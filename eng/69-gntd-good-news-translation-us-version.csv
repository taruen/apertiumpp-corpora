GEN.1.1	In the beginning, when God created the universe,
GEN.1.2	the earth was formless and desolate. The raging ocean that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the Spirit of God
GEN.1.3	 Then God commanded, “Let there be light”—and light appeared. 
GEN.1.4	God was pleased with what he saw. Then he separated the light from the darkness, 
GEN.1.5	and he named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night.” Evening passed and morning came—that was the first day.
GEN.1.8	He named the dome “Sky.” Evening passed and morning came—that was the second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God commanded, “Let the water below the sky come together in one place, so that the land will appear”—and it was done. 
GEN.1.10	He named the land “Earth,” and the water which had come together he named “Sea.” And God was pleased with what he saw. 
GEN.1.11	Then he commanded, “Let the earth produce all kinds of plants, those that bear grain and those that bear fruit”—and it was done. 
GEN.1.12	So the earth produced all kinds of plants, and God was pleased with what he saw. 
GEN.1.13	Evening passed and morning came—that was the third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God commanded, “Let lights appear in the sky to separate day from night and to show the time when days, years, and religious festivals
GEN.1.15	they will shine in the sky to give light to the earth”—and it was done. 
GEN.1.16	So God made the two larger lights, the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule over the night; he also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule over the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God was pleased with what he saw. 
GEN.1.19	Evening passed and morning came—that was the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God commanded, “Let the water be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let the air be filled with birds.” 
GEN.1.21	So God created the great sea monsters, all kinds of creatures that live in the water, and all kinds of birds. And God was pleased with what he saw. 
GEN.1.22	He blessed them all and told the creatures that live in the water to reproduce and to fill the sea, and he told the birds to increase in number. 
GEN.1.23	Evening passed and morning came—that was the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God commanded, “Let the earth produce all kinds of animal life: domestic and wild, large and small”—and it was done. 
GEN.1.25	So God made them all, and he was pleased with what he saw.
GEN.1.28	blessed them, and said, “Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control. I am putting you in charge of the fish, the birds, and all the wild animals. 
GEN.1.29	I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to eat; 
GEN.1.30	but for all the wild animals and for all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food”—and it was done. 
GEN.1.31	God looked at everything he had made, and he was very pleased. Evening passed and morning came—that was the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	And so the whole universe was completed. 
GEN.2.3	He blessed the seventh day and set it apart as a special day, because by that day he had completed his creation
GEN.2.4	And that is how the universe was created.
GEN.2.4	When the 
GEN.2.5	there were no plants on the earth and no seeds had sprouted, because he had not sent any rain, and there was no one to cultivate the land; 
GEN.2.6	but water would come up from beneath the surface and water the ground.
GEN.2.8	Then the 
GEN.2.9	 He made all kinds of beautiful trees grow there and produce good fruit. In the middle of the garden stood the tree that gives life and the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad.
GEN.2.10	A stream flowed in Eden and watered the garden; beyond Eden it divided into four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The first river is the Pishon; it flows around the country of Havilah. ( 
GEN.2.12	Pure gold is found there and also rare perfume and precious stones.) 
GEN.2.13	The second river is the Gihon; it flows around the country of Cush.
GEN.2.14	The third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria, and the fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	Then the 
GEN.2.16	He told him, “You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, 
GEN.2.17	except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad.
GEN.2.18	Then the 
GEN.2.19	So he took some soil from the ground and formed all the animals and all the birds. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and that is how they all got their names. 
GEN.2.20	So the man named all the birds and all the animals; but not one of them was a suitable companion to help him.
GEN.2.21	Then the 
GEN.2.22	He formed a woman out of the rib and brought her to him. 
GEN.2.23	Then the man said,
GEN.2.23	“At last, here is one of my own kind—
GEN.2.23	Bone taken from my bone, and flesh from my flesh.
GEN.2.23	‘Woman’ is her name because she was taken out of man.”
GEN.2.25	The man and the woman were both naked, but they were not embarrassed.
GEN.3.2	“We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,” the woman answered, 
GEN.3.3	“except the tree in the middle of it. God told us not to eat the fruit of that tree or even touch it; if we do, we will die.”
GEN.3.4	The snake replied, “That's not true; you will not die. 
GEN.3.5	God said that because he knows that when you eat it, you will be like God
GEN.3.6	The woman saw how beautiful the tree was and how good its fruit would be to eat, and she thought how wonderful it would be to become wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he also ate it. 
GEN.3.7	As soon as they had eaten it, they were given understanding and realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves.
GEN.3.8	That evening they heard the 
GEN.3.9	But the 
GEN.3.10	He answered, “I heard you in the garden; I was afraid and hid from you, because I was naked.”
GEN.3.11	“Who told you that you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat the fruit that I told you not to eat?”
GEN.3.12	The man answered, “The woman you put here with me gave me the fruit, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	She replied, “The snake tricked me into eating it.”
GEN.3.14	Then the 
GEN.3.15	 I will make you and the woman hate each other; her offspring and yours will always be enemies. Her offspring will crush your head, and you will bite her offspring's
GEN.3.16	And he said to the woman, “I will increase your trouble in pregnancy and your pain in giving birth. In spite of this, you will still have desire for your husband, yet you will be subject to him.”
GEN.3.18	It will produce weeds and thorns, and you will have to eat wild plants. 
GEN.3.19	You will have to work hard and sweat to make the soil produce anything, until you go back to the soil from which you were formed. You were made from soil, and you will become soil again.”
GEN.3.20	Adam
GEN.3.21	And the 
GEN.3.23	So the 
GEN.3.24	Then at the east side of the garden he put living creatures
GEN.4.1	Then Adam had intercourse with his wife, and she became pregnant. She bore a son and said, “By the 
GEN.4.2	Later she gave birth to another son, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, but Cain was a farmer. 
GEN.4.3	After some time Cain brought some of his harvest and gave it as an offering to the 
GEN.4.4	 Then Abel brought the first lamb born to one of his sheep, killed it, and gave the best parts of it as an offering. The 
GEN.4.5	but he rejected Cain and his offering. Cain became furious, and he scowled in anger. 
GEN.4.6	Then the 
GEN.4.7	If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling;
GEN.4.9	The 
GEN.4.9	He answered, “I don't know. Am I supposed to take care of my brother?”
GEN.4.11	You are placed under a curse and can no longer farm the soil. It has soaked up your brother's blood as if it had opened its mouth to receive it when you killed him. 
GEN.4.12	If you try to grow crops, the soil will not produce anything; you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	And Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	You are driving me off the land and away from your presence. I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”
GEN.4.15	But the 
GEN.4.16	And Cain went away from the 
GEN.4.17	Cain and his wife had a son and named him Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son. 
GEN.4.18	Enoch had a son named Irad, who was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael had a son named Methushael, who was the father of Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the ancestor of those who raise livestock and live in tents. 
GEN.4.21	His brother was Jubal, the ancestor of all musicians who play the harp and the flute. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah gave birth to Tubal Cain, who made all kinds of tools
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives,
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, listen to me:
GEN.4.23	I have killed a young man because he struck me.
GEN.4.24	If seven lives are taken to pay for killing Cain,
GEN.4.24	Seventy-seven will be taken if anyone kills me.”
GEN.4.25	Adam and his wife had another son. She said, “God has given me a son to replace Abel, whom Cain killed.” So she named him Seth.
GEN.4.26	Seth had a son whom he named Enosh. It was then that people began using the 
GEN.5.2	 He created them male and female, blessed them, and named them “Human Beings.”) 
GEN.5.3	When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son who was like him, and he named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	After that, Adam lived another 800 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.5	and died at the age of 930.
GEN.5.6	When Seth was 105, he had a son, Enosh, 
GEN.5.7	and then lived another 807 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.8	and died at the age of 912.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh was 90, he had a son, Kenan, 
GEN.5.10	and then lived another 815 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.11	and died at the age of 905.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan was 70, he had a son, Mahalalel, 
GEN.5.13	and then lived another 840 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.14	and died at the age of 910.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel was 65, he had a son, Jared, 
GEN.5.16	and then lived another 830 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.17	and died at the age of 895.
GEN.5.18	When Jared was 162, he had a son, Enoch, 
GEN.5.19	and then lived another 800 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.20	and died at the age of 962.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch was 65, he had a son, Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After that, Enoch lived in fellowship with God for 300 years and had other children. 
GEN.5.23	He lived to be 365 years old. 
GEN.5.24	 He spent his life in fellowship with God, and then he disappeared, because God took him away.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah was 187, he had a son, Lamech, 
GEN.5.26	and then lived another 782 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.27	and died at the age of 969.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech was 182, he had a son 
GEN.5.29	and said, “From the very ground on which the 
GEN.5.30	Lamech lived another 595 years. He had other children 
GEN.5.31	and died at the age of 777.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was 500 years old, he had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.2	some of the heavenly beings
GEN.6.3	Then the 
GEN.6.4	 In those days, and even later, there were giants on the earth who were descendants of human women and the heavenly beings. They were the great heroes and famous men of long ago.
GEN.6.6	he was sorry that he had ever made them and put them on the earth. He was so filled with regret 
GEN.6.7	that he said, “I will wipe out these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry that I made any of them.” 
GEN.6.8	But the 
GEN.6.11	but everyone else was evil in God's sight, and violence had spread everywhere. 
GEN.6.12	God looked at the world and saw that it was evil, for the people were all living evil lives.
GEN.6.13	God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to all people. I will destroy them completely, because the world is full of their violent deeds. 
GEN.6.14	Build a boat for yourself out of good timber; make rooms in it and cover it with tar inside and out. 
GEN.6.15	Make it 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
GEN.6.16	Make a roof
GEN.6.17	I am going to send a flood on the earth to destroy every living being. Everything on the earth will die, 
GEN.6.18	but I will make a covenant with you. Go into the boat with your wife, your sons, and their wives. 
GEN.6.19+GEN.6.20	Take into the boat with you a male and a female of every kind of animal and of every kind of bird, in order to keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	Take along all kinds of food for you and for them.” 
GEN.6.22	 Noah did everything that God commanded.
GEN.7.1	The 
GEN.7.2	Take with you seven pairs of each kind of ritually clean animal, but only one pair of each kind of unclean animal. 
GEN.7.3	Take also seven pairs of each kind of bird. Do this so that every kind of animal and bird will be kept alive to reproduce again on the earth. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I am going to send rain that will fall for forty days and nights, in order to destroy all the living beings that I have made.” 
GEN.7.5	And Noah did everything that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came on the earth. 
GEN.7.7	 He and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went into the boat to escape the flood. 
GEN.7.8	A male and a female of every kind of animal and bird, whether ritually clean or unclean, 
GEN.7.9	went into the boat with Noah, as God had commanded. 
GEN.7.10	Seven days later the flood came.
GEN.7.12	and rain fell on the earth for forty days and nights. 
GEN.7.13	On that same day Noah and his wife went into the boat with their three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives. 
GEN.7.14	With them went every kind of animal, domestic and wild, large and small, and every kind of bird. 
GEN.7.15	A male and a female of each kind of living being went into the boat with Noah, 
GEN.7.16	as God had commanded. Then the 
GEN.7.17	The flood continued for forty days, and the water became deep enough for the boat to float. 
GEN.7.18	The water became deeper, and the boat drifted on the surface. 
GEN.7.19	It became so deep that it covered the highest mountains; 
GEN.7.20	it went on rising until it was about twenty-five feet above the tops of the mountains. 
GEN.7.21	Every living being on the earth died—every bird, every animal, and every person. 
GEN.7.22	Everything on earth that breathed died. 
GEN.7.23	The 
GEN.7.24	The water did not start going down for a hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	God had not forgotten Noah and all the animals with him in the boat; he caused a wind to blow, and the water started going down. 
GEN.8.2	The outlets of the water beneath the earth and the floodgates of the sky were closed. The rain stopped, 
GEN.8.3	and the water gradually went down for 150 days. 
GEN.8.4	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the boat came to rest on a mountain in the Ararat range. 
GEN.8.5	The water kept going down, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains appeared.
GEN.8.6	After forty days Noah opened a window 
GEN.8.7	and sent out a raven. It did not come back, but kept flying around until the water was completely gone. 
GEN.8.8	Meanwhile, Noah sent out a dove to see if the water had gone down, 
GEN.8.9	but since the water still covered all the land, the dove did not find a place to light. It flew back to the boat, and Noah reached out and took it in. 
GEN.8.10	He waited another seven days and sent out the dove again. 
GEN.8.11	It returned to him in the evening with a fresh olive leaf in its beak. So Noah knew that the water had gone down. 
GEN.8.12	Then he waited another seven days and sent out the dove once more; this time it did not come back.
GEN.8.13	When Noah was 601 years old, on the first day of the first month, the water was gone. Noah removed the covering of the boat, looked around, and saw that the ground was getting dry. 
GEN.8.14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
GEN.8.15	God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“Go out of the boat with your wife, your sons, and their wives. 
GEN.8.17	Take all the birds and animals out with you, so that they may reproduce and spread over all the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	So Noah went out of the boat with his wife, his sons, and their wives. 
GEN.8.19	All the animals and birds went out of the boat in groups of their own kind.
GEN.8.20	Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	The odor of the sacrifice pleased the 
GEN.8.22	As long as the world exists, there will be a time for planting and a time for harvest. There will always be cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night.”
GEN.9.2	All the animals, birds, and fish will live in fear of you. They are all placed under your power. 
GEN.9.3	Now you can eat them, as well as green plants; I give them all to you for food. 
GEN.9.4	 The one thing you must not eat is meat with blood still in it; I forbid this because the life is in the blood. 
GEN.9.5	If anyone takes human life, he will be punished. I will punish with death any animal that takes a human life. 
GEN.9.6	 Human beings were made like God, so whoever murders one of them will be killed by someone else.
GEN.9.8	God said to Noah and his sons, 
GEN.9.9	“I am now making my covenant with you and with your descendants, 
GEN.9.10	and with all living beings—all birds and all animals—everything that came out of the boat with you. 
GEN.9.11	With these words I make my covenant with you: I promise that never again will all living beings be destroyed by a flood; never again will a flood destroy the earth. 
GEN.9.12	As a sign of this everlasting covenant which I am making with you and with all living beings, 
GEN.9.13	I am putting my bow in the clouds. It will be the sign of my covenant with the world. 
GEN.9.14	Whenever I cover the sky with clouds and the rainbow appears, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my promise to you and to all the animals that a flood will never again destroy all living beings. 
GEN.9.16	When the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between me and all living beings on earth. 
GEN.9.17	That is the sign of the promise which I am making to all living beings.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who went out of the boat were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 
GEN.9.19	These three sons of Noah were the ancestors of all the people on earth.
GEN.9.20	Noah, who was a farmer, was the first man to plant a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	After he drank some of the wine, he became drunk, took off his clothes, and lay naked in his tent. 
GEN.9.22	When Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked, he went out and told his two brothers. 
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth took a robe and held it behind them on their shoulders. They walked backward into the tent and covered their father, keeping their faces turned away so as not to see him naked. 
GEN.9.24	When Noah sobered up and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
GEN.9.25	he said,
GEN.9.25	“A curse on Canaan!
GEN.9.25	He will be a slave to his brothers.
GEN.9.26	Give praise to the 
GEN.9.26	Canaan will be the slave of Shem.
GEN.9.27	May God cause Japheth
GEN.9.27	May his descendants live with the people of Shem!
GEN.9.27	Canaan will be the slave of Japheth.”
GEN.9.28	After the flood Noah lived 350 years 
GEN.9.29	and died at the age of 950.
GEN.10.1	These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These three had sons after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth—Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras—were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
GEN.10.3	The descendants of Gomer were the people of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	The descendants of Javan were the people of Elishah, Spain, Cyprus, and Rhodes; 
GEN.10.5	they were the ancestors of the people who live along the coast and on the islands. These are the descendants of Japheth, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language.
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham—Cush, Egypt, Libya, and Canaan—were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
GEN.10.7	The descendants of Cush were the people of Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were the people of Sheba and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the world's first great conqueror. 
GEN.10.9	By the 
GEN.10.10	At first his kingdom included Babylon, Erech, and Accad, all three of them in Babylonia. 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went to Assyria and built the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
GEN.10.12	and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.
GEN.10.13	The descendants of Egypt were the people of Lydia, Anam, Lehab, Naphtuh, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrus, Casluh, and of Crete, from whom the Philistines are descended.
GEN.10.15	Canaan's sons—Sidon, the oldest, and Heth—were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
GEN.10.16	Canaan was also the ancestor of the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. The different tribes of the Canaanites spread out, 
GEN.10.19	until the Canaanite borders reached from Sidon southward to Gerar near Gaza, and eastward to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim near Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are the descendants of Ham, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language.
GEN.10.21	Shem, the older brother of Japheth, was the ancestor of all the Hebrews. 
GEN.10.22	Shem's sons—Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram—were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
GEN.10.23	The descendants of Aram were the people of Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshek. 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad was the father of Shelah, who was the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Eber had two sons: one was named Peleg,
GEN.10.26	The descendants of Joktan were the people of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All of them were descended from Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	The land in which they lived extended from Mesha to Sephar in the eastern hill country. 
GEN.10.31	These are the descendants of Shem, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language.
GEN.10.32	All these peoples are the descendants of Noah, nation by nation, according to their different lines of descent. After the flood all the nations of the earth were descended from the sons of Noah.
GEN.11.1	At first, the people of the whole world had only one language and used the same words. 
GEN.11.2	As they wandered about in the East, they came to a plain in Babylonia and settled there. 
GEN.11.3	They said to one another, “Come on! Let's make bricks and bake them hard.” So they had bricks to build with and tar to hold them together. 
GEN.11.4	They said, “Now let's build a city with a tower that reaches the sky, so that we can make a name for ourselves and not be scattered all over the earth.”
GEN.11.5	Then the 
GEN.11.6	and he said, “Now then, these are all one people and they speak one language; this is just the beginning of what they are going to do. Soon they will be able to do anything they want! 
GEN.11.7	Let us go down and mix up their language so that they will not understand each other.” 
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	The city was called Babylon,
GEN.11.10	These are the descendants of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he had a son, Arpachshad. 
GEN.11.11	After that, he lived another 500 years and had other children.
GEN.11.12	When Arpachshad was 35 years old, he had a son, Shelah; 
GEN.11.13	after that, he lived another 403 years and had other children.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah was 30 years old, he had a son, Eber; 
GEN.11.15	after that, he lived another 403 years and had other children.
GEN.11.16	When Eber was 34 years old, he had a son, Peleg; 
GEN.11.17	after that, he lived another 430 years and had other children.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg was 30 years old, he had a son, Reu; 
GEN.11.19	after that, he lived another 209 years and had other children.
GEN.11.20	When Reu was 32 years old, he had a son, Serug; 
GEN.11.21	after that, he lived another 207 years and had other children.
GEN.11.22	When Serug was 30 years old, he had a son, Nahor; 
GEN.11.23	after that, he lived another 200 years and had other children.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor was 29 years old, he had a son, Terah; 
GEN.11.25	after that, he lived another 119 years and had other children.
GEN.11.26	After Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	These are the descendants of Terah, who was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran was the father of Lot, 
GEN.11.28	and Haran died in his hometown of Ur in Babylonia, while his father was still living. 
GEN.11.29	Abram married Sarai, and Nahor married Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai was not able to have children.
GEN.11.31	Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, who was the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, Abram's wife, and with them he left the city of Ur in Babylonia to go to the land of Canaan. They went as far as Haran and settled there. 
GEN.11.32	Terah died there at the age of 205.
GEN.12.2	I will give you many descendants, and they will become a great nation. I will bless you and make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing.
GEN.12.3	But I will curse those who curse you.
GEN.12.3	And through you I will bless all the nations.”
GEN.12.4	When Abram was seventy-five years old, he started out from Haran, as the 
GEN.12.5	Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the wealth and all the slaves they had acquired in Haran, and they started out for the land of Canaan.
GEN.12.5	When they arrived in Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram traveled through the land until he came to the sacred tree of Moreh, the holy place at Shechem. (At that time the Canaanites were still living in the land.) 
GEN.12.7	 The 
GEN.12.8	After that, he moved on south to the hill country east of the city of Bethel and set up his camp between Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There also he built an altar and worshiped the 
GEN.12.9	Then he moved on from place to place, going toward the southern part of Canaan.
GEN.12.10	But there was a famine in Canaan, and it was so bad that Abram went farther south to Egypt, to live there for a while. 
GEN.12.11	When he was about to cross the border into Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “You are a beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will assume that you are my wife, and so they will kill me and let you live. 
GEN.12.13	 Tell them that you are my sister; then because of you they will let me live and treat me well.” 
GEN.12.14	When he crossed the border into Egypt, the Egyptians did see that his wife was beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	Some of the court officials saw her and told the king how beautiful she was; so she was taken to his palace. 
GEN.12.16	Because of her the king treated Abram well and gave him flocks of sheep and goats, cattle, donkeys, slaves, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But because the king had taken Sarai, the 
GEN.12.18	Then the king sent for Abram and asked him, “What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say that she was your sister, and let me take her as my wife? Here is your wife; take her and get out!” 
GEN.12.20	The king gave orders to his men, so they took Abram and put him out of the country, together with his wife and everything he owned.
GEN.13.1	Abram went north out of Egypt to the southern part of Canaan with his wife and everything he owned, and Lot went with him. 
GEN.13.2	Abram was a very rich man, with sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as silver and gold. 
GEN.13.3	Then he left there and moved from place to place, going toward Bethel. He reached the place between Bethel and Ai where he had camped before 
GEN.13.4	and had built an altar. There he worshiped the 
GEN.13.5	Lot also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and servants. 
GEN.13.6	And so there was not enough pasture land for the two of them to stay together, because they had too many animals. 
GEN.13.7	So quarrels broke out between the men who took care of Abram's animals and those who took care of Lot's animals. (At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were still living in the land.)
GEN.13.8	Then Abram said to Lot, “We are relatives, and your men and my men shouldn't be quarreling. 
GEN.13.9	So let's separate. Choose any part of the land you want. You go one way, and I'll go the other.”
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself and moved away toward the east. That is how the two men parted. 
GEN.13.12	Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled among the cities in the valley and camped near Sodom, 
GEN.13.13	whose people were wicked and sinned against the 
GEN.13.14	After Lot had left, the 
GEN.13.15	 I am going to give you and your descendants all the land that you see, and it will be yours forever. 
GEN.13.16	I am going to give you so many descendants that no one will be able to count them all; it would be as easy to count all the specks of dust on earth! 
GEN.13.17	Now, go and look over the whole land, because I am going to give it all to you.” 
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his camp and settled near the sacred trees of Mamre at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the 
GEN.14.1	Four kings, Amraphel of Babylonia, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	went to war against five other kings: Bera of Sodom, Birsha of Gomorrah, Shinab of Admah, Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (or Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	These five kings had formed an alliance and joined forces in Siddim Valley, which is now the Dead Sea. 
GEN.14.4	They had been under the control of Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and his allies came with their armies and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in the mountains of Edom, pursuing them as far as Elparan on the edge of the desert. 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned around and came back to Kadesh (then known as Enmishpat). They conquered all the land of the Amalekites and defeated the Amorites who lived in Hazazon Tamar.
GEN.14.8	Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela drew up their armies for battle in Siddim Valley and fought 
GEN.14.9	against the kings of Elam, Goiim, Babylonia, and Ellasar, five kings against four. 
GEN.14.10	The valley was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah tried to run away from the battle, they fell into the pits; but the other three kings escaped to the mountains. 
GEN.14.11	The four kings took everything in Sodom and Gomorrah, including the food, and went away. 
GEN.14.12	Lot, Abram's nephew, was living in Sodom, so they took him and all his possessions.
GEN.14.13	But a man escaped and reported all this to Abram, the Hebrew, who was living near the sacred trees belonging to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his brothers Eshcol and Aner were Abram's allies. 
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his nephew had been captured, he called together all the fighting men in his camp, 318 in all, and pursued the four kings all the way to Dan. 
GEN.14.15	There he divided his men into groups, attacked the enemy by night, and defeated them. He chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus, 
GEN.14.16	and got back all the loot that had been taken. He also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other prisoners.
GEN.14.17	When Abram came back from his victory over Chedorlaomer and the other kings, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in Shaveh Valley (also called King's Valley). 
GEN.14.18	 And Melchizedek, who was king of Salem and also a priest of the Most High God, brought bread and wine to Abram, 
GEN.14.19	blessed him, and said, “May the Most High God, who made heaven and earth, bless Abram! 
GEN.14.20	May the Most High God, who gave you victory over your enemies, be praised!” And Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the loot he had recovered.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Keep the loot, but give me back all my people.”
GEN.14.22	Abram answered, “I solemnly swear before the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not keep anything of yours, not even a thread or a sandal strap. Then you can never say, ‘I am the one who made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will take nothing for myself. I will accept only what my men have used. But let my allies, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, take their share.”
GEN.15.1	After this, Abram had a vision and heard the 
GEN.15.2	But Abram answered, “Sovereign 
GEN.15.3	You have given me no children, and one of my slaves will inherit my property.”
GEN.15.4	Then he heard the 
GEN.15.5	 The 
GEN.15.7	Then the 
GEN.15.8	But Abram asked, “Sovereign 
GEN.15.9	He answered, “Bring me a cow, a goat, and a ram, each of them three years old, and a dove and a pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	Abram brought the animals to God, cut them in half, and placed the halves opposite each other in two rows; but he did not cut up the birds. 
GEN.15.11	Vultures came down on the bodies, but Abram drove them off.
GEN.15.13	 The 
GEN.15.14	 But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and when they leave that foreign land, they will take great wealth with them. 
GEN.15.15	You yourself will live to a ripe old age, die in peace, and be buried. 
GEN.15.16	It will be four generations before your descendants come back here, because I will not drive out the Amorites until they become so wicked that they must be punished.”
GEN.15.17	When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch suddenly appeared and passed between the pieces of the animals. 
GEN.15.18	 Then and there the 
GEN.15.19	including the lands of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Abram's wife Sarai had not borne him any children. But she had an Egyptian slave woman named Hagar, 
GEN.16.2	and so she said to Abram, “The 
GEN.16.3	So she gave Hagar to him to be his concubine. (This happened after Abram had lived in Canaan for ten years.) 
GEN.16.4	Abram had intercourse with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she found out that she was pregnant, she became proud and despised Sarai.
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “It's your fault that Hagar despises me.
GEN.16.6	Abram answered, “Very well, she is your slave and under your control; do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so cruelly that she ran away.
GEN.16.7	The angel of the 
GEN.16.8	and said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	She answered, “I am running away from my mistress.”
GEN.16.9	He said, “Go back to her and be her slave.” 
GEN.16.10	Then he said, “I will give you so many descendants that no one will be able to count them. 
GEN.16.11	You are going to have a son, and you will name him Ishmael,
GEN.16.12	But your son will live like a wild donkey; he will be against everyone, and everyone will be against him. He will live apart from all his relatives.”
GEN.16.13	Hagar asked herself, “Have I really seen God and lived to tell about it?”
GEN.16.14	That is why people call the well between Kadesh and Bered “The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.”
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old at the time.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	I will make my covenant with you and give you many descendants.” 
GEN.17.3	Abram bowed down with his face touching the ground, and God said, 
GEN.17.4	“I make this covenant with you: I promise that you will be the ancestor of many nations. 
GEN.17.5	 Your name will no longer be Abram, but Abraham,
GEN.17.6	I will give you many descendants, and some of them will be kings. You will have so many descendants that they will become nations.
GEN.17.8	 I will give to you and to your descendants this land in which you are now a foreigner. The whole land of Canaan will belong to your descendants forever, and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	God said to Abraham, “You also must agree to keep the covenant with me, both you and your descendants in future generations. 
GEN.17.10	 You and your descendants must all agree to circumcise every male among you. 
GEN.17.11+GEN.17.12	From now on you must circumcise every baby boy when he is eight days old, including slaves born in your homes and slaves bought from foreigners. This will show that there is a covenant between you and me. 
GEN.17.13	Each one must be circumcised, and this will be a physical sign to show that my covenant with you is everlasting. 
GEN.17.14	Any male who has not been circumcised will no longer be considered one of my people, because he has not kept the covenant with me.”
GEN.17.15	God said to Abraham, “You must no longer call your wife Sarai; from now on her name is Sarah.
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will become the mother of nations, and there will be kings among her descendants.”
GEN.17.17	Abraham bowed down with his face touching the ground, but he began to laugh when he thought, “Can a man have a child when he is a hundred years old? Can Sarah have a child at ninety?” 
GEN.17.18	He asked God, “Why not let Ishmael be my heir?”
GEN.17.19	But God said, “No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son and you will name him Isaac.
GEN.17.20	I have heard your request about Ishmael, so I will bless him and give him many children and many descendants. He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make a great nation of his descendants. 
GEN.17.21	But I will keep my covenant with your son Isaac, who will be born to Sarah about this time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When God finished speaking to Abraham, he left him.
GEN.17.23	On that same day Abraham obeyed God and circumcised his son Ishmael and all the other males in his household, including the slaves born in his home and those he had bought. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
GEN.17.25	and his son Ishmael was thirteen. 
GEN.17.26	They were both circumcised on the same day, 
GEN.17.27	together with all of Abraham's slaves.
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	 he looked up and saw three men standing there. As soon as he saw them, he ran out to meet them. Bowing down with his face touching the ground, 
GEN.18.3	he said, “Sirs, please do not pass by my home without stopping; I am here to serve you. 
GEN.18.4	Let me bring some water for you to wash your feet; you can rest here beneath this tree. 
GEN.18.5	I will also bring a bit of food; it will give you strength to continue your journey. You have honored me by coming to my home, so let me serve you.”
GEN.18.5	They replied, “Thank you; we accept.”
GEN.18.6	Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, take a sack of your best flour, and bake some bread.” 
GEN.18.7	Then he ran to the herd and picked out a calf that was tender and fat, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to get it ready. 
GEN.18.8	He took some cream, some milk, and the meat, and set the food before the men. There under the tree he served them himself, and they ate.
GEN.18.9	Then they asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?”
GEN.18.9	“She is there in the tent,” he answered.
GEN.18.10	Sarah was behind him, at the door of the tent, listening. 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah had stopped having her monthly periods. 
GEN.18.12	 So Sarah laughed to herself and said, “Now that I am old and worn out, can I still enjoy sex? And besides, my husband is old too.”
GEN.18.13	Then the 
GEN.18.14	 Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Because Sarah was afraid, she denied it. “I didn't laugh,” she said.
GEN.18.15	“Yes, you did,” he replied. “You laughed.”
GEN.18.16	Then the men left and went to a place where they could look down at Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on their way. 
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	His descendants will become a great and mighty nation, and through him I will bless all the nations.
GEN.18.19	I have chosen him in order that he may command his sons and his descendants to obey me and to do what is right and just. If they do, I will do everything for him that I have promised.”
GEN.18.20	Then the 
GEN.18.21	I must go down to find out whether or not the accusations which I have heard are true.”
GEN.18.22	Then the two men left and went on toward Sodom, but the 
GEN.18.23	Abraham approached the 
GEN.18.24	If there are fifty innocent people in the city, will you destroy the whole city? Won't you spare it in order to save the fifty? 
GEN.18.25	Surely you won't kill the innocent with the guilty. That's impossible! You can't do that. If you did, the innocent would be punished along with the guilty. That is impossible. The judge of all the earth has to act justly.”
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Abraham spoke again: “Please forgive my boldness in continuing to speak to you, Lord. I am only a man and have no right to say anything. 
GEN.18.28	But perhaps there will be only forty-five innocent people instead of fifty. Will you destroy the whole city because there are five too few?”
GEN.18.28	The 
GEN.18.29	Abraham spoke again: “Perhaps there will be only forty.”
GEN.18.29	He replied, “I will not destroy it if there are forty.”
GEN.18.30	Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, Lord, but I must speak again. What if there are only thirty?”
GEN.18.30	He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty.”
GEN.18.31	Abraham said, “Please forgive my boldness in continuing to speak to you, Lord. Suppose that only twenty are found?”
GEN.18.31	He said, “I will not destroy the city if I find twenty.”
GEN.18.32	Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, Lord, and I will speak only once more. What if only ten are found?”
GEN.18.32	He said, “I will not destroy it if there are ten.” 
GEN.18.33	After he had finished speaking with Abraham, the 
GEN.19.1	When the two angels came to Sodom that evening, Lot was sitting at the city gate. As soon as he saw them, he got up and went to meet them. He bowed down before them 
GEN.19.2	and said, “Sirs, I am here to serve you. Please come to my house. You can wash your feet and spend the night. In the morning you can get up early and go on your way.”
GEN.19.2	But they answered, “No, we will spend the night here in the city square.”
GEN.19.3	He kept on urging them, and finally they went with him to his house. Lot ordered his servants to bake some bread and prepare a fine meal for the guests. When it was ready, they ate it.
GEN.19.4	Before the guests went to bed, the men of Sodom surrounded the house. All the men of the city, both young and old, were there. 
GEN.19.5	 They called out to Lot and asked, “Where are the men who came to stay with you tonight? Bring them out to us!” The men of Sodom wanted to have sex with them.
GEN.19.6	Lot went outside and closed the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	He said to them, “Friends, I beg you, don't do such a wicked thing! 
GEN.19.8	Look, I have two daughters who are still virgins. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do whatever you want with them. But don't do anything to these men; they are guests in my house, and I must protect them.”
GEN.19.9	But they said, “Get out of our way, you foreigner! Who are you to tell us what to do? Out of our way, or we will treat you worse than them.” They pushed Lot back and moved up to break down the door. 
GEN.19.10	But the two men inside reached out, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	 Then they struck all the men outside with blindness, so that they couldn't find the door.
GEN.19.12	The two men said to Lot, “If you have anyone else here—sons, daughters, sons-in-law, or any other relatives living in the city—get them out of here, 
GEN.19.13	because we are going to destroy this place. The 
GEN.19.14	Then Lot went to the men that his daughters were going to marry, and said, “Hurry up and get out of here; the 
GEN.19.15	At dawn the angels tried to make Lot hurry. “Quick!” they said. “Take your wife and your two daughters and get out, so that you will not lose your lives when the city is destroyed.” 
GEN.19.16	 Lot hesitated. The 
GEN.19.17	Then one of the angels said, “Run for your lives! Don't look back and don't stop in the valley. Run to the hills, so that you won't be killed.”
GEN.19.18	But Lot answered, “No, please don't make us do that, sir. 
GEN.19.19	You have done me a great favor and saved my life. But the hills are too far away; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die before I get there. 
GEN.19.20	Do you see that little town? It is near enough. Let me go over there—you can see it is just a small place—and I will be safe.”
GEN.19.21	He answered, “All right, I agree. I won't destroy that town. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry! Run! I can't do anything until you get there.”
GEN.19.22	Because Lot called it small, the town was named Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun was rising when Lot reached Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	 Suddenly the 
GEN.19.25	and destroyed them and the whole valley, along with all the people there and everything that grew on the land. 
GEN.19.26	 But Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Early the next morning Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood in the presence of the 
GEN.19.28	He looked down at Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole valley and saw smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a huge furnace. 
GEN.19.29	But when God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living, he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety.
GEN.19.30	Because Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave. 
GEN.19.31	The older daughter said to her sister, “Our father is getting old, and there are no men in the whole world
GEN.19.32	Come on, let's get our father drunk, so that we can sleep with him and have children by him.” 
GEN.19.33	That night they gave him wine to drink, and the older daughter had intercourse with him. But he was so drunk that he didn't know it.
GEN.19.34	The next day the older daughter said to her sister, “I slept with him last night; now let's get him drunk again tonight, and you sleep with him. Then each of us will have a child by our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So that night they got him drunk, and the younger daughter had intercourse with him. Again he was so drunk that he didn't know it. 
GEN.19.36	In this way both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their own father. 
GEN.19.37	The older daughter had a son, whom she named Moab.
GEN.19.38	The younger daughter also had a son, whom she named Benammi.
GEN.20.1	Abraham moved from Mamre to the southern part of Canaan and lived between Kadesh and Shur. Later, while he was living in Gerar, 
GEN.20.2	 he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
GEN.20.3	One night God appeared to him in a dream and said, “You are going to die, because you have taken this woman; she is already married.”
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not come near her, and he said, “Lord, I am innocent! Would you destroy me and my people? 
GEN.20.5	Abraham himself said that she was his sister, and she said the same thing. I did this with a clear conscience, and I have done no wrong.”
GEN.20.6	God replied in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did it with a clear conscience; so I kept you from sinning against me and did not let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	But now, give the woman back to her husband. He is a prophet, and he will pray for you, so that you will not die. But if you do not give her back, I warn you that you are going to die, you and all your people.”
GEN.20.8	Early the next morning Abimelech called all his officials and told them what had happened, and they were terrified. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? What wrong have I done to you to make you bring this disaster on me and my kingdom? No one should ever do what you have done to me. 
GEN.20.10	Why did you do it?”
GEN.20.11	Abraham answered, “I thought that there would be no one here who has reverence for God and that they would kill me to get my wife. 
GEN.20.12	She really is my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not of my mother, and I married her. 
GEN.20.13	So when God sent me from my father's house into foreign lands, I said to her, ‘You can show how loyal you are to me by telling everyone that I am your brother.’”
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech gave Sarah back to Abraham, and at the same time he gave him sheep, cattle, and slaves. 
GEN.20.15	He said to Abraham, “Here is my whole land; live anywhere you like.” 
GEN.20.16	He said to Sarah, “I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver as proof to all who are with you that you are innocent; everyone will know that you have done no wrong.”
GEN.20.17+GEN.20.18	Because of what had happened to Sarah, Abraham's wife, the 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	 and she became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham when he was old. The boy was born at the time God had said he would be born. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham named him Isaac, 
GEN.21.4	 and when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born. 
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has brought me joy and laughter.
GEN.21.7	Then she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	The child grew, and on the day that he was weaned, Abraham gave a great feast.
GEN.21.9	One day Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, was playing with
GEN.21.10	 Sarah saw them and said to Abraham, “Send this slave and her son away. The son of this woman must not get any part of your wealth, which my son Isaac should inherit.” 
GEN.21.11	This troubled Abraham very much, because Ishmael also was his son. 
GEN.21.12	 But God said to Abraham, “Don't be worried about the boy and your slave Hagar. Do whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I have promised. 
GEN.21.13	I will also give many children to the son of the slave woman, so that they will become a nation. He too is your son.”
GEN.21.14	Early the next morning Abraham gave Hagar some food and a leather bag full of water. He put the child on her back and sent her away. She left and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
GEN.21.15	When the water was all gone, she left the child under a bush 
GEN.21.16	and sat down about a hundred yards away. She said to herself, “I can't bear to see my child die.” While she was sitting there, she
GEN.21.17	God heard the boy crying, and from heaven the angel of God spoke to Hagar, “What are you troubled about, Hagar? Don't be afraid. God has heard the boy crying. 
GEN.21.18	Get up, go and pick him up, and comfort him. I will make a great nation out of his descendants.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the leather bag with water and gave some to the boy. 
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy as he grew up; he lived in the wilderness of Paran and became a skillful hunter. 
GEN.21.21	His mother got an Egyptian wife for him.
GEN.21.23	So make a vow here in the presence of God that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants. I have been loyal to you, so promise that you will also be loyal to me and to this country in which you are living.”
GEN.21.24	Abraham said, “I promise.”
GEN.21.25	Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well which the servants of Abimelech had seized. 
GEN.21.26	Abimelech said, “I don't know who did this. You didn't tell me about it, and this is the first I have heard of it.” 
GEN.21.27	Then Abraham gave some sheep and cattle to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham separated seven lambs from his flock, 
GEN.21.29	and Abimelech asked him, “Why did you do that?”
GEN.21.30	Abraham answered, “Accept these seven lambs. By doing this, you admit that I am the one who dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	And so the place was called Beersheba,
GEN.21.32	After they had made this agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistia. 
GEN.21.33	Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and worshiped the 
GEN.21.34	Abraham lived in Philistia for a long time.
GEN.22.3	Early the next morning Abraham cut some wood for the sacrifice, loaded his donkey, and took Isaac and two servants with him. They started out for the place that God had told him about. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	Then he said to the servants, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you.”
GEN.22.6	Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice, and he himself carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire. As they walked along together, 
GEN.22.7	Isaac spoke up, “Father!”
GEN.22.7	He answered, “Yes, my son?”
GEN.22.7	Isaac asked, “I see that you have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?”
GEN.22.8	Abraham answered, “God himself will provide one.” And the two of them walked on together.
GEN.22.10	Then he picked up the knife to kill him. 
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the 
GEN.22.11	He answered, “Yes, here I am.”
GEN.22.12	“Don't hurt the boy or do anything to him,” he said. “Now I know that you honor and obey God, because you have not kept back your only son from him.”
GEN.22.13	Abraham looked around and saw a ram caught in a bush by its horns. He went and got it and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
GEN.22.14	Abraham named that place “The 
GEN.22.15	The angel of the 
GEN.22.16	 “I make a vow by my own name—the 
GEN.22.17	 I promise that I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore. Your descendants will conquer their enemies. 
GEN.22.18	 All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants—all because you obeyed my command.” 
GEN.22.19	Abraham went back to his servants, and they went together to Beersheba, where Abraham settled.
GEN.22.20	Some time later Abraham learned that Milcah had borne eight children to his brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz the first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel, 
GEN.22.23	Rebecca's father. Milcah bore these eight sons to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
GEN.22.24	Reumah, Nahor's concubine, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived to be 127 years old. 
GEN.23.2	She died in Hebron in the land of Canaan, and Abraham mourned her death.
GEN.23.3	He left the place where his wife's body was lying, went to the Hittites, and said, 
GEN.23.4	 “I am a foreigner living here among you; sell me some land, so that I can bury my wife.”
GEN.23.5	They answered, 
GEN.23.6	“Listen to us, sir. We look upon you as a mighty leader; bury your wife in the best grave that we have. Any of us would be glad to give you a grave, so that you can bury her.”
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham bowed before them 
GEN.23.8	and said, “If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Ephron son of Zohar 
GEN.23.9	to sell me Machpelah Cave, which is near the edge of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for its full price, here in your presence, so that I can own it as a burial ground.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron himself was sitting with the other Hittites at the meeting place at the city gate; he answered in the hearing of everyone there, 
GEN.23.11	“Listen, sir; I will give you the whole field and the cave that is in it. Here in the presence of my own people, I will give it to you, so that you can bury your wife.”
GEN.23.12	But Abraham bowed before the Hittites 
GEN.23.13	and said to Ephron, so that everyone could hear, “May I ask you, please, to listen. I will buy the whole field. Accept my payment, and I will bury my wife there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered, 
GEN.23.15	“Sir, land worth only four hundred pieces of silver—what is that between us? Bury your wife in it.” 
GEN.23.16	Abraham agreed and weighed out the amount that Ephron had mentioned in the hearing of the people—four hundred pieces of silver, according to the standard weights used by the merchants.
GEN.23.17	That is how the property which had belonged to Ephron at Machpelah east of Mamre, became Abraham's. It included the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees in the field up to the edge of the property. 
GEN.23.18	It was recognized as Abraham's property by all the Hittites who were there at the meeting.
GEN.23.19	Then Abraham buried his wife Sarah in that cave in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	So the field which had belonged to the Hittites, and the cave in it, became the property of Abraham for a burial ground.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now very old, and the 
GEN.24.2	He said to his oldest servant, who was in charge of all that he had, “Place your hand between my thighs
GEN.24.3	I want you to make a vow in the name of the 
GEN.24.4	You must go back to the country where I was born and get a wife for my son Isaac from among my relatives.”
GEN.24.5	But the servant asked, “What if the young woman will not leave home to come with me to this land? Shall I send your son back to the land you came from?”
GEN.24.6	Abraham answered, “Make sure that you don't send my son back there! 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	If the young woman is not willing to come with you, you will be free from this promise. But you must not under any circumstances take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand between the thighs of Abraham, his master, and made a vow to do what Abraham had asked.
GEN.24.10	The servant, who was in charge of Abraham's property, took ten of his master's camels and went to the city where Nahor had lived in northern Mesopotamia. 
GEN.24.11	When he arrived, he made the camels kneel down at the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when women came out to get water. 
GEN.24.12	He prayed, “
GEN.24.13	Here I am at the well where the young women of the city will be coming to get water. 
GEN.24.14	I will say to one of them, ‘Please, lower your jar and let me have a drink.’ If she says, ‘Drink, and I will also bring water for your camels,’ may she be the one that you have chosen for your servant Isaac. If this happens, I will know that you have kept your promise to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished praying, Rebecca arrived with a water jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. 
GEN.24.16	She was a very beautiful young woman and still a virgin. She went down to the well, filled her jar, and came back. 
GEN.24.17	The servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a drink of water from your jar.”
GEN.24.18	She said, “Drink, sir,” and quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank. 
GEN.24.19	When he had finished, she said, “I will also bring water for your camels and let them have all they want.” 
GEN.24.20	She quickly emptied her jar into the animals' drinking trough and ran to the well to get more water, until she had watered all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	The man kept watching her in silence, to see if the 
GEN.24.22	When she had finished, the man took an expensive gold ring and put it in her nose and put two large gold bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.23	He said, “Please tell me who your father is. Is there room in his house for my men and me to spend the night?”
GEN.24.24	“My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah,” she answered. 
GEN.24.25	“There is plenty of straw and fodder at our house, and there is a place for you to stay.”
GEN.24.26	Then the man knelt down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	He said, “Praise the 
GEN.24.28	The young woman ran to her mother's house and told the whole story. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebecca had a brother named Laban, and he ran outside to go to the well where Abraham's servant was. 
GEN.24.30	Laban had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and had heard her say what the man had told her. He went to Abraham's servant, who was standing by his camels at the well, 
GEN.24.31	and said, “Come home with me. You are a man whom the 
GEN.24.32	So the man went into the house, and Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder. Then he brought water for Abraham's servant and his men to wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	When food was brought, the man said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.”
GEN.24.33	Laban said, “Go on and speak.”
GEN.24.34	“I am the servant of Abraham,” he began. 
GEN.24.35	“The 
GEN.24.36	Sarah, my master's wife, bore him a son when she was old, and my master has given everything he owns to him. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me promise with a vow to obey his command. He said, ‘Do not choose a wife for my son from the young women in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.24.38	Instead, go to my father's people, to my relatives, and choose a wife for him.’ 
GEN.24.39	And I asked my master, ‘What if she will not come with me?’ 
GEN.24.40	He answered, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	There is only one way for you to be free from your vow: if you go to my relatives and they refuse you, then you will be free.’
GEN.24.42	“When I came to the well today, I prayed, ‘
GEN.24.43	Here I am at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I will ask her to give me a drink of water from her jar. 
GEN.24.44	If she agrees and also offers to bring water for my camels, may she be the one that you have chosen as the wife for my master's son.’ 
GEN.24.45	Before I had finished my silent prayer, Rebecca came with a water jar on her shoulder and went down to the well to get water. I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels. 
GEN.24.47	I asked her, ‘Who is your father?’ And she answered, ‘My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.’ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.48	I knelt down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	Now, if you intend to fulfill your responsibility toward my master and treat him fairly, please tell me; if not, say so, and I will decide what to do.”
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “Since this matter comes from the 
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebecca; take her and go. Let her become the wife of your master's son, as the 
GEN.24.52	When the servant of Abraham heard this, he bowed down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.53	Then he brought out clothing and silver and gold jewelry, and gave them to Rebecca. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and to her mother.
GEN.24.54	Then Abraham's servant and the men with him ate and drank, and spent the night there. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Let me go back to my master.”
GEN.24.55	But Rebecca's brother and her mother said, “Let her stay with us a week or ten days, and then she may go.”
GEN.24.56	But he said, “Don't make us stay. The 
GEN.24.57	They answered, “Let's call her and find out what she has to say.” 
GEN.24.58	So they called Rebecca and asked, “Do you want to go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	“Yes,” she answered.
GEN.24.59	So they let Rebecca and her old family servant go with Abraham's servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they gave Rebecca their blessing in these words:
GEN.24.60	“May you, sister, become the mother of millions!
GEN.24.60	May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies!”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebecca and her young women got ready and mounted the camels to go with Abraham's servant, and they all started out.
GEN.24.62	Isaac had come into the wilderness of
GEN.24.63	He went out in the early evening to take a walk in the fields and saw camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	When Rebecca saw Isaac, she got down from her camel 
GEN.24.65	and asked Abraham's servant, “Who is that man walking toward us in the field?”
GEN.24.65	“He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her scarf and covered her face.
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac everything he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent that his mother Sarah had lived in, and she became his wife. Isaac loved Rebecca, and so he was comforted for the loss of his mother.
GEN.25.1	Abraham married another woman, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan, and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah's descendants.
GEN.25.5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac; 
GEN.25.6	but while he was still alive, he gave presents to the sons his other wives had borne him. Then he sent these sons to the land of the East, away from his son Isaac.
GEN.25.7+GEN.25.8	Abraham died at the ripe old age of 175. 
GEN.25.9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in Machpelah Cave, in the field east of Mamre that had belonged to Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite. 
GEN.25.10	 It was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites; both Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there. 
GEN.25.11	After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near “The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.”
GEN.25.12	Ishmael, whom Hagar, the Egyptian slave of Sarah, bore to Abraham, 
GEN.25.13	had the following sons, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	They were the ancestors of twelve tribes, and their names were given to their villages and camping places. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael was 137 years old when he died. 
GEN.25.18	The descendants of Ishmael lived in the territory between Havilah and Shur, to the east of Egypt on the way to Assyria. They lived apart from the other descendants of Abraham.
GEN.25.19	This is the story of Abraham's son Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel (an Aramean from Mesopotamia) and sister of Laban. 
GEN.25.21	Because Rebecca had no children, Isaac prayed to the 
GEN.25.22	She was going to have twins, and before they were born, they struggled against each other in her womb. She said, “Why should something like this happen to me?” So she went to ask the 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are within you;
GEN.25.23	You will give birth to two rival peoples.
GEN.25.23	One will be stronger than the other;
GEN.25.23	The older will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	The time came for her to give birth, and she had twin sons. 
GEN.25.25	The first one was reddish, and his skin was like a hairy robe, so he was named Esau.
GEN.25.26	The second one was born holding on tightly to the heel of Esau, so he was named Jacob.
GEN.25.27	The boys grew up, and Esau became a skilled hunter, a man who loved the outdoors, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home. 
GEN.25.28	Isaac preferred Esau, because he enjoyed eating the animals Esau killed, but Rebecca preferred Jacob.
GEN.25.29	One day while Jacob was cooking some bean soup, Esau came in from hunting. He was hungry 
GEN.25.30	and said to Jacob, “I'm starving; give me some of that red stuff.” (That is why he was named Edom.
GEN.25.31	Jacob answered, “I will give it to you if you give me your rights as the first-born son.”
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “All right! I am about to die; what good will my rights do me?”
GEN.25.33	Esau made the vow and gave his rights to Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave him some bread and some of the soup. He ate and drank and then got up and left. That was all Esau cared about his rights as the first-born son.
GEN.26.1	There was another famine in the land besides the earlier one during the time of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	 Live here, and I will be with you and bless you. I am going to give all this territory to you and to your descendants. I will keep the promise I made to your father Abraham. 
GEN.26.4	I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give them all this territory. All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants. 
GEN.26.5	I will bless you, because Abraham obeyed me and kept all my laws and commands.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac lived at Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	 When the men there asked about his wife, he said that she was his sister. He would not admit that she was his wife, because he was afraid that the men there would kill him to get Rebecca, who was very beautiful. 
GEN.26.8	When Isaac had been there for some time, King Abimelech looked down from his window and saw Isaac and Rebecca making love. 
GEN.26.9	Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is your wife! Why did you say she was your sister?”
GEN.26.9	He answered, “I thought I would be killed if I said she was my wife.”
GEN.26.10	“What have you done to us?” Abimelech said. “One of my men might easily have slept with your wife, and you would have been responsible for our guilt.” 
GEN.26.11	Abimelech warned all the people: “Anyone who mistreats this man or his wife will be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Isaac sowed crops in that land, and that year he harvested a hundred times as much as he had sown, because the 
GEN.26.13	He continued to prosper and became a very rich man. 
GEN.26.14	Because he had many herds of sheep and cattle and many servants, the Philistines were jealous of him. 
GEN.26.15	So they filled in all the wells which the servants of his father Abraham had dug while Abraham was alive.
GEN.26.16	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave our country. You have become more powerful than we are.” 
GEN.26.17	So Isaac left and set up his camp in Gerar Valley, where he stayed for some time. 
GEN.26.18	He dug once again the wells which had been dug during the time of Abraham and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death. Isaac gave the wells the same names that his father had given them.
GEN.26.19	Isaac's servants dug a well in the valley and found water. 
GEN.26.20	The shepherds of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's shepherds and said, “This water belongs to us.” So Isaac named the well “Quarrel.”
GEN.26.21	Isaac's servants dug another well, and there was a quarrel about that one also, so he named it “Enmity.” 
GEN.26.22	He moved away from there and dug another well. There was no dispute about this one, so he named it “Freedom.” He said, “Now the 
GEN.26.23	Isaac left and went to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	That night the 
GEN.26.25	Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the 
GEN.26.27	So Isaac asked, “Why have you now come to see me, when you were so unfriendly to me before and made me leave your country?”
GEN.26.28	They answered, “Now we know that the 
GEN.26.29	that you will not harm us, just as we did not harm you. We were kind to you and let you go peacefully. Now it is clear that the 
GEN.26.30	Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Early next morning each man made his promise and sealed it with a vow. Isaac said good-bye to them, and they parted as friends.
GEN.26.32	On that day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug. They said, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	He named the well “Vow.” That is how the city of Beersheba
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he married two Hittites, Judith the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath the daughter of Elon. 
GEN.26.35	They made life miserable for Isaac and Rebecca.
GEN.27.1	Isaac was now old and had become blind. He sent for his older son Esau and said to him, “Son!”
GEN.27.1	“Yes,” he answered.
GEN.27.2	Isaac said, “You see that I am old and may die soon. 
GEN.27.3	Take your bow and arrows, go out into the country, and kill an animal for me. 
GEN.27.4	Cook me some of that tasty food that I like, and bring it to me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my final blessing before I die.”
GEN.27.5	While Isaac was talking to Esau, Rebecca was listening. So when Esau went out to hunt, 
GEN.27.6	she said to Jacob, “I have just heard your father say to Esau, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me an animal and cook it for me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my blessing in the presence of the 
GEN.27.8	Now, son,” Rebecca continued, “listen to me and do what I say. 
GEN.27.9	Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats, so that I can cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much. 
GEN.27.10	You can take it to him to eat, and he will give you his blessing before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	But Jacob said to his mother, “You know that Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin. 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him; in this way, I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.”
GEN.27.13	His mother answered, “Let any curse against you fall on me, my son; just do as I say, and go and get the goats for me.” 
GEN.27.14	So he went to get them and brought them to her, and she cooked the kind of food that his father liked. 
GEN.27.15	Then she took Esau's best clothes, which she kept in the house, and put them on Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	She put the skins of the goats on his arms and on the hairless part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	She handed him the tasty food, along with the bread she had baked.
GEN.27.18	Then Jacob went to his father and said, “Father!”
GEN.27.18	“Yes,” he answered. “Which of my sons are you?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob answered, “I am your older son Esau; I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.20	Isaac said, “How did you find it so quickly, son?”
GEN.27.20	Jacob answered, “The 
GEN.27.21	Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so that I can touch you. Are you really Esau?” 
GEN.27.22	Jacob moved closer to his father, who felt him and said, “Your voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but your arms feel like Esau's arms.” 
GEN.27.23	He did not recognize Jacob, because his arms were hairy like Esau's. He was about to give him his blessing, 
GEN.27.24	but asked again, “Are you really Esau?”
GEN.27.24	“I am,” he answered.
GEN.27.25	Isaac said, “Bring me some of the meat. After I eat it, I will give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him, and he also brought him some wine to drink. 
GEN.27.26	Then his father said to him, “Come closer and kiss me, son.” 
GEN.27.27	 As he came up to kiss him, Isaac smelled his clothes—so he gave him his blessing. He said, “The pleasant smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	May God give you dew from heaven and make your fields fertile! May he give you plenty of grain and wine! 
GEN.27.29	 May nations be your servants, and may peoples bow down before you. May you rule over all your relatives, and may your mother's descendants bow down before you. May those who curse you be cursed, and may those who bless you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	Isaac finished giving his blessing, and as soon as Jacob left, his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He also cooked some tasty food and took it to his father. He said, “Please, father, sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.32	“Who are you?” Isaac asked.
GEN.27.32	“Your older son Esau,” he answered.
GEN.27.33	Isaac began to tremble and shake all over, and he asked, “Who was it, then, who killed an animal and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came. I gave him my final blessing, and so it is his forever.”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard this, he cried out loudly and bitterly and said, “Give me your blessing also, father!”
GEN.27.35	Isaac answered, “Your brother came and deceived me. He has taken away your blessing.”
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered, “I have already made him master over you, and I have made all his relatives his slaves. I have given him grain and wine. Now there is nothing that I can do for you, son!”
GEN.27.39	“No dew from heaven for you,
GEN.27.39	No fertile fields for you.
GEN.27.40	But be your brother's slave.
GEN.27.40	Yet when you rebel,
GEN.27.40	You will break away from his control.”
GEN.27.41	Esau hated Jacob, because his father had given Jacob the blessing. He thought, “The time to mourn my father's death is near; then I will kill Jacob.”
GEN.27.43	Now, son, do what I say. Go at once to my brother Laban in Haran, 
GEN.27.44	and stay with him for a while, until your brother's anger cools down 
GEN.27.45	and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send someone to bring you back. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?”
GEN.27.46	Rebecca said to Isaac, “I am sick and tired of Esau's foreign wives. If Jacob also marries one of these Hittites, I might as well die.”
GEN.28.1	Isaac called Jacob, greeted him, and told him, “Don't marry a Canaanite. 
GEN.28.2	Go instead to Mesopotamia, to the home of your grandfather Bethuel, and marry one of the young women there, one of your uncle Laban's daughters. 
GEN.28.3	May Almighty God bless your marriage and give you many children, so that you will become the father of many nations! 
GEN.28.4	 May he bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham, and may you take possession of this land, in which you have lived and which God gave to Abraham!” 
GEN.28.5	Isaac sent Jacob away to Mesopotamia, to Laban, who was the son of Bethuel the Aramean and the brother of Rebecca, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Mesopotamia to find a wife. He also learned that when Isaac blessed him, he commanded him not to marry a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.28.7	He found out that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Mesopotamia. 
GEN.28.8	Esau then understood that his father Isaac did not approve of Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	So he went to Ishmael son of Abraham and married his daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.28.11	At sunset he came to a holy place
GEN.28.12	 He dreamed that he saw a stairway reaching from earth to heaven, with angels going up and coming down on it. 
GEN.28.13	 And there was the 
GEN.28.14	 They will be as numerous as the specks of dust on the earth. They will extend their territory in all directions, and through you and your descendants I will bless all the nations.
GEN.28.15	Remember, I will be with you and protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done all that I have promised you.”
GEN.28.16	Jacob woke up and said, “The 
GEN.28.17	He was afraid and said, “What a terrifying place this is! It must be the house of God; it must be the gate that opens into heaven.”
GEN.28.18	Jacob got up early next morning, took the stone that was under his head, and set it up as a memorial. Then he poured olive oil on it to dedicate it to God. 
GEN.28.19	He named the place Bethel.
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow to the 
GEN.28.21	and if I return safely to my father's home, then you will be my God. 
GEN.28.22	This memorial stone which I have set up will be the place where you are worshiped, and I will give you a tenth of everything you give me.”
GEN.29.1	Jacob continued on his way and went toward the land of the East. 
GEN.29.2	Suddenly he came upon a well out in the fields with three flocks of sheep lying around it. The flocks were watered from this well, which had a large stone over the opening. 
GEN.29.3	Whenever all the flocks came together there, the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them. Then they would put the stone back in place.
GEN.29.4	Jacob asked the shepherds, “My friends, where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	“From Haran,” they answered.
GEN.29.5	He asked, “Do you know Laban, grandson of Nahor?”
GEN.29.5	“Yes, we do,” they answered.
GEN.29.6	“Is he well?” he asked.
GEN.29.6	“He is well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with his flock.”
GEN.29.7	Jacob said, “Since it is still broad daylight and not yet time to bring the flocks in, why don't you water them and take them back to pasture?”
GEN.29.8	They answered, “We can't do that until all the flocks are here and the stone has been rolled back; then we will water the flocks.”
GEN.29.9	While Jacob was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with the flock. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw Rachel with his uncle Laban's flock, he went to the well, rolled the stone back, and watered the sheep. 
GEN.29.11	Then he kissed her and began to cry for joy. 
GEN.29.12	He told her, “I am your father's relative, the son of Rebecca.”
GEN.29.12	She ran to tell her father; 
GEN.29.13	and when he heard the news about his nephew Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him and kissed him, and brought him into the house. When Jacob told Laban everything that had happened, 
GEN.29.14	Laban said, “Yes, indeed, you are my own flesh and blood.” Jacob stayed there a whole month.
GEN.29.15	Laban said to Jacob, “You shouldn't work for me for nothing just because you are my relative. How much pay do you want?” 
GEN.29.16	Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah had lovely
GEN.29.18	Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said, “I will work seven years for you, if you will let me marry Rachel.”
GEN.29.19	Laban answered, “I would rather give her to you than to anyone else; stay here with me.” 
GEN.29.20	Jacob worked seven years so that he could have Rachel, and the time seemed like only a few days to him, because he loved her.
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “The time is up; let me marry your daughter.” 
GEN.29.22	So Laban gave a wedding feast and invited everyone. 
GEN.29.23	But that night, instead of Rachel, he took Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had intercourse with her. ( 
GEN.29.24	Laban gave his slave woman Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.) 
GEN.29.25	Not until the next morning did Jacob discover that it was Leah. He went to Laban and said, “Why did you do this to me? I worked to get Rachel. Why have you tricked me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban answered, “It is not the custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. 
GEN.29.27	Wait until the week's marriage celebrations are over, and I will give you Rachel, if you will work for me another seven years.”
GEN.29.28	Jacob agreed, and when the week of marriage celebrations was over, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. ( 
GEN.29.29	Laban gave his slave woman Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.) 
GEN.29.30	Jacob had intercourse with Rachel also, and he loved her more than Leah. Then he worked for Laban another seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, “The 
GEN.29.33	She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “The 
GEN.29.34	Once again she became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She said, “Now my husband will be bound more tightly to me, because I have borne him three sons”; so she named him Levi.
GEN.29.35	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “This time I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	But Rachel had not borne Jacob any children, and so she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I will die.”
GEN.30.2	Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “I can't take the place of God. He is the one who keeps you from having children.”
GEN.30.3	She said, “Here is my slave Bilhah; sleep with her, so that she can have a child for me. In this way I can become a mother through her.” 
GEN.30.4	So she gave Bilhah to her husband, and he had intercourse with her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah became pregnant and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel said, “God has judged in my favor. He has heard my prayer and has given me a son”; so she named him Dan.
GEN.30.7	Bilhah became pregnant again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said, “I have fought a hard fight with my sister, but I have won”; so she named him Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah realized that she had stopped having children, she gave her slave Zilpah to Jacob as his wife. 
GEN.30.10	Then Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Leah said, “I have been lucky”; so she named him Gad.
GEN.30.12	Zilpah bore Jacob another son, 
GEN.30.13	and Leah said, “How happy I am! Now women will call me happy”; so she named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the fields and found mandrakes,
GEN.30.15	Leah answered, “Isn't it enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you are even trying to take away my son's mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	Rachel said, “If you will give me your son's mandrakes, you can sleep with Jacob tonight.”
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the fields in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You are going to sleep with me tonight, because I have paid for you with my son's mandrakes.” So he had intercourse with her that night.
GEN.30.17	God answered Leah's prayer, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband”; so she named her son Issachar.
GEN.30.19	Leah became pregnant again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	She said, “God has given me a fine gift. Now my husband will accept me, because I have borne him six sons”; so she named him Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	Later she bore a daughter, whom she named Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel; he answered her prayer and made it possible for her to have children. 
GEN.30.23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, “God has taken away my disgrace by giving me a son. 
GEN.30.24	May the 
GEN.30.25	After the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me go, so that I can return home. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and children that I have earned by working for you, and I will leave. You know how well I have served you.”
GEN.30.27	Laban said to him, “Let me say this: I have learned by divination that the 
GEN.30.28	Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
GEN.30.29	Jacob answered, “You know how I have worked for you and how your flocks have prospered under my care. 
GEN.30.30	The little you had before I came has grown enormously, and the 
GEN.30.31	“What shall I pay you?” Laban asked.
GEN.30.31	Jacob answered, “I don't want any wages. I will continue to take care of your flocks if you agree to this suggestion: 
GEN.30.32	Let me go through all your flocks today and take every black lamb
GEN.30.33	In the future you can easily find out if I have been honest. When you come to check up on my wages, if I have any goat that isn't speckled or spotted or any sheep that isn't black, you will know that it has been stolen.”
GEN.30.34	Laban answered, “Agreed. We will do as you suggest.” 
GEN.30.35	But that day Laban removed the male goats that had stripes or spots and all the females that were speckled and spotted or which had white on them; he also removed all the black sheep. He put his sons in charge of them, 
GEN.30.36	and then went away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks.
GEN.30.37	Jacob got green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them. 
GEN.30.38	He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
GEN.30.40	Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban's flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban's.
GEN.30.41	When the healthy animals were mating, Jacob put the branches in front of them at the drinking troughs, so that they would breed among the branches. 
GEN.30.42	But he did not put the branches in front of the weak animals. Soon Laban had all the weak animals, and Jacob all the healthy ones. 
GEN.30.43	In this way Jacob became very wealthy. He had many flocks, slaves, camels, and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father. He got all his wealth from what our father owned.” 
GEN.31.2	He also saw that Laban was no longer as friendly as he had been earlier. 
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where his flocks were. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I have noticed that your father is not as friendly toward me as he used to be; but my father's God has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength. 
GEN.31.7	Yet he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not let him harm me. 
GEN.31.8	Whenever Laban said, ‘The speckled goats shall be your wages,’ all the flocks produced speckled young. When he said, ‘The striped goats shall be your wages,’ all the flocks produced striped young. 
GEN.31.9	God has taken flocks away from your father and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	“During the breeding season I had a dream, and I saw that the male goats that were mating were striped, spotted, and speckled. 
GEN.31.11	The angel of God spoke to me in the dream and said, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Yes,’ I answered. 
GEN.31.12	‘Look,’ he continued, ‘all the male goats that are mating are striped, spotted, and speckled. I am making this happen because I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	 I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you dedicated a stone as a memorial by pouring olive oil on it and where you made a vow to me. Now get ready and go back to the land where you were born.’”
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah answered Jacob, “There is nothing left for us to inherit from our father. 
GEN.31.15	He treats us like foreigners. He sold us, and now he has spent all the money he was paid for us. 
GEN.31.16	All this wealth which God has taken from our father belongs to us and to our children. Do whatever God has told you.”
GEN.31.17+GEN.31.18	So Jacob got ready to go back to his father in the land of Canaan. He put his children and his wives on the camels, and drove all his flocks ahead of him, with everything that he had gotten in Mesopotamia. 
GEN.31.19	Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and during his absence Rachel stole the household gods that belonged to her father. 
GEN.31.20	Jacob deceived Laban by not letting him know that he was leaving. 
GEN.31.21	He took everything he owned and left in a hurry. He crossed the Euphrates River and started for the hill country of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	Three days later Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	He took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	In a dream that night God came to Laban and said to him, “Be careful not to threaten Jacob in any way.” 
GEN.31.25	Jacob had set up his camp on a mountain, and Laban set up his camp with his relatives in the hill country of Gilead.
GEN.31.26	Laban said to Jacob, “Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps. 
GEN.31.28	You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye. That was a foolish thing to do! 
GEN.31.29	I have the power to do you harm, but last night the God of your father warned me not to threaten you in any way. 
GEN.31.30	I know that you left because you were so anxious to get back home, but why did you steal my household gods?”
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered, “I was afraid, because I thought that you might take your daughters away from me. 
GEN.31.32	But if you find that anyone here has your gods, he will be put to death. Here, with our men as witnesses, look for anything that belongs to you and take what is yours.” Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban's gods.
GEN.31.33	Laban went and searched Jacob's tent; then he went into Leah's tent, and the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find his gods. Then he went into Rachel's tent. 
GEN.31.34	Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in a camel's saddlebag and was sitting on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I am not able to stand up in your presence; I am having my monthly period.” Laban searched but did not find his household gods.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob lost his temper. “What crime have I committed?” he asked angrily. “What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down? 
GEN.31.37	Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it, and let them decide which one of us is right. 
GEN.31.38	I have been with you now for twenty years; your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce, and I have not eaten any rams from your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	Whenever a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always bore the loss myself. I didn't take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night. 
GEN.31.40	Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep. 
GEN.31.41	It was like that for the whole twenty years I was with you. For fourteen years I worked to win your two daughters—and six years for your flocks. And even then, you changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac, had not been with me, you would have already sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my trouble and the work I have done, and last night he gave his judgment.”
GEN.31.43	Laban answered Jacob, “These young women are my daughters; their children belong to me, and these flocks are mine. In fact, everything you see here belongs to me. But since I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children, 
GEN.31.44	I am ready to make an agreement with you. Let us make a pile of stones to remind us of our agreement.”
GEN.31.45	So Jacob got a stone and set it up as a memorial. 
GEN.31.46	He told his men to gather some rocks and pile them up. Then they ate a meal beside the pile of rocks. 
GEN.31.47	Laban named it Jegar Sahadutha,
GEN.31.48	Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks will be a reminder for both of us.” That is why that place was named Galeed. 
GEN.31.49	Laban also said, “May the 
GEN.31.50	Laban went on, “If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other women, even though I don't know about it, remember that God is watching us. 
GEN.31.51	Here are the rocks that I have piled up between us, and here is the memorial stone. 
GEN.31.52	Both this pile and this memorial stone are reminders. I will never go beyond this pile to attack you, and you must never go beyond it or beyond this memorial stone to attack me. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor
GEN.31.54	He killed an animal, which he offered as a sacrifice on the mountain, and he invited his men to the meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters good-bye, and left to go back home.
GEN.32.1	As Jacob went on his way, some angels met him. 
GEN.32.2	When he saw them, he said, “This is God's camp”; so he named the place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He instructed them to say: “I, Jacob, your obedient servant, report to my master Esau that I have been staying with Laban and that I have delayed my return until now. 
GEN.32.5	I own cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and slaves. I am sending you word, sir, in the hope of gaining your favor.”
GEN.32.6	When the messengers came back to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and he is already on his way to meet you. He has four hundred men with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Jacob was frightened and worried. He divided into two groups the people who were with him, and also his sheep, goats, cattle, and camels. 
GEN.32.8	He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks the first group, the other may be able to escape.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob prayed, “God of my grandfather Abraham and God of my father Isaac, hear me! You told me, 
GEN.32.10	I am not worth all the kindness and faithfulness that you have shown me, your servant. I crossed the Jordan with nothing but a walking stick, and now I have come back with these two groups. 
GEN.32.11	Save me, I pray, from my brother Esau. I am afraid—afraid that he is coming to attack us and destroy us all, even the women and children. 
GEN.32.12	 Remember that you promised to make everything go well for me and to give me more descendants than anyone could count, as many as the grains of sand along the seashore.”
GEN.32.13+GEN.32.14+GEN.32.15	After spending the night there, Jacob chose from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau: 200 female goats and 20 males, 200 female sheep and 20 males, 30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 males. 
GEN.32.16	He divided them into herds and put one of his servants in charge of each herd. He said to them, “Go ahead of me, and leave a space between each herd and the one behind it.” 
GEN.32.17	He ordered the first servant, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these animals in front of you?’ 
GEN.32.18	you must answer, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. He sends them as a present to his master Esau. Jacob himself is right behind us.’” 
GEN.32.19	He gave the same order to the second, the third, and to all the others who were in charge of the herds: “This is what you must say to Esau when you meet him. 
GEN.32.20	You must say, ‘Yes, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” Jacob was thinking, “I will win him over with the gifts, and when I meet him, perhaps he will forgive me.” 
GEN.32.21	He sent the gifts on ahead of him and spent that night in camp.
GEN.32.22	That same night Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two concubines, and his eleven children, and crossed the Jabbok River. 
GEN.32.23	 After he had sent them across, he also sent across all that he owned, 
GEN.32.24	 but he stayed behind, alone.
GEN.32.24	Then a man came and wrestled with him until just before daybreak. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he was not winning the struggle, he hit Jacob on the hip, and it was thrown out of joint. 
GEN.32.26	The man said, “Let me go; daylight is coming.”
GEN.32.26	“I won't, unless you bless me,” Jacob answered.
GEN.32.27	“What is your name?” the man asked.
GEN.32.27	“Jacob,” he answered.
GEN.32.29	But he answered, “Why do you want to know my name?” Then he blessed Jacob.
GEN.32.30	Jacob said, “I have seen God face-to-face, and I am still alive”; so he named the place Peniel.
GEN.32.31	The sun rose as Jacob was leaving Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. 
GEN.32.32	Even today the descendants of Israel do not eat the muscle which is on the hip joint, because it was on this muscle that Jacob was hit.
GEN.33.1	Jacob saw Esau coming with his four hundred men, so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two concubines. 
GEN.33.2	He put the concubines and their children first, then Leah and her children, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
GEN.33.3	Jacob went ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They were both crying. 
GEN.33.5	When Esau looked around and saw the women and the children, he asked, “Who are these people with you?”
GEN.33.5	“These, sir, are the children whom God has been good enough to give me,” Jacob answered. 
GEN.33.6	Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down; 
GEN.33.7	then Leah and her children came, and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down.
GEN.33.8	Esau asked, “What about that other group I met? What did that mean?”
GEN.33.8	Jacob answered, “It was to gain your favor.”
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have.”
GEN.33.10	Jacob said, “No, please, if I have gained your favor, accept my gift. To see your face is for me like seeing the face of God, now that you have been so friendly to me. 
GEN.33.11	Please accept this gift which I have brought for you; God has been kind to me and given me everything I need.” Jacob kept on urging him until he accepted.
GEN.33.12	Esau said, “Let's get ready and leave. I will go ahead of you.”
GEN.33.13	Jacob answered, “You know that the children are weak, and I must think of the sheep and livestock with their young. If they are driven hard for even one day, the whole herd will die. 
GEN.33.14	Please go on ahead of me, and I will follow slowly, going as fast as I can with the livestock and the children until I catch up with you in Edom.”
GEN.33.15	Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”
GEN.33.15	But Jacob answered, “There is no need for that for I only want to gain your favor.”
GEN.33.16	So that day Esau started on his way back to Edom. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob went to Sukkoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was named Sukkoth.
GEN.33.18	On his return from Mesopotamia Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan and set up his camp in a field near the city. 
GEN.33.19	 He bought that part of the field from the descendants of Hamor father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver. 
GEN.33.20	He put up an altar there and named it for El, the God of Israel.
GEN.34.1	One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the Canaanite women. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, who was chief of that region, saw her, he took her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	But he found the young woman so attractive that he fell in love with her and tried to win her affection.
GEN.34.4	He told his father, “I want you to get Dinah for me as my wife.”
GEN.34.5	Jacob learned that his daughter had been disgraced, but because his sons were out in the fields with his livestock, he did nothing until they came back. 
GEN.34.6	Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob, 
GEN.34.7	just as Jacob's sons were coming in from the fields. When they heard about it, they were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a thing and had insulted the people of Israel by raping Jacob's daughter. 
GEN.34.8	Hamor said to him, “My son Shechem has fallen in love with your daughter; please let him marry her. 
GEN.34.9	Let us make an agreement that there will be intermarriage between our people and yours. 
GEN.34.10	Then you may stay here in our country with us; you may live anywhere you wish, trade freely, and own property.”
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, “Do me this favor, and I will give you whatever you want. 
GEN.34.12	Tell me what presents you want, and set the payment for the bride as high as you wish; I will give you whatever you ask, if you will only let me marry her.”
GEN.34.13	Because Shechem had disgraced their sister Dinah, Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor in a deceitful way. 
GEN.34.14	They said to him, “We cannot let our sister marry a man who is not circumcised; that would be a disgrace for us. 
GEN.34.15	We can agree only on the condition that you become like us by circumcising all your males. 
GEN.34.16	Then we will agree to intermarriage. We will settle among you and become one people with you. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not accept our terms and be circumcised, we will take her and leave.”
GEN.34.18	These terms seemed fair to Hamor and his son Shechem, 
GEN.34.19	and the young man lost no time in doing what was suggested, because he was in love with Jacob's daughter. He was the most important member of his family.
GEN.34.20	Hamor and his son Shechem went to the meeting place at the city gate and spoke to the people of the town: 
GEN.34.21	“These men are friendly; let them live in the land with us and travel freely. The land is large enough for them also. Let us marry their daughters and give them ours in marriage. 
GEN.34.22	But these men will agree to live among us and be one people with us only on the condition that we circumcise all our males, as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Won't all their livestock and everything else they own be ours? So let us agree that they can live among us.” 
GEN.34.24	All the citizens of the city agreed with what Hamor and Shechem proposed, and all the males were circumcised.
GEN.34.25	Three days later, when the men were still sore from their circumcision, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, took their swords, went into the city without arousing suspicion, and killed all the men, 
GEN.34.26	including Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 
GEN.34.27	After the slaughter Jacob's other sons looted the town to take revenge for their sister's disgrace. 
GEN.34.28	They took the flocks, the cattle, the donkeys, and everything else in the city and in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	They took everything of value, captured all the women and children, and carried off everything in the houses.
GEN.34.30	Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have gotten me into trouble; now the Canaanites, the Perizzites, and everybody else in the land will hate me. I do not have many men; if they all band together against me and attack me, our whole family will be destroyed.”
GEN.34.31	But they answered, “We cannot let our sister be treated like a common whore.”
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his family and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that you have; purify yourselves and put on clean clothes. 
GEN.35.3	We are going to leave here and go to Bethel, where I will build an altar to the God who helped me in the time of my trouble and who has been with me everywhere I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that they had and also the earrings that they were wearing. He buried them beneath the oak tree near Shechem.
GEN.35.5	When Jacob and his sons started to leave, great fear fell on the people of the nearby towns, and they did not pursue them. 
GEN.35.6	Jacob came with all his people to Luz, which is now known as Bethel, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	He built an altar there and named the place for the God of Bethel, because God had revealed himself to him there when he was running away from his brother. 
GEN.35.8	Rebecca's nurse Deborah died and was buried beneath the oak south of Bethel. So it was named “Oak of Weeping.”
GEN.35.9	When Jacob returned from Mesopotamia, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	 God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but from now on it will be Israel.” So God named him Israel. 
GEN.35.11	 And God said to him, “I am Almighty God. Have many children. Nations will be descended from you, and you will be the ancestor of kings. 
GEN.35.12	I will give you the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, and I will also give it to your descendants after you.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God left him. 
GEN.35.14	 There, where God had spoken to him, Jacob set up a memorial stone and consecrated it by pouring wine and olive oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	He named the place Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Jacob and his family left Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, the time came for Rachel to have her baby, and she was having difficult labor. 
GEN.35.17	When her labor pains were at their worst, the midwife said to her, “Don't be afraid, Rachel; it's another boy.” 
GEN.35.18	But she was dying, and as she breathed her last, she named her son Benoni,
GEN.35.19	When Rachel died, she was buried beside the road to Ephrath, now known as Bethlehem. 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a memorial stone there, and it still marks Rachel's grave to this day. 
GEN.35.21	Jacob moved on and set up his camp on the other side of the tower of Eder.
GEN.35.22	Jacob had twelve sons. 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah were Reuben (Jacob's oldest son), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Rachel's slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. 
GEN.35.26	The sons of Leah's slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These sons were born in Mesopotamia.
GEN.35.28	Isaac lived to be a hundred and eighty years old 
GEN.35.29	and died at a ripe old age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	These are the descendants of Esau, also called Edom. 
GEN.36.2	 Esau married Canaanite women: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah son
GEN.36.3	 and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel; 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons were born to Esau in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the people of his house, along with all his livestock and all the possessions he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went away from his brother Jacob to another land. 
GEN.36.7	He left because the land where he and Jacob were living was not able to support them; they had too much livestock and could no longer stay together. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau lived in the hill country of Edom.
GEN.36.9	These are the descendants of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites. 
GEN.36.10+GEN.36.11+GEN.36.12+GEN.36.13	Esau's wife Adah bore him one son, Eliphaz, and Eliphaz had five sons: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. And by another wife, Timna, he had one more son, Amalek.
GEN.36.10+GEN.36.11+GEN.36.12+GEN.36.13	Esau's wife Basemath bore him one son, Reuel, and Reuel had four sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
GEN.36.14	Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah son
GEN.36.15	These are the tribes descended from Esau. Esau's first son Eliphaz was the ancestor of the following tribes: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These were all descendants of Esau's wife Adah.
GEN.36.17	Esau's son Reuel was the ancestor of the following tribes: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were all descendants of Esau's wife Basemath.
GEN.36.18	The following tribes were descended from Esau by his wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
GEN.36.19	All these tribes were descended from Esau.
GEN.36.20+GEN.36.21	The original inhabitants of the land of Edom were divided into tribes which traced their ancestry to the following descendants of Seir, a Horite: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
GEN.36.22	Lotan was the ancestor of the clans of Hori and Heman. (Lotan had a sister named Timna.)
GEN.36.23	Shobal was the ancestor of the clans of Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	Zibeon had two sons, Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was taking care of his father's donkeys.) 
GEN.36.25+GEN.36.26	Anah was the father of Dishon, who was the ancestor of the clans of Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. Anah also had a daughter named Oholibamah.
GEN.36.27	Ezer was the ancestor of the clans of Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	Dishan was the ancestor of the clans of Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29+GEN.36.30	These are the Horite tribes in the land of Edom: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Before there were any kings in Israel, the following kings ruled the land of Edom in succession:
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Bela son of Beor from Dinhabah
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Husham from the region of Teman
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Hadad son of Bedad from Avith (he defeated the Midianites in a battle in the country of Moab)
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Samlah from Masrekah

GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Baal Hanan son of Achbor
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Hadad from Pau (his wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Mezahab)
GEN.36.40+GEN.36.41+GEN.36.42+GEN.36.43	Esau was the ancestor of the following Edomite tribes: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, Magdiel, and Iram. The area where each of these tribes lived was known by the name of the tribe.
GEN.37.1	Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived, 
GEN.37.2	and this is the story of Jacob's family.
GEN.37.2	Joseph, a young man of seventeen, took care of the sheep and goats with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's concubines. He brought bad reports to his father about what his brothers were doing.
GEN.37.3	Jacob loved Joseph more than all his other sons, because he had been born to him when he was old. He made a long robe with full sleeves
GEN.37.4	When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than he loved them, they hated their brother so much that they would not speak to him in a friendly manner.
GEN.37.5	One time Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	He said, “Listen to the dream I had. 
GEN.37.7	We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat, when my sheaf got up and stood up straight. Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it.”
GEN.37.8	“Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us?” his brothers asked. So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them.
GEN.37.9	Then Joseph had another dream and told his brothers, “I had another dream, in which I saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.”
GEN.37.10	He also told the dream to his father, and his father scolded him: “What kind of a dream is that? Do you think that your mother, your brothers, and I are going to come and bow down to you?” 
GEN.37.11	 Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept thinking about the whole matter.
GEN.37.12	One day when Joseph's brothers had gone to Shechem to take care of their father's flock, 
GEN.37.13	Jacob said to Joseph, “I want you to go to Shechem, where your brothers are taking care of the flock.”
GEN.37.13	Joseph answered, “I am ready.”
GEN.37.14	His father told him, “Go and see if your brothers are safe and if the flock is all right; then come back and tell me.” So his father sent him on his way from Hebron Valley.
GEN.37.14	Joseph arrived at Shechem 
GEN.37.15	and was wandering around in the country when a man saw him and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	“I am looking for my brothers, who are taking care of their flock,” he answered. “Can you tell me where they are?”
GEN.37.17	The man said, “They have already left. I heard them say that they were going to Dothan.” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
GEN.37.18	They saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted against him and decided to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Here comes that dreamer. 
GEN.37.20	Come on now, let's kill him and throw his body into one of the dry wells. We can say that a wild animal killed him. Then we will see what becomes of his dreams.”
GEN.37.21	Reuben heard them and tried to save Joseph. “Let's not kill him,” he said. 
GEN.37.22	“Just throw him into this well in the wilderness, but don't hurt him.” He said this, planning to save him from them and send him back to his father. 
GEN.37.23	When Joseph came up to his brothers, they ripped off his long robe with full sleeves.
GEN.37.24	Then they took him and threw him into the well, which was dry.
GEN.37.25	While they were eating, they suddenly saw a group of Ishmaelites traveling from Gilead to Egypt. Their camels were loaded with spices and resins. 
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up the murder? 
GEN.37.27	Let's sell him to these Ishmaelites. Then we won't have to hurt him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed, 
GEN.37.28	 and when some Midianite traders came by, the brothers
GEN.37.29	When Reuben came back to the well and found that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes in sorrow. 
GEN.37.30	He returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not there! What am I going to do?”
GEN.37.31	Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph's robe in its blood. 
GEN.37.32	They took the robe to their father and said, “We found this. Does it belong to your son?”
GEN.37.33	He recognized it and said, “Yes, it is his! Some wild animal has killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. He mourned for his son a long time. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “I will go down to the world of the dead still mourning for my son.” So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph.
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites had sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of the king's officers, who was the captain of the palace guard.
GEN.38.1	About that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah, who was from the town of Adullam. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah met a young Canaanite woman whose father was named Shua. He married her, 
GEN.38.3	and she bore him a son, whom he named Er. 
GEN.38.4	She became pregnant again and bore another son and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	Again she had a son and named him Shelah. Judah was at Achzib when the boy was born.
GEN.38.6	For his first son Er, Judah got a wife whose name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	Er's conduct was evil, and it displeased the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Er's brother Onan, “Go and sleep with your brother's widow. Fulfill your obligation to her as her husband's brother, so that your brother may have descendants.” 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the children would not belong to him, so when he had intercourse with his brother's widow, he let the semen spill on the ground, so that there would be no children for his brother. 
GEN.38.10	What he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Return to your father's house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up.” He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed, as his brothers had been. So Tamar went back home.
GEN.38.12	After some time Judah's wife died. When he had finished the time of mourning, he and his friend Hirah of Adullam went to Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared. 
GEN.38.13	Someone told Tamar that her father-in-law was going to Timnah to shear his sheep. 
GEN.38.14	So she changed from the widow's clothes she had been wearing, covered her face with a veil, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, a town on the road to Timnah. As she well knew, Judah's youngest son Shelah was now grown up, and yet she had not been given to him in marriage.
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, because she had her face covered. 
GEN.38.16	He went over to her at the side of the road and said, “All right, how much do you charge?” (He did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.)
GEN.38.16	She said, “What will you give me?”
GEN.38.17	He answered, “I will send you a young goat from my flock.”
GEN.38.17	She said, “All right, if you will give me something to keep as a pledge until you send the goat.”
GEN.38.18	“What shall I give you as a pledge?” he asked.
GEN.38.18	She answered, “Your seal with its cord and the walking stick you are carrying.” He gave them to her. Then they had intercourse, and she became pregnant. 
GEN.38.19	Tamar went home, took off her veil, and put her widow's clothes back on.
GEN.38.20	Judah sent his friend Hirah to take the goat and get back from the woman the articles he had pledged, but Hirah could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked some men at Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who was here by the road?”
GEN.38.21	“There has never been a prostitute here,” they answered.
GEN.38.22	He returned to Judah and said, “I couldn't find her. The men of the place said that there had never been a prostitute there.”
GEN.38.23	Judah said, “Let her keep the things. We don't want people to laugh at us. I did try to pay her, but you couldn't find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been acting like a whore, and now she is pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	Judah ordered, “Take her out and burn her to death.”
GEN.38.25	As she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man who owns these things. Look at them and see whose they are—this seal with its cord and this walking stick.”
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized them and said, “She is in the right. I have failed in my obligation to her—I should have given her to my son Shelah in marriage.” And Judah never had intercourse with her again.
GEN.38.27	When the time came for her to give birth, it was discovered that she was going to have twins. 
GEN.38.28	While she was in labor, one of them put out an arm; the midwife caught it, tied a red thread around it, and said, “This one was born first.” 
GEN.38.29	But he pulled his arm back, and his brother was born first. Then the midwife said, “So this is how you break your way out!” So he was named Perez.
GEN.38.30	Then his brother was born with the red thread on his arm, and he was named Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Now the Ishmaelites had taken Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, one of the king's officers, who was the captain of the palace guard. 
GEN.39.2	 The 
GEN.39.3	who saw that the 
GEN.39.4	Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant; so he put him in charge of his house and everything he owned. 
GEN.39.5	From then on, because of Joseph the 
GEN.39.6	Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph and did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
GEN.39.6	Joseph was well-built and good-looking, 
GEN.39.7	and after a while his master's wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her. 
GEN.39.8	He refused and said to her, “Look, my master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house, because I am here. He has put me in charge of everything he has. 
GEN.39.9	I have as much authority in this house as he has, and he has not kept back anything from me except you. How then could I do such an immoral thing and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	Although she asked Joseph day after day, he would not go to bed with her.
GEN.39.11	But one day when Joseph went into the house to do his work, none of the house servants was there. 
GEN.39.12	She caught him by his robe and said, “Come to bed with me.” But he escaped and ran outside, leaving his robe in her hand. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his robe and had run out of the house, 
GEN.39.14	she called to her house servants and said, “Look at this! This Hebrew that my husband brought to the house is insulting us. He came into my room and tried to rape me, but I screamed as loud as I could. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me scream, he ran outside, leaving his robe beside me.”
GEN.39.16	She kept his robe with her until Joseph's master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told him the same story: “That Hebrew slave that you brought here came into my room and insulted me. 
GEN.39.18	But when I screamed, he ran outside, leaving his robe beside me.”
GEN.39.19	Joseph's master was furious 
GEN.39.20	and had Joseph arrested and put in the prison where the king's prisoners were kept, and there he stayed. 
GEN.39.21	 But the 
GEN.39.22	He put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and made him responsible for everything that was done in the prison. 
GEN.39.23	The jailer did not have to look after anything for which Joseph was responsible, because the 
GEN.40.1	Some time later the king of Egypt's wine steward and his chief baker offended the king. 
GEN.40.2	He was angry with these two officials 
GEN.40.3	and put them in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same place where Joseph was being kept. 
GEN.40.4	They spent a long time in prison, and the captain assigned Joseph as their servant.
GEN.40.5	One night there in prison the wine steward and the chief baker each had a dream, and the dreams had different meanings. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were upset. 
GEN.40.7	He asked them, “Why do you look so worried today?”
GEN.40.8	They answered, “Each of us had a dream, and there is no one here to explain what the dreams mean.”
GEN.40.8	“It is God who gives the ability to interpret dreams,” Joseph said. “Tell me your dreams.”
GEN.40.9	So the wine steward said, “In my dream there was a grapevine in front of me 
GEN.40.10	with three branches on it. As soon as the leaves came out, the blossoms appeared, and the grapes ripened. 
GEN.40.11	I was holding the king's cup; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup and gave it to him.”
GEN.40.12	Joseph said, “This is what it means: the three branches are three days. 
GEN.40.13	In three days the king will release you, pardon you, and restore you to your position. You will give him his cup as you did before when you were his wine steward. 
GEN.40.14	But please remember me when everything is going well for you, and please be kind enough to mention me to the king and help me get out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	After all, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here in Egypt I didn't do anything to deserve being put in prison.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the wine steward's dream was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I had a dream too; I was carrying three breadbaskets on my head. 
GEN.40.17	In the top basket there were all kinds of baked goods for the king, and the birds were eating them.”
GEN.40.18	Joseph answered, “This is what it means: the three baskets are three days. 
GEN.40.19	In three days the king will release you—and have your head cut off! Then he will hang your body on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh.”
GEN.40.20	On his birthday three days later the king gave a banquet for all his officials; he released his wine steward and his chief baker and brought them before his officials. 
GEN.40.21	He restored the wine steward to his former position, 
GEN.40.22	but he executed the chief baker. It all happened just as Joseph had said. 
GEN.40.23	But the wine steward never gave Joseph another thought—he forgot all about him.
GEN.41.1	After two years had passed, the king of Egypt dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River, 
GEN.41.2	when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and began to feed on the grass. 
GEN.41.3	Then seven other cows came up; they were thin and bony. They came and stood by the other cows on the riverbank, 
GEN.41.4	and the thin cows ate up the fat cows. Then the king woke up. 
GEN.41.5	He fell asleep again and had another dream. Seven heads of grain, full and ripe, were growing on one stalk. 
GEN.41.6	Then seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the desert wind, 
GEN.41.7	and the thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming. 
GEN.41.8	 In the morning he was worried, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. He told them his dreams, but no one could explain them to him.
GEN.41.9	Then the wine steward said to the king, “I must confess today that I have done wrong. 
GEN.41.10	You were angry with the chief baker and me, and you put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	One night each of us had a dream, and the dreams had different meanings. 
GEN.41.12	A young Hebrew was there with us, a slave of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us. 
GEN.41.13	Things turned out just as he said: you restored me to my position, but you executed the baker.”
GEN.41.14	The king sent for Joseph, and he was immediately brought from the prison. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came into the king's presence. 
GEN.41.15	The king said to him, “I have had a dream, and no one can explain it. I have been told that you can interpret dreams.”
GEN.41.16	Joseph answered, “I cannot, Your Majesty, but God will give a favorable interpretation.”
GEN.41.17	The king said, “I dreamed that I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
GEN.41.18	when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and began feeding on the grass. 
GEN.41.19	Then seven other cows came up which were thin and bony. They were the poorest cows I have ever seen anywhere in Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	The thin cows ate up the fat ones, 
GEN.41.21	but no one would have known it, because they looked just as bad as before. Then I woke up. 
GEN.41.22	I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain which were full and ripe, growing on one stalk. 
GEN.41.23	Then seven heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the desert wind, 
GEN.41.24	and the thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told the dreams to the magicians, but none of them could explain them to me.”
GEN.41.25	Joseph said to the king, “The two dreams mean the same thing; God has told you what he is going to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven full heads of grain are also seven years; they have the same meaning. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin cows which came up later and the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the desert wind are seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	It is just as I told you—God has shown you what he is going to do. 
GEN.41.29	There will be seven years of great plenty in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	After that, there will be seven years of famine, and all the good years will be forgotten, because the famine will ruin the country. 
GEN.41.31	The time of plenty will be entirely forgotten, because the famine which follows will be so terrible. 
GEN.41.32	The repetition of your dream means that the matter is fixed by God and that he will make it happen in the near future.
GEN.41.33	“Now you should choose some man with wisdom and insight and put him in charge of the country. 
GEN.41.34	You must also appoint other officials and take a fifth of the crops during the seven years of plenty. 
GEN.41.35	Order them to collect all the food during the good years that are coming, and give them authority to store up grain in the cities and guard it. 
GEN.41.36	The food will be a reserve supply for the country during the seven years of famine which are going to come on Egypt. In this way the people will not starve.”
GEN.41.37	The king and his officials approved this plan, 
GEN.41.38	and he said to them, “We will never find a better man than Joseph, a man who has God's spirit in him.” 
GEN.41.39	The king said to Joseph, “God has shown you all this, so it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else. 
GEN.41.40	 I will put you in charge of my country, and all my people will obey your orders. Your authority will be second only to mine. 
GEN.41.41	I now appoint you governor over all Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	 The king removed from his finger the ring engraved with the royal seal and put it on Joseph's finger. He put a fine linen robe on him, and placed a gold chain around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	He gave him the second royal chariot to ride in, and his guard of honor went ahead of him and cried out, “Make way! Make way!” And so Joseph was appointed governor over all Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	The king said to him, “I am the king—and no one in all Egypt shall so much as lift a hand or a foot without your permission.” 
GEN.41.45+GEN.41.46	He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah, and he gave him a wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis.
GEN.41.45+GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he began to serve the king of Egypt. He left the king's court and traveled all over the land. 
GEN.41.47	During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundant crops, 
GEN.41.48	all of which Joseph collected and stored in the cities. In each city he stored the food from the fields around it. 
GEN.41.49	There was so much grain that Joseph stopped measuring it—it was like the sand of the sea.
GEN.41.50	Before the years of famine came, Joseph had two sons by Asenath. 
GEN.41.51	He said, “God has made me forget all my sufferings and all my father's family”; so he named his first son Manasseh.
GEN.41.52	He also said, “God has given me children in the land of my trouble”; so he named his second son Ephraim.
GEN.41.53	The seven years of plenty that the land of Egypt had enjoyed came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every other country, but there was food throughout Egypt. 
GEN.41.55	 When the Egyptians began to be hungry, they cried out to the king for food. So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them. 
GEN.41.56	The famine grew worse and spread over the whole country, so Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. 
GEN.41.57	People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why don't you do something? 
GEN.42.2	 I hear that there is grain in Egypt; go there and buy some to keep us from starving to death.” 
GEN.42.3	So Joseph's ten half brothers went to buy grain in Egypt, 
GEN.42.4	but Jacob did not send Joseph's full brother Benjamin with them, because he was afraid that something might happen to him.
GEN.42.5	The sons of Jacob came with others to buy grain, because there was famine in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	Joseph, as governor of the land of Egypt, was selling grain to people from all over the world. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7	When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he acted as if he did not know them. He asked them harshly, “Where do you come from?”
GEN.42.7	“We have come from Canaan to buy food,” they answered.
GEN.42.8	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	 He remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said, “You are spies; you have come to find out where our country is weak.”
GEN.42.10	“No, sir,” they answered. “We have come as your slaves, to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all brothers. We are not spies, sir, we are honest men.”
GEN.42.12	Joseph said to them, “No! You have come to find out where our country is weak.”
GEN.42.13	They said, “We were twelve brothers in all, sir, sons of the same man in the land of Canaan. One brother is dead, and the youngest is now with our father.”
GEN.42.14	“It is just as I said,” Joseph answered. “You are spies. 
GEN.42.15	This is how you will be tested: I swear by the name of the king that you will never leave unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	One of you must go and get him. The rest of you will be kept under guard until the truth of what you say can be tested. Otherwise, as sure as the king lives, you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	With that, he put them in prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man, and I will spare your lives on one condition. 
GEN.42.19	To prove that you are honest, one of you will stay in the prison where you have been kept; the rest of you may go and take back to your starving families the grain that you have bought. 
GEN.42.20	Then you must bring your youngest brother to me. This will prove that you have been telling the truth, and I will not put you to death.”
GEN.42.20	They agreed to this 
GEN.42.21	and said to one another, “Yes, now we are suffering the consequences of what we did to our brother; we saw the great trouble he was in when he begged for help, but we would not listen. That is why we are in this trouble now.”
GEN.42.23	Joseph understood what they said, but they did not know it, because they had been speaking to him through an interpreter. 
GEN.42.24	Joseph left them and began to cry. When he was able to speak again, he came back, picked out Simeon, and had him tied up in front of them.
GEN.42.25	Joseph gave orders to fill his brothers' packs with grain, to put each man's money back in his sack, and to give them food for the trip. This was done. 
GEN.42.26	The brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain they had bought, and then they left. 
GEN.42.27	At the place where they spent the night, one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey and found his money at the top of the sack. 
GEN.42.28	“My money has been returned to me,” he called to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack!” Their hearts sank, and in fear they asked one another, “What has God done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When they came to their father Jacob in Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them: 
GEN.42.30	“The governor of Egypt spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying against his country. 
GEN.42.31	‘We are not spies,’ we answered, ‘we are honest men. 
GEN.42.32	We were twelve brothers in all, sons of the same father. One brother is dead, and the youngest is still in Canaan with our father.’ 
GEN.42.33	The man answered, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men: One of you will stay with me; the rest will take grain for your starving families and leave. 
GEN.42.34	Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but honest men; I will give your brother back to you, and you can stay here and trade.’”
GEN.42.35	Then when they emptied out their sacks, every one of them found his bag of money; and when they saw the money, they and their father Jacob were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	Their father said to them, “Do you want to make me lose all my children? Joseph is gone; Simeon is gone; and now you want to take away Benjamin. I am the one who suffers!”
GEN.42.37	Reuben said to his father, “If I do not bring Benjamin back to you, you can kill my two sons. Put him in my care, and I will bring him back.”
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “My son cannot go with you; his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. Something might happen to him on the way. I am an old man, and the sorrow you would cause me would kill me.”
GEN.43.1	The famine in Canaan got worse, 
GEN.43.2	and when the family of Jacob had eaten all the grain which had been brought from Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy a little food for us.”
GEN.43.3	Judah said to him, “The man sternly warned us that we would not be admitted to his presence unless we had our brother with us. 
GEN.43.4	If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	If you are not willing, we will not go, because the man told us we would not be admitted to his presence unless our brother was with us.”
GEN.43.6	Jacob said, “Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the man that you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	They answered, “The man kept asking about us and our family, ‘Is your father still living? Do you have another brother?’ We had to answer his questions. How could we know that he would tell us to bring our brother with us?”
GEN.43.8	Judah said to his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will leave at once. Then none of us will starve to death. 
GEN.43.9	I will pledge my own life, and you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you safe and sound, I will always bear the blame. 
GEN.43.10	If we had not waited so long, we could have been there and back twice by now.”
GEN.43.11	Their father said to them, “If that is how it has to be, then take the best products of the land in your packs as a present for the governor: a little resin, a little honey, spices, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Take with you also twice as much money, because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother and return at once. 
GEN.43.14	May Almighty God cause the man to have pity on you, so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you. As for me, if I must lose my children, I must lose them.”
GEN.43.15	So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money, and set out for Egypt with Benjamin. There they presented themselves to Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant in charge of his house, “Take these men to my house. They are going to eat with me at noon, so kill an animal and prepare it.” 
GEN.43.17	The servant did as he was commanded and took the brothers to Joseph's house.
GEN.43.18	As they were being brought to the house, they were afraid and thought, “We are being brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time. They will suddenly attack us, take our donkeys, and make us his slaves.” 
GEN.43.19	So at the door of the house, they said to the servant in charge, 
GEN.43.20	“If you please, sir, we came here once before to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	When we set up camp on the way home, we opened our sacks, and each man found his money in the top of his sack—every bit of it. We have brought it back to you. 
GEN.43.22	We have also brought some more money with us to buy more food. We do not know who put our money back in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	The servant said, “Don't worry. Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put the money in your sacks for you. I received your payment.” Then he brought Simeon to them.
GEN.43.24	The servant took the brothers into the house. He gave them water so that they could wash their feet, and he fed their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	They got their gifts ready to present to Joseph when he arrived at noon, because they had been told that they were to eat with him. 
GEN.43.26	When Joseph got home, they took the gifts into the house to him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
GEN.43.27	He asked about their health and then said, “You told me about your old father—how is he? Is he still alive and well?”
GEN.43.28	They answered, “Your humble servant, our father, is still alive and well.” And they knelt and bowed down before him.
GEN.43.29	When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin, he said, “So this is your youngest brother, the one you told me about. God bless you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph left suddenly, because his heart was full of tender feelings for his brother. He was about to break down, so he went to his room and cried. 
GEN.43.31	After he had washed his face, he came out, and controlling himself, he ordered the meal to be served. 
GEN.43.32	Joseph was served at one table and his brothers at another. The Egyptians who were eating there were served separately, because they considered it beneath their dignity to eat with Hebrews. 
GEN.43.33	The brothers had been seated at the table, facing Joseph, in the order of their age from the oldest to the youngest. When they saw how they had been seated, they looked at one another in amazement. 
GEN.43.34	Food was served to them from Joseph's table, and Benjamin was served five times as much as the rest of them. So they ate and drank with Joseph until they were drunk.
GEN.44.1	Joseph commanded the servant in charge of his house, “Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's money in the top of his sack. 
GEN.44.2	Put my silver cup in the top of the youngest brother's sack, together with the money for his grain.” He did as he was told. 
GEN.44.3	Early in the morning the brothers were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	When they had gone only a short distance from the city, Joseph said to the servant in charge of his house, “Hurry after those men. When you catch up with them, ask them, ‘Why have you paid back evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Why did you steal my master's silver cup?
GEN.44.6	When the servant caught up with them, he repeated these words. 
GEN.44.7	They answered him, “What do you mean, sir, by talking like this? We swear that we have done no such thing. 
GEN.44.8	You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master's house? 
GEN.44.9	Sir, if any one of us is found to have it, he will be put to death, and the rest of us will become your slaves.”
GEN.44.10	He said, “I agree; but only the one who has taken the cup will become my slave, and the rest of you can go free.” 
GEN.44.11	So they quickly lowered their sacks to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	Joseph's servant searched carefully, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
GEN.44.13	The brothers tore their clothes in sorrow, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They bowed down before him, 
GEN.44.15	and Joseph said, “What have you done? Didn't you know that a man in my position could find you out by practicing divination?”
GEN.44.16	“What can we say to you, sir?” Judah answered. “How can we argue? How can we clear ourselves? God has uncovered our guilt. All of us are now your slaves and not just the one with whom the cup was found.”
GEN.44.17	Joseph said, “Oh, no! I would never do that! Only the one who had the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go back safe and sound to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Judah went up to Joseph and said, “Please, sir, allow me to speak with you freely. Don't be angry with me; you are like the king himself. 
GEN.44.19	Sir, you asked us, ‘Do you have a father or another brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	We answered, ‘We have a father who is old and a younger brother, born to him in his old age. The boy's brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's children still alive; his father loves him very much.’ 
GEN.44.21	Sir, you told us to bring him here, so that you could see him, 
GEN.44.22	and we answered that the boy could not leave his father; if he did, his father would die. 
GEN.44.23	Then you said, ‘You will not be admitted to my presence again unless your youngest brother comes with you.’
GEN.44.24	“When we went back to our father, we told him what you had said. 
GEN.44.25	Then he told us to return and buy a little food. 
GEN.44.26	We answered, ‘We cannot go; we will not be admitted to the man's presence unless our youngest brother is with us. We can go only if our youngest brother goes also.’ 
GEN.44.27	Our father said to us, ‘You know that my wife Rachel bore me only two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One of them has already left me. He must have been torn to pieces by wild animals, because I have not seen him since he left. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one from me now and something happens to him, the sorrow you would cause me would kill me, as old as I am.’
GEN.44.30+GEN.44.31	“And now, sir,” Judah continued, “if I go back to my father without the boy, as soon as he sees that the boy is not with me, he will die. His life is wrapped up with the life of the boy, and he is so old that the sorrow we would cause him would kill him. 
GEN.44.32	What is more, I pledged my life to my father for the boy. I told him that if I did not bring the boy back to him, I would bear the blame all my life. 
GEN.44.33	And now, sir, I will stay here as your slave in place of the boy; let him go back with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I cannot bear to see this disaster come upon my father.”
GEN.45.2	He cried with such loud sobs that the Egyptians heard it, and the news was taken to the king's palace. 
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But when his brothers heard this, they were so terrified that they could not answer. 
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to them, “Please come closer.” They did, and he said, “I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Now do not be upset or blame yourselves because you sold me here. It was really God who sent me ahead of you to save people's lives. 
GEN.45.6	This is only the second year of famine in the land; there will be five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor reaping. 
GEN.45.7	God sent me ahead of you to rescue you in this amazing way and to make sure that you and your descendants survive. 
GEN.45.8	So it was not really you who sent me here, but God. He has made me the king's highest official. I am in charge of his whole country; I am the ruler of all Egypt.
GEN.45.10	You can live in the region of Goshen, where you can be near me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your sheep, your goats, your cattle, and everything else that you have. 
GEN.45.11	If you are in Goshen, I can take care of you. There will still be five years of famine; and I do not want you, your family, and your livestock to starve.’”
GEN.45.12	Joseph continued, “Now all of you, and you too, Benjamin, can see that I am really Joseph. 
GEN.45.13	Tell my father how powerful I am here in Egypt and tell him about everything that you have seen. Then hurry and bring him here.”
GEN.45.14	He threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and began to cry; Benjamin also cried as he hugged him. 
GEN.45.15	Then, still weeping, he embraced each of his brothers and kissed them. After that, his brothers began to talk with him.
GEN.45.16	When the news reached the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were pleased. 
GEN.45.17	He said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers to load their animals and to return to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Let them get their father and their families and come back here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they will have more than enough to live on. 
GEN.45.19	Tell them also to take wagons with them from Egypt for their wives and small children and to bring their father with them. 
GEN.45.20	They are not to worry about leaving their possessions behind; the best in the whole land of Egypt will be theirs.”
GEN.45.21	Jacob's sons did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons, as the king had ordered, and food for the trip. 
GEN.45.22	He also gave each of them a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothes. 
GEN.45.23	He sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best Egyptian goods and ten donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food for the trip. 
GEN.45.24	He sent his brothers off and as they left, he said to them, “Don't quarrel on the way.”
GEN.45.25	They left Egypt and went back home to their father Jacob in Canaan. 
GEN.45.26	“Joseph is still alive!” they told him. “He is the ruler of all Egypt!” Jacob was stunned and could not believe them.
GEN.45.27	But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to take him to Egypt, he recovered from the shock. 
GEN.45.28	“My son Joseph is still alive!” he said. “This is all I could ask for! I must go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	Jacob packed up all he had and went to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	God spoke to him in a vision at night and called, “Jacob, Jacob!”
GEN.46.2	“Yes, here I am,” he answered.
GEN.46.3	“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go to Egypt; I will make your descendants a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I will go with you to Egypt, and I will bring your descendants back to this land. Joseph will be with you when you die.”
GEN.46.5	Jacob set out from Beersheba. His sons put him, their small children, and their wives in the wagons which the king of Egypt had sent. 
GEN.46.6	 They took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt. Jacob took all his descendants with him: 
GEN.46.7	his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters.
GEN.46.8	The members of Jacob's family who went to Egypt with him were his oldest son Reuben 
GEN.46.9	and Reuben's sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	Simeon and his sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	Levi and his sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	Judah and his sons: Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. (Judah's other sons, Er and Onan, had died in Canaan.) Perez' sons were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	Issachar and his sons: Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	Zebulun and his sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons that Leah had borne to Jacob in Mesopotamia, besides his daughter Dinah. In all, his descendants by Leah numbered thirty-three.
GEN.46.16	Gad and his sons: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arod, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	Asher and his sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These sixteen are the descendants of Jacob by Zilpah, the slave woman whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah.
GEN.46.19	Jacob's wife Rachel bore him two sons: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	 In Egypt Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, by Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in Heliopolis. 
GEN.46.21	Benjamin's sons were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These fourteen are the descendants of Jacob by Rachel.
GEN.46.23	Dan and his son Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	Naphtali and his sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These seven are the descendants of Jacob by Bilhah, the slave woman whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel.
GEN.46.26	The total number of the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt was sixty-six, not including his sons' wives. 
GEN.46.27	 Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt, bringing to seventy the total number of Jacob's family who went there.
GEN.46.28	Jacob sent Judah ahead to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen. When they arrived, 
GEN.46.29	Joseph got in his chariot and went to Goshen to meet his father. When they met, Joseph threw his arms around his father's neck and cried for a long time. 
GEN.46.30	Jacob said to Joseph, “I am ready to die, now that I have seen you and know that you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and the rest of his father's family, “I must go and tell the king that my brothers and all my father's family, who were living in Canaan, have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	I will tell him that you are shepherds and take care of livestock and that you have brought your flocks and herds and everything else that belongs to you. 
GEN.46.33	When the king calls for you and asks what your occupation is, 
GEN.46.34	be sure to tell him that you have taken care of livestock all your lives, just as your ancestors did. In this way he will let you live in the region of Goshen.” Joseph said this because Egyptians will have nothing to do with shepherds.
GEN.47.1	So Joseph took five of his brothers and went to the king. He told him, “My father and my brothers have come from Canaan with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own. They are now in the region of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	He then presented his brothers to the king. 
GEN.47.3	The king asked them, “What is your occupation?”
GEN.47.3	“We are shepherds, sir, just as our ancestors were,” they answered. 
GEN.47.4	“We have come to live in this country, because in the land of Canaan the famine is so severe that there is no pasture for our flocks. Please give us permission to live in the region of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	The king said to Joseph, “Now that your father and your brothers have arrived, 
GEN.47.6	the land of Egypt is theirs. Let them settle in the region of Goshen, the best part of the land. And if there are any capable men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing, 
GEN.47.8	and the king asked him, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	Jacob answered, “My life of wandering has lasted a hundred and thirty years. Those years have been few and difficult, unlike the long years of my ancestors in their wanderings.” 
GEN.47.10	Jacob gave the king a farewell blessing and left. 
GEN.47.11	Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt, giving them property in the best of the land near the city of Rameses, as the king had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph provided food for his father, his brothers, and all the rest of his father's family, including the very youngest.
GEN.47.13	The famine was so severe that there was no food anywhere, and the people of Egypt and Canaan became weak with hunger. 
GEN.47.14	As they bought grain, Joseph collected all the money and took it to the palace. 
GEN.47.15	When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was spent, the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Don't let us die. Do something! Our money is all gone.”
GEN.47.16	Joseph answered, “Bring your livestock; I will give you food in exchange for it if your money is all gone.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. That year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
GEN.47.18	The following year they came to him and said, “We will not hide the fact from you, sir, that our money is all gone and our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left to give you except our bodies and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Don't let us die. Do something! Don't let our fields be deserted. Buy us and our land in exchange for food. We will be the king's slaves, and he will own our land. Give us grain to keep us alive and seed so that we can plant our fields.”
GEN.47.20	Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king. Every Egyptian was forced to sell his land, because the famine was so severe; and all the land became the king's property. 
GEN.47.21	Joseph made slaves of the people from one end of Egypt to the other. 
GEN.47.22	The only land he did not buy was the land that belonged to the priests. They did not have to sell their lands, because the king gave them an allowance to live on. 
GEN.47.23	Joseph said to the people, “You see, I have now bought you and your lands for the king. Here is seed for you to sow in your fields. 
GEN.47.24	At the time of harvest you must give one-fifth to the king. You can use the rest for seed and for food for yourselves and your families.”
GEN.47.25	They answered, “You have saved our lives; you have been good to us, sir, and we will be the king's slaves.” 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made it a law for the land of Egypt that one-fifth of the harvest should belong to the king. This law still remains in force today. Only the lands of the priests did not become the king's property.
GEN.47.27	The Israelites lived in Egypt in the region of Goshen, where they became rich and had many children. 
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, until he was a hundred and forty-seven years old. 
GEN.47.29	 When the time drew near for him to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “Place your hand between my thighs
GEN.47.30	I want to be buried where my fathers are; carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.”
GEN.47.30	Joseph answered, “I will do as you say.”
GEN.47.31	Jacob said, “Make a vow that you will.” Joseph made the vow, and Jacob gave thanks there on his bed.
GEN.48.1	Some time later Joseph was told that his father was ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see Jacob. 
GEN.48.2	When Jacob was told that his son Joseph had come to see him, he gathered his strength and sat up in bed. 
GEN.48.3	 Jacob said to Joseph, “Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me. 
GEN.48.4	He said to me, ‘I will give you many children, so that your descendants will become many nations; I will give this land to your descendants as their possession forever.’”
GEN.48.5	Jacob continued, “Joseph, your two sons, who were born to you in Egypt before I came here, belong to me; Ephraim and Manasseh are just as much my sons as Reuben and Simeon. 
GEN.48.6	If you have any more sons, they will not be considered mine; the inheritance they get will come through Ephraim and Manasseh. 
GEN.48.7	 I am doing this because of your mother Rachel. To my great sorrow she died in the land of Canaan, not far from Ephrath, as I was returning from Mesopotamia. I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath.” (Ephrath is now known as Bethlehem.)
GEN.48.8	When Jacob saw Joseph's sons, he asked, “Who are these boys?”
GEN.48.9	Joseph answered, “These are my sons, whom God has given me here in Egypt.”
GEN.48.9	Jacob said, “Bring them to me so that I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Jacob's eyesight was failing because of his age, and he could not see very well. Joseph brought the boys to him, and he hugged them and kissed them. 
GEN.48.11	Jacob said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, and now God has even let me see your children.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph took them from Jacob's lap and bowed down before him with his face to the ground.
GEN.48.13	Joseph put Ephraim at Jacob's left and Manasseh at his right. 
GEN.48.14	But Jacob crossed his hands, and put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, even though he was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, who was the older. 
GEN.48.15	Then he blessed Joseph:
GEN.48.15	“May God, whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac served, bless these boys!
GEN.48.15	May God, who has led me to this very day, bless them!
GEN.48.16	May the angel, who has rescued me from all harm, bless them!
GEN.48.16	May my name and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac live on through these boys!
GEN.48.16	May they have many children, many descendants!”
GEN.48.17	Joseph was upset when he saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim's head; so he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to the head of Manasseh. 
GEN.48.18	He said to his father, “Not that way, father. This is the older boy; put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	His father refused, saying, “I know, son, I know. Manasseh's descendants will also become a great people. But his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become great nations.”
GEN.48.21	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “As you see, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will take you back to the land of your ancestors. 
GEN.48.22	It is to you and not to your brothers that I am giving Shechem, that fertile region which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
GEN.49.1	Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future:
GEN.49.2	“Come together and listen, sons of Jacob.
GEN.49.2	Listen to your father Israel.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, my first-born, you are my strength
GEN.49.3	And the first child of my manhood,
GEN.49.3	The proudest and strongest of all my sons.
GEN.49.4	You are like a raging flood,
GEN.49.4	But you will not be the most important,
GEN.49.4	For you slept with my concubine
GEN.49.4	And dishonored your father's bed.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers.
GEN.49.5	They use their weapons to commit violence.
GEN.49.6	I will not join in their secret talks,
GEN.49.6	Nor will I take part in their meetings,
GEN.49.6	For they killed people in anger
GEN.49.6	And they crippled bulls for sport.
GEN.49.7	A curse be on their anger, because it is so fierce,
GEN.49.7	And on their fury, because it is so cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will scatter them throughout the land of Israel.
GEN.49.7	I will disperse them among its people.
GEN.49.8	“Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	You hold your enemies by the neck.
GEN.49.8	Your brothers will bow down before you.
GEN.49.9	Killing his victim and returning to his den,
GEN.49.9	Stretching out and lying down.
GEN.49.9	No one dares disturb him.
GEN.49.10	Judah will hold the royal scepter,
GEN.49.10	And his descendants will always rule.
GEN.49.10	Nations will bring him tribute
GEN.49.10	And bow in obedience before him.
GEN.49.11	He ties his young donkey to a grapevine,
GEN.49.11	To the very best of the vines.
GEN.49.11	He washes his clothes in blood-red wine.
GEN.49.12	His eyes are bloodshot from drinking wine,
GEN.49.12	His teeth white from drinking milk.
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will live beside the sea.
GEN.49.13	His shore will be a haven for ships.
GEN.49.13	His territory will reach as far as Sidon.
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is no better than a donkey
GEN.49.14	That lies stretched out between its saddlebags.
GEN.49.15	But he sees that the resting place is good
GEN.49.15	And that the land is delightful.
GEN.49.15	So he bends his back to carry the load
GEN.49.15	And is forced to work as a slave.
GEN.49.16	“Dan will be a ruler for his people.
GEN.49.16	They will be like the other tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be a snake at the side of the road,
GEN.49.17	A poisonous snake beside the path,
GEN.49.17	That strikes at the horse's heel,
GEN.49.17	So that the rider is thrown off backward.
GEN.49.18	“I wait for your deliverance, 
GEN.49.19	“Gad will be attacked by a band of robbers,
GEN.49.19	But he will turn and pursue them.
GEN.49.20	“Asher's land will produce rich food.
GEN.49.20	He will provide food fit for a king.
GEN.49.21	“Naphtali is a deer that runs free,
GEN.49.21	Who bears lovely fawns.
GEN.49.22	“Joseph is like a wild donkey by a spring,
GEN.49.22	A wild colt on a hillside.
GEN.49.23	His enemies attack him fiercely
GEN.49.23	And pursue him with their bows and arrows.
GEN.49.24	But his bow remains steady,
GEN.49.24	And his arms are made strong
GEN.49.24	By the power of the Mighty God of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	By the Shepherd, the Protector of Israel.
GEN.49.25	It is your father's God who helps you,
GEN.49.25	The Almighty God who blesses you
GEN.49.25	With blessings of rain from above
GEN.49.25	And of deep waters from beneath the ground,
GEN.49.25	Blessings of many cattle and children,
GEN.49.26	Blessings of grain and flowers,
GEN.49.26	Blessings of ancient mountains,
GEN.49.26	Delightful things from everlasting hills.
GEN.49.26	May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	On the brow of the one set apart from his brothers.
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is like a vicious wolf.
GEN.49.27	Morning and evening he kills and devours.”
GEN.49.28	These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said as he spoke a suitable word of farewell to each son.
GEN.49.29	Then Jacob commanded his sons, “Now that I am going to join my people in death, bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	 at Machpelah east of Mamre in the land of Canaan. Abraham bought this cave and field from Ephron for a burial ground. 
GEN.49.31	 That is where they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; that is where they buried Isaac and his wife Rebecca; and that is where I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. Bury me there.” 
GEN.49.33	 When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he lay back down and died.
GEN.50.1	Joseph threw himself on his father, crying and kissing his face. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his father's body. 
GEN.50.3	It took forty days, the normal time for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the king's officials, “Please take this message to the king: 
GEN.50.5	 ‘When my father was about to die, he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb which he had prepared in the land of Canaan. So please let me go and bury my father, and then I will come back.’”
GEN.50.6	The king answered, “Go and bury your father, as you promised you would.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went to bury his father. All the king's officials, the senior men of his court, and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph. 
GEN.50.8	His family, his brothers, and the rest of his father's family all went with him. Only their small children and their sheep, goats, and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him; it was a huge group.
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan, they mourned loudly for a long time, and Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days. 
GEN.50.11	When the citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad, they said, “What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding!” That is why the place was named Abel Mizraim.
GEN.50.12	So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them; 
GEN.50.13	 they carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre in the field which Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground. 
GEN.50.14	After Joseph had buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him for the funeral.
GEN.50.15	After the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said, “What if Joseph still hates us and plans to pay us back for all the harm we did to him?” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent a message to Joseph: “Before our father died, 
GEN.50.17	he told us to ask you, ‘Please forgive the crime your brothers committed when they wronged you.’ Now please forgive us the wrong that we, the servants of your father's God, have done.” Joseph cried when he received this message.
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers themselves came and bowed down before him. “Here we are before you as your slaves,” they said.
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Don't be afraid; I can't put myself in the place of God. 
GEN.50.20	You plotted evil against me, but God turned it into good, in order to preserve the lives of many people who are alive today because of what happened. 
GEN.50.21	You have nothing to fear. I will take care of you and your children.” So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts.
GEN.50.22	Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father's family; he was a hundred and ten years old when he died. 
GEN.50.23	He lived to see Ephraim's children and grandchildren. He also lived to receive the children of Machir son of Manasseh into the family. 
GEN.50.24	He said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will certainly take care of you and lead you out of this land to the land he solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	 Then Joseph asked his people to make a vow. “Promise me,” he said, “that when God leads you to that land, you will take my body with you.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died in Egypt at the age of a hundred and ten. They embalmed his body and put it in a coffin.
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	The total number of these people directly descended from Jacob was seventy.
EXO.1.6	In the course of time Joseph, his brothers, and all the rest of that generation died, 
EXO.1.7	 but their descendants, the Israelites, had many children and became so numerous and strong that Egypt was filled with them.
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “These Israelites are so numerous and strong that they are a threat to us. 
EXO.1.10	 In case of war they might join our enemies in order to fight against us, and might escape from
EXO.1.11	So the Egyptians put slave drivers over them to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses to serve as supply centers for the king. 
EXO.1.12	But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number and the farther they spread through the land. The Egyptians came to fear the Israelites 
EXO.1.13+EXO.1.14	and made their lives miserable by forcing them into cruel slavery. They made them work on their building projects and in their fields, and they had no pity on them.
EXO.1.15	Then the king of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and Puah, the two midwives who helped the Hebrew women. 
EXO.1.16	“When you help the Hebrew women give birth,” he said to them, “kill the baby if it is a boy; but if it is a girl, let it live.” 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives were God-fearing and so did not obey the king; instead, they let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	So the king sent for the midwives and asked them, “Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the boys live?”
EXO.1.19	They answered, “The Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they give birth easily, and their babies are born before either of us gets there.” 
EXO.1.20+EXO.1.21	Because the midwives were God-fearing, God was good to them and gave them families of their own. And the Israelites continued to increase and become strong. 
EXO.1.22	 Finally the king issued a command to all his people: “Take every newborn Hebrew boy and throw him into the Nile, but let all the girls live.”
EXO.2.1	During this time a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman of his own tribe, 
EXO.2.2	 and she bore him a son. When she saw what a fine baby he was, she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could not hide him any longer, she took a basket made of reeds and covered it with tar to make it watertight. She put the baby in it and then placed it in the tall grass at the edge of the river. 
EXO.2.4	The baby's sister stood some distance away to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	The king's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her servants walked along the bank. Suddenly she noticed the basket in the tall grass and sent a slave woman to get it. 
EXO.2.6	The princess opened it and saw a baby boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.
EXO.2.7	Then his sister asked her, “Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?”
EXO.2.8	“Please do,” she answered. So the girl went and brought the baby's own mother. 
EXO.2.9	The princess told the woman, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So she took the baby and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	 Later, when the child was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him as her own son. She said to herself, “I pulled him out of the water, and so I name him Moses.”
EXO.2.12	Moses looked all around, and when he saw that no one was watching, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	The next day he went back and saw two Hebrew men fighting. He said to the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you beating up a fellow Hebrew?”
EXO.2.14	The man answered, “Who made you our ruler and judge? Are you going to kill me just as you killed that Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said to himself, “People have found out what I have done.” 
EXO.2.15+EXO.2.16	 When the king heard about what had happened, he tried to have Moses killed, but Moses fled and went to live in the land of Midian.
EXO.2.15+EXO.2.16	One day, when Moses was sitting by a well, seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father's sheep and goats. 
EXO.2.17	But some shepherds drove Jethro's daughters away. Then Moses went to their rescue and watered their animals for them. 
EXO.2.18	When they returned to their father, he asked, “Why have you come back so early today?”
EXO.2.19	“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they answered, “and he even drew water for us and watered our animals.”
EXO.2.20	“Where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why did you leave the man out there? Go and invite him to eat with us.”
EXO.2.21	So Moses decided to live there, and Jethro gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage, 
EXO.2.22	who bore him a son. Moses said to himself, “I am a foreigner in this land, and so I name him Gershom.”
EXO.2.23	Years later the king of Egypt died, but the Israelites were still groaning under their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry went up to God, 
EXO.2.24	 who heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	He saw the slavery of the Israelites and was concerned for them.
EXO.3.1	One day while Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, he led the flock across the desert and came to Sinai, the holy mountain. 
EXO.3.2	 There the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	“This is strange,” he thought. “Why isn't the bush burning up? I will go closer and see.”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.4	He answered, “Yes, here I am.”
EXO.3.5	God said, “Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground. 
EXO.3.6	I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” So Moses covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	Then the 
EXO.3.8	and so I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them out of Egypt to a spacious land, one which is rich and fertile and in which the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites now live. 
EXO.3.9	I have indeed heard the cry of my people, and I see how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
EXO.3.10	Now I am sending you to the king of Egypt so that you can lead my people out of his country.”
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “I am nobody. How can I go to the king and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	God answered, “I will be with you, and when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will worship me on this mountain. That will be the proof that I have sent you.”
EXO.3.15	Tell the Israelites that I, the 
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the leaders of Israel together and tell them that I, the 
EXO.3.17	I have decided that I will bring them out of Egypt, where they are being treated cruelly, and will take them to a rich and fertile land—the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
EXO.3.18	“My people will listen to what you say to them. Then you must go with the leaders of Israel to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The 
EXO.3.19	I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless he is forced to do so. 
EXO.3.20	But I will use my power and will punish Egypt by doing terrifying things there. After that he will let you go.
EXO.3.22	Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbors and to any Egyptian woman living in her house and will ask for clothing and for gold and silver jewelry. The Israelites will put these things on their sons and daughters and carry away the wealth of the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered the 
EXO.4.2	So the 
EXO.4.2	“A walking stick,” he answered.
EXO.4.3	The 
EXO.4.4	Then the 
EXO.4.5	The 
EXO.4.6	The 
EXO.4.7	Then the 
EXO.4.8	The 
EXO.4.9	If in spite of these two miracles they still will not believe you, and if they refuse to listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the ground. The water will turn into blood.”
EXO.4.10	But Moses said, “No, 
EXO.4.11	The 
EXO.4.12	Now, go! I will help you to speak, and I will tell you what to say.”
EXO.4.13	But Moses answered, “No, Lord, please send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	At this the 
EXO.4.15	You can speak to him and tell him what to say. I will help both of you to speak, and I will tell you both what to do. 
EXO.4.16	He will be your spokesman and speak to the people for you. Then you will be like God, telling him what to say. 
EXO.4.17	Take this walking stick with you; for with it you will perform miracles.”
EXO.4.18	Then Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go back to my relatives in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” Jethro agreed and told him good-bye.
EXO.4.19	While Moses was still in Midian, the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and set out with them for Egypt, carrying the walking stick that God had told him to take.
EXO.4.21	Again the 
EXO.4.22	Then you must tell him that I, the 
EXO.4.23	 I told you to let my son go, so that he might worship me, but you refused. Now I am going to kill your first-born son.’”
EXO.4.24	At a camping place on the way to Egypt, the 
EXO.4.25+EXO.4.26	Then Zipporah, his wife, took a sharp stone, cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched Moses' feet
EXO.4.27	Meanwhile the 
EXO.4.28	Then Moses told Aaron everything that the 
EXO.4.29	So Moses and Aaron went to Egypt and gathered all the Israelite leaders together. 
EXO.4.30	Aaron told them everything that the 
EXO.4.31	They believed, and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	Then Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and said, “The 
EXO.5.2	“Who is the 
EXO.5.3	Moses and Aaron replied, “The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us. Allow us to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.5.4	The king said to Moses and Aaron, “What do you mean by making the people neglect their work? Get those slaves back to work! 
EXO.5.5	You people have become more numerous than the Egyptians. And now you want to stop working!”
EXO.5.6	That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave drivers and the Israelite foremen: 
EXO.5.7	“Stop giving the people straw for making bricks. Make them go and find it for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before, not one brick less. They don't have enough work to do, and that is why they keep asking me to let them go and offer sacrifices to their God! 
EXO.5.9	Make them work harder and keep them busy, so that they won't have time to listen to a pack of lies.”
EXO.5.10	The slave drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites, “The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw. 
EXO.5.11	He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it, but you must still make the same number of bricks.” 
EXO.5.12	So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The slave drivers kept trying to force them to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made when they were given straw. 
EXO.5.14	The Egyptian slave drivers beat the Israelite foremen, whom they had put in charge of the work. They demanded, “Why aren't you people making the same number of bricks that you made before?”
EXO.5.15	Then the foremen went to the king and complained, “Why do you do this to us, Your Majesty? 
EXO.5.16	We are given no straw, but we are still ordered to make bricks! And now we are being beaten. It is your people that are at fault.”
EXO.5.17	The king answered, “You are lazy and don't want to work, and that is why you ask me to let you go and offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.5.18	Now get back to work! You will not be given any straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.” 
EXO.5.19	The foremen realized that they were in trouble when they were told that they had to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made before.
EXO.5.20	As they were leaving, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. 
EXO.5.21	They said to Moses and Aaron, “The 
EXO.5.22	Then Moses turned to the 
EXO.5.23	Ever since I went to the king to speak for you, he has treated them cruelly. And you have done nothing to help them!”
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Almighty God, but I did not make myself known to them by my holy name, the 
EXO.6.4	I also made my covenant with them, promising to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they had lived as foreigners. 
EXO.6.5	Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered my covenant. 
EXO.6.6	So tell the Israelites that I say to them, ‘I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will make you my own people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	I will bring you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as your own possession. I am the 
EXO.6.9	Moses told this to the Israelites, but they would not listen to him, because their spirit had been broken by their cruel slavery.
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	“Go and tell the king of Egypt that he must let the Israelites leave his land.”
EXO.6.12	But Moses replied, “Even the Israelites will not listen to me, so why should the king? I am such a poor speaker.”
EXO.6.13	The 
EXO.6.14	Reuben, Jacob's first-born, had four sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. 
EXO.6.15	Simeon had six sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. 
EXO.6.16	 Levi had three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. Levi lived 137 years. 
EXO.6.17	Gershon had two sons: Libni and Shimei, and they had many descendants. 
EXO.6.18	Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
EXO.6.19	Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi with their descendants.
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
EXO.6.21	Izhar had three sons: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	Uzziel also had three sons: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon; she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	Korah had three sons: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; they were the ancestors of the divisions of the clan of Korah. 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters, who bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the families and the clans of the tribe of Levi.
EXO.6.26	Aaron and Moses were the ones to whom the 
EXO.6.27	They were the men who told the king of Egypt to free the Israelites.
EXO.6.28	When the 
EXO.6.29	he said, “I am the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses answered, “You know that I am such a poor speaker; why should the king listen to me?”
EXO.7.1	The 
EXO.7.2	Tell Aaron everything I command you, and he will tell the king to let the Israelites leave his country. 
EXO.7.3+EXO.7.4	 But I will make the king stubborn, and he will not listen to you, no matter how many terrifying things I do in Egypt. Then I will bring severe punishment on Egypt and lead the tribes of my people out of the land. 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians will then know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	Moses and Aaron did what the 
EXO.7.7	At the time when they spoke to the king, Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three.
EXO.7.8	The 
EXO.7.9	“If the king demands that you prove yourselves by performing a miracle, tell Aaron to take his walking stick and throw it down in front of the king, and it will turn into a snake.” 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to the king and did as the 
EXO.7.11	Then the king called for his wise men and magicians, and by their magic they did the same thing. 
EXO.7.12	They threw down their walking sticks, and the sticks turned into snakes. But Aaron's stick swallowed theirs. 
EXO.7.13	The king, however, remained stubborn and, just as the 
EXO.7.15	So go and meet him in the morning when he goes down to the Nile. Take with you the walking stick that was turned into a snake, and wait for him on the riverbank. 
EXO.7.16	Then say to the king, ‘The 
EXO.7.17	 Now, Your Majesty, the 
EXO.7.18	The fish will die, and the river will stink so much that the Egyptians will not be able to drink from it.’”
EXO.7.19	The 
EXO.7.20	Then Moses and Aaron did as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish in the river died, and it smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink from it. There was blood everywhere in Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	Then the king's magicians did the same thing by means of their magic, and the king was as stubborn as ever. Just as the 
EXO.7.23	Instead, he turned and went back to his palace without paying any attention even to this. 
EXO.7.24	All the Egyptians dug along the bank of the river for drinking water, because they were not able to drink water from the river.
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the 
EXO.8.1	Then the 
EXO.8.2	If you refuse, I will punish your country by covering it with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	The Nile will be so full of frogs that they will leave it and go into your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your officials and your people, and even into your ovens and baking pans. 
EXO.8.4	They will jump up on you, your people, and all your officials.’”
EXO.8.5	The 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron held it out over all the water, and the frogs came out and covered the land. 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians used magic, and they also made frogs come up on the land.
EXO.8.8	The king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the 
EXO.8.9	Moses replied, “I will be glad to pray for you. Just set the time when I am to pray for you, your officers, and your people. Then you will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile.”
EXO.8.10	The king answered, “Pray for me tomorrow.”
EXO.8.10	Moses said, “I will do as you ask, and then you will know that there is no other god like the 
EXO.8.11	You, your officials, and your people will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	Then Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed to the 
EXO.8.13	The 
EXO.8.14	The Egyptians piled them up in great heaps, until the land stank with them. 
EXO.8.15	When the king saw that the frogs were dead, he became stubborn again and, just as the 
EXO.8.16	The 
EXO.8.17	So Aaron struck the ground with his stick, and all the dust in Egypt was turned into gnats, which covered the people and the animals. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians tried to use their magic to make gnats appear, but they failed. There were gnats everywhere, 
EXO.8.19	 and the magicians said to the king, “God has done this!” But the king was stubborn and, just as the 
EXO.8.20	The 
EXO.8.21	I warn you that if you refuse, I will punish you by sending flies on you, your officials, and your people. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and the ground will be covered with them. 
EXO.8.22	But I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live, so that there will be no flies there. I will do this so that you will know that I, the 
EXO.8.23	I will make a distinction
EXO.8.24	The 
EXO.8.25	Then the king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go and offer sacrifices to your God here in this country.”
EXO.8.26	“It would not be right to do that,” Moses answered, “because the Egyptians would be offended by our sacrificing the animals that we offer to the 
EXO.8.27	We must travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.28	The king said, “I will let you go to sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	Moses answered, “As soon as I leave, I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	Moses left the king and prayed to the 
EXO.8.31	and the 
EXO.8.32	But even this time the king became stubborn, and again he would not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	The 
EXO.9.2	If you again refuse to let them go, 
EXO.9.3	I will punish you by sending a terrible disease on all your animals—your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. 
EXO.9.4	I will make a distinction between the animals of the Israelites and those of the Egyptians, and no animal that belongs to the Israelites will die. 
EXO.9.5	I, the 
EXO.9.6	The next day the 
EXO.9.7	The king asked what had happened and was told that none of the animals of the Israelites had died. But he was stubborn and would not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	Then the 
EXO.9.9	They will spread out like fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and everywhere they will produce boils that become open sores on the people and the animals.” 
EXO.9.10	 So they got some ashes and stood before the king; Moses threw them into the air, and they produced boils that became open sores on the people and the animals. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians were not able to appear before Moses, because they were covered with boils, like all the other Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	The 
EXO.9.14	This time I will punish not only your officials and your people, but I will punish you as well, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the world. 
EXO.9.15	If I had raised my hand to strike you and your people with disease, you would have been completely destroyed. 
EXO.9.16	 But to show you my power I have let you live so that my fame might spread over the whole world. 
EXO.9.17	Yet you are still arrogant and refuse to let my people go. 
EXO.9.18	This time tomorrow I will cause a heavy hailstorm, such as Egypt has never known in all its history. 
EXO.9.19	Now give orders for your livestock and everything else you have in the open to be put under shelter. Hail will fall on the people and animals left outside unprotected, and they will all die.’” 
EXO.9.20	Some of the king's officials were afraid because of what the 
EXO.9.21	Others, however, paid no attention to the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	So Moses raised his stick toward the sky, and the 
EXO.9.24	 a heavy hailstorm, with lightning flashing back and forth. It was the worst storm that Egypt had ever known in all its history. 
EXO.9.25	All over Egypt the hail struck down everything in the open, including all the people and all the animals. It beat down all the plants in the fields and broke all the trees. 
EXO.9.26	The region of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was the only place where there was no hail.
EXO.9.27	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “This time I have sinned; the 
EXO.9.28	Pray to the 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, I will lift up my hands in prayer to the 
EXO.9.30	But I know that you and your officials do not yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	The flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley was ripe, and the flax was budding. 
EXO.9.32	But none of the wheat was ruined, because it ripens later.
EXO.9.33	Moses left the king, went out of the city, and lifted up his hands in prayer to the 
EXO.9.34	When the king saw what had happened, he sinned again. He and his officials remained as stubborn as ever 
EXO.9.35	and, just as the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	and in order that you may be able to tell your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians when I performed the miracles. All of you will know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to the king and said to him, “The 
EXO.10.4	If you keep on refusing, then I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 
EXO.10.5	There will be so many that they will completely cover the ground. They will eat everything that the hail did not destroy, even the trees that are left. 
EXO.10.6	They will fill your palaces and the houses of all your officials and all your people. They will be worse than anything your ancestors ever saw.’” Then Moses turned and left.
EXO.10.7	The king's officials said to him, “How long is this man going to give us trouble? Let the Israelite men go, so that they can worship the 
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king, and he said to them, “You may go and worship the 
EXO.10.9	Moses answered, “We will all go, including our children and our old people. We will take our sons and daughters, our sheep and goats, and our cattle, because we must hold a festival to honor the 
EXO.10.10	The king said, “I swear by the 
EXO.10.11	No! Only the men may go and worship the 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses raised his stick, and the 
EXO.10.14	 They came in swarms and settled over the whole country. It was the largest swarm of locusts that had ever been seen or that ever would be seen again. 
EXO.10.15	They covered the ground until it was black with them; they ate everything that the hail had left, including all the fruit on the trees. Not a green thing was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Then the king hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now forgive my sin this one time and pray to the 
EXO.10.18	Moses left the king and prayed to the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.22	 Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and there was total darkness throughout Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	The Egyptians could not see each other, and no one left his house during that time. But the Israelites had light where they were living.
EXO.10.24	The king called Moses and said, “You may go and worship the 
EXO.10.25	Moses answered, “Then you would have to provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to the 
EXO.10.26	No, we will take our animals with us; not one will be left behind. We ourselves must select the animals with which to worship the 
EXO.10.27	The 
EXO.10.28	He said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Don't let me ever see you again! On the day I do, you will die!”
EXO.10.29	“You are right,” Moses answered. “You will never see me again.”
EXO.11.1	Then the 
EXO.11.2	Now speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry.” 
EXO.11.3	The 
EXO.11.4	Moses then said to the king, “The 
EXO.11.5	and every first-born son in Egypt will die, from the king's son, who is heir to the throne, to the son of the slave woman who grinds grain. The first-born of all the cattle will die also. 
EXO.11.6	There will be loud crying all over Egypt, such as there has never been before or ever will be again. 
EXO.11.7	But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites or their animals. Then you will know that I, the 
EXO.11.8	Moses concluded by saying, “All your officials will come to me and bow down before me, and they will beg me to take all my people and go away. After that, I will leave.” Then in great anger Moses left the king.
EXO.11.9	The 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before the king, but the 
EXO.12.2	“This month is to be the first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	Give these instructions to the whole community of Israel: On the tenth day of this month each man must choose either a lamb or a young goat for his household. 
EXO.12.4	If his family is too small to eat a whole animal, he and his next-door neighbor may share an animal, in proportion to the number of people and the amount that each person can eat. 
EXO.12.5	You may choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a one-year-old male without any defects. 
EXO.12.6	Then, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, the whole community of Israel will kill the animals. 
EXO.12.7	The people are to take some of the blood and put it on the doorposts and above the doors of the houses in which the animals are to be eaten. 
EXO.12.8	That night the meat is to be roasted, and eaten with bitter herbs and with bread made without yeast. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, but eat it roasted whole, including the head, the legs, and the internal organs. 
EXO.12.10	You must not leave any of it until morning; if any is left over, it must be burned. 
EXO.12.11	You are to eat it quickly, for you are to be dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. It is the Passover Festival to honor me, the 
EXO.12.12	“On that night I will go through the land of Egypt, killing every first-born male, both human and animal, and punishing all the gods of Egypt. I am the 
EXO.12.13	The blood on the doorposts will be a sign to mark the houses in which you live. When I see the blood, I will pass over you and will not harm you when I punish the Egyptians. 
EXO.12.14	 You must celebrate this day as a religious festival to remind you of what I, the 
EXO.12.15	The 
EXO.12.16	On the first day and again on the seventh day you are to meet for worship. No work is to be done on those days, but you may prepare food. 
EXO.12.17	Keep this festival, because it was on this day that I brought your tribes out of Egypt. For all time to come you must celebrate this day as a festival. 
EXO.12.18	From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month to the evening of the twenty-first day, you must not eat any bread made with yeast. 
EXO.12.19+EXO.12.20	For seven days no yeast must be found in your houses, for if anyone, native-born or foreign, eats bread made with yeast, he shall no longer be considered one of my people.”
EXO.12.21	Moses called for all the leaders of Israel and said to them, “Each of you is to choose a lamb or a young goat and kill it, so that your families can celebrate Passover. 
EXO.12.22	Take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the bowl containing
EXO.12.23	 When the 
EXO.12.24	You and your children must obey these rules forever. 
EXO.12.25	When you enter the land that the 
EXO.12.26	When your children ask you, ‘What does this ritual mean?’ 
EXO.12.27	you will answer, ‘It is the sacrifice of Passover to honor the 
EXO.12.27	The Israelites knelt down and worshiped. 
EXO.12.28	Then they went and did what the 
EXO.12.30	That night, the king, his officials, and all the other Egyptians were awakened. There was loud crying throughout Egypt, because there was not one home in which there was not a dead son. 
EXO.12.31	That same night the king sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “Get out, you and your Israelites! Leave my country; go and worship the 
EXO.12.32	Take your sheep, goats, and cattle, and leave. Also pray for a blessing on me.”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country; they said, “We will all be dead if you don't leave.” 
EXO.12.34	So the people filled their baking pans with unleavened dough, wrapped them in clothing, and carried them on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	 The Israelites had done as Moses had said, and had asked the Egyptians for gold and silver jewelry and for clothes. 
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	The Israelites set out on foot from Rameses for Sukkoth. There were about 600,000 men, not counting women and children. 
EXO.12.38	A large number of other people and many sheep, goats, and cattle also went with them. 
EXO.12.39	They baked unleavened bread from the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for they had been driven out of Egypt so suddenly that they did not have time to get their food ready or to prepare leavened dough.
EXO.12.41	On the day the 430 years ended, all the tribes of the 
EXO.12.42	It was a night when the 
EXO.12.43	The 
EXO.12.44	but any slave that you have bought may eat it if you circumcise him first. 
EXO.12.45	No temporary resident or hired worker may eat it. 
EXO.12.46	 The whole meal must be eaten in the house in which it was prepared; it must not be taken outside. And do not break any of the animal's bones. 
EXO.12.47	The whole community of Israel must celebrate this festival, 
EXO.12.48	but no uncircumcised man may eat it. If a foreigner has settled among you and wants to celebrate Passover to honor the 
EXO.12.49	The same regulations apply to native-born Israelites and to foreigners who settle among you.” 
EXO.12.50	All the Israelites obeyed and did what the 
EXO.12.51	On that day the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	 “Dedicate all the first-born males to me, for every first-born male Israelite and every first-born male animal belongs to me.”
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember this day—the day on which you left Egypt, the place where you were slaves. This is the day the 
EXO.13.4	You are leaving Egypt on this day in the first month, the month of Abib. 
EXO.13.5	The 
EXO.13.6	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to honor the 
EXO.13.7	For seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast; there must be no yeast or leavened bread anywhere in your land. 
EXO.13.8	When the festival begins, explain to your sons that you do all this because of what the 
EXO.13.9	This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on your hand or on your forehead; it will remind you to continue to recite and study the Law of the 
EXO.13.10	Celebrate this festival at the appointed time each year.
EXO.13.11	“The 
EXO.13.12	 you must offer every first-born male to the 
EXO.13.13	but you must buy back from him every first-born male donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not want to buy back the donkey, break its neck. You must buy back every first-born male child of yours. 
EXO.13.14	In the future, when your son asks what this observance means, you will answer him, ‘By using great power the 
EXO.13.15	When the king of Egypt was stubborn and refused to let us go, the 
EXO.13.16	This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on our hands or on our foreheads; it will remind us that the 
EXO.13.17	When the king of Egypt let the people go, God did not take them by the road that goes up the coast to Philistia, although it was the shortest way. God thought, “I do not want the people to change their minds and return to Egypt when they see that they are going to have to fight.” 
EXO.13.18	Instead, he led them in a roundabout way through the desert toward the Red Sea.
EXO.13.20	The Israelites left Sukkoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	During the day the 
EXO.13.22	 The pillar of cloud was always in front of the people during the day, and the pillar of fire at night.
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	“Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, near Baal Zephon. 
EXO.14.3	The king will think that the Israelites are wandering around in the country and are closed in by the desert. 
EXO.14.4	I will make him stubborn, and he will pursue you, and my victory over the king and his army will bring me honor. Then the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites escape, and we have lost them as our slaves!” 
EXO.14.6	The king got his war chariot and his army ready. 
EXO.14.7	He set out with all his chariots, including the six hundred finest, commanded by their officers. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptian army, with all the horses, chariots, and drivers, pursued them and caught up with them where they were camped by the Red Sea near Pi Hahiroth and Baal Zephon.
EXO.14.10	When the Israelites saw the king and his army marching against them, they were terrified and cried out to the 
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses, “Weren't there any graves in Egypt? Did you have to bring us out here in the desert to die? Look what you have done by bringing us out of Egypt! 
EXO.14.12	Didn't we tell you before we left that this would happen? We told you to leave us alone and let us go on being slaves of the Egyptians. It would be better to be slaves there than to die here in the desert.”
EXO.14.13	Moses answered, “Don't be afraid! Stand your ground, and you will see what the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	The 
EXO.14.16	Lift up your walking stick and hold it out over the sea. The water will divide, and the Israelites will be able to walk through the sea on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go in after them, and I will gain honor by my victory over the king, his army, his chariots, and his drivers. 
EXO.14.18	When I defeat them, the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	The angel of God, who had been in front of the army of Israel, moved and went to the rear. The pillar of cloud also moved until it was 
EXO.14.20	between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud made it dark for the Egyptians, but gave light to the people of Israel,
EXO.14.21	Moses held out his hand over the sea, and the 
EXO.14.22	 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides. 
EXO.14.23	The Egyptians pursued them and went after them into the sea with all their horses, chariots, and drivers. 
EXO.14.24	Just before dawn the 
EXO.14.25	He made the wheels of their chariots get stuck, so that they moved with great difficulty. The Egyptians said, “The

EXO.14.27	So Moses held out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the water returned to its normal level. The Egyptians tried to escape from the water, but the 
EXO.14.28	The water returned and covered the chariots, the drivers, and all the Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea; not one of them was left. 
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides.
EXO.14.30	On that day the 
EXO.14.31	When the Israelites saw the great power with which the 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the

EXO.15.2	he is the one who has saved me.
EXO.15.2	He is my God, and I will praise him,

EXO.15.3	the 
EXO.15.4	“He threw Egypt's army and its chariots into the sea;
EXO.15.4	the best of its officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep sea covered them;
EXO.15.5	they sank to the bottom like a stone.
EXO.15.6	“Your right hand, 
EXO.15.6	it breaks the enemy in pieces.
EXO.15.7	In majestic triumph you overthrow your foes;
EXO.15.7	your anger blazes out and burns them up like straw.
EXO.15.8	You blew on the sea and the water piled up high;
EXO.15.8	it stood up straight like a wall;
EXO.15.8	the deepest part of the sea became solid.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue them and catch them;
EXO.15.9	I will divide their wealth and take all I want;
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword and take all they have.’
EXO.15.10	But one breath from you, 
EXO.15.10	they sank like lead in the terrible water.
EXO.15.11	“
EXO.15.11	Who is like you, wonderful in holiness?
EXO.15.11	Who can work miracles and mighty acts like yours?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out your right hand,
EXO.15.12	and the earth swallowed our enemies.
EXO.15.13	Faithful to your promise, you led the people you had rescued;
EXO.15.13	by your strength you guided them to your sacred land.
EXO.15.14	The nations have heard, and they tremble with fear;
EXO.15.14	the Philistines are seized with terror.
EXO.15.15	The leaders of Edom are terrified;
EXO.15.15	Moab's mighty men are trembling;
EXO.15.15	the people of Canaan lose their courage.
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread fall upon them.
EXO.15.16	They see your strength, O 
EXO.15.16	and stand helpless with fear
EXO.15.16	until your people have marched past—
EXO.15.16	the people you set free from slavery.
EXO.15.17	You bring them in and plant them on your mountain,
EXO.15.17	the place that you, 
EXO.15.17	the Temple that you yourself have built.
EXO.15.18	You, 
EXO.15.19	The Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. But when the Egyptian chariots with their horses and drivers went into the sea, the 
EXO.15.20	The prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, took her tambourine, and all the women followed her, playing tambourines and dancing. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam sang for them:
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they walked through the desert, but found no water. 
EXO.15.23	Then they came to a place called Marah, but the water there was so bitter that they could not drink it. That is why it was named Marah.
EXO.15.24	The people complained to Moses and asked, “What are we going to drink?” 
EXO.15.25	 Moses prayed earnestly to the 
EXO.15.25	There the 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you will obey me completely by doing what I consider right and by keeping my commands, I will not punish you with any of the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians. I am the 
EXO.15.27	Next they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees; there they camped by the water.
EXO.16.1	The whole Israelite community set out from Elim, and on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt, they came to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. 
EXO.16.2	There in the desert they all complained to Moses and Aaron 
EXO.16.3	and said to them, “We wish that the 
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day they are to bring in twice as much as usual and prepare it.”
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the 
EXO.16.7	In the morning you will see the dazzling light of the 
EXO.16.8	Then Moses said, “It is the 
EXO.16.9	Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community to come and stand before the 
EXO.16.10	As Aaron spoke to the whole community, they turned toward the desert, and suddenly the dazzling light of the 
EXO.16.11	The 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them that at twilight they will have meat to eat, and in the morning they will have all the bread they want. Then they will know that I, the 
EXO.16.13	In the evening a large flock of quails flew in, enough to cover the camp, and in the morning there was dew all around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the dew evaporated, there was something thin and flaky on the surface of the desert. It was as delicate as frost. 
EXO.16.15	 When the Israelites saw it, they didn't know what it was and asked each other, “What is it?”
EXO.16.15	Moses said to them, “This is the food that the 
EXO.16.16	The 
EXO.16.17	The Israelites did this, some gathering more, others less. 
EXO.16.18	 When they measured it, those who gathered much did not have too much, and those who gathered less did not have too little. Each had gathered just what he needed. 
EXO.16.19	Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it for tomorrow.” 
EXO.16.20	But some of them did not listen to Moses and saved part of it. The next morning it was full of worms and smelled rotten, and Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	Every morning each one gathered as much as he needed; and when the sun grew hot, what was left on the ground melted.
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts for each person. All the leaders of the community came and told Moses about it, 
EXO.16.23	 and he said to them, “The 
EXO.16.24	As Moses had commanded, they kept what was left until the next day; it did not spoil or get worms in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said, “Eat this today, because today is the Sabbath, a day of rest dedicated to the 
EXO.16.26	You must gather food for six days, but on the seventh day, the day of rest, there will be none.”
EXO.16.27	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather food, but they did not find any. 
EXO.16.28	Then the 
EXO.16.29	Remember that I, the 
EXO.16.30	So the people did no work on the seventh day.
EXO.16.32	Moses said, “The 
EXO.16.33	 Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, put two quarts of manna in it, and place it in the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	 The Israelites ate manna for the next forty years, until they reached the land of Canaan, where they settled. ( 
EXO.16.36	The standard dry measure then in use equaled twenty quarts.)
EXO.17.2	They complained to Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.”
EXO.17.2	Moses answered, “Why are you complaining? Why are you putting the 
EXO.17.3	But the people were very thirsty and continued to complain to Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? To kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”
EXO.17.4	Moses prayed earnestly to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	I will stand before you on a rock at Mount Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” Moses did so in the presence of the leaders of Israel.
EXO.17.7	The place was named Massah and Meribah,
EXO.17.8	The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua, “Pick out some men to go and fight the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on top of the hill holding the stick that God told me to carry.” 
EXO.17.10	Joshua did as Moses commanded him and went out to fight the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	As long as Moses held up his arms, the Israelites won, but when he put his arms down, the Amalekites started winning. 
EXO.17.12	When Moses' arms grew tired, Aaron and Hur brought a stone for him to sit on, while they stood beside him and held up his arms, holding them steady until the sun went down. 
EXO.17.13	In this way Joshua totally defeated the Amalekites.
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar and named it “The 
EXO.17.16	He said, “Hold high the banner of the 
EXO.18.1	Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and the people of Israel when he led them out of Egypt. 
EXO.18.2	 So he came to Moses, bringing with him Moses' wife Zipporah, who had been left behind, 
EXO.18.3	 and Gershom and Eliezer, her two sons. (Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a strange land”; so he had named one son Gershom.
EXO.18.4	He had also said, “The God of my father helped me and saved me from being killed by the king of Egypt”; so he had named the other son Eliezer.
EXO.18.5	Jethro came with Moses' wife and her two sons into the desert where Moses was camped at the holy mountain. 
EXO.18.6	He had sent word to Moses that they were coming, 
EXO.18.7	so Moses went out to meet him, bowed before him, and kissed him. They asked about each other's health and then went into Moses' tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told Jethro everything that the 
EXO.18.9	When Jethro heard all this, he was happy 
EXO.18.10	and said, “Praise the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro brought an offering to be burned whole and other sacrifices to be offered to God; and Aaron and all the leaders of Israel went with him to eat the sacred meal as an act of worship.
EXO.18.13	The next day Moses was settling disputes among the people, and he was kept busy from morning till night. 
EXO.18.14	When Jethro saw everything that Moses had to do, he asked, “What is all this that you are doing for the people? Why are you doing this all alone, with people standing here from morning till night to consult you?”
EXO.18.15	Moses answered, “I must do this because the people come to me to learn God's will. 
EXO.18.16	When two people have a dispute, they come to me, and I decide which one of them is right, and I tell them God's commands and laws.”
EXO.18.17	Then Jethro said, “You are not doing this right. 
EXO.18.18	You will wear yourself out and these people as well. This is too much for you to do alone. 
EXO.18.19	Now let me give you some good advice, and God will be with you. It is right for you to represent the people before God and bring their disputes to him. 
EXO.18.20	You should teach them God's commands and explain to them how they should live and what they should do. 
EXO.18.21	But in addition, you should choose some capable men and appoint them as leaders of the people: leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. They must be God-fearing men who can be trusted and who cannot be bribed. 
EXO.18.22	Let them serve as judges for the people on a permanent basis. They can bring all the difficult cases to you, but they themselves can decide all the smaller disputes. That will make it easier for you, as they share your burden. 
EXO.18.23	If you do this, as God commands, you will not wear yourself out, and all these people can go home with their disputes settled.”
EXO.18.24	Moses took Jethro's advice 
EXO.18.25	and chose capable men from among all the Israelites. He appointed them as leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
EXO.18.26	They served as judges for the people on a permanent basis, bringing the difficult cases to Moses but deciding the smaller disputes themselves.
EXO.18.27	Then Moses said good-bye to Jethro, and Jethro went back home.
EXO.19.1+EXO.19.2	The people of Israel left Rephidim, and on the first day of the third month after they had left Egypt they came to the desert of Sinai. There they set up camp at the foot of Mount Sinai, 
EXO.19.3	and Moses went up the mountain to meet with God.
EXO.19.3	The 
EXO.19.4	“You saw what I, the 
EXO.19.6	 a people dedicated to me alone, and you will serve me as priests.” 
EXO.19.7	So Moses went down and called the leaders of the people together and told them everything that the 
EXO.19.8	Then all the people answered together, “We will do everything that the 
EXO.19.9	The 
EXO.19.9	Moses told the 
EXO.19.10	and the 
EXO.19.11	and be ready the day after tomorrow. On that day I will come down on Mount Sinai, where all the people can see me. 
EXO.19.12	 Mark a boundary around the mountain that the people must not cross, and tell them not to go up the mountain or even get near it. If any of you set foot on it, you are to be put to death; 
EXO.19.13	you must either be stoned or shot with arrows, without anyone touching you. This applies to both people and animals; they must be put to death. But when the trumpet is blown, then the people are to go up to the mountain.”
EXO.19.14	Then Moses came down the mountain and told the people to get ready for worship. So they washed their clothes, 
EXO.19.15	and Moses told them, “Be ready by the day after tomorrow and don't have sexual intercourse in the meantime.”
EXO.19.17	Moses led them out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	All of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	The sound of the trumpet became louder and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him with thunder. 
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	and the 
EXO.19.22	Even the priests who come near me must purify themselves, or I will punish them.”
EXO.19.23	Moses said to the 
EXO.19.24	The 
EXO.19.25	Moses then went down to the people and told them what the 
EXO.20.1	God spoke, and these were his words: 
EXO.20.2	“I am the 
EXO.20.3	“Worship no god but me.
EXO.20.5	 Do not bow down to any idol or worship it, because I am the 
EXO.20.6	But I show my love to thousands of generations
EXO.20.9	 You have six days in which to do your work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to me. On that day no one is to work—neither you, your children, your slaves, your animals, nor the foreigners who live in your country. 
EXO.20.11	 In six days I, the 
EXO.20.19	They said to Moses, “If you speak to us, we will listen; but we are afraid that if God speaks to us, we will die.”
EXO.20.20	Moses replied, “Don't be afraid; God has only come to test you and make you keep on obeying him, so that you will not sin.” 
EXO.20.21	But the people continued to stand a long way off, and only Moses went near the dark cloud where God was.
EXO.20.22	The 
EXO.20.23	Do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gold to be worshiped in addition to me. 
EXO.20.24	Make an altar of earth for me, and on it sacrifice your sheep and your cattle as offerings to be completely burned and as fellowship offerings. In every place that I set aside for you to worship me, I will come to you and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	 If you make an altar of stone for me, do not build it out of cut stones, because when you use a chisel on stones, you make them unfit for my use. 
EXO.20.26	Do not build an altar for me with steps leading up to it; if you do, you will expose yourselves as you go up the steps.
EXO.21.1	“Give the Israelites the following laws: 
EXO.21.2	 If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve you for six years. In the seventh year he is to be set free without having to pay anything. 
EXO.21.3	If he was unmarried when he became your slave, he is not to take a wife with him when he leaves; but if he was married when he became your slave, he may take his wife with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, the woman and her children belong to the master, and the man is to leave by himself. 
EXO.21.5	But if the slave declares that he loves his master, his wife, and his children and does not want to be set free, 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall take him to the place of worship. There he is to make him stand against the door or the doorpost and put a hole through his ear. Then he will be his slave for life.
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to be set free, as male slaves are. 
EXO.21.8	If she is sold to someone who intends to make her his wife, but he doesn't like her, then she is to be sold back to her father; her master cannot sell her to foreigners, because he has treated her unfairly. 
EXO.21.9	If a man buys a female slave to give to his son, he is to treat her like a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If a man takes a second wife, he must continue to give his first wife the same amount of food and clothing and the same rights that she had before. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not fulfill these duties to her, he must set her free and not receive any payment.
EXO.21.13	 But if it was an accident and he did not mean to kill him, he can escape to a place which I will choose for you, and there he will be safe. 
EXO.21.14	But when someone gets angry and deliberately kills someone else, he is to be put to death, even if he has run to my altar for safety.
EXO.21.15	“Whoever hits his father or his mother is to be put to death.
EXO.21.18+EXO.21.19	“If there is a fight and someone hits someone else with a stone or with his fist, but does not kill him, he is not to be punished. If the one who was hit has to stay in bed, but later is able to get up and walk outside with the help of a cane, the one who hit him is to pay for his lost time and take care of him until he gets well.
EXO.21.20	“If a slave owner takes a stick and beats his slave, whether male or female, and the slave dies on the spot, the owner is to be punished. 
EXO.21.21	But if the slave does not die for a day or two, the master is not to be punished. The loss of his property is punishment enough.
EXO.21.22	“If some men are fighting and hurt a pregnant woman so that she loses her child, but she is not injured in any other way, the one who hurt her is to be fined whatever amount the woman's husband demands, subject to the approval of the judges. 
EXO.21.23	But if the woman herself is injured, the punishment shall be life for life, 
EXO.21.24	 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
EXO.21.26	“If someone hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he is to free the slave as payment for the eye. 
EXO.21.27	If he knocks out a tooth, he is to free the slave as payment for the tooth.
EXO.21.28	“If a bull gores someone to death, it is to be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but its owner is not to be punished. 
EXO.21.29	But if the bull had been in the habit of attacking people and its owner had been warned, but did not keep it penned up—then if it gores someone to death, it is to be stoned, and its owner is to be put to death also. 
EXO.21.30	However, if the owner is allowed to pay a fine to save his life, he must pay the full amount required. 
EXO.21.31	If the bull kills a boy or a girl, the same rule applies. 
EXO.21.32	If the bull kills a male or female slave, its owner shall pay the owner of the slave thirty pieces of silver, and the bull shall be stoned to death.
EXO.21.33	“If someone takes the cover off a pit or if he digs one and does not cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it, 
EXO.21.34	he must pay for the animal. He is to pay the money to the owner and may keep the dead animal. 
EXO.21.35	If someone's bull kills someone else's bull, the two of them shall sell the live bull and divide the money; they shall also divide up the meat from the dead animal. 
EXO.21.36	But if it was known that the bull had been in the habit of attacking and its owner did not keep it penned up, he must make good the loss by giving the other man a live bull, but he may keep the dead animal.
EXO.22.1	“If someone steals a cow or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must pay five cows for one cow and four sheep for one sheep. 
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	He must pay for what he stole. If he owns nothing, he shall be sold as a slave to pay for what he has stolen. If the stolen animal, whether a cow, a donkey, or a sheep, is found alive in his possession, he shall pay two for one.
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	“If a thief is caught breaking into a house at night and is killed, the one who killed him is not guilty of murder. But if it happens during the day, he is guilty of murder.
EXO.22.5	“If someone lets his animals graze in a field or a vineyard and they stray away and eat up the crops
EXO.22.6	“If someone starts a fire in his own field and it spreads through the weeds to someone else's field and burns up grain that is growing or that has been cut and stacked, the one who started the fire is to pay for the damage.
EXO.22.7	“If anyone agrees to keep someone else's money or other valuables for him and they are stolen from his house, the thief, if found, shall repay double. 
EXO.22.8	But if the thief is not found, the one who was keeping the valuables is to be brought to the place of worship and there he must take an oath that he has not stolen the other one's property.
EXO.22.9	“In every case of a dispute about property, whether it involves cattle, donkeys, sheep, clothing, or any other lost object, the two people claiming the property shall be taken to the place of worship. The one whom God declares to be guilty shall pay double to the other one.
EXO.22.10	“If anyone agrees to keep someone else's donkey, cow, sheep, or other animal for him, and the animal dies or is injured or is carried off in a raid, and if there was no witness, 
EXO.22.11	the man must go to the place of worship and take an oath that he has not stolen the other man's animal. If the animal was not stolen, the owner shall accept the loss, and the other man need not repay him; 
EXO.22.12	but if the animal was stolen, the man must repay the owner. 
EXO.22.13	If it was killed by wild animals, the man is to bring the remains as evidence; he need not pay for what has been killed by wild animals.
EXO.22.14	“If anyone borrows an animal from someone else and it is injured or dies when its owner is not present, he must pay for it. 
EXO.22.15	But if that happens when the owner is present, he need not repay. If it is a rented animal, the loss is covered by the rental price.
EXO.22.17	But if her father refuses to let him marry her, he must pay the father a sum of money equal to the bride price for a virgin.
EXO.22.22	Do not mistreat any widow or orphan. 
EXO.22.23	If you do, I, the 
EXO.22.24	and I will become angry and kill you in war. Your wives will become widows, and your children will be fatherless.
EXO.22.26	 If you take someone's cloak as a pledge that he will pay you, you must give it back to him before the sun sets, 
EXO.22.27	because it is the only covering he has to keep him warm. What else can he sleep in? When he cries out to me for help, I will answer him because I am merciful.
EXO.22.29	“Give me the offerings from your grain, your wine, and your olive oil when they are due.
EXO.22.29	“Give me your first-born sons. 
EXO.22.30	Give me the first-born of your cattle and your sheep. Let the first-born male stay with its mother for seven days, and on the eighth day offer it to me.
EXO.23.2	Do not follow the majority when they do wrong or when they give testimony that perverts justice. 
EXO.23.3	 Do not show partiality to a poor person at his trial.
EXO.23.5	If his donkey has fallen under its load, help him get the donkey to its feet again; don't just walk off.
EXO.23.7	Do not make false accusations, and do not put an innocent person to death, for I will condemn anyone who does such an evil thing. 
EXO.23.8	Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe makes people blind to what is right and ruins the cause of those who are innocent.
EXO.23.11	But in the seventh year let it rest, and do not harvest anything that grows on it. The poor may eat what grows there, and the wild animals can have what is left. Do the same with your vineyards and your olive trees.
EXO.23.13	“Listen to everything that I, the 
EXO.23.14	“Celebrate three festivals a year to honor me. 
EXO.23.15	 In the month of Abib, the month in which you left Egypt, celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the way that I commanded you. Do not eat any bread made with yeast during the seven days of this festival. Never come to worship me without bringing an offering.
EXO.23.16	“Celebrate the Festival of Shelters in the autumn, when you gather the fruit from your vineyards and orchards. 
EXO.23.17	Every year at these three festivals all your men must come to worship me, the Lord your God.
EXO.23.18	“Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. The fat of animals sacrificed to me during these festivals is not to be left until the following morning.
EXO.23.19	“Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk.
EXO.23.20	“I will send an angel ahead of you to protect you as you travel and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. 
EXO.23.21	Pay attention to him and obey him. Do not rebel against him, for I have sent him, and he will not pardon such rebellion. 
EXO.23.22	But if you obey him and do everything I command, I will fight against all your enemies. 
EXO.23.23	My angel will go ahead of you and take you into the land of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I will destroy them. 
EXO.23.24	Do not bow down to their gods or worship them, and do not adopt their religious practices. Destroy their gods and break down their sacred stone pillars. 
EXO.23.25	If you worship me, the 
EXO.23.26	In your land no woman will have a miscarriage or be without children. I will give you long lives.
EXO.23.27	“I will make the people who oppose you afraid of me; I will bring confusion among the people against whom you fight, and I will make all your enemies turn and run from you. 
EXO.23.28	I will throw your enemies into panic;
EXO.23.29	I will not drive them out within a year's time; if I did, the land would become deserted, and the wild animals would be too many for you. 
EXO.23.30	Instead, I will drive them out little by little, until there are enough of you to take possession of the land. 
EXO.23.31	I will make the borders of your land extend from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterranean Sea and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give you power over the inhabitants of the land, and you will drive them out as you advance. 
EXO.23.32	Do not make any agreement with them or with their gods. 
EXO.23.33	Do not let those people live in your country; if you do, they will make you sin against me. If you worship their gods, it will be a fatal trap for you.”
EXO.24.1	The 
EXO.24.2	You alone, and none of the others, are to come near me. The people are not even to come up the mountain.”
EXO.24.3	Moses went and told the people all the

EXO.24.5	Then he sent young men, and they burned sacrifices to the 
EXO.24.6	Moses took half of the blood of the animals and put it in bowls; and the other half he threw against the altar.

EXO.31.11	the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place. In making all these things, they are to do exactly as I have commanded you.”
EXO.31.12	The 
EXO.31.13	to tell the people of Israel, “Keep the Sabbath, my day of rest, because it is a sign between you and me for all time to come, to show that I, the 
EXO.31.14	You must keep the day of rest, because it is sacred. Whoever does not keep it, but works on that day, is to be put to death. 
EXO.31.15	 You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is a solemn day of rest dedicated to me. Whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death. 
EXO.31.16	The people of Israel are to keep this day as a sign of the covenant. 
EXO.31.17	 It is a permanent sign between the people of Israel and me, because I, the 
EXO.31.18	When God had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets on which God himself had written the commandments.
EXO.32.2	Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold earrings which your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” 
EXO.32.3	So all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	 He took the earrings, melted them, poured the gold into a mold, and made a gold bull-calf.
EXO.32.4	The people said, “Israel, this is our god, who led us out of Egypt!”
EXO.32.5	Then Aaron built an altar in front of the gold bull-calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to honor the 
EXO.32.6	 Early the next morning they brought some animals to burn as sacrifices and others to eat as fellowship offerings. The people sat down to a feast, which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex.
EXO.32.7	The 
EXO.32.8	They have already left the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made a bull-calf out of melted gold and have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it. They are saying that this is their god, who led them out of Egypt. 
EXO.32.9	I know how stubborn these people are. 
EXO.32.10	Now, don't try to stop me. I am angry with them, and I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you and your descendants into a great nation.”
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians be able to say that you led your people out of Egypt, planning to kill them in the mountains and destroy them completely? Stop being angry; change your mind and do not bring this disaster on your people. 
EXO.32.13	 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Remember the solemn promise you made to them to give them as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and to give their descendants all that land you promised would be their possession forever.” 
EXO.32.14	So the 
EXO.32.15	Moses went back down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets with the commandments written on both sides. 
EXO.32.16	God himself had made the tablets and had engraved the commandments on them.
EXO.32.17	Joshua heard the people shouting and said to Moses, “I hear the sound of battle in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	Moses said, “That doesn't sound like a shout of victory or a cry of defeat; it's the sound of singing.”
EXO.32.19	When Moses came close enough to the camp to see the bull-calf and to see the people dancing, he became furious. There at the foot of the mountain, he threw down the tablets he was carrying and broke them. 
EXO.32.20	He took the bull-calf which they had made, melted it, ground it into fine powder, and mixed it with water. Then he made the people of Israel drink it. 
EXO.32.21	He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have made them commit such a terrible sin?”
EXO.32.22	Aaron answered, “Don't be angry with me; you know how determined these people are to do evil. 
EXO.32.23	They said to me, ‘We don't know what has happened to this man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt; so make us a god to lead us.’ 
EXO.32.24	I asked them to bring me their gold ornaments, and those who had any took them off and gave them to me. I threw the ornaments into the fire and out came this bull-calf!”
EXO.32.25	Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control and make fools of themselves in front of their enemies. 
EXO.32.26	So he stood at the gate of the camp and shouted, “Everyone who is on the 
EXO.32.27	and he said to them, “The 
EXO.32.28	The Levites obeyed, and killed about three thousand men that day. 
EXO.32.29	Moses said to the Levites, “Today you have consecrated yourselves
EXO.32.30	The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin. But now I will again go up the mountain to the 
EXO.32.31	Moses then returned to the 
EXO.32.32	 Please forgive their sin; but if you won't, then remove my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people.”
EXO.32.33	The 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Remember that my angel will guide you, but the time is coming when I will punish these people for their sin.”
EXO.32.35	So the 
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel to guide you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	You are going to a rich and fertile land. But I will not go with you myself, because you are a stubborn people, and I might destroy you on the way.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard this, they began to mourn and did not wear jewelry any more. 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	So after they left Mount Sinai, the people of Israel no longer wore jewelry.
EXO.33.7	Whenever the people of Israel set up camp, Moses would take the sacred Tent and put it up some distance outside the camp. It was called the Tent of the 
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out there, the people would stand at the door of their tents and watch Moses until he entered it. 
EXO.33.9	After Moses had gone in, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the door of the Tent, and the 
EXO.33.10	As soon as the people saw the pillar of cloud at the door of the Tent, they would bow down. 
EXO.33.11	The 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	Now if you are, tell me your plans, so that I may serve you and continue to please you. Remember also that you have chosen this nation to be your own.”
EXO.33.14	The 
EXO.33.15	Moses replied, “If you do not go with us, don't make us leave this place. 
EXO.33.16	How will anyone know that you are pleased with your people and with me if you do not go with us? Your presence with us will distinguish us from any other people on earth.”
EXO.33.17	The 
EXO.33.18	Then Moses requested, “Please, let me see the dazzling light of your presence.”
EXO.33.20	I will not let you see my face, because no one can see me and stay alive, 
EXO.33.21	but here is a place beside me where you can stand on a rock. 
EXO.33.22	When the dazzling light of my presence passes by, I will put you in an opening in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back but not my face.”
EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	Get ready tomorrow morning, and come up Mount Sinai to meet me there at the top. 
EXO.34.3	No one is to come up with you; no one is to be seen on any part of the mountain; and no sheep or cattle are to graze at the foot of the mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two more stone tablets, and early the next morning he carried them up Mount Sinai, just as the 
EXO.34.5	The 
EXO.34.6	 The 
EXO.34.7	I keep my promise for thousands of generations
EXO.34.8	Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	He said, “Lord, if you really are pleased with me, I ask you to go with us. These people are stubborn, but forgive our evil and our sin, and accept us as your own people.”
EXO.34.10	The 
EXO.34.11	Obey the laws that I am giving you today. I will drive out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as you advance. 
EXO.34.12	Do not make any treaties with the people of the country into which you are going, because this could be a fatal trap for you. 
EXO.34.13	 Instead, tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down their symbols of the goddess Asherah.
EXO.34.14	“Do not worship any other god, because I, the 
EXO.34.15	Do not make any treaties with the people of the country, because when they worship their pagan gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you to join them, and you will be tempted to eat the food they offer to their gods. 
EXO.34.16	Your sons might marry those foreign women, who would lead them to be unfaithful to me and to worship their pagan gods.
EXO.34.20	 but you are to buy back every first-born donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not buy it back, break its neck. Buy back every first-born son.
EXO.34.20	“No one is to appear before me without an offering.
EXO.34.23	“Three times a year all of your men must come to worship me, the 
EXO.34.24	After I have driven out the nations before you and extended your territory, no one will try to conquer your country during the three festivals.
EXO.34.26	“Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk.”
EXO.34.27	The 
EXO.34.28	Moses stayed there with the 
EXO.34.30	Aaron and all the people looked at Moses and saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him. 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community went to him, and Moses spoke with them. 
EXO.34.32	After that, all the people of Israel gathered around him, and Moses gave them all the laws that the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil. 
EXO.34.34	Whenever Moses went into the Tent of the 
EXO.34.35	and they would see that his face was shining. Then he would put the veil back on until the next time he went to speak with the 
EXO.35.1	Moses called together the whole community of the people of Israel and said to them, “This is what the 
EXO.35.2	 You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is to be sacred, a solemn day of rest dedicated to me, the 
EXO.35.3	Do not even light a fire in your homes on the Sabbath.”
EXO.35.4	Moses said to all the people of Israel, “This is what the 
EXO.35.5	Make an offering to the 
EXO.35.6	fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; cloth made of goats' hair; 
EXO.35.7	rams' skin dyed red; fine leather; acacia wood; 
EXO.35.8	oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense; 
EXO.35.9	carnelians and other jewels to be set in the High Priest's ephod and in his breastpiece.
EXO.35.10	“All the skilled workers among you are to come and make everything that the 
EXO.35.11	the Tent, its covering and its outer covering, its hooks and its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases; 
EXO.35.12	the Covenant Box, its poles, its lid, and the curtain to screen it off; 
EXO.35.13	the table, its poles, and all its equipment; the bread offered to God; 
EXO.35.14	the lampstand for the light and its equipment; the lamps with their oil; 
EXO.35.15	the altar for burning incense and its poles; the anointing oil; the sweet-smelling incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent; 
EXO.35.16	the altar on which to burn offerings, with its bronze grating attached, its poles, and all its equipment; the washbasin and its base; 
EXO.35.17	the curtains for the enclosure, its posts and bases; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure; 
EXO.35.18	the Tent pegs and ropes for the Tent and the enclosure; 
EXO.35.19	and the magnificent garments the priests are to wear when they serve in the Holy Place—the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons.”
EXO.35.20	All the people of Israel left, 
EXO.35.21	and everyone who wished to do so brought an offering to the 
EXO.35.22	All who wanted to, both men and women, brought decorative pins, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry and dedicated them to the 
EXO.35.23	Everyone who had fine linen; blue, purple, or red wool; cloth of goats' hair; rams' skin dyed red; or fine leather, brought it. 
EXO.35.24	All who were able to contribute silver or bronze brought their offering for the 
EXO.35.25	All the skilled women brought fine linen thread and thread of blue, purple, and red wool, which they had made. 
EXO.35.26	They also made thread of goats' hair. 
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought carnelians and other jewels to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece 
EXO.35.28	and spices and oil for the lamps, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet-smelling incense. 
EXO.35.29	All the people of Israel who wanted to brought their offering to the 
EXO.35.30	Moses said to the Israelites, “The 
EXO.35.31	God has filled him with his power
EXO.35.32	for planning skillful designs and working them in gold, silver, and bronze; 
EXO.35.33	for cutting jewels to be set; for carving wood; and for every other kind of artistic work. 
EXO.35.34	The 
EXO.35.35	He has given them skill in all kinds of work done by engravers, designers, and weavers of fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; and other cloth. They are able to do all kinds of work and are skillful designers.
EXO.36.1	“Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other workers to whom the 
EXO.36.2	Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other skilled men to whom the 
EXO.36.3	They received from him all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for constructing the sacred Tent. But the people of Israel continued to bring Moses their offerings every morning. 
EXO.36.4	Then the skilled men who were doing the work went 
EXO.36.5	and told Moses, “The people are bringing more than is needed for the work which the 
EXO.36.6	So Moses sent a command throughout the camp that no one was to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent; so the people did not bring any more. 
EXO.36.7	What had already been brought was more than enough to finish all the work.
EXO.36.8	The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of the 
EXO.36.9	Each piece was the same size, 14 yards long and 2 yards wide. 
EXO.36.10	They sewed five of them together in one set and did the same with the other five. 
EXO.36.11	They made loops of blue cloth on the edge of the outside piece in each set. 
EXO.36.12	They put fifty loops on the first piece of the first set and fifty loops matching them on the last piece of the second set. 
EXO.36.13	They made fifty gold hooks, with which to join the two sets into one piece.
EXO.36.14	Then they made a cover for the Tent out of eleven pieces of cloth made of goats' hair. 
EXO.36.15	They made them all the same size, 15 yards long and 2 yards wide. 
EXO.36.16	They sewed five of them together in one set and the other six in another set. 
EXO.36.17	They put fifty loops on the edge of the last piece of one set and fifty loops on the edge of the other set. 
EXO.36.18	They made fifty bronze hooks to join the two sets, so as to form one cover. 
EXO.36.19	They made two more coverings, one of rams' skin dyed red and the other of fine leather, to serve as an outer cover.
EXO.36.20	They made upright frames of acacia wood for the Tent. 
EXO.36.21	Each frame was 15 feet tall and 27 inches wide, 
EXO.36.22	with two matching projections, so that the frames could be joined together. All the frames had these projections. 
EXO.36.23	They made twenty frames for the south side 
EXO.36.24	and forty silver bases to go under them, two bases under each frame to hold its two projections. 
EXO.36.25	They made twenty frames for the north side of the Tent 
EXO.36.26	and forty silver bases, two under each frame. 
EXO.36.27	For the back of the Tent, on the west, they made six frames 
EXO.36.28	and two frames for the corners. 
EXO.36.29	These corner frames were joined at the bottom and connected all the way to the top. The two frames that formed the two corners were made in this way. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases, two under each frame.
EXO.36.31	They made fifteen crossbars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of the Tent, 
EXO.36.32	five for the frames on the other side, and five for the frames on the west end, at the back. 
EXO.36.33	The middle crossbar, set halfway up the frames, extended from one end of the Tent to the other. 
EXO.36.34	They covered the frames with gold and fitted them with gold rings to hold the crossbars, which were also covered with gold.
EXO.36.35	They made a curtain of fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered it with figures of winged creatures. 
EXO.36.36	They made four posts of acacia wood to hold the curtain, covered them with gold, and fitted them with gold hooks. Then they made four silver bases to hold the posts. 
EXO.36.37	For the entrance of the Tent they made a curtain of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and decorated with embroidery. 
EXO.36.38	For this curtain they made five posts fitted with hooks, covered their tops and their rods with gold, and made five bronze bases for the posts.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel made the Covenant Box out of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
EXO.37.2	He covered it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold border all around it. 
EXO.37.3	He made four carrying rings of gold for it and attached them to its four feet, with two rings on each side. 
EXO.37.4	He made carrying poles of acacia wood, covered them with gold, 
EXO.37.5	and put them through the rings on each side of the Box. 
EXO.37.6	He made a lid of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. 
EXO.37.7	He made two winged creatures of hammered gold, 
EXO.37.8	one for each end of the lid. He made them so that they formed one piece with the lid. 
EXO.37.9	The winged creatures faced each other across the lid, and their outspread wings covered it.
EXO.37.10	He made the table out of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
EXO.37.11	He covered it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 
EXO.37.12	He made a rim 3 inches wide around it and put a gold border around the rim. 
EXO.37.13	He made four carrying rings of gold for it and put them at the four corners, where the legs were. 
EXO.37.14	The rings to hold the poles for carrying the table were placed near the rim. 
EXO.37.15	He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold. 
EXO.37.16	He made the dishes of pure gold for the table: the plates, the cups, the jars, and the bowls to be used for the wine offering.
EXO.37.17	He made the lampstand of pure gold. He made its base and its shaft of hammered gold; its decorative flowers, including buds and petals, formed one piece with it. 
EXO.37.18	Six branches extended from its sides, three from each side. 
EXO.37.19	Each of the six branches had three decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
EXO.37.20	The shaft of the lampstand had four decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
EXO.37.21	There was one bud below each of the three pairs of branches. 
EXO.37.22	The buds, the branches, and the lampstand were a single piece of pure hammered gold. 
EXO.37.23	He made seven lamps for the lampstand, and he made its tongs and trays of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	He used seventy-five pounds of pure gold to make the lampstand and all its equipment.
EXO.37.25	He made an altar out of acacia wood, for burning incense. It was square, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide, and it was 36 inches high. Its projections at the four corners formed one piece with it. 
EXO.37.26	He covered its top, all four sides, and its projections with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 
EXO.37.27	He made two gold carrying rings for it and attached them below the border on the two sides, to hold the poles with which it was to be carried. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold.
EXO.38.1	For burning offerings, he made an altar out of acacia wood. It was square, 7½ feet long and 7½ feet wide, and it was 4½ feet high. 
EXO.38.2	He made the projections at the top of the four corners, so that they formed one piece with the altar. He covered it all with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	He also made all the equipment for the altar: the pans, the shovels, the bowls, the hooks, and the fire pans. All this equipment was made of bronze. 
EXO.38.4	He made a bronze grating and put it under the rim of the altar, so that it reached halfway up the altar. 
EXO.38.5	He made four carrying rings and put them on the four corners. 
EXO.38.6	He made carrying poles of acacia wood, covered them with bronze, 
EXO.38.7	and put them in the rings on each side of the altar. The altar was made of boards and was hollow.
EXO.38.9	For the Tent of the 
EXO.38.10	supported by twenty bronze posts in twenty bronze bases, with hooks and rods made of silver. 
EXO.38.11	The enclosure was the same on the north side. 
EXO.38.12	On the west side there were curtains 25 yards long, with ten posts and ten bases and with hooks and rods made of silver. 
EXO.38.13	On the east side, where the entrance was, the enclosure was also 25 yards wide. 
EXO.38.14+EXO.38.15	On each side of the entrance there were 7½ yards of curtains, with three posts and three bases. 
EXO.38.16	All the curtains around the enclosure were made of fine linen. 
EXO.38.17	The bases for the posts were made of bronze, and the hooks, the rods, and the covering of the tops of the posts were made of silver. All the posts around the enclosure were connected with silver rods. 
EXO.38.18	The curtain for the entrance of the enclosure was made of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and decorated with embroidery. It was 10 yards long and 2½ yards high, like the curtains of the enclosure. 
EXO.38.19	It was supported by four posts in four bronze bases. Their hooks, the covering of their tops, and their rods were made of silver. 
EXO.38.20	All the pegs for the Tent and for the surrounding enclosure were made of bronze.
EXO.38.21	Here is a list of the amounts of the metals used in the Tent of the 
EXO.38.22	Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah, made everything that the 
EXO.38.23	His helper, Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, was an engraver, a designer, and a weaver of fine linen and of blue, purple, and red wool.
EXO.38.24	All the gold that had been dedicated to the 
EXO.38.25	 The silver from the census of the community weighed 7,550 pounds, weighed according to the official standard. 
EXO.38.26	 This amount equaled the total paid by all persons enrolled in the census, each one paying the required amount, weighed according to the official standard. There were 603,550 men twenty years old or older enrolled in the census. 
EXO.38.27	Of the silver, 7,500 pounds were used to make the hundred bases for the sacred Tent and for the curtain, 75 pounds for each base. 
EXO.38.28	With the remaining 50 pounds of silver Bezalel made the rods, the hooks for the posts, and the covering for their tops. 
EXO.38.29	The bronze which was dedicated to the 
EXO.38.30	With it he made the bases for the entrance of the Tent of the 
EXO.38.31	the bases for the surrounding enclosure and for the entrance of the enclosure, and all the pegs for the Tent and the surrounding enclosure.
EXO.39.1	With the blue, purple, and red wool they made the magnificent garments which the priests were to wear when they served in the Holy Place. They made the priestly garments for Aaron, as the 
EXO.39.2	They made the ephod of fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; and gold thread. 
EXO.39.3	They hammered out sheets of gold and cut them into thin strips to be worked into the fine linen and into the blue, purple, and red wool. 
EXO.39.4	They made two shoulder straps for the ephod and attached them to its sides, so that it could be fastened. 
EXO.39.5	The finely woven belt, made of the same materials, was attached to the ephod so as to form one piece with it, as the 
EXO.39.6	They prepared the carnelians and mounted them in gold settings; they were skillfully engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Jacob. 
EXO.39.7	They put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod to represent the twelve tribes of Israel, just as the 
EXO.39.8	They made the breastpiece of the same materials as the ephod and with similar embroidery. 
EXO.39.9	It was square and folded double, 9 inches long and 9 inches wide. 
EXO.39.10	They mounted four rows of precious stones on it: in the first row they mounted a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet; 
EXO.39.11	in the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
EXO.39.12	in the third row, a turquoise, an agate, and an amethyst; 
EXO.39.13	and in the fourth row, a beryl, a carnelian, and a jasper. These were mounted in gold settings. 
EXO.39.14	Each of the twelve stones had engraved on it the name of one of the sons of Jacob, in order to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. 
EXO.39.15	For the breastpiece they made chains of pure gold, twisted like cords. 
EXO.39.16	They made two gold settings and two gold rings and attached the two rings to the upper corners of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.17	They fastened the two gold cords to the two rings 
EXO.39.18	and fastened the other two ends of the cords to the two settings and in this way attached them in front to the shoulder straps of the ephod. 
EXO.39.19	They made two rings of gold and attached them to the lower corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower part of the front of the two shoulder straps of the ephod, near the seam and above the finely woven belt. 
EXO.39.21	Just as the 
EXO.39.22	The robe that goes under the ephod was made entirely of blue wool. 
EXO.39.23	The hole for the head was reinforced with a woven binding to keep it from tearing. 
EXO.39.24+EXO.39.25+EXO.39.26	All around its lower hem they put pomegranates of fine linen and of blue, purple, and red wool, alternating with bells of pure gold, just as the 
EXO.39.27	They made the shirts for Aaron and his sons, 
EXO.39.28	and the turban, the caps, the linen shorts, 
EXO.39.29	and the sash of fine linen and of blue, purple, and red wool, decorated with embroidery, as the

EXO.39.35	the Covenant Box containing the stone tablets, its poles, and its lid; 
EXO.39.36	the table and all its equipment, and the bread offered to God; 
EXO.39.37	the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps, all its equipment, and the oil for the lamps; 
EXO.39.38	the gold altar; the anointing oil; the sweet-smelling incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent; 
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its equipment; the washbasin and its base; 
EXO.39.40	the curtains for the enclosure and its posts and bases; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure and its ropes; the Tent pegs; all the equipment to be used in the Tent; 
EXO.39.41	and the magnificent garments the priests were to wear in the Holy Place—the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons. 
EXO.39.42	The Israelites had done all the work just as the 
EXO.39.43	Moses examined everything and saw that they had made it all just as the 
EXO.40.1	The 
EXO.40.2	“On the first day of the first month set up the Tent of the 
EXO.40.3	Place in it the Covenant Box containing the Ten Commandments and put the curtain in front of it. 
EXO.40.4	Bring in the table and place the equipment on it. Also bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps on it. 
EXO.40.5	Put the gold altar for burning incense in front of the Covenant Box and hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tent. 
EXO.40.6	Put in front of the Tent the altar for burning offerings. 
EXO.40.7	Put the washbasin between the Tent and the altar and fill it with water. 
EXO.40.8	Put up the surrounding enclosure and hang the curtain at its entrance.
EXO.40.9	“Then dedicate the Tent and all its equipment by anointing it with the sacred oil, and it will be holy. 
EXO.40.10	Next, dedicate the altar and all its equipment by anointing it, and it will be completely holy. 
EXO.40.11	Also dedicate the washbasin and its base in the same way.
EXO.40.12	“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent, and have them take a ritual bath. 
EXO.40.13	Dress Aaron in the priestly garments, anoint him, and in this way consecrate him, so that he can serve me as priest. 
EXO.40.14	Bring his sons and put the shirts on them. 
EXO.40.15	Then anoint them, just as you anointed their father, so that they can serve me as priests. This anointing will make them priests for all time to come.”
EXO.40.16	Moses did everything just as the 
EXO.40.17	So on the first day of the first month of the second year after they left Egypt, the Tent of the 
EXO.40.18	Moses put down its bases, set up its frames, attached its crossbars, and put up its posts. 
EXO.40.19	He spread out the covering over the Tent and put the outer covering over it, just as the 
EXO.40.20	Then he took the two stone tablets and put them in the Covenant Box. He put the poles in the rings of the Box and put the lid on it. 
EXO.40.21	Then he put the Box in the Tent and hung up the curtain. In this way he screened off the Covenant Box, just as the 
EXO.40.22	He put the table in the Tent, on the north side outside the curtain, 
EXO.40.23	and placed on it the bread offered to the 
EXO.40.24	He put the lampstand in the Tent, on the south side, opposite the table, 
EXO.40.25	and there in the 
EXO.40.26	He put the gold altar in the Tent, in front of the curtain, 
EXO.40.27	and burned the sweet-smelling incense, just as the 
EXO.40.28	He hung the curtain at the entrance of the Tent, 
EXO.40.29	and there in front of the curtain he placed the altar for burning offerings. On it he sacrificed the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the 
EXO.40.30	He put the washbasin between the Tent and the altar and filled it with water. 
EXO.40.31	Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there 
EXO.40.32	whenever they went into the Tent or to the altar, just as the 
EXO.40.33	Moses set up the enclosure around the Tent and the altar and hung the curtain at the entrance of the enclosure. So he finished all the work.
EXO.40.35	Because of this, Moses could not go into the Tent. 
EXO.40.36	The Israelites moved their camp to another place only when the cloud lifted from the Tent. 
EXO.40.37	As long as the cloud stayed there, they did not move their camp. 
EXO.40.38	During all their wanderings they could see the cloud of the 
LEV.1.1	The 
LEV.1.2	for the Israelites to observe when they offer their sacrifices.
LEV.1.2	When you offer an animal sacrifice, it may be one of your cattle or one of your sheep or goats. 
LEV.1.3	If you are offering one of your cattle as a burnt offering, you must bring a bull without any defects. You must present it at the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.1.4	You shall put your hand on its head, and it will be accepted as a sacrifice to take away your sins. 
LEV.1.5	You shall kill the bull there, and the Aaronite priests shall present the blood to the 
LEV.1.6	Then you shall skin the animal and cut it up, 
LEV.1.7	and the priests shall arrange firewood on the altar and light it. 
LEV.1.8	They shall put on the fire the pieces of the animal, including the head and the fat. 
LEV.1.9	You must wash the internal organs and the hind legs, and the officiating priest will burn the whole sacrifice on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the 
LEV.1.10	If you are offering one of your sheep or goats, it must be a male without any defects. 
LEV.1.11	You shall kill it on the north side of the altar, and the priests shall throw its blood on all four sides of the altar. 
LEV.1.12	After you cut it up, the officiating priest shall put on the fire all the parts, including the head and the fat. 
LEV.1.13	You must wash the internal organs and the hind legs, and the priest will present the sacrifice to the 
LEV.1.14	If you are offering a bird as a burnt offering, it must be a dove or a pigeon. 
LEV.1.15	The priest shall present it at the altar, wring its neck, and burn its head on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out against the side of the altar. 
LEV.1.16	He shall remove the crop and its contents and throw them away on the east side of the altar where the ashes are put. 
LEV.1.17	He shall take hold of its wings and tear its body open, without tearing the wings off, and then burn it whole on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the 
LEV.2.1	When any of you present an offering of grain to the 
LEV.2.2	and bring it to the Aaronite priests. The officiating priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil and all of the incense and burn it on the altar as a token that it has all been offered to the 
LEV.2.3	The rest of the grain offering belongs to the priests; it is very holy, since it is taken from the food offered to the 
LEV.2.4	If the offering is bread baked in an oven, it must be made without yeast. It may be thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil or thin cakes brushed with olive oil.
LEV.2.5	If the offering is bread cooked on a griddle, it is to be made of flour mixed with olive oil but without yeast. 
LEV.2.6	Crumble it up and pour the oil on it when you present it as an offering.
LEV.2.7	If the offering is bread cooked in a pan, it is to be made of flour and olive oil. 
LEV.2.8	Bring it as an offering to the 
LEV.2.9	The priest will take part of it as a token that it has all been offered to the 
LEV.2.10	The rest of the offering belongs to the priests; it is very holy, since it is taken from the food offered to the 
LEV.2.11	None of the grain offerings which you present to the 
LEV.2.12	An offering of the first grain that you harvest each year shall be brought to the 
LEV.2.13	Put salt on every grain offering, because salt represents the covenant between you and God. (You must put salt on all your offerings.) 
LEV.2.14	When you bring to the 
LEV.2.15	Add olive oil and put incense on it. 
LEV.2.16	The priest will burn that part of the meal and oil that is to serve as a token, and also all the incense, as a food offering to the 
LEV.3.1	When any of you offer one of your cattle as a fellowship offering, it is to be a bull or a cow without any defects. 
LEV.3.2	You shall put your hand on the head of the animal and kill it at the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.3.3	and present the following parts of the animal as a food offering to the 
LEV.3.4	the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver. 
LEV.3.5	The priests shall burn all this on the altar along with the burnt offerings. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the 
LEV.3.6	If a sheep or goat is used as a fellowship offering, it may be male or female, but it must be without any defects. 
LEV.3.7	If you offer a sheep, 
LEV.3.8	you shall put your hand on its head and kill it in front of the Tent. The priests shall throw its blood against all four sides of the altar 
LEV.3.9	and present the following parts of the animal as a food offering to the 
LEV.3.10	the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver. 
LEV.3.11	The officiating priest shall burn all this on the altar as a food offering to the 
LEV.3.12	If you offer a goat, 
LEV.3.13	you shall put your hand on its head and kill it in front of the Tent. The priests shall throw its blood against all four sides of the altar 
LEV.3.14	and present the following parts as a food offering to the 
LEV.3.15	the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver. 
LEV.3.16	The priest shall burn all this on the altar as a food offering pleasing to the 
LEV.3.17	No Israelite may eat any fat or any blood; this is a rule to be kept forever by all Israelites wherever they live.
LEV.4.1	The 
LEV.4.2	to tell the people of Israel that anyone who sinned and broke any of the 
LEV.4.3	If it is the High Priest who sins and so brings guilt on the people, he shall present a young bull without any defects and sacrifice it to the 
LEV.4.4	He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent, put his hand on its head, and kill it there in the 
LEV.4.5	Then the High Priest shall take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tent. 
LEV.4.6	He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it in front of the sacred curtain seven times. 
LEV.4.7	Then he shall put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the incense altar in the Tent. He shall pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar used for burning sacrifices, which is at the entrance of the Tent. 
LEV.4.8	From this bull he shall take all the fat, the fat on the internal organs, 
LEV.4.9	the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver. 
LEV.4.10	The priest shall take this fat and burn it on the altar used for the burnt offerings, just as he does with the fat from the animal killed for the fellowship offering. 
LEV.4.11	But he shall take its skin, all its flesh, its head, its legs, and its internal organs, including the intestines, 
LEV.4.12	carry it all outside the camp to the ritually clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he shall burn it on a wood fire.
LEV.4.13	If it is the whole community of Israel that sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of the 
LEV.4.14	then as soon as the sin becomes known, the community shall bring a young bull as a sin offering. They shall bring it to the Tent of the 
LEV.4.15	the leaders of the community shall put their hands on its head, and it shall be killed there. 
LEV.4.16	The High Priest shall take some of the bull's blood into the Tent, 
LEV.4.17	dip his finger in it, and sprinkle it in front of the curtain seven times. 
LEV.4.18	He shall put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the incense altar inside the Tent and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar used for burning sacrifices, which is at the entrance of the Tent. 
LEV.4.19	Then he shall take all its fat and burn it on the altar. 
LEV.4.20	He shall do the same thing with this bull as he does with the bull for the sin offering, and in this way he shall make the sacrifice for the people's sin, and they will be forgiven. 
LEV.4.21	Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burns the bull offered for his own sin. This is an offering to take away the sin of the community.
LEV.4.22	If it is a ruler who sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of the 
LEV.4.23	then as soon as the sin is called to his attention, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without any defects. 
LEV.4.24	He shall put his hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. This is an offering to take away sin. 
LEV.4.25	The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.26	Then he shall burn all of its fat on the altar, just as he burns the fat of the animals killed for the fellowship offerings. In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin of the ruler, and he will be forgiven.
LEV.4.28	then as soon as the sin is called to your attention, you shall bring as your offering a female goat without any defects. 
LEV.4.29	You shall put your hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. 
LEV.4.30	The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.31	Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the animals killed for the fellowship offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar as an odor pleasing to the 
LEV.4.32	If you bring a sheep as a sin offering, it must be a female without any defects. 
LEV.4.33	You shall put your hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. 
LEV.4.34	The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.35	Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the sheep killed for the fellowship offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the food offerings given to the 
LEV.5.1	Sin offerings are required in the following cases.
LEV.5.1	If you are officially summoned to give evidence in court and do not give information about something you have seen or heard, you must suffer the consequences.
LEV.5.2	If you unintentionally touch anything ritually unclean, such as a dead animal, you are unclean and guilty as soon as you realize what you have done.

LEV.5.9	and sprinkle some of its blood against the side of the altar. The rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar. This is an offering to take away sin. 
LEV.5.10	Then he shall offer the second bird as a burnt offering, according to the regulations. In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven.
LEV.5.11	If you cannot afford two doves or two pigeons, you shall bring two pounds of flour as a sin offering. You shall not put any olive oil or any incense on it, because it is a sin offering, not a grain offering. 
LEV.5.12	You shall bring it to the priest, who will take a handful of it as a token that it has all been offered to the

LEV.6.2	An offering is to be made if any of you sin against the 
LEV.6.3	or by lying about something that has been lost and swearing that you did not find it. 
LEV.6.4+LEV.6.5	When you sin in any of these ways, you must repay whatever you got by dishonest means. On the day you are found guilty, you must repay the owner in full, plus an additional 20 percent.

LEV.6.28	Any clay pot in which the meat is boiled must be broken, and if a metal pot is used, it must be scrubbed and rinsed with water.

LEV.8.3	Then call the whole community together there.”
LEV.8.4	Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	he said to them, “What I am now about to do is what the 
LEV.8.6	Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and had them take a ritual bath. 
LEV.8.7	He put the shirt and the robe on Aaron and the sash around his waist. He put the ephod
LEV.8.8	He put the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim
LEV.8.9	He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of it he put the gold ornament, the sacred sign of dedication, just as the 
LEV.8.10	Then Moses took the anointing oil and put it on the Tent of the 
LEV.8.11	He took some of the oil and sprinkled it seven times on the altar and its equipment and on the basin and its base, in order to dedicate them to the 
LEV.8.12	He ordained Aaron by pouring some of the anointing oil on his head. 
LEV.8.13	Next, Moses brought the sons of Aaron forward and put shirts on them, put sashes around their waists, and tied caps on their heads, just as the 
LEV.8.14	Then Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 
LEV.8.15	Moses killed it and took some of the blood, and with his finger put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, in order to dedicate it. He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. In this way he dedicated it and purified it. 
LEV.8.16	Moses took all the fat on the internal organs, the best part of the liver, and the kidneys with the fat on them, and burned it all on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	He took the rest of the bull, including its skin, flesh, and intestines, and burned it outside the camp, just as the 
LEV.8.18	Next, Moses brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 
LEV.8.19	Moses killed it and threw the blood on all four sides of the altar. 
LEV.8.20+LEV.8.21	He cut the ram in pieces, washed the internal organs and the hind legs with water, and burned the head, the fat, and all the rest of the ram on the altar, just as the 
LEV.8.22	Then Moses brought the second ram, which was for the ordination of priests, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head.

LEV.8.24	Then he brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses then threw the rest of the blood on all four sides of the altar.

LEV.8.26	Then he took one loaf of bread from the basket of unleavened bread dedicated to the 
LEV.8.27	He put all of this food in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they presented it as a special gift to the 
LEV.8.28	Then Moses took the food from them and burned it on the altar, on top of the burnt offering, as an ordination offering. This was a food offering, and its odor was pleasing to the 
LEV.8.29	Then Moses took the breast and presented it as a special gift to the 
LEV.8.30	Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his sons and on their clothes. In this way he consecrated them and their clothes to the 
LEV.8.31	Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Take the meat to the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.8.32	Burn up any meat or bread that is left over. 
LEV.8.33	You shall not leave the entrance of the Tent for seven days, until your ordination rites are completed. 
LEV.8.34	The 
LEV.8.35	You must stay at the entrance of the Tent day and night for seven days, doing what the 
LEV.8.36	So Aaron and his sons did everything that the 
LEV.9.1	The day after the ordination rites were completed, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the leaders of Israel. 
LEV.9.2	He said to Aaron, “Take a young bull and a ram without any defects and offer them to the 
LEV.9.3	Then tell the people of Israel to take a male goat for a sin offering, a one-year-old calf, and a one-year-old lamb without any defects for a burnt offering, 
LEV.9.4	and a bull and a ram for a fellowship offering. They are to sacrifice them to the 
LEV.9.5	They brought to the front of the Tent everything that Moses had commanded, and the whole community assembled there to worship the 
LEV.9.6	Moses said, “The 
LEV.9.7	 Then he said to Aaron, “Go to the altar and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering to take away your sins and the sins of the people. Present this offering to take away the sins of the people, just as the 
LEV.9.8	Aaron went to the altar and killed the young bull which was for his own sin offering. 
LEV.9.9	His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it, put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and poured out the rest of it at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the best part of the liver, just as the 
LEV.9.11	But he burned the meat and the skin outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	He killed the animal which was for his own burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They handed him the head and the other pieces of the animal, and he burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	Then he washed the internal organs and the hind legs and burned them on the altar on top of the rest of the burnt offering.
LEV.9.15	After that, he presented the people's offerings. He took the goat that was to be offered for the people's sins, killed it, and offered it, as he had done with his own sin offering. 
LEV.9.16	He also brought the animal for the burnt offering and offered it according to the regulations. 
LEV.9.17	He presented the grain offering and took a handful of flour and burned it on the altar. (This was in addition to the daily burnt offering.) 
LEV.9.18	 He killed the bull and the ram as a fellowship offering for the people. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.19	Aaron put the fat parts of the bull and the ram 
LEV.9.20	on top of the breasts of the animals and carried it all to the altar. He burned the fat on the altar 
LEV.9.21	and presented the breasts and the right hind legs as the special gift to the 
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of the 
LEV.9.24	Suddenly the 
LEV.10.1	Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan, put live coals in it, added incense, and presented it to the 
LEV.10.2	Suddenly the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.4	Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, “Come here and carry your cousins' bodies away from the sacred Tent and put them outside the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they came and took hold of the clothing on the corpses and carried them outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded.
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes to show that you are in mourning. If you do, you will die, and the 
LEV.10.7	Do not leave the entrance of the Tent or you will die, because you have been consecrated by the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.8	The 
LEV.10.9	“You and your sons are not to enter the Tent of my presence after drinking wine or beer; if you do, you will die. This is a law to be kept by all your descendants. 
LEV.10.10	You must distinguish between what belongs to God and what is for general use, between what is ritually clean and what is unclean. 
LEV.10.11	You must teach the people of Israel all the laws which I have given to you through Moses.”
LEV.10.13	Eat it in a holy place; it is the part that belongs to you and your sons from the food offered to the 
LEV.10.14	 But you and your families may eat the breast and the hind leg that are presented as the special gift and the special contribution to the 
LEV.10.15	They shall bring the hind leg and the breast at the time the fat is presented as a food offering to the 
LEV.10.16	Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering and learned that it had already been burned. This made him angry at Eleazar and Ithamar, and he demanded, 
LEV.10.17	 “Why didn't you eat the sin offering in a sacred place? It is very holy, and the 
LEV.10.18	Since its blood was not brought into the sacred Tent, you should have eaten the sacrifice there, as I commanded.”
LEV.10.19	Aaron answered, “If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the 
LEV.10.20	When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
LEV.11.1	The 
LEV.11.2	for the people of Israel. You may eat any land animal 
LEV.11.3	that has divided hoofs and that also chews the cud, 
LEV.11.4+LEV.11.5+LEV.11.6	but you must not eat camels, rock badgers, or rabbits. These must be considered unclean; they chew the cud, but do not have divided hoofs. 
LEV.11.7	Do not eat pigs. They must be considered unclean; they have divided hoofs, but do not chew the cud. 
LEV.11.8	Do not eat these animals or even touch their dead bodies; they are unclean.

LEV.11.10	but anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales must not be eaten. 
LEV.11.11	Such creatures must be considered unclean. You must not eat them or even touch their dead bodies. 
LEV.11.12	You must not eat anything that lives in the water and does not have fins and scales.
LEV.11.13+LEV.11.14+LEV.11.15+LEV.11.16+LEV.11.17+LEV.11.18+LEV.11.19	You must not eat any of the following birds: eagles, owls, hawks, falcons; buzzards, vultures, crows; ostriches; seagulls, storks, herons, pelicans, cormorants;

LEV.11.21	except those that hop. 
LEV.11.22	You may eat locusts, crickets, or grasshoppers. 
LEV.11.23	But all other small things that have wings and also crawl must be considered unclean.
LEV.11.24+LEV.11.25+LEV.11.26+LEV.11.27+LEV.11.28	If you touch the dead bodies of the following animals, you will be unclean until evening: all animals with hoofs, unless their hoofs are divided and they chew the cud, and all four-footed animals with paws. If you carry their dead bodies, you must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening.
LEV.11.29+LEV.11.30	Moles, rats, mice, and lizards must be considered unclean. 
LEV.11.31	Whoever touches them or their dead bodies will be unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.32	And if their dead bodies fall on anything, it will be unclean. This applies to any article of wood, cloth, leather, or sacking, no matter what it is used for. It shall be dipped in water, but it will remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.33	And if their bodies fall into a clay pot, everything that is in it shall be unclean, and you must break the pot. 
LEV.11.34	Any food which could normally be eaten, but on which water from such a pot has been poured, will be unclean, and anything drinkable in such a pot is unclean. 
LEV.11.35	Anything on which the dead bodies fall is unclean; a clay stove or oven shall be broken, 
LEV.11.36	but a spring or a cistern remains clean, although anything else that touches their dead bodies is unclean. 
LEV.11.37	If one of them falls on seed that is going to be planted, the seed remains clean. 
LEV.11.38	But if the seed is soaking in water and one of them falls on it, the seed is unclean.
LEV.11.39	If any animal that may be eaten dies, anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.40	And if any of you eat any part of the animal, you must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening; any of you who carry the dead body must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening.
LEV.11.41	You must not eat any of the small animals that move on the ground, 
LEV.11.42	whether they crawl, or walk on four legs, or have many legs. 
LEV.11.43	Do not make yourselves unclean by eating any of these. 
LEV.11.44	 I am the 
LEV.11.45	I am the 
LEV.11.46	This, then, is the law about animals and birds, about everything that lives in the water, and everything that moves on the ground. 
LEV.11.47	You must be careful to distinguish between what is ritually clean and unclean, between animals that may be eaten and those that may not.
LEV.12.1	The 
LEV.12.2	for the people of Israel. For seven days after a woman gives birth to a son, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period. 
LEV.12.3	 On the eighth day, the child shall be circumcised. 
LEV.12.4	Then it will be thirty-three more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood; she must not touch anything that is holy or enter the sacred Tent until the time of her purification is completed.
LEV.12.5	For fourteen days after a woman gives birth to a daughter, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period. Then it will be sixty-six more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood.
LEV.12.6	When the time of her purification is completed, whether for a son or daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.12.7	The priest shall present her offering to the 
LEV.13.1	The 
LEV.13.2	If any of you have a sore on your skin or a boil or an inflammation which could develop into a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the Aaronite priest. 
LEV.13.3	The priest shall examine the sore, and if the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
LEV.13.4	But if the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
LEV.13.5	The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread, he shall isolate you for another seven days. 
LEV.13.6	The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if the sore has faded and has not spread, he shall pronounce you ritually clean; it is only a sore. You shall wash your clothes and be ritually clean. 
LEV.13.7	But if the sore spreads after the priest has examined you and pronounced you clean, you must appear before the priest again. 
LEV.13.8	The priest will examine you again, and if it has spread, he shall pronounce you unclean; it is a dreaded skin disease.
LEV.13.9	If any of you have a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the priest, 
LEV.13.10	who will examine you. If there is a white sore on your skin which turns the hairs white and is full of pus, 
LEV.13.11	it is a chronic skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you unclean; there is no need to isolate you, because you are obviously unclean. 
LEV.13.12	If the skin disease spreads and covers you from head to foot, 
LEV.13.13	the priest shall examine you again. If he finds that it actually has covered the whole body, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. If your whole skin has turned white, you are ritually clean. 
LEV.13.14	But from the moment an open sore appears, you are unclean. 
LEV.13.15	The priest shall examine you again, and if he sees an open sore, he shall pronounce you unclean. An open sore means a dreaded skin disease, and you are unclean. 
LEV.13.16	But when the sore heals and becomes white again, you shall go to the priest, 
LEV.13.17	who will examine you again. If the sore has turned white, you are ritually clean, and the priest shall pronounce you clean.
LEV.13.18	If any of you have a boil that has healed 
LEV.13.19	and if afterward a white swelling or a reddish-white spot appears where the boil was, you shall go to the priest. 
LEV.13.20	The priest shall examine you, and if the spot seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it have turned white, he shall pronounce you unclean. It is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the boil. 
LEV.13.21	But if the priest examines it and finds that the hairs in it have not turned white and that it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
LEV.13.22	If the spot spreads, the priest shall pronounce you unclean; you are diseased. 
LEV.13.23	But if it remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar left from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean.
LEV.13.24	In case any of you have been burned, if the raw flesh becomes white or reddish-white, 
LEV.13.25	the priest shall examine you. If the hairs in the spot have turned white and it appears deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
LEV.13.26	But if the hairs in it have not turned white and it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
LEV.13.27	The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if it is spreading, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
LEV.13.28	But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread and is light in color, it is not a dreaded skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you ritually clean, because it is only a scar from the burn.
LEV.13.29	When any of you, male or female, have a sore on your head or chin, 
LEV.13.30	the priest shall examine it. If it seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it are yellowish and thin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and he shall pronounce you unclean. 
LEV.13.31	If, when the priest examines you, the sore does not appear to be deeper than the surrounding skin, but there are still no healthy hairs in it, he shall isolate you for seven days. 
LEV.13.32	The priest shall examine the sore again on the seventh day, and if it has not spread and there are no yellowish hairs in it and it does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, 
LEV.13.33	you shall shave the head except the area around the sore. The priest shall then isolate you for another seven days. 
LEV.13.34	On the seventh day the priest shall again examine the sore, and if it has not spread and does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. You shall wash your clothes, and you will be clean. 
LEV.13.35	But if the sore spreads after you have been pronounced clean, 
LEV.13.36	the priest shall examine you again. If the sore has spread, he need not look for yellowish hairs; you are obviously unclean. 
LEV.13.37	But if in the priest's opinion the sore has not spread and healthy hairs are growing in it, the sore has healed, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean.
LEV.13.38	When any of you, male or female, have white spots on the skin, 
LEV.13.39	the priest shall examine you. If the spots are dull white, it is only a blemish that has broken out on the skin; you are ritually clean.
LEV.13.40+LEV.13.41	If you lose your hair at the back or the front of your head, this does not make you unclean. 
LEV.13.42	But if a reddish-white sore appears on the bald spot, it is a dreaded skin disease. 
LEV.13.43	The priest shall examine you, and if there is a reddish-white sore, 
LEV.13.44	the priest shall pronounce you unclean, because of the dreaded skin disease on your head.
LEV.13.45	If you have a dreaded skin disease, you must wear torn clothes, leave your hair uncombed, cover the lower part of your face, and call out, “Unclean, unclean!” 
LEV.13.46	You remain unclean as long as you have the disease, and you must live outside the camp, away from others.
LEV.13.47	When there is mildew
LEV.13.48	or on any piece of linen or wool cloth or on leather or anything made of leather, 
LEV.13.49	if it is greenish or reddish, it is a spreading mildew and must be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.50	The priest shall examine it and put the object away for seven days. 
LEV.13.51	He shall examine it again on the seventh day, and if the mildew has spread, the object is unclean. 
LEV.13.52	The priest shall burn it, because it is a spreading mildew which must be destroyed by fire.
LEV.13.53	But if, when he examines it, the priest finds that the mildew has not spread on the object, 
LEV.13.54	he shall order that it be washed and put away for another seven days. 
LEV.13.55	Then he shall examine it, and if the mildew has not changed color, even though it has not spread, it is still unclean; you must burn the object, whether the rot is on the front or the back. 
LEV.13.56	But if, when the priest examines it again, the mildew has faded, he shall tear it out of the clothing or leather. 
LEV.13.57	Then, if the mildew reappears, it is spreading again, and the owner shall burn the object. 
LEV.13.58	If he washes the object and the spot disappears, he shall wash it again, and it will be ritually clean.
LEV.13.59	This, then, is the law about mildew on clothing, whether it is wool or linen, or on linen or wool cloth or on anything made of leather; this is how the decision is made as to whether it is ritually clean or unclean.
LEV.14.1	The 
LEV.14.2	 the following regulations about the ritual purification of those of you cured of a dreaded skin disease. On the day you are to be pronounced clean, you shall be brought to the priest, 
LEV.14.3	and the priest shall take you outside the camp and examine you. If the disease is healed, 
LEV.14.4	the priest shall order that two ritually clean birds be brought, along with a piece of cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop. 
LEV.14.5	Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water. 
LEV.14.6	He shall take the other bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the red cord, and the hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed. 
LEV.14.7	He shall sprinkle the blood seven times on the one of you who is to be purified from your skin disease, and then he shall pronounce you clean. He shall let the live bird fly away over the open fields. 
LEV.14.8	You shall wash your clothes, shave off all your hair, and take a bath; you will then be ritually clean. You may enter the camp, but you must live outside your tent for seven days. 
LEV.14.9	On the seventh day you shall again shave your head, your beard, your eyebrows, and all the rest of the hair on your body; you shall wash your clothes and take a bath, and then you will be ritually clean.
LEV.14.10	On the eighth day you shall bring two male lambs and one female lamb a year old that are without any defects, five pounds of flour mixed with olive oil, and half a pint of olive oil. 
LEV.14.11	The priest shall take you and these offerings to the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.14.12	Then the priest shall take one of the male lambs and together with the half pint of oil he shall offer it as a repayment offering. He shall present them as a special gift to the 
LEV.14.13	He shall kill the lamb in the holy place where the animals for the sin offerings and the burnt offerings are killed. He must do this because the repayment offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest and is very holy. 
LEV.14.14	The priest shall take some of the blood of the lamb and put it on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean. 
LEV.14.15	The priest shall take some of the olive oil and pour it in the palm of his own left hand, 
LEV.14.16	dip a finger of his right hand in it, and sprinkle some of it seven times there in the 
LEV.14.17	He shall take some of the oil that is in the palm of his hand and some of the blood of the lamb and put them on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean. 
LEV.14.18	He shall put the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand on your head. In this way he shall perform the ritual of purification.
LEV.14.19	Then the priest shall offer the sin offering and perform the ritual of purification. After that, he shall kill the animal for the burnt offering 
LEV.14.20	and offer it with the grain offering on the altar. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification, and you will be ritually clean.
LEV.14.21	If you are poor and cannot afford any more, you shall bring for your purification only one male lamb as your repayment offering, a special gift to the 
LEV.14.22	You shall also bring two doves or two pigeons, one for the sin offering and one for the burnt offering. 
LEV.14.23	On the eighth day of your purification you shall bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent. 
LEV.14.24	The priest shall take the lamb and the olive oil and present them as a special gift to the 
LEV.14.25	He shall kill the lamb and take some of the blood and put it on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot. 
LEV.14.26	The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand 
LEV.14.27	and with a finger of his right hand sprinkle some of it seven times there in the 
LEV.14.28	He shall put some of the oil on the same places he put the blood: on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot. 
LEV.14.29	The rest of the oil that is in his palm he shall put on your head and in this way perform the ritual of purification. 
LEV.14.30	Then he shall offer one of the doves or pigeons 
LEV.14.31	as the sin offering and the other as the burnt offering with the grain offering. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification. 
LEV.14.32	This is the law for those who have a dreaded skin disease but who cannot afford the normal offerings required for his purification.
LEV.14.33	The 
LEV.14.34+LEV.14.35	the following regulations about houses affected by spreading mildew. (These were to apply after the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan, which the 
LEV.14.36	The priest shall order everything to be moved out of the house before he goes to examine the mildew; otherwise everything in the house will be declared unclean. Then he shall go to the house 
LEV.14.37	and examine the mildew. If there are greenish or reddish spots that appear to be eating into the wall, 
LEV.14.38	he shall leave the house and lock it up for seven days. 
LEV.14.39	On the seventh day he shall return and examine it again. If the mildew has spread, 
LEV.14.40	he shall order that the stones on which the mildew is found be removed and thrown into some unclean place outside the city. 
LEV.14.41	After that he must have all the interior walls scraped and the plaster dumped in an unclean place outside the city. 
LEV.14.42	Then other stones are to be used to replace the stones that were removed, and new plaster will be used to cover the walls.
LEV.14.43	If the mildew breaks out again in the house after the stones have been removed and the house has been scraped and plastered, 
LEV.14.44	the priest shall go and look. If it has spread, the house is unclean. 
LEV.14.45	It must be torn down, and its stones, its wood, and all its plaster must be carried out of the city to an unclean place. 
LEV.14.46	Any who enter the house while it is locked up will be unclean until evening. 
LEV.14.47	Any who lie down or eat in the house must wash their clothes.
LEV.14.48	If, when the priest comes to look, the mildew has not reappeared after the house has been replastered, he shall pronounce the house ritually clean, because the mildew has been completely removed. 
LEV.14.49	To purify the house, he shall take two birds, some cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop. 
LEV.14.50	He shall kill one of the birds over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water. 
LEV.14.51	Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the red cord, and the live bird and shall dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water. And he shall sprinkle the house seven times. 
LEV.14.52	In this way he shall purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the red cord. 
LEV.14.53	Then he shall let the live bird fly away outside the city over the open fields. In this way he shall perform the ritual of purification for the house, and it will be ritually clean.
LEV.14.54	These are the laws about dreaded skin diseases; 
LEV.14.55+LEV.14.56	sores, boils, or inflammations; and about mildew in clothes or houses. 
LEV.14.57	These laws determine when something is unclean and when it is clean.

LEV.15.11	If a man who has a discharge touches one of you without first having washed his hands, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, and you remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.12	Any clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden bowl that he touches must be washed.
LEV.15.13	After the man is cured of his discharge, he must wait seven days and then wash his clothes and take a bath in fresh spring water, and he will be ritually clean. 
LEV.15.14	On the eighth day he shall take two doves or two pigeons to the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.15.15	The priest shall offer one of them as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way he will perform the ritual of purification for the man.

LEV.15.31	The 
LEV.15.32	These are the regulations about a man who has a discharge or an emission of semen, 
LEV.15.33	a woman during her monthly period, or a man who has sexual intercourse with a woman who is ritually unclean.
LEV.16.1	The 
LEV.16.2	 He said, “Tell your brother Aaron that only at the proper time is he to go behind the curtain into the Most Holy Place, because that is where I appear in a cloud above the lid on the Covenant Box. If he disobeys, he will be killed. 
LEV.16.3	 He may enter the Most Holy Place only after he has brought a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.”
LEV.16.4	Then the 
LEV.16.5	The community of Israel shall give Aaron two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 
LEV.16.6	He shall offer a bull as a sacrifice to take away his own sins and those of his family. 
LEV.16.7	Then he shall take the two goats to the entrance of the Tent of the 
LEV.16.8	There he shall draw lots, using two stones, one marked “for the 
LEV.16.9	Aaron shall sacrifice the goat chosen by lot for the 
LEV.16.10	The goat chosen for Azazel shall be presented alive to the 
LEV.16.11	When Aaron sacrifices the bull as the sin offering for himself and his family, 
LEV.16.12	he shall take a fire pan full of burning coals from the altar and two handfuls of fine incense and bring them into the Most Holy Place. 
LEV.16.13	There in the 
LEV.16.14	He shall take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the lid and then sprinkle some of it seven times in front of the Covenant Box.
LEV.16.16	In this way he will perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place from the uncleanness of the people of Israel and from all their sins. He must do this to the Tent, because it stands in the middle of the camp, which is ritually unclean. 
LEV.16.17	From the time Aaron enters the Most Holy Place to perform the ritual of purification until he comes out, there must be no one in the Tent. When he has performed the ritual for himself, his family, and the whole community, 
LEV.16.18	he must then go out to the altar for burnt offerings and purify it. He must take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it all over the projections at the corners of the altar. 
LEV.16.19	With his finger he must sprinkle some of the blood on the altar seven times. In this way he is to purify it from the sins of the people of Israel and make it holy.
LEV.16.20	When Aaron has finished performing the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of the 
LEV.16.21	 He shall put both of his hands on the goat's head and confess over it all the evils, sins, and rebellions of the people of Israel, and so transfer them to the goat's head. Then the goat is to be driven off into the desert by someone appointed to do it. 
LEV.16.22	The goat will carry all their sins away with him into some uninhabited land.
LEV.16.24	He must take a bath in a holy place and put on his own clothes. After that, he shall go out and offer the burnt offering to remove his own sins and those of the people. 
LEV.16.25	He shall burn on the altar the fat of the animal for the sin offering. 
LEV.16.26	The man who drove the goat into the desert to Azazel must wash his clothes and take a bath before he comes back into camp. 
LEV.16.27	 The bull and the goat used for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin, shall be carried outside the camp and burned. Skin, meat, and intestines shall all be burned. 
LEV.16.28	The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp.
LEV.16.30	On that day the ritual is to be performed to purify them from all their sins, so that they will be ritually clean. 
LEV.16.31	That day is to be a very holy day, one on which they fast and do no work at all. These regulations are to be observed for all time to come. 
LEV.16.32	The High Priest, properly ordained and consecrated to succeed his father, is to perform the ritual of purification. He shall put on the priestly garments 
LEV.16.33	and perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of the 
LEV.16.34	These regulations are to be observed for all time to come. This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins.
LEV.16.34	So Moses
LEV.17.1	The 
LEV.17.2	to give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations. 
LEV.17.3+LEV.17.4	Any Israelites who kill a cow or a sheep or a goat as an offering to the 
LEV.17.5	The meaning of this command is that the people of Israel shall now bring to the 
LEV.17.6	The priest shall throw the blood against the sides of the altar at the entrance of the Tent and burn the fat to produce an odor that is pleasing to the 
LEV.17.7	The people of Israel must no longer be unfaithful to the 
LEV.17.8	Any Israelites or any foreigners living in the community who offer a burnt offering or any other sacrifice 
LEV.17.9	as an offering to the 
LEV.17.11	 The life of every living thing is in the blood, and that is why the 
LEV.17.12	That is why the 
LEV.17.13	If any Israelites or any foreigners living in the community catch an animal or a bird which is ritually clean, they must pour its blood out on the ground and cover it with dirt. 
LEV.17.14	The life of every living thing is in the blood, and that is why the 
LEV.17.15	Any people, Israelites or foreigners, who eat meat from an animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals must wash their clothes, take a bath, and wait until evening before they are ritually clean. 
LEV.17.16	If they do not, they must suffer the consequences.
LEV.18.1	The 
LEV.18.2	to say to the people of Israel, “I am the 
LEV.18.3	Do not follow the practices of the people of Egypt, where you once lived, or of the people in the land of Canaan, where I am now taking you. 
LEV.18.4	Obey my laws and do what I command. I am the 
LEV.18.5	 Follow the practices and the laws that I give you; you will save your life by doing so. I am the 
LEV.18.6	The 
LEV.18.7	Do not disgrace your father by having intercourse with your mother. You must not disgrace your own mother. 
LEV.18.8	 Do not disgrace your father by having intercourse with any of his other wives. 
LEV.18.9	 Do not have intercourse with your sister or your stepsister, whether or not she was brought up in the same house with you. 
LEV.18.10	Do not have intercourse with your granddaughter; that would be a disgrace to you. 
LEV.18.11	Do not have intercourse with a half sister; she, too, is your sister. 
LEV.18.12+LEV.18.13	 Do not have intercourse with an aunt, whether she is your father's sister or your mother's sister. 
LEV.18.14	Do not have intercourse with your uncle's wife; she, too, is your aunt. 
LEV.18.15	 Do not have intercourse with your daughter-in-law 
LEV.18.16	 or with your brother's wife. 
LEV.18.17	 Do not have intercourse with the daughter or granddaughter of a woman with whom you have had intercourse; they may be related to you, and that would be incest. 
LEV.18.18	Do not take your wife's sister as one of your wives, as long as your wife is living.
LEV.18.20	 Do not have intercourse with another man's wife; that would make you ritually unclean. 
LEV.18.21	 Do not hand over any of your children to be used in the worship of the god Molech, because that would bring disgrace on the name of God, the 
LEV.18.22	 No man is to have sexual relations with another man; God hates that. 
LEV.18.23	 No man or woman is to have sexual relations with an animal; that perversion makes you ritually unclean.
LEV.18.24	Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these acts, for that is how the pagans made themselves unclean, those pagans who lived in the land before you and whom the 
LEV.18.25	Their actions made the land unclean, and so the 
LEV.18.26+LEV.18.27	They did all these disgusting things and made the land unclean, but you must not do them. All of you, whether Israelites or foreigners living with you, must keep the 
LEV.18.28	and then the land will not reject you, as it rejected the pagans who lived there before you. 
LEV.18.29	You know that whoever does any of these disgusting things will no longer be considered one of God's people.
LEV.18.30	And the 
LEV.19.1	The 
LEV.19.2	 to say to the community of Israel, “Be holy, because I, the 
LEV.19.3	 Each of you must respect your mother and your father, and must keep the Sabbath, as I have commanded. I am the 
LEV.19.5	“When you kill an animal for a fellowship offering, keep the regulations that I have given you, and I will accept the offering. 
LEV.19.6	The meat must be eaten on the day the animal is killed or on the next day. Any meat left on the third day must be burned, 
LEV.19.7	because it is ritually unclean, and if anyone eats it, I will not accept the offering. 
LEV.19.8	Any who eat it will be guilty of treating as ordinary what is dedicated to me, and they will no longer be considered my people.
LEV.19.10	Do not go back through your vineyard to gather the grapes that were missed or to pick up the grapes that have fallen; leave them for poor people and foreigners. I am the 
LEV.19.12	 Do not make a promise in my name if you do not intend to keep it; that brings disgrace on my name. I am the 
LEV.19.14	 Do not curse the deaf or put something in front of the blind so as to make them stumble over it. Obey me; I am the 
LEV.19.16	Do not spread lies about anyone, and when someone is on trial for his life, speak out if your testimony can help him. I am the 
LEV.19.18	 Do not take revenge on others or continue to hate them, but love your neighbors as you love yourself. I am the 
LEV.19.20	“If a slave woman is the recognized concubine of a man and she has not been paid for and freed, then if another man has sexual relations with her, they will be punished, but not
LEV.19.21	The man shall bring a ram to the entrance of the Tent of my presence as his repayment offering, 
LEV.19.22	and with it the priest shall perform the ritual of purification to remove the man's sin, and God will forgive him.
LEV.19.23	“When you come into the land of Canaan and plant any kind of fruit tree, consider the fruit ritually unclean for the first three years. During that time you must not eat it. 
LEV.19.24	In the fourth year all the fruit shall be dedicated as an offering to show your gratitude to me,
LEV.19.25	But in the fifth year you may eat the fruit. If you do all this, your trees will bear more fruit. I am the 
LEV.19.27	 Do not cut the hair on the sides of your head or trim your beard 
LEV.19.28	or tattoo yourselves or cut gashes in your body to mourn for the dead. I am the 
LEV.19.30	 Keep the Sabbath, and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am the 
LEV.19.32	“Show respect for old people and honor them. Reverently obey me; I am the 
LEV.19.34	Treat them as you would an Israelite, and love them as you love yourselves. Remember that you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the 
LEV.19.36	Use honest scales, honest weights, and honest measures. I am the 
LEV.19.37	Obey all my laws and commands. I am the 
LEV.20.1	The 
LEV.20.2	to say to the people of Israel, “Any of you or any foreigner living among you who gives any children to be used in the worship of the god Molech shall be stoned to death by the whole community. 
LEV.20.3	If any of you give one of your children to Molech and make my sacred Tent unclean and disgrace my holy name, I will turn against you and will no longer consider you my people. 
LEV.20.4	But if the community ignores what you have done and does not put you to death, 
LEV.20.5	I myself will turn against you and your whole family and against all who join you in being unfaithful to me and worshiping Molech. I will no longer consider any of you my people.
LEV.20.6	“If any of you go for advice to people who consult the spirits of the dead, I will turn against you and will no longer consider you one of my people. 
LEV.20.7	Keep yourselves holy, because I am the 
LEV.20.8	Obey my laws, because I am the 
LEV.20.11	 A man who has intercourse with one of his father's wives disgraces his father, and both he and the woman shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death. 
LEV.20.12	 If a man has intercourse with his daughter-in-law, they shall both be put to death. They have committed incest and are responsible for their own death. 
LEV.20.13	 If a man has sexual relations with another man, they have done a disgusting thing, and both shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death. 
LEV.20.14	 If a man marries a woman and her mother, all three shall be burned to death because of the disgraceful thing they have done; such a thing must not be permitted among you. 
LEV.20.15	 If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he and the animal shall be put to death. 
LEV.20.16	If a woman tries to have sexual relations with an animal, she and the animal shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death.
LEV.20.18	 If a man has intercourse with a woman during her monthly period, both of them are to be driven out of the community, because they have broken the regulations about ritual uncleanness.
LEV.20.20	If a man has intercourse with his uncle's wife, he disgraces his uncle, and he and the woman will pay the penalty; neither one will have children. 
LEV.20.21	 If a man takes his brother's wife, they will die childless. He has done a ritually unclean thing and has disgraced his brother.
LEV.20.22	The 
LEV.20.23	Do not adopt the customs of the people who live there; I am driving out those pagans so that you can enter the land. They have disgusted me with all their evil practices. 
LEV.20.24	But I have promised you this rich and fertile land as your possession, and I will give it to you. I am the 
LEV.20.25	So then, you must make a clear distinction between animals and birds that are ritually clean and those that are not. Do not eat unclean animals or birds. I have declared them unclean, and eating them would make you unclean. 
LEV.20.26	You shall be holy and belong only to me, because I am the 
LEV.20.27	“Any man or woman who consults the spirits of the dead shall be stoned to death; any of you that do this are responsible for your own death.”
LEV.21.1	The 
LEV.21.2	unless it is his mother, father, son, daughter, brother, 
LEV.21.3	or unmarried sister living in his house. 
LEV.21.4	He shall not make himself unclean at the death of those related to him by marriage.
LEV.21.6	He must be holy and must not disgrace my name. He offers food offerings to me, and he must be holy. 
LEV.21.7	A priest shall not marry a woman who has been a prostitute or a woman who is not a virgin or who is divorced; he is holy. 
LEV.21.8	The people must consider the priest holy, because he presents the food offerings to me. I am the 
LEV.21.9	If a priest's daughter becomes a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she shall be burned to death.
LEV.21.10	“The High Priest has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been consecrated to wear the priestly garments, so he must not leave his hair uncombed or tear his clothes to show that he is in mourning. 
LEV.21.11+LEV.21.12	He has been dedicated to me and is not to make himself ritually unclean nor is he to defile my sacred Tent by leaving it and entering a house where there is a dead person, even if it is his own father or mother. 
LEV.21.13	He shall marry a virgin, 
LEV.21.14	not a widow or a divorced woman or a woman who has been a prostitute. He shall marry only a virgin from his own clan. 
LEV.21.15	Otherwise, his children, who ought to be holy, will be ritually unclean. I am the 
LEV.21.16	The 
LEV.21.17	to tell Aaron, “None of your descendants who has any physical defects may present the food offering to me. This applies for all time to come. 
LEV.21.18	No man with any physical defects may make the offering: no one who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed; 
LEV.21.19	no one with a crippled hand or foot; 
LEV.21.20	no one who is a hunchback or a dwarf; no one with any eye or skin disease; and no eunuch. 
LEV.21.21	No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any physical defects may present the food offering to me. 
LEV.21.22	Such a man may eat the food offered to me, both the holy food offering and the very holy food offering, 
LEV.21.23	but because he has a physical defect, he shall not come near the sacred curtain or approach the altar. He must not profane these holy things, because I am the 
LEV.21.24	This, then, is what Moses said to Aaron, the sons of Aaron, and to all the people of Israel.
LEV.22.1	The 
LEV.22.2	to tell Aaron and his sons, “You must not bring disgrace on my holy name, so treat with respect the sacred offerings that the people of Israel dedicate to me. I am the 
LEV.22.3	If any of your descendants, while he is ritually unclean, comes near the sacred offerings which the people of Israel have dedicated to me, he can never again serve at the altar. This applies for all time to come. I am the 
LEV.22.4	“None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean. Any priest is unclean if he touches anything which is unclean through contact with a corpse or if he has an emission of semen 
LEV.22.5	or if he has touched an unclean animal or person. 
LEV.22.6	Any priest who becomes unclean remains unclean until evening, and even then he may not eat any of the sacred offerings until he has taken a bath. 
LEV.22.7	After the sun sets he is clean, and then he may eat the sacred offerings, which are his food. 
LEV.22.8	He shall not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals; it will make him unclean. I am the 
LEV.22.9	“All priests shall observe the regulations that I have given. Otherwise, they will become guilty and die, because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations. I am the 
LEV.22.10	“Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings; no one else may eat them—not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him. 
LEV.22.11	But a priest's slaves, bought with his own money or born in his home, may eat the food the priest receives. 
LEV.22.12	A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings. 
LEV.22.13	But a widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest. Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of it.
LEV.22.14	“If any people who are not members of a priestly family eat any of the sacred offerings without intending to, they must repay the priest its full value plus an additional 20 percent. 
LEV.22.15	The priests shall not profane the sacred offerings 
LEV.22.16	by letting any unauthorized people eat them; this would bring guilt and punishment on such people. I am the 
LEV.22.17	The 
LEV.22.18	to give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations. When any Israelite or any foreigner living in Israel presents a burnt offering, whether as fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, the animal must not have any defects. 
LEV.22.19	To be accepted, it must be a male without any defects. 
LEV.22.20	 If you offer any animal that has any defects, the 
LEV.22.21	When anyone presents a fellowship offering to the 
LEV.22.22	Do not offer to the 
LEV.22.23	As a freewill offering you may offer an animal that is stunted or not perfectly formed, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow. 
LEV.22.24	Do not offer to the 
LEV.22.25	Do not offer as a food offering any animal obtained from a foreigner. Such animals are considered defective and are not acceptable.
LEV.22.26+LEV.22.27	When a calf or a lamb or a kid is born, it must not be taken from its mother for seven days, but after that it is acceptable as a food offering. 
LEV.22.28	Do not sacrifice a cow and its calf or a sheep and its lamb or a goat and its kid on the same day. 
LEV.22.29	When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the 
LEV.22.30	eat it the same day and leave none of it until the next morning.
LEV.22.31	The 
LEV.22.32	Do not bring disgrace on my holy name; all the people of Israel must acknowledge me to be holy. I am the 
LEV.22.33	and I brought you out of Egypt to become your God. I am the 
LEV.23.1	The 
LEV.23.2	the following regulations for the religious festivals, when the people of Israel are to gather for worship. 
LEV.23.3	 You have six days in which to do your work, but remember that the seventh day, the Sabbath, is a day of rest. On that day do not work, but gather for worship. The Sabbath belongs to the 
LEV.23.4	Proclaim the following festivals at the appointed times.
LEV.23.6	 On the fifteenth day the Festival of Unleavened Bread begins, and for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast. 
LEV.23.7	On the first of these days you shall gather for worship and do none of your daily work. 
LEV.23.8	Offer your food offerings to the 
LEV.23.9+LEV.23.10	When you come into the land that the 
LEV.23.11	He shall present it as a special offering to the 
LEV.23.12	On the day you present the offering of grain, also sacrifice as a burnt offering a one-year-old male lamb that has no defects. 
LEV.23.13	With it you shall present four pounds of flour mixed with olive oil as a food offering. The odor of this offering is pleasing to the 
LEV.23.14	Do not eat any of the new grain, whether raw, roasted, or baked into bread, until you have brought this offering to God. This regulation is to be observed by all your descendants for all time to come.
LEV.23.16	On the fiftieth day, the day after the seventh Sabbath, present to the 
LEV.23.17	Each family is to bring two loaves of bread and present them to the 
LEV.23.18	And with the bread the community is to present seven one-year-old lambs, one bull, and two rams, none of which may have any defects. They shall be offered as a burnt offering to the 
LEV.23.19	Also offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering. 
LEV.23.20	The priest shall present the bread with the two lambs as a special gift to the 
LEV.23.21	On that day do none of your daily work, but gather for worship. Your descendants are to observe this regulation for all time to come, no matter where they live.
LEV.23.23+LEV.23.24	On the first day of the seventh month observe a special day of rest, and come together for worship when the trumpets sound. 
LEV.23.25	Present a food offering to the 
LEV.23.28	Do no work on that day, because it is the day for performing the ritual to take away sin. 
LEV.23.29	Any who eat anything on that day will no longer be considered God's people. 
LEV.23.30	And if any do any work on that day, the 
LEV.23.31	This regulation applies to all your descendants, no matter where they live. 
LEV.23.32	From sunset on the ninth day of the month to sunset on the tenth observe this day as a special day of rest, during which nothing may be eaten.
LEV.23.35	On the first of these days come together for worship and do none of your daily work. 
LEV.23.36	Each day for seven days you shall present a food offering. On the eighth day come together again for worship and present a food offering. It is a day for worship, and you shall do no work.
LEV.23.36	( 
LEV.23.37	These are the religious festivals on which you honor the 
LEV.23.38	These festivals are in addition to the regular Sabbaths, and these offerings are in addition to your regular gifts, your offerings as fulfillment of vows, and your freewill offerings that you give to the 
LEV.23.39	When you have harvested your fields, celebrate this festival for seven days, beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The first day shall be a special day of rest. 
LEV.23.40	On that day take some of the best fruit from your trees, take palm branches and limbs from leafy trees, and begin a religious festival to honor the 
LEV.23.41	Celebrate it for seven days. This regulation is to be kept by your descendants for all time to come. 
LEV.23.42	All the people of Israel shall live in shelters for seven days, 
LEV.23.43	so that your descendants may know that the 
LEV.23.44	So in this way Moses gave the people of Israel the regulations for observing the religious festivals to honor the 
LEV.24.1	The 
LEV.24.2	to give the following orders to the people of Israel: Bring pure olive oil of the finest quality for the lamps in the Tent, so that a light might be kept burning regularly. 
LEV.24.3	Each evening Aaron shall light them and keep them burning until morning, there in the 
LEV.24.4	Aaron shall take care of the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold and must see that they burn regularly in the 
LEV.24.6	Put the loaves in two rows, six in each row, on the table covered with pure gold, which is in the 
LEV.24.7	Put some pure incense on each row, as a token food offering to the 
LEV.24.8	Every Sabbath, for all time to come, the bread must be placed in the presence of the 
LEV.24.9	 The bread belongs to Aaron and his descendants, and they shall eat it in a holy place, because this is a very holy part of the food offered to the 
LEV.24.10+LEV.24.11	There was a man whose father was an Egyptian and whose mother was an Israelite named Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan. There in the camp this man quarreled with an Israelite. During the quarrel he cursed the 
LEV.24.12	put him under guard, and waited for the 
LEV.24.13	The 
LEV.24.14	“Take that man out of the camp. Everyone who heard him curse shall put his hands on the man's head to testify that he is guilty, and then the whole community shall stone him to death. 
LEV.24.15	Then tell the people of Israel that anyone who curses God must suffer the consequences 
LEV.24.16	and be put to death. Any Israelite or any foreigner living in Israel who curses the 
LEV.24.18	and any who kill an animal belonging to someone else must replace it. The principle is a life for a life.
LEV.24.19	“If any of you injure another person, whatever you have done shall be done to you. 
LEV.24.20	 If you break a bone, one of your bones shall be broken; if you put out an eye, one of your eyes shall be put out; if you knock out a tooth, one of your teeth shall be knocked out. Whatever injury you cause another person shall be done to you in return. 
LEV.24.21	Whoever kills an animal shall replace it, but whoever kills a human being shall be put to death. 
LEV.24.22	 This law applies to all of you, to Israelites and to foreigners living among you, because I am the 
LEV.24.23	When Moses had said this to the people of Israel, they took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death. In this way the people of Israel did what the 
LEV.25.2	to give the following regulations to the people of Israel. When you enter the land that the 
LEV.25.3	You shall plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and gather your crops for six years. 
LEV.25.4	But the seventh year is to be a year of complete rest for the land, a year dedicated to the 
LEV.25.5	Do not even harvest the grain that grows by itself without being planted, and do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines; it is a year of complete rest for the land. 
LEV.25.6	Although the land has not been cultivated during that year, it will provide food for you, your slaves, your hired men, the foreigners living with you, 
LEV.25.7	your domestic animals, and the wild animals in your fields. Everything that it produces may be eaten.
LEV.25.8	Count seven times seven years, a total of forty-nine years. 
LEV.25.9	Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement, send someone to blow a trumpet throughout the whole land. 
LEV.25.10	In this way you shall set the fiftieth year apart and proclaim freedom to all the inhabitants of the land. During this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to the original owner or the descendants, and any who have been sold as slaves shall return to their families. 
LEV.25.11	You shall not plant your fields or harvest the grain that grows by itself or gather the grapes in your unpruned vineyards. 
LEV.25.12	The whole year shall be sacred for you; you shall eat only what the fields produce of themselves.
LEV.25.13	In this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to its original owner. 
LEV.25.14	So when you sell land to an Israelite or buy land, do not deal unfairly. 
LEV.25.15	The price is to be set according to the number of years the land can produce crops before the next Year of Restoration. 
LEV.25.16	If there are many years, the price shall be higher, but if there are only a few years, the price shall be lower, because what is being sold is the number of crops the land can produce. 
LEV.25.17	Do not cheat an Israelite, but obey the 
LEV.25.18	Obey all the 
LEV.25.19	The land will produce its crops, and you will have all you want to eat and will live in safety.
LEV.25.20	But someone may ask what there will be to eat during the seventh year, when no fields are planted and no crops gathered. 
LEV.25.21	The 
LEV.25.22	When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating what you harvested during the sixth year, and you will have enough to eat until the crops you plant that year are harvested.
LEV.25.23	Your land must not be sold on a permanent basis, because you do not own it; it belongs to God, and you are like foreigners who are allowed to make use of it.
LEV.25.24	When land is sold, the right of the original owner to buy it back must be recognized. 
LEV.25.25	If any of you Israelites become poor and are forced to sell your land, your closest relative is to buy it back. 
LEV.25.26	If you have no relative to buy it back, you may later become prosperous and have enough to buy it back yourself. 
LEV.25.27	In that case you must pay to the one who bought it a sum that will make up for the years remaining until the next Year of Restoration, when you would in any event recover your land. 
LEV.25.28	But if you do not have enough money to buy the land back, it remains under the control of the one who bought it until the next Year of Restoration. In that year it will be returned to its original owner.
LEV.25.29	If you sell a house in a walled city, you have the right to buy it back during the first full year from the date of sale. 
LEV.25.30	But if you do not buy it back within the year, you lose the right of repurchase, and the house becomes the permanent property of the purchasers and their descendants; it will not be returned in the Year of Restoration. 
LEV.25.31	But houses in unwalled villages are to be treated like fields; the original owner has the right to buy them back, and they are to be returned in the Year of Restoration. 
LEV.25.32	However, Levites have the right to buy back at any time their property in the cities assigned to them. 
LEV.25.33	If a house in one of these cities is sold by a Levite and is not bought back, it must be returned in the Year of Restoration,
LEV.25.34	But the pasture land around the Levite cities shall never be sold; it is their property forever.
LEV.25.36	Do not charge Israelites any interest, but obey God and let them live near you. 
LEV.25.37	 Do not make them pay interest on the money you lend them, and do not make a profit on the food you sell them. 
LEV.25.38	This is the command of the 
LEV.25.40	They shall stay with you as hired workers and serve you until the next Year of Restoration. 
LEV.25.41	At that time they and their children shall leave you and return to their family and to the property of their ancestors. 
LEV.25.42	The people of Israel are the 
LEV.25.43	Do not treat them harshly, but obey your God. 
LEV.25.44	If you need slaves, you may buy them from the nations around you. 
LEV.25.45	You may also buy the children of the foreigners who are living among you. Such children born in your land may become your property, 
LEV.25.46	and you may leave them as an inheritance to your children, whom they must serve as long as they live. But you must not treat any Israelites harshly.
LEV.25.47	Suppose a foreigner living with you becomes rich, while some Israelites become poor and sell themselves as slaves to that foreigner or to a member of that foreigner's family. 
LEV.25.48	After they are sold, they still have the right to be bought back. A brother 
LEV.25.49	or an uncle or a cousin or another close relative may buy them back; or if they themselves earn enough, they may buy their own freedom. 
LEV.25.50	They must consult the one who bought them, and they must count the years from the time they sold themselves until the next Year of Restoration and must set the price for their release on the basis of the wages paid hired workers. 
LEV.25.51+LEV.25.52	They must refund a part of the purchase price according to the number of years left, 
LEV.25.53	as if they had been hired on an annual basis. Their master must not treat them harshly. 
LEV.25.54	If they are not set free in any of these ways, they and their children must be set free in the next Year of Restoration. 
LEV.25.55	Israelites cannot be permanent slaves, because the people of Israel are the 
LEV.26.2	Keep the religious festivals and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am the 
LEV.26.4	I will send you rain at the right time, so that the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit. 
LEV.26.5	Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it is time to plant grain. You will have all that you want to eat, and you can live in safety in your land.
LEV.26.6	“I will give you peace in your land, and you can sleep without being afraid of anyone. I will get rid of the dangerous animals in the land, and there will be no more war there. 
LEV.26.7	You will be victorious over your enemies; 
LEV.26.8	five of you will be able to defeat a hundred, and a hundred will be able to defeat ten thousand. 
LEV.26.9	I will bless you and give you many children; I will keep my part of the covenant that I made with you. 
LEV.26.10	Your harvests will be so plentiful that they will last for a year, and even then you will have to throw away what is left of the old harvest to make room for the new. 
LEV.26.11	I will live among you in my sacred Tent, and I will never turn away from you. 
LEV.26.12	 I will be with you; I will be your God, and you will be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I, the 
LEV.26.15	If you refuse to obey my laws and commands and break the covenant I have made with you, 
LEV.26.16	I will punish you. I will bring disaster on you—incurable diseases and fevers that will make you blind and cause your life to waste away. You will plant your crops, but it will do you no good, because your enemies will conquer you and eat what you have grown. 
LEV.26.17	I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated, and those who hate you will rule over you; you will be so terrified that you will run when no one is chasing you.
LEV.26.18	“If even after all of this you still do not obey me, I will increase your punishment seven times. 
LEV.26.19	I will break your stubborn pride; there will be no rain, and your land will be dry and as hard as iron. 
LEV.26.20	All your hard work will do you no good, because your land will not produce crops and the trees will not bear fruit.
LEV.26.21	“If you still continue to resist me and refuse to obey me, I will again increase your punishment seven times. 
LEV.26.22	I will send dangerous animals among you, and they will kill your children, destroy your livestock, and leave so few of you that your roads will be deserted.
LEV.26.23	“If after all of this punishment you still do not listen to me, but continue to defy me, 
LEV.26.24	then I will turn on you and punish you seven times harder than before. 
LEV.26.25	I will bring war on you to punish you for breaking our covenant, and if you gather in your cities for safety, I will send incurable diseases among you, and you will be forced to surrender to your enemies. 
LEV.26.26	I will cut off your food supply, so that ten women will need only one oven to bake all the bread they have. They will ration it out, and when you have eaten it all, you will still be hungry.
LEV.26.27	“If after all of this you still continue to defy me and refuse to obey me, 
LEV.26.28	then in my anger I will turn on you and again make your punishment seven times worse than before. 
LEV.26.29	Your hunger will be so great that you will eat your own children. 
LEV.26.30	I will destroy your places of worship on the hills, tear down your incense altars, and throw your dead bodies on your fallen idols. In utter disgust 
LEV.26.31	I will turn your cities into ruins, destroy your places of worship, and refuse to accept your sacrifices. 
LEV.26.32	I will destroy your land so completely that the enemies who occupy it will be shocked at the destruction. 
LEV.26.33	I will bring war on you and scatter you in foreign lands. Your land will be deserted, and your cities left in ruins. 
LEV.26.34+LEV.26.35	Then the land will enjoy the years of complete rest that you would not give it; it will lie abandoned and get its rest while you are in exile in the land of your enemies.
LEV.26.36	“I will make those of you who are in exile so terrified that the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will make you run. You will run as if you were being pursued in battle, and you will fall when there is no enemy near you. 
LEV.26.37	You will stumble over one another when no one is chasing you, and you will be unable to fight against any enemy. 
LEV.26.38	You will die in exile, swallowed up by the land of your enemies. 
LEV.26.39	The few of you who survive in the land of your enemies will waste away because of your own sin and the sin of your ancestors.
LEV.26.40	“But your descendants will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors, who resisted me and rebelled against me, 
LEV.26.41	and caused me to turn against them and send them into exile in the land of their enemies. At last, when your descendants are humbled and they have paid the penalty for their sin and rebellion, 
LEV.26.42	 I will remember my covenant with Jacob and with Isaac and with Abraham, and I will renew my promise to give my people the land. 
LEV.26.43	First, however, the land must be rid of its people, so that it can enjoy its complete rest, and they must pay the full penalty for having rejected my laws and my commands. 
LEV.26.44	But even then, when they are still in the land of their enemies, I will not completely abandon them or destroy them. That would put an end to my covenant with them, and I am the

LEV.27.8	If any of you make a vow and are too poor to pay the standard price, you shall bring the person to the priest, and the priest will set a lower price, according to your ability to pay.
LEV.27.9	If your vow concerns an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the

LEV.27.18	If you dedicate it any time later, the priest shall estimate the cash value according to the number of years left until the next Year of Restoration, and set a reduced price. 
LEV.27.19	If you wish to buy your field back, you must pay the price plus an additional 20 percent.

NUM.5.11	The 
NUM.5.12+NUM.5.13+NUM.5.14	to give the Israelites the following instructions. It may happen that a man becomes suspicious that his wife is unfaithful to him and has defiled herself by having intercourse with another man. But the husband may not be certain, for his wife may have kept it secret—there was no witness, and she was not caught in the act. Or it may happen that a husband becomes suspicious of his wife, even though she has not been unfaithful. 
NUM.5.15	In either case the man shall take his wife to the priest. He shall also take the required offering of two pounds of barley flour, but he shall not pour any olive oil on it or put any incense on it, because it is an offering from a suspicious husband, made to bring the truth to light.
NUM.5.16	The priest shall bring the woman forward and have her stand in front of the altar. 
NUM.5.17	He shall pour some holy water into a clay bowl and take some of the earth that is on the floor of the Tent of the 
NUM.5.18	Then he shall loosen the woman's hair and put the offering of flour in her hands. In his hands the priest shall hold the bowl containing the bitter water that brings a curse. 
NUM.5.19	Then the priest shall make the woman agree to this oath spoken by the priest: “If you have not committed adultery, you will not be harmed by the curse that this water brings. 
NUM.5.20	But if you have committed adultery, 
NUM.5.21	may the 
NUM.5.22	May this water enter your stomach and cause it to swell up and your genital organs to shrink.”
NUM.5.22	The woman shall respond, “I agree; may the 
NUM.5.23	Then the priest shall write this curse down and wash the writing off into the bowl of bitter water. 
NUM.5.24	Before he makes the woman drink the water, which may then cause her bitter pain, 
NUM.5.25	the priest shall take the offering of flour out of the woman's hands, hold it out in dedication to the 
NUM.5.26	Then he shall take a handful of it as a token offering and burn it on the altar. Finally, he shall make the woman drink the water. 
NUM.5.27	If she has committed adultery, the water will cause bitter pain; her stomach will swell up and her genital organs will shrink. Her name will become a curse among her people. 
NUM.5.28	But if she is innocent, she will not be harmed and will be able to bear children.
NUM.5.29+NUM.5.30	This is the law in cases where a man is jealous and becomes suspicious that his wife has committed adultery. The woman shall be made to stand in front of the altar, and the priest shall perform this ritual. 
NUM.5.31	The husband shall be free of guilt, but the woman, if guilty, must suffer the consequences.

NUM.6.2	to give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Any of you, male or female, who make a special vow to become a nazirite and dedicate yourself to the 
NUM.6.3	 shall abstain from wine and beer. You shall not drink any kind of drink made from grapes or eat any grapes or raisins. 
NUM.6.4	As long as you are a nazirite, you shall not eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even the seeds or skins of grapes.
NUM.6.5	As long as you are under the nazirite vow, you must not cut your hair or shave. You are bound by the vow for the full time that you are dedicated to the 
NUM.6.6+NUM.6.7	Your hair is the sign of your dedication to God, and so you must not defile yourself by going near a corpse, not even that of your father, mother, brother, or sister. 
NUM.6.8	As long as you are a nazirite, you are consecrated to the 
NUM.6.9	If your consecrated hair is defiled because you are right beside someone who suddenly dies, you must wait seven days and then shave your head; and so you become ritually clean. 
NUM.6.10	On the eighth day you shall bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the 
NUM.6.11	The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to perform the ritual of purification for you because of your contact with a corpse. On the same day you shall reconsecrate your hair 
NUM.6.12	and rededicate to the 
NUM.6.14	and present to the 
NUM.6.15	You shall also offer a basket of bread made without yeast: thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil and thin cakes brushed with olive oil, and in addition the required offerings of grain and wine.
NUM.6.16	The priest shall present all these to the 
NUM.6.17	He shall sacrifice the ram to the 
NUM.6.18	At the entrance of the Tent you nazirites shall shave off your hair and put it on the fire on which the fellowship offering is being burned.
NUM.6.19	Then, when the shoulder of the ram is boiled, the priest shall take it and put it, together with one thick loaf of bread and one thin cake from the basket, into the hands of the nazirite. 
NUM.6.20	Next, the priest shall present them as a special gift to the 
NUM.6.21	These are the regulations for you nazirites; but if you promise an offering beyond what your vow requires you to give, you must fulfill exactly the promise you made.
NUM.6.22	The

NUM.7.1	On the day Moses finished setting up the Tent of the

NUM.7.3	brought their offerings to the 
NUM.7.4	the 
NUM.7.5	“Accept these gifts for use in the work to be done for the Tent; give them to the Levites according to the work they have to do.” 
NUM.7.6	So Moses gave the wagons and the oxen to the Levites. 
NUM.7.7	He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites, 
NUM.7.8	and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites. All their work was to be done under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron. 
NUM.7.9	But Moses gave no wagons or oxen to the Kohathites, because the sacred objects they took care of had to be carried on their shoulders.

NUM.11.16	The 
NUM.11.17	I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the spirit I have given you and give it to them. Then they can help you bear the responsibility for these people, and you will not have to bear it alone. 
NUM.11.18	Now tell the people, ‘Purify yourselves for tomorrow; you will have meat to eat. The

NUM.11.33	While there was still plenty of meat for them to eat, the 
NUM.11.34	That place was named Kibroth Hattaavah (which means “Graves of Craving”), because there they buried the people who had craved meat.

NUM.13.16	These are the spies Moses sent to explore the land. He changed the name of Hoshea son of Nun to Joshua.
NUM.13.17	When Moses sent them out, he said to them, “Go north from here into the southern part of the land of Canaan and then on into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	Find out what kind of country it is, how many people live there, and how strong they are. 
NUM.13.19	Find out whether the land is good or bad and whether the people live in open towns or in fortified cities. 
NUM.13.20	Find out whether the soil is fertile and whether the land is wooded. And be sure to bring back some of the fruit that grows there.” (It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.)
NUM.13.21	So the men went north and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin in the south all the way to Rehob, near Hamath Pass in the north. 
NUM.13.22	They went first into the southern part of the land and came to Hebron, where the clans of Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of a race of giants called the Anakim, lived. (Hebron was founded seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	They came to Eshcol Valley, and there they cut off a branch which had one bunch of grapes on it so heavy that it took two men to carry it on a pole between them. They also brought back some pomegranates and figs. ( 
NUM.13.24	That place was named Eshcol
NUM.13.25	After exploring the land for forty days, the spies returned 
NUM.13.26	to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They reported what they had seen and showed them the fruit they had brought. 
NUM.13.27	They told Moses, “We explored the land and found it to be rich and fertile; and here is some of its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	But the people who live there are powerful, and their cities are very large and well fortified. Even worse, we saw the descendants of the giants there. 
NUM.13.29	Amalekites live in the southern part of the land; Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and Canaanites live by the Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan River.”
NUM.13.30	Caleb silenced the people who were complaining against
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone with Caleb said, “No, we are not strong enough to attack them; the people there are more powerful than we are.” 
NUM.13.32	So they spread a false report among the Israelites about the land they had explored. They said, “That land doesn't even produce enough to feed the people who live there. Everyone we saw was very tall, 
NUM.13.33	 and we even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak. We felt as small as grasshoppers, and that is how we must have looked to them.”
NUM.14.1	All night long the people cried out in distress. 
NUM.14.2	They complained against Moses and Aaron, and said, “It would have been better to die in Egypt or even here in the wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why is the 
NUM.14.4	So they said to one another, “Let's choose a leader and go back to Egypt!”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron bowed to the ground in front of all the people. 
NUM.14.6	And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of the spies, tore their clothes in sorrow 
NUM.14.7	and said to the people, “The land we explored is an excellent land.

NUM.14.15	Now if you kill all your people, the nations who have heard of your fame will say 
NUM.14.16	that you killed your people in the wilderness because you were not able to bring them into the land you promised to give them.

NUM.14.22	none of these people will live to enter that land. They have seen the dazzling light of my presence and the miracles that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, but they have tried my patience over and over again and have refused to obey me. 
NUM.14.23	They will never enter the land which I promised to their ancestors. None of those who have rejected me will ever enter it. 
NUM.14.24	 But because my servant Caleb has a different attitude and has remained loyal to me, I will bring him into the land which he explored, and his descendants will possess the land 
NUM.14.25	in whose valleys the Amalekites and the Canaanites now live. Turn back tomorrow and go into the wilderness in the direction of the Gulf of Aqaba.”

NUM.14.28	Now give them this answer: ‘I swear that as surely as I live, I will do to you just what you have asked. I, the 
NUM.14.29	 You will die and your corpses will be scattered across this wilderness. Because you have complained against me, none of you over twenty years of age will enter that land. 
NUM.14.30	I promised to let you live there, but not one of you will, except Caleb and Joshua. 
NUM.14.31	You said that your children would be captured, but I will bring them into the land that you rejected, and it will be their home. 
NUM.14.32	You will die here in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	 Your children will wander in the wilderness for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last one of you dies. 
NUM.14.34	You will suffer the consequences of your sin for forty years, one year for each of the forty days you spent exploring the land. You will know what it means to have me against you!

NUM.15.4+NUM.15.5	Whoever presents a sheep or a goat as a burnt offering to the 
NUM.15.6	When a ram is offered, 4 pounds of flour mixed with 3 pints of olive oil are to be presented as a grain offering, 
NUM.15.7	together with 3 pints of wine. The odor of these sacrifices is pleasing to the 
NUM.15.8	When a bull is offered to the 
NUM.15.9	a grain offering of 6 pounds of flour mixed with 4 pints of olive oil is to be presented, 
NUM.15.10	together with 4 pints of wine. The odor of this sacrifice is pleasing to the 
NUM.15.11	That is what shall be offered with each bull, ram, sheep, or goat. 
NUM.15.12	When more than one animal is offered, the accompanying offering is to be increased proportionately. 
NUM.15.13	All native Israelites are to do this when they present a food offering, an odor pleasing to the 
NUM.15.14	And if at any time foreigners living among you, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis, make a food offering, an odor that pleases the 
NUM.15.15	For all time to come, the same
NUM.15.16	 the same laws and regulations apply to you and to them.
NUM.15.17	The 
NUM.15.18	the following regulations for the people of Israel to observe in the land that he was going to give them. 
NUM.15.19	When any food produced there is eaten, some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to the

NUM.15.25	The priest shall perform the ritual of purification for the community, and they will be forgiven, because the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to the 
NUM.15.26	The whole community of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, because everyone was involved in the mistake.
NUM.15.28	At the altar the priest shall perform the ritual of purification to purify you from your sin, and you will be forgiven. 
NUM.15.29	The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin, whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners.
NUM.15.30	But any who sin deliberately, whether they are natives or foreigners, are guilty of treating the 
NUM.15.31	because they have rejected what the 
NUM.15.32	Once, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath. 
NUM.15.33	He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community, 
NUM.15.34	and was put under guard, because it was not clear what should be done with him. 
NUM.15.35	Then the 
NUM.15.36	So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the

NUM.15.38	 to say to the people of Israel: “Make tassels on the corners of your garments and put a blue cord on each tassel. You are to do this for all time to come.

NUM.16.4	When Moses heard this, he threw himself on the ground and prayed. 
NUM.16.5	Then he said to Korah and his followers, “Tomorrow morning the 
NUM.16.6+NUM.16.7	Tomorrow morning you and your followers take fire pans, put live coals and incense on them, and take them to the altar. Then we will see which of us the 
NUM.16.8	Moses continued to speak to Korah. “Listen, you Levites! 
NUM.16.9	Do you consider it a small matter that the God of Israel has set you apart from the rest of the community, so that you can approach him, perform your service in the 
NUM.16.10	He has let you and all the other Levites have this honor—and now you are trying to get the priesthood too! 
NUM.16.11	When you complain against Aaron, it is really against the 
NUM.16.12	Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said, “We will not come! 
NUM.16.13	Isn't it enough that you have brought us out of the fertile land of Egypt to kill us here in the wilderness? Do you also have to lord it over us? 
NUM.16.14	You certainly have not brought us into a fertile land or given us fields and vineyards as our possession, and now you are trying to deceive us. We will not come!”
NUM.16.15	Moses became angry and said to the 
NUM.16.16	Moses said to Korah, “Tomorrow you and your 250 followers must come to the Tent of the 
NUM.16.17	Each of you will take his fire pan, put incense on it, and then present it at the altar.” 
NUM.16.18	So they each took their fire pans, put live coals and incense on them, and stood at the entrance of the Tent with Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	Then Korah gathered the whole community, and they stood facing Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the Tent. Suddenly the dazzling light of the 
NUM.16.20	and the 
NUM.16.21	“Move back from these people, and I will destroy them immediately.”
NUM.16.22	But Moses and Aaron bowed down with their faces to the ground and said, “O God, you are the source of all life. When one of us sins, do you become angry with the whole community?”
NUM.16.23	The 
NUM.16.24	“Tell the people to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
NUM.16.25	Then Moses, accompanied by the leaders of Israel, went to Dathan and Abiram. 
NUM.16.26	He said to the people, “Get away from the tents of these wicked men and don't touch anything that belongs to them. Otherwise, you will be wiped out with them for all their sins.” 
NUM.16.27	So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
NUM.16.27	Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at the entrance of their tents, with their wives and children. 
NUM.16.28	Moses said to the people, “This is how you will know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die a natural death without some punishment from God, then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	As soon as he had finished speaking, the ground under Dathan and Abiram split open 
NUM.16.32	and swallowed them and their families, together with all of Korah's followers and their possessions. 
NUM.16.33	So they went down alive to the world of the dead, with their possessions. The earth closed over them, and they vanished. 
NUM.16.34	All the people of Israel who were there fled when they heard their cry. They shouted, “Run! The earth might swallow us too!”

NUM.16.36	Then the 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the bronze fire pans from the remains of those who have been burned, and scatter the coals from the fire pans somewhere else, because the fire pans are holy. 
NUM.16.38	They became holy when they were presented at the 
NUM.16.39	So Eleazar the priest took the fire pans and had them beaten into thin plates to make a covering for the altar. 
NUM.16.40	This was a warning to the Israelites that no one who was not a descendant of Aaron should come to the altar to burn incense for the 
NUM.16.41	The next day the whole community complained against Moses and Aaron and said, “You have killed some of the 
NUM.16.42	After they had all gathered to protest to Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the Tent and saw that the cloud was covering it and that the dazzling light of the 
NUM.16.43	Moses and Aaron went and stood in front of the Tent, 
NUM.16.44	 and the 
NUM.16.45	“Move back from these people, and I will destroy them on the spot!”
NUM.16.45	The two of them bowed down with their faces to the ground, 
NUM.16.46	and Moses said to Aaron, “Take your fire pan, put live coals from the altar in it, and put some incense on the coals. Then hurry with it to the people and perform the ritual of purification for them. Hurry! The 
NUM.16.47	Aaron obeyed, took his fire pan and ran into the middle of the assembled people. When he saw that the plague had already begun, he put the incense on the coals and performed the ritual of purification for the people. 
NUM.16.48	This stopped the plague, and he was left standing between the living and the dead. 
NUM.16.49	The number of people who died was 14,700, not counting those who died in Korah's rebellion. 
NUM.16.50	When the plague had stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent.
NUM.17.1	The 
NUM.17.2	“Tell the people of Israel to give you twelve walking sticks, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man's name on his stick 
NUM.17.3	and then write Aaron's name on the stick representing Levi. There will be one stick for each tribal leader. 
NUM.17.4	Take them to the Tent of my presence and put them in front of the Covenant Box, where I meet you. 
NUM.17.5	Then the stick of the man I have chosen will sprout. In this way I will put a stop to the constant complaining of these Israelites against you.”
NUM.17.6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a stick, one for each tribe, twelve in all, and Aaron's stick was put with them. 
NUM.17.7	Moses then put all the sticks in the Tent in front of the 
NUM.17.9	Moses took all the sticks and showed them to the Israelites. They saw what had happened, and each leader took his own stick back. 
NUM.17.10	The 
NUM.17.11	Moses did as the 
NUM.17.12	The people of Israel said to Moses, “Then that's the end of us! 
NUM.17.13	If anyone who even comes near the Tent must die, then we are all as good as dead!”
NUM.18.1	The 
NUM.18.2	Bring in your relatives, the tribe of Levi, to work with you and help you while you and your sons are serving at the Tent. 
NUM.18.3	They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the Tent, but they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar. If they do, both they and you will be put to death. 
NUM.18.4	They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the Tent, but no unqualified person may work with you. 
NUM.18.5	You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar, so that my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel. 
NUM.18.6	I am the one who has chosen your relatives the Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you. They are dedicated to me, so that they can carry out their duties in the Tent. 
NUM.18.7	But you and your sons alone shall fulfill all the responsibilities of the priesthood that concern the altar and what is in the Most Holy Place. These things are your responsibility, because I have given you the gift of the priesthood. Any unqualified person who comes near the sacred objects shall be put to death.”
NUM.18.8	The 
NUM.18.9	Of the most sacred offerings not burned on the altar, the following belong to you: the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the repayment offerings. Everything that is presented to me as a sacred offering belongs to you and your sons. 
NUM.18.10	You must eat these things in a holy place, and only males may eat them; consider them holy.
NUM.18.11	“In addition, any other special contributions that the Israelites present to me shall be yours. I am giving them to you, your sons, and your daughters for all time to come. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat them.
NUM.18.12	“I am giving you all the best of the first produce which the Israelites give me each year: olive oil, wine, and grain. 
NUM.18.13	It all belongs to you. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat it.
NUM.18.15	“Every first-born child or animal that the Israelites present to me belongs to you. But you must accept payment to buy back every first-born child, and must also accept payment for every first-born animal that is ritually unclean. 
NUM.18.16	Children shall be bought back at the age of one month for the fixed price of five pieces of silver, according to the official standard. 
NUM.18.17	But the first-born of cows, sheep, and goats are not to be bought back; they belong completely to me and are to be sacrificed. Throw their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an odor pleasing to me. 
NUM.18.18	The meat from them belongs to you, like the breast and the right hind leg of the special offering.
NUM.18.19	“I am giving to you, to your sons, and to your daughters, for all time to come, all the special contributions which the Israelites present to me. This is an unbreakable covenant that I have made with you and your descendants.”
NUM.18.20	The 
NUM.18.22	The other Israelites must no longer approach the Tent and in this way bring on themselves the penalty of death. 
NUM.18.23	From now on only the Levites will take care of the Tent and bear the full responsibility for it. This is a permanent rule that applies also to your descendants. The Levites shall have no permanent property in Israel, 
NUM.18.24	because I have given to them as their possession the tithe which the Israelites present to me as a special contribution. That is why I told them that they would have no permanent property in Israel.”
NUM.18.25	The 
NUM.18.26	to say to the Levites: “When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that the 
NUM.18.27	This special contribution will be considered as the equivalent of the offering which the farmer makes of new grain and new wine. 
NUM.18.28	In this way you also will present the special contribution that belongs to the 
NUM.18.29	Give it from the best that you receive. 
NUM.18.30	When you have presented the best part, you may keep the rest, just as the farmer keeps what is left after he makes his offering. 
NUM.18.31	You and your families may eat the rest anywhere, because it is your wages for your service in the Tent. 
NUM.18.32	You will not become guilty when you eat it, as long as you have presented the best of it to the 
NUM.19.1	The 
NUM.19.2	to give the Israelites the following regulations. Bring to Moses and Aaron a red cow which has no defects and which has never been worked, 
NUM.19.3	and they will give it to Eleazar the priest. It is to be taken outside the camp and killed in his presence.
NUM.19.4	Then Eleazar is to take some of its blood and with his finger sprinkle it seven times in the direction of the Tent. 
NUM.19.5	The whole animal, including skin, meat, blood, and intestines, is to be burned in the presence of the priest. 
NUM.19.6	Then he is to take some cedar wood, a sprig of hyssop, and a red cord and throw them into the fire. 
NUM.19.7	After that, he is to wash his clothes and pour water over himself, and then he may enter the camp; but he remains ritually unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.8	The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and pour water over himself, but he also remains unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.9	 Then someone who is ritually clean is to collect the ashes of the cow and put them in a ritually clean place outside the camp, where they are to be kept for the Israelite community to use in preparing the water for removing ritual uncleanness. This ritual is performed to remove sin. 
NUM.19.10	The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes, but he remains unclean until evening. This regulation is valid for all time to come, both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them.
NUM.19.11	Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.12	They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day, and then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day, they will not be clean. 
NUM.19.13	Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the 
NUM.19.14	In the case of a person who dies in a tent, anyone who is in the tent at the time of death or who enters it becomes ritually unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.15	Every jar and pot in the tent that has no lid
NUM.19.16	If any touch a person who has been killed or has died a natural death outdoors or if any touch a human bone or a grave, they become unclean for seven days.
NUM.19.17	To remove the uncleanness, some ashes from the red cow which was burned to remove sin shall be taken and put in a pot, and fresh water added. 
NUM.19.18	In the first case, someone who is ritually clean is to take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, everything in it, and the people who were there. In the second case, someone who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on those who had touched the human bone or the dead body or the grave. 
NUM.19.19	On the third day and on the seventh the person who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on the unclean persons. On the seventh day he is to purify those, who, after washing their clothes and pouring water over themselves, become ritually clean at sunset.
NUM.19.20	Those who have become ritually unclean and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the 
NUM.19.21	You are to observe this rule for all time to come. The person who sprinkles the water for purification must also wash his clothes; anyone who touches the water remains ritually unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.22	Whatever an unclean person touches is unclean, and anyone else who touches it remains unclean until evening.
NUM.20.1	In the first month the whole community of Israel came to the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
NUM.20.3	and complained: “It would have been better if we had died in front of the 
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought us out into this wilderness? Just so that we can die here with our animals? 
NUM.20.5	Why did you bring us out of Egypt into this miserable place where nothing will grow? There's no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates. There is not even any water to drink!” 
NUM.20.6	Moses and Aaron moved away from the people and stood at the entrance of the Tent. They bowed down with their faces to the ground, and the dazzling light of the 
NUM.20.7	The 
NUM.20.8	“Take the stick that is in front of the Covenant Box, and then you and Aaron assemble the whole community. There in front of them all speak to that rock over there, and water will gush out of it. In this way you will bring water out of the rock for the people, for them and their animals to drink.” 
NUM.20.9	Moses went and got the stick, as the 
NUM.20.10	He and Aaron assembled the whole community in front of the rock, and Moses said, “Listen, you rebels! Do we have to get water out of this rock for you?” 
NUM.20.11	 Then Moses raised the stick and struck the rock twice with it, and a great stream of water gushed out, and all the people and animals drank.
NUM.20.12	But the 
NUM.20.13	This happened at Meribah,
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. They said, “This message is from your kinsmen, the tribes of Israel. You know the hardships we have suffered, 
NUM.20.15	how our ancestors went to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us, 
NUM.20.16	and we cried to the 
NUM.20.17	Please permit us to pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink from your wells. We will stay on the main road
NUM.20.18	But the Edomites answered, “We refuse to let you pass through our country! If you try, we will march out and attack you.”
NUM.20.19	The people of Israel said, “We will stay on the main road, and if we or our animals drink any of your water, we will pay for it—all we want is to pass through.”
NUM.20.20	The Edomites repeated, “We refuse!” and they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel. 
NUM.20.21	Because the Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory, the Israelites turned and went another way.
NUM.20.22	The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor, 
NUM.20.23	on the border of Edom. There the 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron is not going to enter the land which I promised to give to Israel; he is going to die, because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor, 
NUM.20.26	and there remove Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. Aaron is going to die there.” 
NUM.20.27	Moses did what the 
NUM.20.28	 and Moses removed Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. There on the top of the mountain Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar came back down. 
NUM.20.29	The whole community learned that Aaron had died, and they all mourned for him for thirty days.
NUM.21.2	Then the Israelites made a vow to the 
NUM.21.3	The 
NUM.21.5	 and spoke against God and Moses. They complained, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no food or water? We can't stand any more of this miserable food!” 
NUM.21.6	Then the 
NUM.21.7	The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the 
NUM.21.8	Then the 
NUM.21.9	 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who had been bitten would look at the bronze snake and be healed.
NUM.21.10	The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory. 
NUM.21.12	Then they camped in Zered Valley. 
NUM.21.13	From there they moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness which extends into Amorite territory. (The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.) 
NUM.21.14	That is why 
NUM.21.15	and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	From there they went on to a place called Wells, where the 
NUM.21.17	At that time the people of Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Wells, produce your water;
NUM.21.17	And we will greet it with a song—
NUM.21.18	The well dug by princes
NUM.21.18	And by leaders of the people,
NUM.21.18	Dug with a royal scepter
NUM.21.18	And with their walking sticks.”
NUM.21.18	They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert.
NUM.21.21	Then the people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say: 
NUM.21.22	“Let us pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road and go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink water from your wells; we will stay on the main road
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not permit the people of Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered his army and went out to Jahaz in the wilderness and attacked the Israelites. 
NUM.21.24	But the Israelites killed many of the enemy in battle and occupied their land from the Arnon River north to the Jabbok, that is, to the Ammonites, because the Ammonite border was strongly defended.
NUM.21.25	So the people of Israel captured all the Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all the surrounding towns, and settled in them. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the capital city of the Amorite king Sihon, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had captured all his land as far as the Arnon River. 
NUM.21.27	That is why the poets sing,
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon, to King Sihon's city!
NUM.21.27	We want to see it rebuilt and restored.
NUM.21.28	Sihon's army went forth like a fire;
NUM.21.28	It destroyed the city of Ar in Moab
NUM.21.28	And devoured
NUM.21.29	How terrible for you, people of Moab!
NUM.21.29	You worshipers of Chemosh are brought to ruin!
NUM.21.29	Your god let the men become refugees,
NUM.21.29	And the women became captives of the Amorite king.
NUM.21.30	But now their descendants are destroyed,
NUM.21.30	All the way from Heshbon to Dibon,
NUM.21.30	From Nashim to Nophah, near Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	So the people of Israel settled in the territory of the Amorites, 
NUM.21.32	and Moses sent men to find the best way to attack the city of Jazer. The Israelites captured it and its surrounding towns and drove out the Amorites living there.
NUM.21.33	Then the Israelites turned and took the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan marched out with his army to attack them at Edrei. 
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	So the Israelites killed Og, his sons, and all his people, leaving no survivors, and then they occupied his land.
NUM.22.1	The Israelites moved on and set up camp in the plains of Moab east of the Jordan and opposite Jericho.
NUM.22.2	When the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, heard what the Israelites had done to the Amorites and how many Israelites there were, 
NUM.22.3	he and all his people became terrified. 
NUM.22.4	The Moabites said to the leaders of the Midianites, “This horde will soon destroy everything around us, like a bull eating the grass in a pasture.” So King Balak 
NUM.22.5	 sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor near the Euphrates River in the land of Amaw. They brought him this message from Balak: “I want you to know that a whole nation has come from Egypt; its people are spreading out everywhere and threatening to take over our land. 
NUM.22.6	They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then perhaps we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse.”
NUM.22.7	So the Moabite and Midianite leaders took with them the payment for the curse, went to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message. 
NUM.22.8	Balaam said to them, “Spend the night here, and tomorrow I will report to you whatever the 
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these people that are staying with you?”
NUM.22.10	He answered, “King Balak of Moab has sent them to tell me 
NUM.22.11	that a people who came from Egypt has spread out over the whole land. He wants me to curse them for him, so that he can fight them and drive them out.”
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them, and do not put a curse on the people of Israel, because they have my blessing.”
NUM.22.13	The next morning Balaam went to Balak's messengers and said, “Go back home; the 
NUM.22.14	So they returned to Balak and told him that Balaam had refused to come with them.
NUM.22.15	Then Balak sent a larger number of leaders, who were more important than the first. 
NUM.22.16	They went to Balaam and gave him this message from Balak: “Please don't let anything prevent you from coming to me! 
NUM.22.17	I will reward you richly and do anything you say. Please come and curse these people for me.”
NUM.22.18	But Balaam answered, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not disobey the command of the 
NUM.22.19	But please spend the night, as the others did, so that I may learn whether or not the 
NUM.22.20	That night God came to Balaam and said, “If these men have come to ask you to go with them, get ready and go, but do only what I tell you.” 
NUM.22.21	So the next morning Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite leaders.
NUM.22.22	God was angry that Balaam was going, and as Balaam was riding along on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants, the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	When the donkey saw the angel standing there holding a sword, it left the road and turned into the fields. Balaam beat the donkey and brought it back onto the road. 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel stood where the road narrowed between two vineyards and had a stone wall on each side. 
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel, it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey. 
NUM.22.26	Once more the angel moved ahead; he stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side. 
NUM.22.27	This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick. 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	Balaam answered, “Because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.”
NUM.22.30	The donkey replied, “Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” he answered.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	The angel demanded, “Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.
NUM.22.33	But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it hadn't, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.”
NUM.22.34	Balaam replied, “I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me; but now if you think it is wrong for me to go on, I will return home.”
NUM.22.35	But the angel said, “Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.” So Balaam went on with them.
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to him, “Why didn't you come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I wasn't able to reward you enough?”
NUM.22.38	Balaam answered, “I came, didn't I? But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say.” 
NUM.22.39	So Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth, 
NUM.22.40	where Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
NUM.22.41	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel.
NUM.23.1	He said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”
NUM.23.2	Balak did as he was told, and he and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I go to see whether or not the 
NUM.23.4	and God met him. Balaam said to him, “I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.”
NUM.23.5	The 
NUM.23.6	So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering with all the leaders of Moab.
NUM.23.7	Balaam uttered this prophecy:
NUM.23.7	“Balak king of Moab has brought me
NUM.23.7	From Syria, from the eastern mountains.
NUM.23.7	‘Come speak for me,’ he said.
NUM.23.7	‘Put a curse on the people of Israel.’
NUM.23.8	How can I curse what God has not cursed,
NUM.23.8	Or speak of doom when the 
NUM.23.9	From the high rocks I can see them;
NUM.23.9	I can watch them from the hills.
NUM.23.9	They are a nation that lives alone;
NUM.23.9	They know they are blessed more than other nations.
NUM.23.10	The descendants of Israel are like the dust—
NUM.23.10	There are too many of them to be counted.
NUM.23.10	Let me end my days like one of God's people;
NUM.23.10	Let me die in peace like the righteous.”
NUM.23.11	Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them.”
NUM.23.12	He answered, “I can say only what the 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place from which you can see only some of the Israelites. Curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	He took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Mount Pisgah. There also he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each of them.
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, and I will meet God over there.”
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what the 
NUM.23.18	and Balaam uttered this prophecy:
NUM.23.18	“Come, Balak son of Zippor,
NUM.23.18	And listen to what I have to say.
NUM.23.19	God is not like people, who lie;
NUM.23.19	He is not a human who changes his mind.
NUM.23.19	Whatever he promises, he does;
NUM.23.19	He speaks, and it is done.
NUM.23.20	I have been instructed to bless,
NUM.23.20	And when God blesses, I cannot call it back.
NUM.23.21	I foresee that Israel's future
NUM.23.21	Will bring her no misfortune or trouble.
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	They proclaim that he is their king.
NUM.23.22	God has brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	He fights for them like a wild ox.
NUM.23.23	There is no magic charm, no witchcraft,
NUM.23.23	That can be used against the nation of Israel.
NUM.23.23	Now people will say about Israel,
NUM.23.23	‘Look what God has done!’
NUM.23.24	The nation of Israel is like a mighty lion:
NUM.23.24	It doesn't rest until it has torn and devoured,
NUM.23.24	Until it has drunk the blood of those it has killed.”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “You refuse to curse the people of Israel, but at least don't bless them!”
NUM.23.26	Balaam answered, “Didn't I tell you that I had to do everything that the 
NUM.23.27	Balak said, “Come with me, and I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert. 
NUM.23.29	Balaam said to him, “Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did as he was told, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	By now Balaam knew that the 
NUM.24.2	and saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe. The spirit of God took control of him, 
NUM.24.3	and he uttered this prophecy:
NUM.24.3	“The message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	The words of the man who can see clearly,
NUM.24.4	Who can hear what God is saying.
NUM.24.4	With staring eyes I see in a trance
NUM.24.4	A vision from Almighty God.
NUM.24.5	The tents of Israel are beautiful,
NUM.24.6	Like long rows of palms
NUM.24.6	Or gardens beside a river,
NUM.24.6	Like aloes planted by the 
NUM.24.6	Or cedars beside the water.
NUM.24.7	They will have abundant rainfall
NUM.24.7	And plant their seed in well-watered fields.
NUM.24.7	Their king shall be greater than Agag,
NUM.24.7	And his rule shall be extended far and wide.
NUM.24.8	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	He fights for them like a wild ox.
NUM.24.8	They devour their enemies,
NUM.24.8	Crush their bones, smash their arrows.
NUM.24.9	When it is sleeping, no one dares wake it.
NUM.24.9	Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed,
NUM.24.9	And whoever curses Israel will be cursed.”
NUM.24.10	Balak clenched his fists in anger and said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but three times now you have blessed them instead. 
NUM.24.11	Now get on home! I promised to reward you, but the 
NUM.24.12	Balaam answered, “I told the messengers you sent to me that 
NUM.24.13	even if you gave me all the silver and gold in your palace, I could not disobey the command of the 
NUM.24.14	Balaam said to Balak, “Now I am going back to my own people, but before I go, I am warning you what the people of Israel will do to your people in the future.” 
NUM.24.15	Then he uttered this prophecy:
NUM.24.15	“The message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	The words of the man who can see clearly,
NUM.24.16	Who can hear what God is saying
NUM.24.16	And receive the knowledge that comes from the Most High.
NUM.24.16	With staring eyes I see in a trance
NUM.24.16	A vision from Almighty God.
NUM.24.17	I look into the future,
NUM.24.17	And I see the nation of Israel.
NUM.24.17	A king, like a bright star, will arise in that nation.
NUM.24.17	Like a comet he will come from Israel.
NUM.24.17	He will strike the leaders of Moab
NUM.24.17	And beat down all the people of Seth.
NUM.24.18	He will conquer his enemies in Edom
NUM.24.18	And make their land his property,
NUM.24.18	While Israel continues victorious.
NUM.24.19	The nation of Israel will trample them down
NUM.24.19	And wipe out the last survivors.”
NUM.24.20	Then in his vision Balaam saw the Amalekites and uttered this prophecy:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the most powerful nation of all,
NUM.24.20	But at the end it will perish forever.”
NUM.24.21	In his vision he saw the Kenites, and uttered this prophecy:
NUM.24.21	“The place where you live is secure,
NUM.24.21	Safe as a nest set high on a cliff,
NUM.24.22	But you Kenites will be destroyed
NUM.24.22	When Assyria takes you captive.”
NUM.24.23	Balaam uttered this prophecy:
NUM.24.23	“Who are these people gathering in the north?
NUM.24.24	Invaders will sail from Cyprus;
NUM.24.24	They will conquer Assyria and Eber,
NUM.24.24	But they, in turn, will perish forever.”
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam got ready and went back home, and Balak went on his way.
NUM.25.1	When the Israelites were camped at Acacia Valley, the men began to have sexual intercourse with the Moabite women who were there. 
NUM.25.2	These women invited them to sacrificial feasts, where the god of Moab was worshiped. The Israelites ate the food and worshiped the god 
NUM.25.3	Baal of Peor. So the 
NUM.25.4	and said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of Israel and, in obedience to me, execute them in broad daylight,
NUM.25.5	Moses said to the officials, “Each of you is to kill every man in your tribe who has become a worshiper of Baal of Peor.”
NUM.25.6	One of the Israelites took a Midianite woman into his tent in the sight of Moses and the whole community, while they were mourning at the entrance of the Tent of the 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, saw this, he got up and left the assembly. He took a spear, 
NUM.25.8	followed the man and the woman into the tent, and drove the spear through both of them. In this way the epidemic that was destroying Israel was stopped, 
NUM.25.9	but it had already killed twenty-four thousand people.
NUM.25.10	The 
NUM.25.11	“Because of what Phinehas has done, I am no longer angry with the people of Israel. He refused to tolerate the worship of any god but me, and that is why I did not destroy them in my anger. 
NUM.25.12	So tell him that I am making a covenant with him that is valid for all time to come. 
NUM.25.13	He and his descendants are permanently established as priests, because he did not tolerate any rivals to me and brought about forgiveness for the people's sin.”

NUM.26.61	 Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unholy fire to the 
NUM.26.62	The male Levites who were one month old or older numbered 23,000. They were listed separately from the rest of the Israelites, because they were not given any property in Israel.

NUM.27.6	and the 
NUM.27.7	 “What the daughters of Zelophehad request is right; give them property among their father's relatives. Let his inheritance pass on to them.

NUM.27.10	If he has no brothers, his father's brothers are to inherit it. 
NUM.27.11	If he has no brothers or uncles, then his nearest relative is to inherit it and hold it as his own property. The people of Israel are to observe this as a legal requirement, just as I, the 
NUM.27.13	After you have seen it, you will die, as your brother Aaron did, 
NUM.27.14	because both of you rebelled against my command in the wilderness of Zin. When the whole community complained against me at Meribah, you refused to acknowledge my holy power before them.” (Meribah is the spring at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
NUM.27.15	Moses prayed, 
NUM.27.16	“
NUM.27.17	 and can command them in battle, so that your community will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”
NUM.27.19	Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole community, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor. 
NUM.27.20	Give him some of your own authority, so that the whole community of Israel will obey him. 
NUM.27.21	 He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim.

NUM.29.39	These are the regulations concerning the burnt offerings, grain offerings, wine offerings, and fellowship offerings that you are to make to the 
NUM.29.40	So Moses told the people of Israel everything that the 
NUM.30.1	Moses gave the following instructions to the leaders of the tribes of Israel. 
NUM.30.2	 When a man makes a vow to give something to the 
NUM.30.3	When a young woman still living in her father's house makes a vow to give something to the 
NUM.30.4	she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it. 
NUM.30.5	But if her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The 
NUM.30.6	If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries, 
NUM.30.7	she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it. 
NUM.30.8	But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The 
NUM.30.9	A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something.
NUM.30.10	If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something, 
NUM.30.11	she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it. 
NUM.30.12	But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The 
NUM.30.13	Her husband has the right to affirm or to annul any vow or promise that she has made. 
NUM.30.14	But if, by the day after he hears of the vow, he has raised no objection, she must do everything that she has vowed or promised. He has affirmed the vow by not objecting on the day he heard of it. 
NUM.30.15	But if he later annuls the vow, he must suffer the consequences for the failure to fulfill the vow.
NUM.30.16	These are the rules that the 
NUM.31.1	The 
NUM.31.2	“Punish the Midianites for what they did to the people of Israel. After you have done that, you will die.”
NUM.31.3	So Moses said to the people, “Get ready for war, so that you can attack Midian and punish them for what they did to the 
NUM.31.4	From each tribe of Israel send a thousand men to war.”
NUM.31.5	So a thousand men were chosen from each tribe, a total of twelve thousand men ready for battle. 
NUM.31.6	Moses sent them to war under the command of Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took charge of the sacred objects and the trumpets for giving signals. 
NUM.31.7	They attacked Midian, as the 
NUM.31.8	including the five kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor.
NUM.31.9	The people of Israel captured the Midianite women and children, took their cattle and their flocks, plundered all their wealth, 
NUM.31.10	and burned all their cities and camps. 
NUM.31.11	They took all the loot that they had captured, including the prisoners and the animals, 
NUM.31.12	and brought them to Moses and Eleazar and to the community of the people of Israel, who were at the camp on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.
NUM.31.13	Moses, Eleazar, and all the other leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet the army. 
NUM.31.14	Moses became angry with the officers, the commanders of battalions and companies, who had returned from the war. 
NUM.31.15	He asked them, “Why have you kept all the women alive? 
NUM.31.16	 Remember that it was the women who followed Balaam's instructions and at Peor led the people to be unfaithful to the 
NUM.31.17	So now kill every boy and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse, 
NUM.31.18	but keep alive for yourselves all the girls and all the women who are virgins. 
NUM.31.19	Now all of you who have killed anyone or have touched a corpse must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day purify yourselves and the women you have captured. 
NUM.31.20	You must also purify every piece of clothing and everything made of leather, goats' hair, or wood.”
NUM.31.21	Eleazar the priest said to the men who had returned from battle, “These are the regulations that the 
NUM.31.22+NUM.31.23	Everything that will not burn, such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead, is to be purified by passing it through fire. Everything else is to be purified by the water for purification. 
NUM.31.24	On the seventh day you must wash your clothes; then you will be ritually clean and will be permitted to enter the camp.”
NUM.31.25	The 
NUM.31.26	“You and Eleazar, together with the other leaders of the community, are to count everything that has been captured, including the prisoners and the animals. 
NUM.31.27	Divide what was taken into two equal parts, one part for the soldiers and the other part for the rest of the community. 
NUM.31.28	From the part that belongs to the soldiers, withhold as a tax for the 
NUM.31.29	Give them to Eleazar the priest as a special contribution to the 
NUM.31.30	From the part given to the rest of the people, take one out of every fifty prisoners and the same proportion of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats. Give them to the Levites who are in charge of the 
NUM.31.31	Moses and Eleazar did what the 
NUM.31.32+NUM.31.33+NUM.31.34+NUM.31.35	The following is a list of what was captured by the soldiers, in addition to what they kept for themselves: 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins. 
NUM.31.36+NUM.31.37+NUM.31.38+NUM.31.39+NUM.31.40	The half share of the soldiers was 337,500 sheep and goats, of which 675 were the tax for the 
NUM.31.41	So Moses gave Eleazar the tax as a special contribution to the 
NUM.31.42+NUM.31.43+NUM.31.44+NUM.31.45+NUM.31.46	The share of the community was the same as that for the soldiers: 337,500 sheep and goats, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 virgins. 
NUM.31.47	From this share Moses took one out of every fifty prisoners and animals, and as the 
NUM.31.48	Then the officers who had commanded the army went to Moses 
NUM.31.49	and reported, “Sir, we have counted the soldiers under our command and not one of them is missing. 
NUM.31.50	So we are bringing the gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces that each of us has taken. We offer them to the 
NUM.31.51	Moses and Eleazar received the gold, all of which was in the form of ornaments. 
NUM.31.52	The total contribution of the officers weighed over four hundred pounds. 
NUM.31.53	Those who were not officers kept the loot they had taken. 
NUM.31.54	So Moses and Eleazar took the gold to the Tent, so that the 
NUM.32.1	The tribes of Reuben and Gad had a lot of livestock. When they saw how suitable the land of Jazer and Gilead was for cattle, 
NUM.32.2	they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of the community and said, 
NUM.32.3+NUM.32.4	“This region which the 
NUM.32.5	Please give us this land as our property, and do not make us cross the Jordan River and settle there.”
NUM.32.6	Moses replied, “Do you want to stay here while the other Israelites go to war? 
NUM.32.7	How dare you try to discourage the people of Israel from crossing the Jordan into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	 That is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. 
NUM.32.9	They went as far as Eshcol Valley and saw the land, but when they returned, they discouraged the people from entering the land which the 
NUM.32.10	 The 
NUM.32.11	‘I swear that because they did not remain loyal to me, none of the men twenty years old or older who came out of Egypt will enter the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ 
NUM.32.12	This included everyone, except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun; they remained loyal to the 
NUM.32.13	The 
NUM.32.14	And now you have taken your ancestors' place, a new generation of sinful people ready to bring down the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	If you people of Reuben and Gad refuse to follow him now, he will once again abandon all these people in the wilderness, and you will be responsible for their destruction.”
NUM.32.16	They approached Moses and said, “First, allow us to build stone enclosures here for our sheep and fortified towns for our dependents. 
NUM.32.17	Then we will be ready to go with the other Israelites into battle and lead the attack until we have settled them in the land that will be theirs. In the meantime, our dependents can live here in the fortified towns, safe from the people of this land. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until all the other Israelites have taken possession of the land assigned to them. 
NUM.32.19	We will not take possession of any property among them on the other side of the Jordan, because we have received our share here east of the Jordan.”
NUM.32.20	Moses answered, “If you really mean what you say, then here in the presence of the 
NUM.32.21	All your fighting men are to cross the Jordan and under the command of the 
NUM.32.22	and takes possession of the land. After that, you may return, because you will have fulfilled your obligation to the 
NUM.32.23	But if you do not keep your promise, I warn you that you will be sinning against the 
NUM.32.24	So build your towns and the enclosures for your sheep, but do what you have promised!”
NUM.32.25	The men of Gad and Reuben said, “Sir, we will do as you command. 
NUM.32.26	Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep will remain here in the towns of Gilead. 
NUM.32.27	But all of us are ready to go into battle under the 
NUM.32.29	“If the men of Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan ready for battle at the 
NUM.32.30	But if they do not cross the Jordan and go into battle with you, they are to receive their share of the property in the land of Canaan, as you do.”
NUM.32.31	The men of Gad and Reuben answered, “Sir, we will do as the 
NUM.32.32	Under his command we will cross into the land of Canaan and go into battle, so that we can retain our property here east of the Jordan.”
NUM.32.33	So Moses assigned to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half the tribe of Manasseh all the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan, including the towns and the country around them. 
NUM.32.34	The tribe of Gad rebuilt the fortified towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
NUM.32.35	Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran. 
NUM.32.37	The tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	Nebo, Baal Meon (this name was changed), and Sibmah. They gave new names to the towns they rebuilt.
NUM.32.39	The clan of Machir son of Manasseh invaded the land of Gilead, occupied it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.32.40	So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir, and they lived there. 
NUM.32.41	Jair, of the tribe of Manasseh, attacked and captured some villages and named them “Villages of Jair.” 
NUM.32.42	Nobah attacked and captured Kenath and its villages, and he renamed it Nobah, after himself.
NUM.33.1	The following account gives the names of the places where the Israelites set up camp after they left Egypt in their tribes under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.33.2	At the command of the 
NUM.33.3	The people of Israel left Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after the first Passover. Under the 
NUM.33.4	who were burying the first-born sons that the 
NUM.33.5	The people of Israel left Rameses and set up camp at Sukkoth. 
NUM.33.6	Their next camp was at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
NUM.33.7	From there they turned back to Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol. 
NUM.33.8	They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the Red Sea
NUM.33.9	From there they went to Elim, where they camped, because there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees there.
NUM.33.10	They left Elim and camped near the Gulf of Suez. 
NUM.33.11	Their next camp was in the desert of Sin. 
NUM.33.12	Then they camped at Dophkah,

DEU.1.2	It takes eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea by way of the hill country of Edom.)

DEU.1.4	 This was after the 
DEU.1.5	It was while the people were east of the Jordan in the territory of Moab that Moses began to explain God's laws and teachings.
DEU.1.5	He said, 
DEU.1.6	“When we were at Mount Sinai, the 
DEU.1.7	Break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the surrounding regions—to the Jordan Valley, to the hill country and the lowlands, to the southern region, and to the Mediterranean coast. Go to the land of Canaan and on beyond the Lebanon Mountains as far as the great Euphrates River. 
DEU.1.8	All of this is the land which I, the

DEU.1.14	And you agreed that this was a good thing to do. 
DEU.1.15	So I took the wise and experienced leaders you chose from your tribes, and I placed them in charge of you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten. I also appointed other officials throughout the tribes.
DEU.1.16	“At that time I instructed them, ‘Listen to the disputes that come up among your people. Judge every dispute fairly, whether it concerns only your own people or involves foreigners who live among you. 
DEU.1.17	Show no partiality in your decisions; judge everyone on the same basis, no matter who they are. Do not be afraid of anyone, for the decisions you make come from God. If any case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will decide it.’ 
DEU.1.18	At the same time I gave you instructions for everything else you were to do.

DEU.1.23	“That seemed like a good thing to do, so I selected twelve men, one from each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They went into the hill country as far as Eshcol Valley and explored it. 
DEU.1.25	They brought us back some fruit they found there, and reported that the land which the 
DEU.1.27	You grumbled to one another: ‘The 
DEU.1.28	Why should we go there? We are afraid. The men we sent tell us that the people there are stronger and taller than we are, and that they live in cities with walls that reach the sky. They saw giants there!’

DEU.1.35	‘Not one of you from this evil generation will enter the fertile land that I promised to give your ancestors. 
DEU.1.36	Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will enter it. He has remained faithful to me, and I will give him and his descendants the land that he has explored.’

DEU.4.6	Obey them faithfully, and this will show the people of other nations how wise you are. When they hear of all these laws, they will say, ‘What wisdom and understanding this great nation has!’
DEU.4.7	“No other nation, no matter how great, has a god who is so near when they need him as the 
DEU.4.8	No other nation, no matter how great, has laws so just as those that I have taught you today. 
DEU.4.9	Be on your guard! Make certain that you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have seen with your own eyes. Tell your children and your grandchildren 
DEU.4.10	about the day you stood in the presence of the 
DEU.4.12	Tell them how the 
DEU.4.13	 He told you what you must do to keep the covenant he made with you—you must obey the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets. 
DEU.4.14	 The 
DEU.4.15	“When the 
DEU.4.16	 that you do not sin by making for yourselves an idol in any form at all—whether man or woman, 
DEU.4.17	 animal or bird, 
DEU.4.18	reptile or fish. 
DEU.4.19	Do not be tempted to worship and serve what you see in the sky—the sun, the moon, and the stars. The 
DEU.4.20	 But you are the people he rescued from Egypt, that blazing furnace. He brought you out to make you his own people, as you are today. 
DEU.4.21	 Because of you the 
DEU.4.22	I will die in this land and never cross the river, but you are about to go across and occupy that fertile land. 
DEU.4.23	Be certain that you do not forget the covenant that the 
DEU.4.24	 because the 
DEU.4.25	“Even when you have been in the land a long time and have children and grandchildren, do not sin by making for yourselves an idol in any form at all. This is evil in the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that, if you disobey me, you will soon disappear from the land. You will not live very long in the land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy. You will be completely destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	 The 
DEU.4.28	There you will serve gods made by human hands, gods of wood and stone, gods that cannot see or hear, eat or smell. 
DEU.4.29	 There you will look for the 
DEU.4.30	When you are in trouble and all those things happen to you, then you will finally turn to the 
DEU.4.31	He is a merciful God. He will not abandon you or destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant that he himself made with your ancestors.
DEU.4.32	“Search the past, the time before you were born, all the way back to the time when God created human beings on the earth. Search the entire earth. Has anything as great as this ever happened before? Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? 
DEU.4.33	Have any people ever lived after hearing a god speak to them from a fire, as you have? 
DEU.4.34	Has any god ever dared to go and take a people from another nation and make them his own, as the 
DEU.4.35	 The 
DEU.4.36	He let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could instruct you; and here on earth he let you see his holy fire, and he spoke to you from it. 
DEU.4.37	Because he loved your ancestors, he chose you, and by his great power he himself brought you out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.38	As you advanced, he drove out nations greater and more powerful than you, so that he might bring you in and give you their land, the land which still belongs to you. 
DEU.4.39	So remember today and never forget: the 
DEU.4.40	Obey all his laws that I have given you today, and all will go well with you and your descendants. You will continue to live in the land that the 
DEU.4.42	to which a man could escape and be safe if he had accidentally killed someone who had not been his enemy. He could escape to one of these cities and not be put to death. 
DEU.4.43	For the tribe of Reuben there was the city of Bezer, on the desert plateau; for the tribe of Gad there was Ramoth, in the territory of Gilead; and for the tribe of Manasseh there was Golan, in the territory of Bashan.
DEU.4.44	Moses gave God's laws and teachings to the people of Israel. 
DEU.4.45+DEU.4.46	It was after they had come out of Egypt and were in the valley east of the Jordan River, opposite the town of Bethpeor, that he gave them these laws. This was in the territory that had belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites, who had ruled in the town of Heshbon. Moses and the people of Israel defeated him when they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the other Amorite king who lived east of the Jordan. 
DEU.4.48	This land extended from the town of Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River, all the way north to Mount Sirion,
DEU.4.49	It also included all the region east of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea and east to the foot of Mount Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them, “People of Israel, listen to all the laws that I am giving you today. Learn them and be sure that you obey them. 
DEU.5.2	At Mount Sinai the 
DEU.5.3	not only with our fathers, but with all of us who are living today. 
DEU.5.4	There on the mountain the 
DEU.5.5	I stood between you and the 
DEU.5.5	“The 
DEU.5.6	‘I am the 
DEU.5.7	“‘Worship no god but me.
DEU.5.9	 Do not bow down to any idol or worship it, for I am the 
DEU.5.10	But I show my love to thousands of generations
DEU.5.13	 You have six days in which to do your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to me. On that day no one is to work—neither you, your children, your slaves, your animals, nor the foreigners who live in your country. Your slaves must rest just as you do. 
DEU.5.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and that I, the 
DEU.5.23	“When the whole mountain was on fire and you heard the voice from the darkness, your leaders and the chiefs of your tribes came to me 
DEU.5.24	and said, ‘The 
DEU.5.25	But why should we risk death again? That terrible fire will destroy us. We are sure to die if we hear the 
DEU.5.26	Has any human being ever lived after hearing the living God speak from a fire? 
DEU.5.27	Go back, Moses, and listen to everything that the 
DEU.5.28	“When the 
DEU.5.29	If only they would always feel this way! If only they would always honor me and obey all my commands, so that everything would go well with them and their descendants forever. 
DEU.5.30	Go and tell them to return to their tents. 
DEU.5.31	But you, Moses, stay here with me, and I will give you all my laws and commands. Teach them to the people, so that they will obey them in the land that I am giving them.’
DEU.5.32	“People of Israel, be sure that you do everything that the 
DEU.5.33	Obey them all, so that everything will go well with you and so that you will continue to live in the land that you are going to occupy.
DEU.6.1	“These are all the laws that the 
DEU.6.2	As long as you live, you and your descendants are to honor the 
DEU.6.3	Listen to them, people of Israel, and obey them! Then all will go well with you, and you will become a mighty nation and live in that rich and fertile land, just as the 
DEU.6.5	 Love the 
DEU.6.6	 Never forget these commands that I am giving you today. 
DEU.6.7	Teach them to your children. Repeat them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working. 
DEU.6.8	Tie them on your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder. 
DEU.6.9	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.
DEU.6.11	The houses will be full of good things which you did not put in them, and there will be wells that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant. When the 
DEU.6.12	make certain that you do not forget the 
DEU.6.13	 Honor the 
DEU.6.14	Do not worship other gods, any of the gods of the peoples around you. 
DEU.6.15	If you do worship other gods, the 
DEU.6.17	Be sure that you obey all the laws that he has given you. 
DEU.6.18	Do what the 
DEU.6.19	and you will drive out your enemies, as he promised.
DEU.6.20	“In times to come your children will ask you, ‘Why did the 
DEU.6.21	Then tell them, ‘We were slaves of the king of Egypt, and the 
DEU.6.22	With our own eyes we saw him work miracles and do terrifying things to the Egyptians and to their king and to all his officials. 
DEU.6.23	He freed us from Egypt to bring us here and give us this land, as he had promised our ancestors he would. 
DEU.6.24	Then the 
DEU.6.25	If we faithfully obey everything that God has commanded us, he will be pleased with us.’
DEU.7.2	When the 
DEU.7.3	Do not marry any of them, and do not let your children marry any of them, 
DEU.7.4	because then they would lead your children away from the 
DEU.7.5	 So then, tear down their altars, break their sacred stone pillars in pieces, cut down their symbols of the goddess Asherah, and burn their idols. 
DEU.7.6	 Do this because you belong to the 
DEU.7.7	“The 
DEU.7.8	But the 
DEU.7.9	 Remember that the 
DEU.7.10	but he will not hesitate to punish those who hate him. 
DEU.7.11	Now then, obey what you have been taught; obey all the laws that I have given you today.
DEU.7.13	He will love you and bless you, so that you will increase in number and have many children; he will bless your fields, so that you will have grain, wine, and olive oil; and he will bless you by giving you many cattle and sheep. He will give you all these blessings in the land that he promised your ancestors he would give to you. 
DEU.7.14	No people in the world will be as richly blessed as you. None of you nor any of your livestock will be sterile. 
DEU.7.15	The 
DEU.7.16	Destroy every nation that the 
DEU.7.17	“Do not tell yourselves that these peoples outnumber you and that you cannot drive them out. 
DEU.7.18	Do not be afraid of them; remember what the 
DEU.7.19	Remember the terrible plagues that you saw with your own eyes, the miracles and wonders, and the great power and strength by which the 
DEU.7.20	He will even cause panic
DEU.7.21	So do not be afraid of these people. The 
DEU.7.22	Little by little he will drive out these nations as you advance. You will not be able to destroy them all at once, for, if you did, the number of wild animals would increase and be a threat to you. 
DEU.7.23	The 
DEU.7.24	He will put their kings in your power. You will kill them, and they will be forgotten. No one will be able to stop you; you will destroy everyone. 
DEU.7.25	Burn their idols. Do not desire the silver or gold that is on them, and do not take it for yourselves. If you do, that will be fatal, because the 
DEU.7.26	Do not bring any of these idols into your homes, or the same curse will be on you that is on them. You must hate and despise these idols, because they are under the 
DEU.8.1	“Obey faithfully all the laws that I have given you today, so that you may live, increase in number, and occupy the land that the 
DEU.8.2	Remember how the 
DEU.8.3	 He made you go hungry, and then he gave you manna to eat, food that you and your ancestors had never eaten before. He did this to teach you that you must not depend on bread alone to sustain you, but on everything that the 
DEU.8.4	During these forty years your clothes have not worn out, nor have your feet swollen up. 
DEU.8.5	 Remember that the 
DEU.8.6	So then, do as the 
DEU.8.7	The 
DEU.8.8	a land that produces wheat and barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and honey. 
DEU.8.9	There you will never go hungry or ever be in need. Its rocks have iron in them, and from its hills you can mine copper. 
DEU.8.10	You will have all you want to eat, and you will give thanks to the 
DEU.8.12	When you have all you want to eat and have built good houses to live in 
DEU.8.13	and when your cattle and sheep, your silver and gold, and all your other possessions have increased, 
DEU.8.14	be sure that you do not become proud and forget the 
DEU.8.15	He led you through that vast and terrifying desert where there were poisonous snakes and scorpions. In that dry and waterless land he made water flow out of solid rock for you. 
DEU.8.16	In the desert he gave you manna to eat, food that your ancestors had never eaten. He sent hardships on you to test you, so that in the end he could bless you with good things. 
DEU.8.17	So then, you must never think that you have made yourselves wealthy by your own power and strength. 
DEU.8.18	Remember that it is the 
DEU.8.19	Never forget the 
DEU.8.20	If you do not obey the 
DEU.9.1	“Listen, people of Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River and occupy the land belonging to nations greater and more powerful than you. Their cities are large, with walls that reach the sky. 
DEU.9.2	The people themselves are tall and strong; they are giants, and you have heard it said that no one can stand against them. 
DEU.9.3	But now you will see for yourselves that the 
DEU.9.4	“After the 
DEU.9.5	It is not because you are good and do what is right that the 
DEU.9.6	You can be sure that the 
DEU.9.7	“Never forget how you made the 
DEU.9.8	Even at Mount Sinai you made the 
DEU.9.9	 I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets on which was written the covenant that the 
DEU.9.10	Then the 
DEU.9.11	Yes, after those forty days and nights the 
DEU.9.12	“Then the 
DEU.9.13	“The 
DEU.9.14	Don't try to stop me. I intend to destroy them so that no one will remember them any longer. Then I will make you the father of a nation larger and more powerful than they are.’
DEU.9.15	“So I turned and went down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets on which the covenant was written. Flames of fire were coming from the mountain. 
DEU.9.16	I saw that you had already disobeyed the command that the 
DEU.9.17	So there in front of you I threw the stone tablets down and broke them to pieces. 
DEU.9.18	Then once again I lay face downward in the 
DEU.9.19	 I was afraid of the 
DEU.9.20	The 
DEU.9.21	I took that sinful thing that you had made—that metal bull-calf—and threw it into the fire. Then I broke it in pieces, ground it to dust, and threw the dust into the stream that flowed down the mountain.
DEU.9.23	 And when he sent you from Kadesh Barnea with orders to go and take possession of the land that he was giving you, you rebelled against him; you did not trust him or obey him. 
DEU.9.24	Ever since I have known you, you have rebelled against the 
DEU.9.25	“So I lay face downward in the 
DEU.9.26	And I prayed, ‘Sovereign 
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and do not pay any attention to the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of this people. 
DEU.9.28	Otherwise, the Egyptians will say that you were unable to take your people into the land that you had promised them. They will say that you took your people out into the desert to kill them, because you hated them. 
DEU.9.29	After all, these are the people whom you chose to be your own and whom you brought out of Egypt by your great power and might.’
DEU.10.1	“Then the 
DEU.10.2	and I will write on those tablets what I wrote on the tablets that you broke, and then you are to put them in the Box.’
DEU.10.3	“So I made a Box of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first ones and took them up the mountain. 
DEU.10.4	Then the 
DEU.10.5	and I turned and went down the mountain. Then, just as the 
DEU.10.5	( 
DEU.10.6	 The Israelites set out from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, and went to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar succeeded him as priest. 
DEU.10.7	From there they went to Gudgodah and then on to Jotbathah, a well-watered place. 
DEU.10.8	 At that time the 
DEU.10.9	That is why the tribe of Levi received no land as the other tribes did; what they received was the privilege of being the 
DEU.10.11	Then he told me to go and lead you, so that you could take possession of the land that he had promised to give to your ancestors.
DEU.10.12	“Now, people of Israel, listen to what the 
DEU.10.13	and obey all his laws. I am giving them to you today for your benefit. 
DEU.10.14	To the 
DEU.10.15	But the 
DEU.10.16	So then, from now on be obedient to the 
DEU.10.17	 The 
DEU.10.18	 He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly; he loves the foreigners who live with our people, and gives them food and clothes. 
DEU.10.19	So then, show love for those foreigners, because you were once foreigners in Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Have reverence for the 
DEU.10.21	Praise him—he is your God, and you have seen with your own eyes the great and astounding things that he has done for you. 
DEU.10.22	 When your ancestors went to Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the 
DEU.11.1	“Love the 
DEU.11.2	Remember today what you have learned about the 
DEU.11.3	 and his miracles. You saw what he did to the king of Egypt and to his entire country. 
DEU.11.4	 You saw how the 
DEU.11.5	You know what the 
DEU.11.6	 You recall what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab of the tribe of Reuben. In the sight of everyone the earth opened up and swallowed them, along with their families, their tents, and all their servants and animals. 
DEU.11.7	Yes, you are the ones who have seen all these great things that the 
DEU.11.8	“Obey everything that I have commanded you today. Then you will be able to cross the river and occupy the land that you are about to enter. 
DEU.11.9	And you will live a long time in the rich and fertile land that the 
DEU.11.10	The land that you are about to occupy is not like the land of Egypt, where you lived before. There, when you planted grain, you had to work hard to irrigate the fields; 
DEU.11.11	but the land that you are about to enter is a land of mountains and valleys, a land watered by rain. 
DEU.11.12	The 
DEU.11.14	If you do, he will send rain on your land when it is needed, in the autumn and in the spring, so that there will be grain, wine, and olive oil for you, 
DEU.11.15	and grass for your livestock. You will have all the food you want. 
DEU.11.16	Do not let yourselves be led away from the 
DEU.11.17	If you do, the 
DEU.11.19	Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working. 
DEU.11.20	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates. 
DEU.11.21	Then you and your children will live a long time in the land that the 
DEU.11.22	“Obey faithfully everything that I have commanded you: Love the 
DEU.11.23	Then he will drive out all those nations as you advance, and you will occupy the land belonging to nations greater and more powerful than you. 
DEU.11.24	 All the ground that you march over will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
DEU.11.25	Wherever you go in that land, the 
DEU.11.26	“Today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse— 
DEU.11.27	a blessing, if you obey the commands of the 
DEU.11.28	but a curse, if you disobey these commands and turn away to worship other gods that you have never worshiped before. 
DEU.11.29	 When the 
DEU.11.30	These two mountains are west of the Jordan River in the territory of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley. They are toward the west, not far from the sacred trees of Moreh near the town of Gilgal.) 
DEU.11.31	You are about to cross the Jordan River and occupy the land that the 
DEU.11.32	be sure to obey all the laws that I am giving you today.
DEU.12.1	“Here are the laws that you are to obey as long as you live in the land that the 
DEU.12.2	In the land that you are taking, destroy all the places where the people worship their gods on high mountains, on hills, and under green trees. 
DEU.12.3	 Tear down their altars and smash their sacred stone pillars to pieces. Burn their symbols of the goddess Asherah and chop down their idols, so that they will never again be worshiped at those places.
DEU.12.4	“Do not worship the 
DEU.12.5	Out of the territory of all your tribes the 
DEU.12.6	There you are to offer your sacrifices that are to be burned and your other sacrifices, your tithes and your offerings, the gifts that you promise to the 
DEU.12.7	There, in the presence of the 
DEU.12.8	“When that time comes, you must not do as you have been doing. Until now you have all been worshiping as you please, 
DEU.12.9	because you have not yet entered the land that the 
DEU.12.10	When you cross the Jordan River, the 
DEU.12.11	The 
DEU.12.12	Be joyful there in his presence, together with your children, your servants, and the Levites who live in your towns; remember that the Levites will have no land of their own. 
DEU.12.13	You are not to offer your sacrifices wherever you choose; 
DEU.12.14	you must offer them only in the one place that the 
DEU.12.15	“But you are free to kill and eat your animals wherever you live. You may eat as many as the 
DEU.12.16	 But you must not eat their blood; you must pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	Nothing that you offer to the 
DEU.12.18	You and your children, together with your servants and the Levites who live in your towns, are to eat these offerings only in the presence of the 
DEU.12.19	Be sure, also, not to neglect the Levites, as long as you live in your land.
DEU.12.20	“When the 
DEU.12.21	If the one place of worship is too far away, then, whenever you wish, you may kill any of the cattle or sheep that the 
DEU.12.22	Anyone, ritually clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just as he would eat the meat of deer or antelope. 
DEU.12.23	 Only do not eat meat with blood still in it, for the life is in the blood, and you must not eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	Do not use the blood for food; instead, pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	If you obey this command, the 
DEU.12.26	Take to the one place of worship your offerings and the gifts that you have promised the 
DEU.12.27	Offer there the sacrifices which are to be completely burned on the 
DEU.12.28	Obey faithfully everything that I have commanded you, and all will go well for you and your descendants forever, because you will be doing what is right and what pleases the 
DEU.12.29	“The 
DEU.12.30	After the 
DEU.12.31	Do not worship the 
DEU.13.1	“Prophets or interpreters of dreams may promise a miracle or a wonder, 
DEU.13.2	in order to lead you to worship and serve gods that you have not worshiped before. Even if what they promise comes true, 
DEU.13.3	do not pay any attention to them. The 
DEU.13.4	Follow the 
DEU.13.5	But put to death any interpreters of dreams or prophets that tell you to rebel against the 
DEU.13.6	“Even your brother or your son or your daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend may secretly encourage you to worship other gods, gods that you and your ancestors have never worshiped. 
DEU.13.7	Some of them may encourage you to worship the gods of the people who live near you or the gods of those who live far away. 
DEU.13.8	But do not let any of them persuade you; do not even listen to them. Show them no mercy or pity, and do not protect them. 
DEU.13.9	Kill them! Be the first to stone them, and then let everyone else stone them too. 
DEU.13.10	Stone them to death! They tried to lead you away from the 
DEU.13.11	Then all the people of Israel will hear what happened; they will be afraid, and no one will ever again do such an evil thing.
DEU.13.12	“When you are living in the towns that the 
DEU.13.13	that some worthless people of your nation have misled the people of their town to worship gods that you have never worshiped before. 
DEU.13.14	If you hear such a rumor, investigate it thoroughly; and if it is true that this evil thing did happen, 
DEU.13.15	then kill all the people in that town and all their livestock too. Destroy that town completely. 
DEU.13.16	Bring together all the possessions of the people who live there and pile them up in the town square. Then burn the town and everything in it as an offering to the 
DEU.13.17	Do not keep for yourselves anything that was condemned to destruction, and then the 
DEU.13.18	if you obey all his commands that I have given you today, and do what he requires.

DEU.14.6	any animals that have divided hoofs and that also chew the cud. 
DEU.14.7	But no animals may be eaten unless they have divided hoofs and also chew the cud. You may not eat camels, rabbits, or rock badgers. They must be considered unclean; they chew the cud but do not have divided hoofs. 
DEU.14.8	Do not eat pigs. They must be considered unclean; they have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud. Do not eat any of these animals or even touch their dead bodies.
DEU.14.9	“You may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales,

DEU.14.25	Sell your produce and take the money with you to the one place of worship. 
DEU.14.26	Spend it on whatever you want—beef, lamb, wine, beer—and there, in the presence of the 
DEU.14.27	“Do not neglect the Levites who live in your towns; they have no property of their own. 
DEU.14.28	At the end of every third year bring the tithe of all your crops and store it in your towns. 
DEU.14.29	This food is for the Levites, since they own no property, and for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. They are to come and get all they need. Do this, and the 
DEU.15.1	“At the end of every seventh year you are to cancel the debts of those who owe you money. 
DEU.15.2	This is how it is to be done. Each of you who has lent money to any Israelite is to cancel the debt; you must not try to collect the money; the 
DEU.15.3	You may collect what a foreigner owes you, but you must not collect what any of your own people owe you.
DEU.15.4	“The 
DEU.15.5	if you obey him and carefully observe everything that I command you today. 
DEU.15.6	The 
DEU.15.8	Instead, be generous and lend them as much as they need. 
DEU.15.9	Do not refuse to lend them something, just because the year when debts are canceled is near. Do not let such an evil thought enter your mind. If you refuse to make the loan, they will cry out to the 
DEU.15.10	Give to them freely and unselfishly, and the 
DEU.15.11	 There will always be some Israelites who are poor and in need, and so I command you to be generous to them.
DEU.15.13	When you set them free, do not send them away empty-handed. 
DEU.15.14	Give to them generously from what the 
DEU.15.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the 
DEU.15.16	“But your slave may not want to leave; he may love you and your family and be content to stay. 
DEU.15.17	Then take him to the door of your house and there pierce his ear; he will then be your slave for life. Treat your female slave in the same way. 
DEU.15.18	Do not be resentful when you set slaves free; after all, they have served you for six years at half the cost of hired servants.
DEU.15.20	Each year you and your family are to eat them in the 
DEU.15.21	But if there is anything wrong with the animals, if they are crippled or blind or have any other serious defect, you must not sacrifice them to the 
DEU.15.22	You may eat such animals at home. All of you, whether ritually clean or unclean, may eat them, just as you eat deer or antelope. 
DEU.15.23	 But do not use their blood for food; instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU.16.2	Go to the one place of worship and slaughter there one of your sheep or cattle for the Passover meal to honor the 
DEU.16.3	When you eat this meal, do not eat bread prepared with yeast. For seven days you are to eat bread prepared without yeast, as you did when you had to leave Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this bread—it will be called the bread of suffering—so that as long as you live you will remember the day you came out of Egypt, that place of suffering. 
DEU.16.4	For seven days no one in your land is to have any yeast in the house; and the meat of the animal killed on the evening of the first day must be eaten that same night.
DEU.16.5+DEU.16.6	“Slaughter the Passover animals at the one place of worship—and nowhere else in the land that the 
DEU.16.7	Boil the meat and eat it at the one place of worship; and the next morning return home. 
DEU.16.8	For the next six days you are to eat bread prepared without yeast, and on the seventh day assemble to worship the 
DEU.16.10	and then celebrate the Harvest Festival, to honor the 
DEU.16.11	Be joyful in the 
DEU.16.12	Be sure that you obey these commands; do not forget that you were slaves in Egypt.
DEU.16.14	Enjoy it with your children, your servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. 
DEU.16.15	Honor the 
DEU.16.16	“All the men of your nation are to come to worship the 
DEU.16.17	as he is able, in proportion to the blessings that the 
DEU.16.18	“Appoint judges and other officials in every town that the 
DEU.16.19	 They are not to be unjust or show partiality in their judgments; and they are not to accept bribes, for gifts blind the eyes even of wise and honest men, and cause them to give wrong decisions. 
DEU.16.20	Always be fair and just, so that you will occupy the land that the 
DEU.16.22	 And do not set up any stone pillar for idol worship; the 
DEU.17.1	“Do not sacrifice to the 
DEU.17.2	“Suppose you hear that in one of your towns some men or women have sinned against the 
DEU.17.3	 by worshiping and serving other gods or the sun or the moon or the stars, contrary to the 
DEU.17.4	If you hear such a report, then investigate it thoroughly. If it is true that this evil thing has happened in Israel, 
DEU.17.5	then take them outside the town and stone them to death. 
DEU.17.6	 However, they may be put to death only if two or more witnesses testify against them; they are not to be put to death if there is only one witness. 
DEU.17.7	 The witnesses are to throw the first stones, and then the rest of the people are to stone them; in this way you will get rid of this evil.
DEU.17.8	“It may be that some cases will be too difficult for the local judges to decide, such as certain cases of property rights or of bodily injury or those cases that involve a distinction between murder and manslaughter. When this happens, go to the one place of worship chosen by the 
DEU.17.9	and present your case to the levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time, and let them decide the case. 
DEU.17.10	They will give their decision, and you are to do exactly as they tell you. 
DEU.17.11	Accept their verdict and follow their instructions in every detail. 
DEU.17.12	Anyone who dares to disobey either the judge or the priest on duty is to be put to death; in this way you will remove this evil from Israel. 
DEU.17.13	Then everyone will hear of it and be afraid, and no one else will dare to act in such a way.
DEU.17.15	Be sure that the man you choose to be king is the one whom the 
DEU.17.16	 The king is not to have a large number of horses for his army, and he is not to send people to Egypt to buy horses,
DEU.17.17	 The king is not to have many wives, because this would make him turn away from the 
DEU.17.18	When he becomes king, he is to have a copy of the book of God's laws and teachings made from the original copy kept by the levitical priests. 
DEU.17.19	He is to keep this book near him and read from it all his life, so that he will learn to honor the 
DEU.17.20	This will keep him from thinking that he is better than other Israelites and from disobeying the 
DEU.18.1	“The priestly tribe of Levi is not to receive any share of land in Israel; instead, they are to live on the offerings and other sacrifices given to the 
DEU.18.2	 They are to own no land, as the other tribes do; their share is the privilege of being the 
DEU.18.3	“Whenever cattle or sheep are sacrificed, the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jaw, and the stomach. 
DEU.18.4	They are to receive the first share of the grain, wine, olive oil, and wool. 
DEU.18.5	The 
DEU.18.6	“Any Levite who wants to may come from any town in Israel to the one place of worship 
DEU.18.7	and may serve there as a priest of the

DEU.18.9	“When you come into the land that the 
DEU.18.10	 Don't sacrifice your children in the fires on your altars; and don't let your people practice divination or look for omens or use spells 
DEU.18.11	 or charms, and don't let them consult the spirits of the dead. 
DEU.18.12	The 
DEU.18.13	 Be completely faithful to the 
DEU.18.14	Then Moses said, “In the land you are about to occupy, people follow the advice of those who practice divination and look for omens, but the 
DEU.18.15	 Instead, he will send you a prophet like me from among your own people, and you are to obey him.
DEU.18.16	“On the day that you were gathered at Mount Sinai, you begged not to hear the 
DEU.18.17	So the 
DEU.18.18	I will send them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will tell him what to say, and he
DEU.18.19	 He will speak in my name, and I
DEU.18.20	But if any prophet dares to speak a message in my name when I did not command him to do so, he must die for it, and so must any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods.’
DEU.18.21	“You may wonder how you can tell when a prophet's message does not come from the 
DEU.18.22	If a prophet speaks in the name of the 
DEU.19.2+DEU.19.3	divide the territory into three parts, each with a city that can be easily reached. Then any of you that kill will be able to escape to one of them for protection. 
DEU.19.4	If you accidentally kill someone who is not your enemy, you may escape to any of these cities and be safe. 
DEU.19.5	For example, if two of you go into the forest together to cut wood and if, as one of you is chopping down a tree, the ax head comes off the handle and kills the other, you can run to one of those three cities and be safe. 
DEU.19.6	If there were only one city, the distance to it might be too great, and the relative who is responsible for taking revenge for the killing might catch you and angrily kill an innocent person. After all, it was by accident that you killed someone who was not your enemy. 
DEU.19.7	This is why I order you to set aside three cities.
DEU.19.8	“When the 
DEU.19.9	then you are to select three more cities. (He will give you this land if you do everything that I command you today and if you love the 
DEU.19.10	Do this, so that innocent people will not die and so that you will not be guilty of putting them to death in the land that the 
DEU.19.11	“But suppose you deliberately murder your enemy in cold blood and then escape to one of those cities for protection. 
DEU.19.12	In that case, the leaders of your own town are to send for you and hand you over to the relative responsible for taking revenge for the murder, so that you may be put to death. 
DEU.19.13	No mercy will be shown to you. Israel must rid itself of murderers, so that all will go well.
DEU.19.16	If any of you try to harm another by false accusations, 
DEU.19.17	both of you are to go to the one place of worship and be judged by the priests and judges who are then in office. 
DEU.19.18	The judges will investigate the case thoroughly; and if you have made a false accusation, 
DEU.19.19	you are to receive the punishment the accused would have received. In this way your nation will get rid of this evil. 
DEU.19.20	Then everyone else will hear what happened; they will be afraid, and no one will ever again do such an evil thing. 
DEU.19.21	 In such cases show no mercy; the punishment is to be a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
DEU.20.1	“When you go out to fight against your enemies and you see chariots and horses and an army that outnumbers yours, do not be afraid of them. The 
DEU.20.2	Before you start fighting, a priest is to come forward and say to the army, 
DEU.20.3	‘Men of Israel, listen! Today you are going into battle. Do not be afraid of your enemies or lose courage or panic. 
DEU.20.4	The 
DEU.20.5	“Then the officers will address the men and say, ‘Is there any man here who has just built a house, but has not yet dedicated it? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will dedicate his house. 
DEU.20.6	Is there any man here who has just planted a vineyard, but has not yet had the chance to harvest its grapes? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will enjoy the wine. 
DEU.20.7	Is there anyone here who is engaged to be married? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will marry the woman he is engaged to.’
DEU.20.8	“The officers will also say to the men, ‘Is there any man here who has lost his nerve and is afraid? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, he will destroy the morale of the others.’ 
DEU.20.9	When the officers have finished speaking to the army, leaders are to be chosen for each unit.
DEU.20.10	“When you go to attack a city, first give its people a chance to surrender. 
DEU.20.11	If they open the gates and surrender, they are all to become your slaves and do forced labor for you. 
DEU.20.12	But if the people of that city will not surrender, but choose to fight, surround it with your army. 
DEU.20.13	Then, when the 
DEU.20.14	You may, however, take for yourselves the women, the children, the livestock, and everything else in the city. You may use everything that belongs to your enemies. The 
DEU.20.15	That is how you are to deal with those cities that are far away from the land you will settle in.
DEU.20.16	“But when you capture cities in the land that the 
DEU.20.17	Completely destroy all the people: the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as the 
DEU.20.18	Kill them, so that they will not make you sin against the 
DEU.20.19	“When you are trying to capture a city, do not cut down its fruit trees, even though the siege lasts a long time. Eat the fruit, but do not destroy the trees; the trees are not your enemies. 
DEU.20.20	You may cut down the other trees and use them in the siege mounds until the city is captured.
DEU.21.1	“Suppose someone is found murdered in a field in the land that the 
DEU.21.2	Your leaders and judges are to go out and measure the distance from the place where the body was found to each of the nearby towns. 
DEU.21.3	Then the leaders of the town nearest to where the body was found are to select a young cow that has never been used for work. 
DEU.21.4	They are to take it down to a spot near a stream that never runs dry and where the ground has never been plowed or planted, and there they are to break its neck. 
DEU.21.5	The levitical priests are to go there also, because they are to decide every legal case involving violence. The 
DEU.21.6	Then all the leaders from the town nearest the place where the murdered person was found are to wash their hands over the cow 
DEU.21.7	and say, ‘We did not murder this one, and we do not know who did it. 
DEU.21.8	, forgive your people Israel, whom you rescued from Egypt. Forgive us and do not hold us responsible for the murder of an innocent person.’ 
DEU.21.9	And so, by doing what the 
DEU.21.10	“When the 
DEU.21.11	you may see among them a beautiful woman that you like and want to marry. 
DEU.21.12	Take her to your home, where she will shave her head,
DEU.21.13	and change her clothes. She is to stay in your home and mourn for her parents for a month; after that, you may marry her. 
DEU.21.14	Later, if you no longer want her, you are to let her go free. Since you forced her to have intercourse with you, you cannot treat her as a slave and sell her.
DEU.21.15	“Suppose a man has two wives and they both bear him sons, but the first son is not the child of his favorite wife. 
DEU.21.16	When the man decides how he is going to divide his property among his children, he is not to show partiality to the son of his favorite wife by giving him the share that belongs to the first-born son. 
DEU.21.17	He is to give a double share of his possessions to his first son, even though he is not the son of his favorite wife. A man must acknowledge his first son and give him the share he is legally entitled to.
DEU.21.18	“Suppose someone has a son who is stubborn and rebellious, a son who will not obey his parents, even though they punish him. 
DEU.21.19	His parents are to take him before the leaders of the town where he lives and make him stand trial. 
DEU.21.20	They are to say to them, ‘Our son is stubborn and rebellious and refuses to obey us; he wastes money and is a drunkard.’ 
DEU.21.21	Then the men of the city are to stone him to death, and so you will get rid of this evil. Everyone in Israel will hear what has happened and be afraid.
DEU.21.22	“If someone has been put to death for a crime and the body is hung on a post, 
DEU.21.23	 it is not to remain there overnight. It must be buried the same day, because a dead body hanging on a post brings God's curse on the land. Bury the body, so that you will not defile the land that the 
DEU.22.2	But if its owner lives a long way off or if you don't know who owns it, then take it home with you. When its owner comes looking for it, give it to him. 
DEU.22.3	Do the same thing if you find a donkey, a piece of clothing, or anything else that an Israelite may have lost.
DEU.22.4	“If an Israelite's donkey or cow has fallen down, don't ignore it; help him get the animal to its feet again.
DEU.22.5	“Women are not to wear men's clothing, and men are not to wear women's clothing; the 
DEU.22.6	“If you happen to find a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground with the mother bird sitting either on the eggs or with her young, you are not to take the mother bird. 
DEU.22.7	You may take the young birds, but you must let the mother bird go, so that you will live a long and prosperous life.
DEU.22.8	“When you build a new house, be sure to put a railing around the edge of the roof. Then you will not be responsible if someone falls off and is killed.
DEU.22.10	“Do not hitch an ox and a donkey together for plowing.
DEU.22.11	“Do not wear cloth made by weaving wool and linen together.
DEU.22.13	“Suppose a man marries a young woman and later he decides he doesn't want her. 
DEU.22.14	So he makes up false charges against her, accusing her of not being a virgin when they got married.
DEU.22.15	“If this happens, the young woman's parents are to take the blood-stained wedding sheet that proves she was a virgin, and they are to show it in court to the town leaders. 
DEU.22.16	Her father will say to them, ‘I gave my daughter to this man in marriage, and now he doesn't want her. 
DEU.22.17	He has made false charges against her, saying that she was not a virgin when he married her. But here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin; look at the bloodstains on the wedding sheet!’ 
DEU.22.18	Then the town leaders are to take the husband and beat him. 
DEU.22.19	They are also to fine him a hundred pieces of silver and give the money to the young woman's father, because the man has brought disgrace on an Israelite woman. Moreover, she will continue to be his wife, and he can never divorce her as long as he lives.
DEU.22.20	“But if the charge is true and there is no proof that she was a virgin, 
DEU.22.21	then they are to take her out to the entrance of her father's house, where the men of her city are to stone her to death. She has done a shameful thing among our people by having intercourse before she was married, while she was still living in her father's house. In this way you will get rid of this evil.
DEU.22.22	“If a man is caught having intercourse with another man's wife, both of them are to be put to death. In this way you will get rid of this evil.
DEU.22.23	“Suppose a man is caught in a town having intercourse with a young woman who is engaged to someone else. 
DEU.22.24	You are to take them outside the town and stone them to death. She is to die because she did not cry out for help, although she was in a town, where she could have been heard. And the man is to die because he had intercourse with someone who was engaged. In this way you will get rid of this evil.
DEU.22.25	“Suppose a man out in the countryside rapes a young woman who is engaged to someone else. Then only the man is to be put to death; 
DEU.22.26	nothing is to be done to the woman, because she has not committed a sin worthy of death. This case is the same as when one man attacks another man and murders him. 
DEU.22.27	The man raped the engaged woman in the countryside, and although she cried for help, there was no one to help her.
DEU.22.29	He is to pay her father the bride price of fifty pieces of silver, and she is to become his wife, because he forced her to have intercourse with him. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
DEU.23.1	“No man who has been castrated or whose penis has been cut off may be included among the

DEU.23.5	 But the 
DEU.23.6	As long as you are a nation, never do anything to help these nations or to make them prosperous.
DEU.23.7	“Do not despise the Edomites; they are your relatives. And do not despise the Egyptians; you once lived in their land. 
DEU.23.8	From the third generation onward their descendants may be included among the 
DEU.23.9	“When you are in camp in time of war, you are to avoid anything that would make you ritually unclean. 
DEU.23.10	If a man becomes unclean because he has had a wet dream during the night, he is to go outside the camp and stay there. 
DEU.23.11	Toward evening he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may come back into camp.
DEU.23.12	“You are to have a place outside the camp where you can go when you need to relieve yourselves. 
DEU.23.13	Carry a stick as part of your equipment, so that when you have a bowel movement you can dig a hole and cover it up. 
DEU.23.14	Keep your camp ritually clean, because the 
DEU.23.15	“If slaves run away from their owners and come to you for protection, do not send them back. 
DEU.23.16	They may live in any of your towns that they choose, and you are not to treat them harshly.
DEU.23.18	Also, no money earned in this way may be brought into the house of the 
DEU.23.20	You may charge interest on what you lend to foreigners, but not on what you lend to Israelites. Obey this rule, and the 
DEU.23.22	It is no sin not to make a vow to the 
DEU.23.23	but if you make one voluntarily, be sure that you keep it.
DEU.23.24	“When you walk along a path in someone else's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but you must not carry any away in a container. 
DEU.23.25	When you walk along a path in someone else's grainfield, you may eat all the grain you can pull off with your hands, but you must not cut any grain with a sickle.
DEU.24.2	Then suppose she marries another man, 
DEU.24.3	and he also decides that he doesn't want her, so he also writes out divorce papers, gives them to her, and sends her away from his home. Or suppose her second husband dies. 
DEU.24.4	In either case, her first husband is not to marry her again; he is to consider her defiled. If he married her again, it would be offensive to the 
DEU.24.5	“When a man is newly married, he is not to be drafted into military service or any other public duty; he is to be excused from duty for one year, so that he can stay at home and make his wife happy.
DEU.24.6	“When you lend someone something, you are not to take as security his millstones used for grinding his grain. This would take away the family's means of preparing food to stay alive.
DEU.24.9	 Remember what the 
DEU.24.11	wait outside and let him bring it to you himself. 
DEU.24.12	If he is poor, do not keep it overnight; 
DEU.24.13	return it to him each evening, so that he can have it to sleep in. Then he will be grateful, and the 
DEU.24.15	Each day before sunset pay them for that day's work; they need the money and have counted on getting it. If you do not pay them, they will cry out against you to the 
DEU.24.18	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the 
DEU.24.20	When you have picked your olives once, do not go back and get those that are left; they are for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. 
DEU.24.21	When you have gathered your grapes once, do not go back over the vines a second time; the grapes that are left are for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. 
DEU.24.22	Never forget that you were slaves in Egypt; that is why I have given you this command.
DEU.25.1	“Suppose two Israelites go to court to settle a dispute, and one is declared innocent and the other guilty. 
DEU.25.2	If the guilty one is sentenced to be beaten, the judge is to make him lie face downward and have him whipped. The number of lashes will depend on the crime he has committed. 
DEU.25.3	 He may be given as many as forty lashes, but no more; more than that would humiliate him publicly.
DEU.25.6	The first son that they have will be considered the son of the dead man, so that his family line will continue in Israel. 
DEU.25.7	 But if the dead man's brother does not want to marry her, she is to go before the town leaders and say, ‘My husband's brother will not do his duty; he refuses to give his brother a descendant among the people of Israel.’ 
DEU.25.8	Then the town leaders are to summon him and speak to him. If he still refuses to marry her, 
DEU.25.9	his brother's widow is to go up to him in the presence of the town leaders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face, and say, ‘This is what happens to the man who refuses to give his brother a descendant.’ 
DEU.25.10	His family will be known in Israel as ‘the family of the man who had his sandal pulled off.’
DEU.25.11	“If two men are having a fight and the wife of one tries to help her husband by grabbing hold of the other man's genitals, 
DEU.25.12	show her no mercy; cut off her hand.
DEU.25.15	Use true and honest weights and measures, so that you may live a long time in the land that the 
DEU.25.16	The 
DEU.25.18	They had no fear of God, and so they attacked you from the rear when you were tired and exhausted, and killed all who were straggling behind. 
DEU.25.19	So then, when the 
DEU.26.1	“After you have occupied the land that the 
DEU.26.2	 each of you must place in a basket the first part of each crop that you harvest and you must take it with you to the one place of worship. 
DEU.26.3	Go to the priest in charge at that time and say to him, ‘I now acknowledge to the 
DEU.26.4	“The priest will take the basket from you and place it before the altar of the

DEU.26.6	The Egyptians treated us harshly and forced us to work as slaves. 
DEU.26.7	Then we cried out for help to the 
DEU.26.8	By his great power and strength he rescued us from Egypt. He worked miracles and wonders, and caused terrifying things to happen. 
DEU.26.9	He brought us here and gave us this rich and fertile land. 
DEU.26.10	So now I bring to the 
DEU.26.10	“Then set the basket down in the

DEU.26.13	say to the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten any of it when I was mourning; I have not taken any of it out of my house when I was ritually unclean; and I have not given any of it as an offering for the dead.
DEU.26.15	Look down from your holy place in heaven and bless your people Israel; bless also the rich and fertile land that you have given us, as you promised our ancestors.’
DEU.26.16	“Today the 
DEU.26.17	Today you have acknowledged the 
DEU.26.18	 Today the 
DEU.26.19	He will make you greater than any other nation that he has created, and you will bring praise and honor to his name.
DEU.27.1	Then Moses, together with the leaders of Israel, said to the people, “Obey all the instructions that I am giving you today. 
DEU.27.2	 On the day you cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the 
DEU.27.3	and write on them all these laws and teachings. When you have entered the rich and fertile land that the 
DEU.27.4	and you are on the other side of the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am instructing you today, and cover them with plaster. 
DEU.27.5	 Build an altar there made of stones that have had no iron tools used on them, 
DEU.27.6	because any altar you build for the 
DEU.27.7	and there you are to sacrifice and eat your fellowship offerings and be grateful in the presence of the 
DEU.27.8	On the stones covered with plaster write clearly every word of God's laws.”
DEU.27.9	Then Moses, together with the levitical priests, said to all the people of Israel, “Give me your attention, people of Israel, and listen to me. Today you have become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	so obey him and keep all his laws that I am giving you today.”
DEU.27.11	Then Moses said to the people of Israel, 
DEU.27.12	 “After you have crossed the Jordan, the following tribes are to stand on Mount Gerizim when the blessings are pronounced on the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
DEU.27.13	And the following tribes will stand on Mount Ebal when the curses are pronounced: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
DEU.27.14	The Levites will speak these words in a loud voice:
DEU.27.15	“And all the people will answer, ‘Amen!’
DEU.27.16	“And all the people will answer, ‘Amen!’

DEU.28.13	The 
DEU.28.14	But you must never disobey them in any way, or worship and serve other gods.

DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	You will grope about in broad daylight like someone blind, and you will not be able to find your way. You will not prosper in anything you do. You will be constantly oppressed and robbed, and there will be no one to help you.
DEU.28.30	“You will be engaged to a young woman—but someone else will marry her. You will build a house—but never live in it. You will plant a vineyard—but never eat its grapes. 
DEU.28.31	Your cattle will be butchered before your very eyes, but you will not eat any of the meat. Your donkeys will be dragged away while you look on, and they will not be given back to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and there will be no one to help you. 
DEU.28.32	Your sons and daughters will be given as slaves to foreigners while you look on. Every day you will strain your eyes, looking in vain for your children to return. 
DEU.28.33	A foreign nation will take all the crops that you have worked so hard to grow, while you receive nothing but constant oppression and harsh treatment. 
DEU.28.34	Your sufferings will make you lose your mind. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	“The

DEU.28.40	Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not have any olive oil, because the olives will drop off. 
DEU.28.41	You will have sons and daughters, but you will lose them, because they will be taken away as prisoners of war.

DEU.28.48	So then, you will serve the enemies that the

DEU.28.50	They will be ruthless and show no mercy to anyone, young or old. 
DEU.28.51	They will eat your livestock and your crops, and you will starve to death. They will not leave you any grain, wine, olive oil, cattle, or sheep; and you will die. 
DEU.28.52	They will attack every town in the land that the 
DEU.28.53	“When your enemies are besieging your towns, you will become so desperate for food that you will even eat the children that the 
DEU.28.54+DEU.28.55	Even the most refined man of noble birth will become so desperate during the siege that he will eat some of his own children because he has no other food. He will not even give any to his brother or to the wife he loves or to any of his children who are left. 
DEU.28.56+DEU.28.57	 Even the most refined woman of noble birth, so rich that she has never had to walk anywhere, will behave in the same way. When the enemy besieges her town, she will become so desperate for food that she will secretly eat her newborn child and the afterbirth as well. She will not share them with the husband she loves or with any of her children.
DEU.28.58	“If you do not obey faithfully all of God's teachings that are written in this book and if you do not honor the wonderful and awesome name of the

DEU.28.60	He will bring on you once again all the dreadful diseases you experienced in Egypt, and you will never recover. 
DEU.28.61	He will also send all kinds of diseases and epidemics that are not mentioned in this book of God's laws and teachings, and you will be destroyed. 
DEU.28.62	Although you become as numerous as the stars in the sky, only a few of you will survive, because you did not obey the 
DEU.28.63	Just as the 
DEU.28.64	“The 
DEU.28.65	You will find no peace anywhere, no place to call your own; the 
DEU.28.66	Your life will always be in danger. Day and night you will be filled with terror, and you will live in constant fear of death. 
DEU.28.67	Your hearts will pound with fear at everything you see. Every morning you will wish for evening; every evening you will wish for morning. 
DEU.28.68	The 
DEU.29.1	These are the terms of the covenant that the 
DEU.29.2	Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them, “You saw for yourselves what the 
DEU.29.3	You saw the terrible plagues, the miracles, and the great wonders that the 
DEU.29.4	But to this very day he has not let you understand what you have experienced. 
DEU.29.5	For forty years the 
DEU.29.6	You did not have bread to eat or wine or beer to drink, but the 
DEU.29.7	 And when we came to this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us. But we defeated them, 
DEU.29.8	 took their land, and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. 
DEU.29.9	Obey faithfully all the terms of this covenant, so that you will be successful in everything you do.
DEU.29.10	“Today you are standing in the presence of the 
DEU.29.11	women, and children, and the foreigners who live among you and cut wood and carry water for you. 
DEU.29.12	You are here today to enter into this covenant that the 
DEU.29.13	so that the 
DEU.29.14	You are not the only ones with whom the 
DEU.29.15	He is making it with all of us who stand here in his presence today and also with our descendants who are not yet born.
DEU.29.16	“You remember what life was like in Egypt and what it was like to travel through the territory of other nations. 
DEU.29.17	You saw their disgusting idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. 
DEU.29.18	 Make sure that no man, woman, family, or tribe standing here today turns from the 
DEU.29.19	Make sure that there is no one here today who hears these solemn demands and yet convinces himself that all will be well with him, even if he stubbornly goes his own way. That would destroy all of you, good and evil alike. 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	“In future generations your descendants and foreigners from distant lands will see the disasters and sufferings that the 
DEU.29.23	 The fields will be a barren waste, covered with sulfur and salt; nothing will be planted, and not even weeds will grow there. Your land will be like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim, which the 
DEU.29.24	Then the whole world will ask, ‘Why did the 
DEU.29.25	And the answer will be, ‘It is because the 
DEU.29.26	They served other gods that they had never worshiped before, gods that the 
DEU.29.27	And so the 
DEU.29.28	The 
DEU.29.29	“There are some things that the 
DEU.30.1	“I have now given you a choice between a blessing and a curse. When all these things have happened to you, and you are living among the nations where the 
DEU.30.2	If you and your descendants will turn back to the 
DEU.30.3	then the 
DEU.30.4	Even if you are scattered to the farthest corners of the earth, the 
DEU.30.5	so that you may again take possession of the land where your ancestors once lived. And he will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors ever were. 
DEU.30.6	The 
DEU.30.7	He will turn all these curses against your enemies, who hated you and oppressed you, 
DEU.30.8	and you will again obey him and keep all his commands that I am giving you today. 
DEU.30.9	The 
DEU.30.10	but you will have to obey him and keep all his laws that are written in this book of his teachings. You will have to turn to him with all your heart.
DEU.30.11	“The command that I am giving you today is not too difficult or beyond your reach. 
DEU.30.12	 It is not up in the sky. You do not have to ask, ‘Who will go up and bring it down for us, so that we can hear it and obey it?’ 
DEU.30.13	Nor is it on the other side of the ocean. You do not have to ask, ‘Who will go across the ocean and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and obey it?’ 
DEU.30.14	No, it is here with you. You know it and can quote it, so now obey it.
DEU.30.16	If you obey the commands of the 
DEU.30.17	But if you disobey and refuse to listen, and are led away to worship other gods, 
DEU.30.18	you will be destroyed—I warn you here and now. You will not live long in that land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy. 
DEU.30.19	I am now giving you the choice between life and death, between God's blessing and God's curse, and I call heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Choose life. 
DEU.30.20	 Love the 
DEU.31.1	Moses continued speaking to the people of Israel, 
DEU.31.2	 and said, “I am now a hundred and twenty years old and am no longer able to be your leader. And besides this, the 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	 The 
DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	Be determined and confident. Do not be afraid of them. Your God, the 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all the people of Israel, “Be determined and confident; you are the one who will lead these people to occupy the land that the 
DEU.31.8	 The 
DEU.31.9	So Moses wrote down God's Law and gave it to the levitical priests, who were in charge of the 
DEU.31.10	 He commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, when the year that debts are canceled comes around, read this aloud at the Festival of Shelters. 
DEU.31.11	Read it to the people of Israel when they come to worship the 
DEU.31.12	Call together all the men, women, and children, and the foreigners who live in your towns, so that everyone may hear it and learn to honor the 
DEU.31.13	In this way your descendants who have never heard the Law of the 
DEU.31.14	Then the 
DEU.31.15	and the 
DEU.31.16	The 
DEU.31.17	When that happens, I will become angry with them; I will abandon them, and they will be destroyed. Many terrible disasters will come upon them, and then they will realize that these things are happening to them because I, their God, am no longer with them. 
DEU.31.18	And I will refuse to help them then, because they have done evil and worshiped other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now, write down this song. Teach it to the people of Israel, so that it will stand as evidence against them. 
DEU.31.20	I will take them into this rich and fertile land, as I promised their ancestors. There they will have all the food they want, and they will live comfortably. But they will turn away and worship other gods. They will reject me and break my covenant, 
DEU.31.21	and many terrible disasters will come on them. But this song will still be sung, and it will stand as evidence against them. Even now, before I take them into the land that I promised to give them, I know what they are thinking.”
DEU.31.22	That same day Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the people of Israel.
DEU.31.24	Moses wrote God's Law in a book, taking care not to leave out anything. 
DEU.31.25	When he finished, he said to the levitical priests, who were in charge of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this book of God's Law and place it beside the Covenant Box of the 
DEU.31.27	I know how stubborn and rebellious they are. They have rebelled against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble all your tribal leaders and officials before me, so that I can tell them these things; I will call heaven and earth to be my witnesses against them. 
DEU.31.29	I know that after my death the people will become wicked and reject what I have taught them. And in time to come they will meet with disaster, because they will have made the 
DEU.31.30	Then Moses recited the entire song while all the people of Israel listened.
DEU.32.1	“Earth and sky, hear my words,
DEU.32.1	listen closely to what I say.
DEU.32.2	My teaching will fall like drops of rain
DEU.32.2	and form on the earth like dew.
DEU.32.2	My words will fall like showers on young plants,
DEU.32.2	like gentle rain on tender grass.
DEU.32.3	I will praise the name of the 
DEU.32.3	and his people will tell of his greatness.
DEU.32.4	“The 
DEU.32.4	perfect and just in all his ways;
DEU.32.4	Your God is faithful and true;
DEU.32.4	he does what is right and fair.
DEU.32.5	But you are unfaithful, unworthy to be his people,
DEU.32.5	a sinful and deceitful nation.
DEU.32.6	Is this the way you should treat the 
DEU.32.6	you foolish, senseless people?
DEU.32.6	He is your father, your Creator,
DEU.32.6	he made you into a nation.
DEU.32.7	“Think of the past, of the time long ago;
DEU.32.7	ask your parents to tell you what happened,
DEU.32.7	ask the old people to tell of the past.
DEU.32.8	he determined where peoples should live.
DEU.32.8	He assigned to each nation a heavenly being,
DEU.32.9	but Jacob's descendants he chose for himself.
DEU.32.10	“He found them wandering through the desert,
DEU.32.10	a desolate, wind-swept wilderness.
DEU.32.10	He protected them and cared for them,
DEU.32.10	as he would protect himself.
DEU.32.11	Like an eagle teaching its young to fly,
DEU.32.11	catching them safely on its spreading wings,
DEU.32.11	the 
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.12	without the help of a foreign god.
DEU.32.13	“He let them rule the highlands,
DEU.32.13	and they ate what grew in the fields.
DEU.32.13	They found wild honey among the rocks;
DEU.32.13	their olive trees flourished in stony ground.
DEU.32.14	Their cows and goats gave plenty of milk;
DEU.32.14	they had the best sheep, goats, and cattle,
DEU.32.14	the finest wheat, and the choicest wine.
DEU.32.15	“The 
DEU.32.15	they were fat and stuffed with food.
DEU.32.15	They abandoned God their Creator
DEU.32.15	and rejected their mighty savior.
DEU.32.16	Their idolatry made the 
DEU.32.16	the evil they did made him angry.
DEU.32.17	new gods their ancestors had never known,
DEU.32.17	gods that Israel had never obeyed.
DEU.32.18	They forgot their God, their mighty savior,
DEU.32.18	the one who had given them life.
DEU.32.19	“When the 
DEU.32.19	and rejected his sons and daughters.
DEU.32.20	‘I will no longer help them,’ he said;
DEU.32.20	‘then I will see what happens to them,
DEU.32.20	those stubborn, unfaithful people.
DEU.32.21	jealous with their so-called gods,
DEU.32.21	gods that are really not gods.
DEU.32.21	So I will use a so-called nation to make them angry;
DEU.32.21	I will make them jealous with a nation of fools.
DEU.32.22	My anger will flame up like fire
DEU.32.22	and burn everything on earth.
DEU.32.22	It will reach to the world below
DEU.32.22	and consume the roots of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	“‘I will bring on them endless disasters
DEU.32.23	and use all my arrows against them.
DEU.32.24	They will die from hunger and fever;
DEU.32.24	they will die from terrible diseases.
DEU.32.24	I will send wild animals to attack them,
DEU.32.24	and poisonous snakes to bite them.
DEU.32.25	War will bring death in the streets;
DEU.32.25	terrors will strike in the homes.
DEU.32.25	Young men and young women will die;
DEU.32.25	neither babies nor old people will be spared.
DEU.32.26	I would have destroyed them completely,
DEU.32.26	so that no one would remember them.
DEU.32.27	But I could not let their enemies boast
DEU.32.27	that they had defeated my people,
DEU.32.27	when it was I myself who had crushed them.’
DEU.32.28	“Israel is a nation without sense;
DEU.32.28	they have no wisdom at all.
DEU.32.29	They fail to see why they were defeated;
DEU.32.29	they cannot understand what happened.
DEU.32.30	Why were a thousand defeated by one,
DEU.32.30	and ten thousand by only two?
DEU.32.30	The 
DEU.32.30	their mighty God had given them up.
DEU.32.31	Their enemies know that their own gods are weak,
DEU.32.31	not mighty like Israel's God.
DEU.32.32	Their enemies, corrupt as Sodom and Gomorrah,
DEU.32.32	are like vines that bear bitter and poisonous grapes,
DEU.32.33	like wine made from the venom of snakes.
DEU.32.34	“The 
DEU.32.34	he waits for the right time to punish them.
DEU.32.35	the time will come when they will fall;
DEU.32.35	the day of their doom is near.
DEU.32.36	when he sees that their strength is gone.
DEU.32.36	He will have mercy on those who serve him,
DEU.32.36	when he sees how helpless they are.
DEU.32.37	Then the 
DEU.32.37	‘Where are those mighty gods you trusted?
DEU.32.38	You fed them the fat of your sacrifices
DEU.32.38	and offered them wine to drink.
DEU.32.38	Let them come and help you now;
DEU.32.38	let them run to your rescue.
DEU.32.39	“‘I, and I alone, am God;
DEU.32.39	no other god is real.
DEU.32.39	I kill and I give life, I wound and I heal,
DEU.32.39	and no one can oppose what I do.
DEU.32.40	As surely as I am the living God,
DEU.32.40	I raise my hand and I vow
DEU.32.41	that I will sharpen my flashing sword
DEU.32.41	and see that justice is done.
DEU.32.41	I will take revenge on my enemies
DEU.32.41	and punish those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	My arrows will drip with their blood,
DEU.32.42	and my sword will kill all who oppose me.
DEU.32.42	I will spare no one who fights against me;
DEU.32.42	even the wounded and prisoners will die.’
DEU.32.43	he punishes all who kill them.
DEU.32.43	He takes revenge on his enemies
DEU.32.43	and forgives the sins of his people.”
DEU.32.44	Moses and Joshua son of Nun recited this song, so that the people of Israel could hear it.
DEU.32.45	When Moses had finished giving God's teachings to the people, 
DEU.32.46	he said, “Be sure to obey all these commands that I have given you today. Repeat them to your children, so that they may faithfully obey all of God's teachings. 
DEU.32.47	These teachings are not empty words; they are your very life. Obey them and you will live long in that land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy.”
DEU.32.49	“Go to the Abarim Mountains in the land of Moab opposite the city of Jericho; climb Mount Nebo and look at the land of Canaan that I am about to give the people of Israel. 
DEU.32.50	You will die on that mountain as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor, 
DEU.32.51	because both of you were unfaithful to me in the presence of the people of Israel. When you were at the waters of Meribah, near the town of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, you dishonored me in the presence of the people. 
DEU.32.52	You will look at the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land that I am giving the people of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	These are the blessings that Moses, the man of God, pronounced on the people of Israel before he died.
DEU.33.2	The 
DEU.33.2	he rose like the sun over Edom
DEU.33.2	and shone on his people from Mount Paran.
DEU.33.2	Ten thousand angels were with him,
DEU.33.2	a flaming fire at his right hand.
DEU.33.3	The 
DEU.33.3	and protects those who belong to him.
DEU.33.3	So we bow at
DEU.33.3	and obey his commands.
DEU.33.4	We obey the Law that Moses gave us,
DEU.33.4	our nation's most treasured possession.
DEU.33.5	The 
DEU.33.5	when their tribes and leaders were gathered together.
DEU.33.6	Moses said about the tribe of Reuben:
DEU.33.6	“May Reuben never die out,
DEU.33.6	Although their people are few.”
DEU.33.7	About the tribe of Judah he said:
DEU.33.7	“
DEU.33.7	Unite them again with the other tribes.
DEU.33.7	Fight for them, 
DEU.33.7	And help them against their enemies.”
DEU.33.8	“You, 
DEU.33.8	Through your faithful servants, the Levites;
DEU.33.8	You put them to the test at Massah
DEU.33.8	And proved them true at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	They showed greater loyalty to you
DEU.33.9	Than to parents, brothers, or children.
DEU.33.9	They obeyed your commands
DEU.33.9	And were faithful to your covenant.
DEU.33.10	They will teach your people to obey your Law;
DEU.33.10	They will offer sacrifices on your altar.
DEU.33.11	Be pleased with what they do.
DEU.33.11	Crush all their enemies;
DEU.33.11	Let them never rise again.”
DEU.33.12	About the tribe of Benjamin he said:
DEU.33.12	“This is the tribe the 
DEU.33.12	He guards them all the day long,
DEU.33.12	And he dwells in their midst.”
DEU.33.13	About the tribe of Joseph he said:
DEU.33.13	“May the 
DEU.33.13	And with water from under the earth.
DEU.33.14	May their land be blessed with sun-ripened fruit,
DEU.33.14	Rich with the best fruits of each season.
DEU.33.15	May their ancient hills be covered with choice fruit.
DEU.33.16	May their land be filled with all that is good,
DEU.33.16	Blessed by the goodness of the 
DEU.33.16	Who spoke from the burning bush.
DEU.33.16	May these blessings come to the tribe of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	Because he was the leader among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	Joseph has the strength of a bull,
DEU.33.17	The horns of a wild ox.
DEU.33.17	His horns are Manasseh's thousands
DEU.33.17	And Ephraim's ten thousands.
DEU.33.17	With them he gores the nations
DEU.33.17	And pushes them to the ends of the earth.”
DEU.33.18	About the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar he said:
DEU.33.18	“May Zebulun be prosperous in their trade on the sea,
DEU.33.18	And may Issachar's wealth increase at home.
DEU.33.19	They invite foreigners to their mountain
DEU.33.19	And offer the right sacrifices there.
DEU.33.19	They get their wealth from the sea
DEU.33.19	And from the sand along the shore.”
DEU.33.20	About the tribe of Gad he said:
DEU.33.20	“Praise God, who made their territory large.
DEU.33.20	Gad waits like a lion
DEU.33.20	To tear off an arm or a scalp.
DEU.33.21	They took the best of the land for themselves;
DEU.33.21	A leader's share was assigned to them.
DEU.33.21	They obeyed the 
DEU.33.21	When the leaders of Israel were gathered together.”
DEU.33.22	About the tribe of Dan he said:
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a young lion;
DEU.33.22	He leaps out from Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	About the tribe of Naphtali he said:
DEU.33.23	“Naphtali is richly blessed by the 
DEU.33.23	Their land reaches to the south from Lake Galilee.”
DEU.33.24	About the tribe of Asher he said:
DEU.33.24	“Asher is blessed more than the other tribes.
DEU.33.24	May he be the favorite of his brothers,
DEU.33.24	And may his land be rich with olive trees.
DEU.33.25	May his towns be protected with iron gates,
DEU.33.25	And may he always live secure.”
DEU.33.26	People of Israel, no god is like your God,
DEU.33.26	riding in splendor across the sky,
DEU.33.26	riding through the clouds to come to your aid.
DEU.33.27	God has always been your defense;
DEU.33.27	his eternal arms are your support.
DEU.33.27	He drove out your enemies as you advanced,
DEU.33.27	and told you to destroy them all.
DEU.33.28	So Jacob's descendants live in peace,
DEU.33.28	secure in a land full of grain and wine,
DEU.33.28	where dew from the sky waters the ground.
DEU.33.29	Israel, how happy you are!
DEU.33.29	There is no one like you,
DEU.33.29	a nation saved by the 
DEU.33.29	The 
DEU.33.29	to defend you and give you victory.
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will come begging for mercy,
DEU.33.29	and you will trample them down.
DEU.34.1	Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Mount Pisgah east of Jericho, and there the 
DEU.34.2	the entire territory of Naphtali; the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh; the territory of Judah as far west as the Mediterranean Sea; 
DEU.34.3	the southern part of Judah; and the plain that reaches from Zoar to Jericho, the city of palm trees. 
DEU.34.4	 Then the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses, the 
DEU.34.6	The 
DEU.34.7	Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; he was as strong as ever, and his eyesight was still good. 
DEU.34.8	The people of Israel mourned for him for thirty days in the plains of Moab.
DEU.34.9	Joshua son of Nun was filled with wisdom, because Moses had appointed him to be his successor. The people of Israel obeyed Joshua and kept the commands that the 
DEU.34.11	No other prophet has ever done miracles and wonders like those that the 
DEU.34.12	No other prophet has been able to do the great and terrifying things that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	After the death of the 
JOS.1.2	He said, “My servant Moses is dead. Get ready now, you and all the people of Israel, and cross the Jordan River into the land that I am giving them. 
JOS.1.3	 As I told Moses, I have given you and all my people the entire land that you will be marching over. 
JOS.1.4	Your borders will reach from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north; from the great Euphrates River in the east, through the Hittite country, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
JOS.1.5	 Joshua, no one will be able to defeat you as long as you live. I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will always be with you; I will never abandon you. 
JOS.1.6	 Be determined and confident, for you will be the leader of these people as they occupy this land which I promised their ancestors. 
JOS.1.7	Just be determined, be confident; and make sure that you obey the whole Law that my servant Moses gave you. Do not neglect any part of it and you will succeed wherever you go. 
JOS.1.8	Be sure that the book of the Law is always read in your worship. Study it day and night, and make sure that you obey everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. 
JOS.1.9	Remember that I have commanded you to be determined and confident! Do not be afraid or discouraged, for I, the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua ordered the leaders to 
JOS.1.11	go through the camp and say to the people, “Get some food ready, because in three days you are going to cross the Jordan River to occupy the land that the 
JOS.1.13	“Remember how the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your children, and your livestock will stay here, but your soldiers, armed for battle, will cross over ahead of the other Israelites in order to help them 
JOS.1.15	until they have occupied the land west of the Jordan that the 
JOS.1.16	They answered Joshua, “We will do everything you have told us and will go anywhere you send us. 
JOS.1.17	We will obey you, just as we always obeyed Moses, and may the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever questions your authority or disobeys any of your orders will be put to death. Be determined and confident!”
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho heard that some Israelites had come that night to spy out the country, 
JOS.2.3	so he sent word to Rahab: “The men in your house have come to spy out the whole country! Bring them out!”
JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6	“Some men did come to my house,” she answered, “but I don't know where they were from. They left at sundown before the city gate was closed. I didn't find out where they were going, but if you start after them quickly, you can catch them.” (Now Rahab had taken the two spies up on the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax that she had put there.) 
JOS.2.7	The king's men left the city, and then the gate was shut. They went looking for the Israelite spies as far as the place where the road crosses the Jordan.
JOS.2.8	Before the spies settled down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof 
JOS.2.9	and said to them, “I know that the 
JOS.2.10	 We have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	We were afraid as soon as we heard about it; we have all lost our courage because of you. The 
JOS.2.12	Now swear by him that you will treat my family as kindly as I have treated you, and give me some sign that I can trust you. 
JOS.2.13	Promise me that you will save my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families! Don't let us be killed!”
JOS.2.14	The men said to her, “May God take our lives if we don't do as we say!
JOS.2.15	Rahab lived in a house built into the city wall, so she let the men down from the window by a rope. 
JOS.2.16	“Go into the hill country,” she said, “or the king's men will find you. Hide there for three days until they come back. After that, you can go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We will keep the promise that you have made us give. 
JOS.2.18	This is what you must do. When we invade your land, tie this red cord to the window you let us down from. Get your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's family together in your house. 
JOS.2.19	If anyone goes out of the house, his death will be his own fault, and we will not be responsible; but if anyone in the house with you is harmed, then we will be responsible. 
JOS.2.20	However, if you tell anyone what we have been doing, then we will not have to keep our promise which you have made us give you.” 
JOS.2.21	She agreed and sent them away. When they had gone, she tied the red cord to the window.
JOS.2.22	The spies went into the hills and hid. The king's men looked for them all over the countryside for three days, but they did not find them, so they returned to Jericho. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two spies came down from the hills, crossed the river, and went back to Joshua. They told him everything that had happened, 
JOS.2.24	and then said, “We are sure that the 
JOS.3.1	The next morning Joshua and all the people of Israel got up early, left the camp at Acacia, and went to the Jordan, where they camped while waiting to cross it. 
JOS.3.2	Three days later the leaders went through the camp 
JOS.3.3	and told the people, “When you see the priests carrying the Covenant Box of the 
JOS.3.4	You have never been here before, so they will show you the way to go. But do not get near the Covenant Box; stay about half a mile behind it.”
JOS.3.5	Joshua told the people, “Purify yourselves, because tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	Then he told the priests to take the Covenant Box and go with it ahead of the people. They did as he said.
JOS.3.7	The 
JOS.3.8	Tell the priests carrying the Covenant Box that when they reach the river, they must wade in and stand near the bank.”
JOS.3.9	Then Joshua said to the people, “Come here and listen to what the 
JOS.3.10	As you advance, he will surely drive out the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. You will know that the living God is among you 
JOS.3.11	when the Covenant Box of the Lord of all the earth crosses the Jordan ahead of you. 
JOS.3.12	Now choose twelve men, one from each of the tribes of Israel. 
JOS.3.13	When the priests who carry the Covenant Box of the 
JOS.3.14+JOS.3.15	It was harvest time, and the river was in flood.
JOS.3.14+JOS.3.15	When the people left the camp to cross the Jordan, the priests went ahead of them, carrying the Covenant Box. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, 
JOS.3.16	the water stopped flowing and piled up, far upstream at Adam, the city beside Zarethan. The flow downstream to the Dead Sea was completely cut off, and the people were able to cross over near Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	While the people walked across on dry ground, the priests carrying the 
JOS.4.1	When the whole nation had crossed the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	“Choose twelve men, one from each tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and command them to take twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests were standing. Tell them to carry these stones with them and to put them down where you camp tonight.”
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men he had chosen, 
JOS.4.5	and he told them, “Go into the Jordan ahead of the Covenant Box of the 
JOS.4.6	These stones will remind the people of what the 
JOS.4.7	you will tell them that the water of the Jordan stopped flowing when the 
JOS.4.8	The men followed Joshua's orders. As the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, where the priests carrying the Covenant Box had stood. (Those stones are still there.) 
JOS.4.10	The priests stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything had been done that the 
JOS.4.10	The people hurried across the river. 
JOS.4.11	When they were all on the other side, the priests with the 
JOS.4.12	The men of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and of half the tribe of Manasseh, ready for battle, crossed ahead of the rest of the people, as Moses had told them to do. 
JOS.4.13	In the presence of the 
JOS.4.14	What the 
JOS.4.15	Then the 
JOS.4.16	to command the priests carrying the Covenant Box to come up out of the Jordan. 
JOS.4.17	Joshua did so, 
JOS.4.18	and when the priests reached the riverbank, the river began flowing once more and flooded its banks again.
JOS.4.19	The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	There Joshua set up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan. 
JOS.4.21	And he said to the people of Israel, “In the future, when your children ask you what these stones mean, 
JOS.4.22	you will tell them about the time when Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground. 
JOS.4.23	Tell them that the 
JOS.4.24	Because of this everyone on earth will know how great the 
JOS.5.1	All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea heard that the 
JOS.5.2	Then the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua did as the 
JOS.5.4+JOS.5.5+JOS.5.6	 When the people of Israel left Egypt, all the males were already circumcised. However, during the forty years the people spent crossing the desert, none of the baby boys had been circumcised. Also, by the end of that time all the men who were of fighting age when they left Egypt had died because they had disobeyed the 
JOS.5.7	The sons of these men had never been circumcised, and it was this new generation that Joshua circumcised.
JOS.5.8	After the circumcision was completed, the whole nation stayed in the camp until the wounds had healed. 
JOS.5.9	The 
JOS.5.11	The next day was the first time they ate food grown in Canaan: roasted grain and bread made without yeast. 
JOS.5.12	 The manna stopped falling then, and the Israelites no longer had any. From that time on they ate food grown in Canaan.
JOS.5.13	While Joshua was near Jericho, he suddenly saw a man standing in front of him, holding a sword. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you one of our soldiers, or an enemy?”
JOS.5.14	“Neither,” the man answered. “I am here as the commander of the 
JOS.5.14	Joshua threw himself on the ground in worship and said, “I am your servant, sir. What do you want me to do?”
JOS.5.15	And the commander of the 
JOS.6.1	The gates of Jericho were kept shut and guarded to keep the Israelites out. No one could enter or leave the city. 
JOS.6.2	The 
JOS.6.3	You and your soldiers are to march around the city once a day for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Seven priests, each carrying a trumpet, are to go in front of the Covenant Box. On the seventh day you and your soldiers are to march around the city seven times while the priests blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	Then they are to sound one long note. As soon as you hear it, all the people are to give a loud shout, and the city walls will collapse. Then the whole army will go straight into the city.”
JOS.6.6	Joshua called the priests and told them, “Take the Covenant Box, and seven of you go in front of it, carrying trumpets.” 
JOS.6.7	Then he ordered the people to start marching around the city, with an advance guard going on ahead of the 
JOS.6.8+JOS.6.9	So, just as Joshua had ordered, an advance guard started out ahead of the priests who were blowing trumpets; behind these came the priests who were carrying the Covenant Box, followed by a rear guard. All this time the trumpets were sounding. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua had ordered the people not to shout, not to say a word until he gave the order. 
JOS.6.11	So he had this group of men take the 
JOS.6.12+JOS.6.13	Joshua got up early the next morning, and for the second time the priests and soldiers marched around the city in the same order as the day before: first, the advance guard; next, the seven priests blowing the seven trumpets; then, the priests carrying the 
JOS.6.14	On this second day they again marched around the city one time and then returned to camp. They did this for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day they got up at daybreak and marched seven times around the city in the same way—this was the only day that they marched around it seven times. 
JOS.6.16	The seventh time around, when the priests were about to sound the trumpets, Joshua ordered the people to shout, and he said, “The 
JOS.6.17	The city and everything in it must be totally destroyed as an offering to the 
JOS.6.18	But you are not to take anything that is to be destroyed; if you do, you will bring trouble and destruction on the Israelite camp. 
JOS.6.19	Everything made of silver, gold, bronze, or iron is set apart for the 
JOS.6.21	With their swords they killed everyone in the city, men and women, young and old. They also killed the cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
JOS.6.22	Joshua then told the two men who had served as spies, “Go into the prostitute's house, and bring her and her family out, as you promised her.” 
JOS.6.23	So they went and brought Rahab out, along with her father and mother, her brothers, and the rest of her family. They took them all, family and slaves, to safety near the Israelite camp. 
JOS.6.24	Then they set fire to the city and burned it to the ground, along with everything in it, except the things made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, which they took and put in the 
JOS.6.25	 But Joshua spared the lives of the prostitute Rahab and all her relatives, because she had hidden the two spies that he had sent to Jericho. (Her descendants have lived in Israel to this day.)
JOS.6.26	Whoever lays the foundation will lose his oldest son;
JOS.6.26	Whoever builds the gates will lose his youngest.”
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	The 
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai, a city east of Bethel, near Bethaven, with orders to go and explore the land. When they had done so, 
JOS.7.3	they reported back to Joshua: “There is no need for everyone to attack Ai. Send only about two or three thousand men. Don't send the whole army up there to fight; it is not a large city.” 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand Israelites made the attack, but they were forced to retreat. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai chased them from the city gate as far as some quarries and killed about thirty-six of them on the way down the hill. Then the Israelites lost their courage and were afraid.
JOS.7.6	Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief, threw themselves to the ground before the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, “Sovereign 
JOS.7.8	What can I say, O Lord, now that Israel has retreated from the enemy? 
JOS.7.9	The Canaanites and everyone else in the country will hear about it. They will surround us and kill every one of us! And then what will you do to protect your honor?”
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned! They have broken the agreement with me that I ordered them to keep. They have taken some of the things condemned to destruction. They stole them, lied about it, and put them with their own things. 
JOS.7.12	This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They retreat from them because they themselves have now been condemned to destruction! I will not stay with you any longer unless you destroy the things you were ordered not to take! 
JOS.7.13	Get up! Purify the people and get them ready to come before me. Tell them to be ready tomorrow, because I, the 
JOS.7.14	So tell them that in the morning they will be brought forward, tribe by tribe. The tribe that I pick out will then come forward, clan by clan. The clan that I pick out will come forward, family by family. The family that I pick out will come forward, one by one. 
JOS.7.15	The one who is then picked out and found with the condemned goods will be burned, along with his family and everything he owns, for he has brought terrible shame on Israel and has broken my covenant.”
JOS.7.16	Early the next morning Joshua brought Israel forward, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was picked out. 
JOS.7.17	He brought the tribe of Judah forward, clan by clan, and the clan of Zerah was picked out. Then he brought the clan of Zerah forward, family by family, and the family of Zabdi was picked out. 
JOS.7.18	He then brought Zabdi's family forward, one by one, and Achan, the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, was picked out. 
JOS.7.19	Joshua said to him, “My son, tell the truth here before the 
JOS.7.20	“It's true,” Achan answered. “I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	Among the things we seized I saw a beautiful Babylonian cloak, about five pounds of silver, and a bar of gold weighing over one pound. I wanted them so much that I took them. You will find them buried inside my tent, with the silver at the bottom.”
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent some men, who ran to the tent and found that the condemned things really were buried there, with the silver at the bottom. 
JOS.7.23	They brought them out of the tent, took them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them down in the presence of the 
JOS.7.24	Joshua, along with all the people of Israel, seized Achan, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, together with Achan's sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned; and they took them to Trouble Valley. 
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, “Why have you brought such trouble on us? The 
JOS.7.26	They put a huge pile of stones over him, which is there to this day. That is why that place is still called Trouble Valley.
JOS.7.26	Then the 
JOS.8.1	The 
JOS.8.2	You are to do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king, but this time you may keep its goods and livestock for yourselves. Prepare to attack the city by surprise from the rear.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua got ready to go to Ai with all his soldiers. He picked out thirty thousand of his best troops and sent them out at night 
JOS.8.4	with these orders: “Hide on the other side of the city, but not too far away from it; be ready to attack. 
JOS.8.5	My men and I will approach the city. When the men of Ai come out against us, we will turn and run, just as we did the first time. 
JOS.8.6	They will pursue us until we have led them away from the city. They will think that we are running from them, as we did before. 
JOS.8.7	Then you will come out of hiding and capture the city. The 
JOS.8.8	After you have taken the city, set it on fire, just as the 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them out, and they went to their hiding place and waited there, west of Ai, between Ai and Bethel. Joshua spent the night in camp.
JOS.8.10	Early in the morning Joshua got up and called the soldiers together. Then he and the leaders of Israel led them to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	The soldiers with him went toward the main entrance to the city and set up camp on the north side, with a valley between themselves and Ai. 
JOS.8.12	He took about five thousand men and put them in hiding west of the city, between Ai and Bethel. 
JOS.8.13	The soldiers were arranged for battle with the main camp north of the city and the rest of the men to the west. Joshua spent the night in the valley. 
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw Joshua's men, he acted quickly. He and all his men went out toward the Jordan Valley to fight the Israelites at the same place as before, not knowing that he was about to be attacked from the rear. 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and his men pretended that they were retreating, and ran away toward the barren country. 
JOS.8.16	All the men in the city had been called together to go after them, and as they pursued Joshua, they kept getting farther away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Every man in Ai
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	and as soon as he lifted his hand, the men who had been hiding got up quickly, ran into the city and captured it. They immediately set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke rising to the sky. There was no way for them to escape, because the Israelites who had run toward the barren country now turned around to attack them. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and his men saw that the others had taken the city and that it was on fire, they turned around and began killing the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	The Israelites in the city now came down to join the battle. So the men of Ai found themselves completely surrounded by Israelites, and they were all killed. No one got away, and no one lived through it 
JOS.8.23	except the king of Ai. He was captured and taken to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	The Israelites killed every one of the enemy in the barren country where they had chased them. Then they went back to Ai and killed everyone there. 
JOS.8.25+JOS.8.26	Joshua kept his spear pointed at Ai and did not put it down until every person there had been killed. The whole population of Ai was killed that day—twelve thousand men and women. 
JOS.8.27	The Israelites kept for themselves the livestock and goods captured in the city, as the 
JOS.8.28	Joshua burned Ai and left it in ruins. It is still like that today. 
JOS.8.29	He hanged the king of Ai from a tree and left his body there until evening. At sundown Joshua gave orders for the body to be removed, and it was thrown down at the entrance to the city gate. They covered it with a huge pile of stones, which is still there today.
JOS.8.31	 He made it according to the instructions that Moses, the 
JOS.8.32	There, with the Israelites looking on, Joshua made on the stones
JOS.8.33	 The Israelites, with their leaders, officers, and judges, as well as the foreigners among them, stood on two sides of the 
JOS.8.34	Joshua then read aloud the whole Law, including the blessings and the curses, just as they are written in the book of the Law. 
JOS.8.35	Every one of the commandments of Moses was read by Joshua to the whole gathering, which included women and children, as well as the foreigners living among them.
JOS.9.1	The victories of Israel became known to all the kings west of the Jordan—in the hills, in the foothills, and all along the coastal plain of the Mediterranean Sea as far north as Lebanon; these were the kings of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
JOS.9.2	They all came together and joined forces to fight against Joshua and the Israelites.
JOS.9.3	But the people of Gibeon, who were Hivites, heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	and they decided to deceive him. They went and got some food and loaded their donkeys with worn-out sacks and patched-up wineskins. 
JOS.9.5	They put on ragged clothes and worn-out sandals that had been mended. The bread they took with them was dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to the camp at Gilgal and said to Joshua and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant land. We want you to make a treaty with us.”
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are at your service.”
JOS.9.8	Joshua asked them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	Then they told him this story: “We have come from a very distant land, sir, because we have heard of the 
JOS.9.10	 and what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan: King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	Our leaders and all the people that live in our land told us to get some food ready for a trip and to go and meet you. We were told to put ourselves at your service and ask you to make a treaty with us. 
JOS.9.12	Look at our bread. When we left home with it and started out to meet you, it was still warm. But look! Now it is dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.13	When we filled these wineskins, they were new, but look! They are torn. Our clothes and sandals are worn out from the long trip.”
JOS.9.14	The Israelites accepted some food from them, but did not consult the 
JOS.9.15	Joshua made a treaty of friendship with the people of Gibeon and allowed them to live. The leaders of the community of Israel gave their solemn promise to keep the treaty.
JOS.9.16	Three days after the treaty had been made, the Israelites learned that these people did indeed live nearby. 
JOS.9.17	So the people of Israel started out and three days later arrived at the cities where these people lived: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites could not kill them, because their leaders had made a solemn promise to them in the name of the 
JOS.9.19	but they answered, “We have made our solemn promise to them in the name of the 
JOS.9.20	We must let them live because of our promise; if we don't, God will punish us. 
JOS.9.21	Let them live, but they will have to cut wood and carry water for us.” This was what the leaders suggested.
JOS.9.22	Joshua ordered the people of Gibeon to be brought to him, and he asked them, “Why did you deceive us and tell us that you were from far away, when you live right here? 
JOS.9.23	Because you did this, God has condemned you. Your people will always be slaves, cutting wood and carrying water for the sanctuary of my God.”
JOS.9.24	They answered, “We did it, sir, because we learned that it was really true that the 
JOS.9.25	Now we are in your power; do with us what you think is right.” 
JOS.9.26	So this is what Joshua did: he protected them and did not allow the people of Israel to kill them. 
JOS.9.27	But at the same time he made them slaves, to cut wood and carry water for the people of Israel and for the 
JOS.10.1	Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem,
JOS.10.2	The people of Jerusalem were greatly alarmed at this because Gibeon was as large as any of the cities that had a king; it was larger than Ai, and its men were good fighters. 
JOS.10.3	So Adonizedek sent the following message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and to King Debir of Eglon: 
JOS.10.4	“Come and help me attack Gibeon, because its people have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” 
JOS.10.5	These five Amorite kings, the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, joined forces, surrounded Gibeon, and attacked it.
JOS.10.6	The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal: “Do not abandon us, sir! Come at once and help us! Save us! All the Amorite kings in the hill country have joined forces and have attacked us!”
JOS.10.7	So Joshua and his whole army, including the best troops, started out from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.8	The 
JOS.10.9	All night Joshua and his army marched from Gilgal to Gibeon, and they made a surprise attack on the Amorites. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	While the Amorites were running down the pass from the Israelite army, the 
JOS.10.12	On the day that the 
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand still over Gibeon;
JOS.10.12	Moon, stop over Aijalon Valley.”
JOS.10.14	Never before, and never since, has there been a day like it, when the 
JOS.10.15	After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	The five Amorite kings, however, had escaped and were hiding in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	Someone found them, and Joshua was told where they were hiding. 
JOS.10.18	He said, “Roll some big stones in front of the entrance to the cave. Place some guards there, 
JOS.10.19	but don't stay there yourselves. Keep on after the enemy and attack them from the rear; don't let them get to their cities! The 
JOS.10.20	Joshua and the men of Israel slaughtered them, although some managed to find safety inside their city walls and were not killed. 
JOS.10.21	Then all of Joshua's men came back safe to him at the camp at Makkedah.
JOS.10.21	No one in the land dared even to speak against the Israelites.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the entrance to the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” 
JOS.10.23	So the cave was opened, and the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon were brought out 
JOS.10.24	and taken to Joshua. Joshua then called all the men of Israel to him and ordered the officers who had gone with him to come and put their feet on the necks of the kings. They did so. 
JOS.10.25	Then Joshua said to his officers, “Don't be afraid or discouraged. Be determined and confident because this is what the 
JOS.10.26	Then Joshua killed the kings and hanged them on five trees, where their bodies stayed until evening. 
JOS.10.27	At sundown Joshua gave orders, and their bodies were taken down and thrown into the same cave where they had hidden earlier. Large stones were placed at the entrance to the cave, and they are still there.
JOS.10.28	Joshua attacked and captured Makkedah and its king that day. He put everyone in the city to death; no one was left alive. He did to the king of Makkedah what he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	After this, Joshua and his army went on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. 
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	After this, Joshua and his army went on from Libnah to Lachish, surrounded it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.32	The 
JOS.10.33	King Horam of Gezer came to the aid of Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army and left none of them alive.
JOS.10.34	Next, Joshua and his army went on from Lachish to Eglon, surrounded it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it the same day and put everyone there to death, just as they had done at Lachish.
JOS.10.36	After this, Joshua and his army went from Eglon up into the hills to Hebron, attacked it 
JOS.10.37	and captured it. They killed the king and everyone else in the city as well as in the nearby towns. Joshua condemned the city to total destruction, just as he had done to Eglon. No one in it was left alive.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and his army turned back to Debir and attacked it. 
JOS.10.39	He captured it, with its king and all the nearby towns. They put everyone there to death. Joshua did to Debir and its king what he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king.
JOS.10.40	Joshua conquered the whole land. He defeated the kings of the hill country, the eastern slopes, and the western foothills, as well as those of the dry country in the south. He spared no one; everyone was put to death. This was what the 
JOS.10.41	Joshua's campaign took him from Kadesh Barnea in the south to Gaza near the coast, including all the area of Goshen, and as far north as Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua conquered all these kings and their territory in one campaign because the 
JOS.10.43	After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When the news of Israel's victories reached King Jabin of Hazor, he sent word to King Jobab of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings in the hill country in the north, in the Jordan Valley south of Lake Galilee, in the foothills, and on the coast near Dor. 
JOS.11.3	He also sent word to the Canaanites on both sides of the Jordan, to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, as well as to the Hivites who lived at the foot of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	They came with all their soldiers—an army with as many men as there are grains of sand on the seashore. They also had many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	All of these kings joined forces and came together and set up camp at Merom Brook to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	The 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all his men attacked them by surprise at Merom Brook. 
JOS.11.8	The 
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them what the 
JOS.11.10	Joshua then turned back, captured Hazor and killed its king. (At that time Hazor was the most powerful of all those kingdoms.) 
JOS.11.11	They put everyone there to death; no one was left alive, and the city was burned.
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all these cities and their kings, putting everyone to death, just as Moses, the 
JOS.11.13	However, the Israelites did not burn any of the cities built on mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua did burn. 
JOS.11.14	The people of Israel took all the valuables and livestock from these cities and kept them for themselves. But they put every person to death; no one was left alive. 
JOS.11.15	The 
JOS.11.16	Joshua captured all the land—the hill country and foothills, both north and south, all the area of Goshen and the dry country south of it, as well as the Jordan Valley. 
JOS.11.17+JOS.11.18	The territory extended from Mount Halak in the south near Edom, as far as Baalgad in the north, in the valley of Lebanon south of Mount Hermon. Joshua was at war with the kings of this territory for a long time, but he captured them all and put them to death. 
JOS.11.19	The only city that made peace with the people of Israel was Gibeon, where some of the Hivites lived. All the others were conquered in battle. 
JOS.11.20	 The 
JOS.11.21	At this time Joshua went and destroyed the race of giants called the Anakim who lived in the hill country—in Hebron, Debir, Anab, and in all the hill country of Judah and Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them and their cities. 
JOS.11.22	None of the Anakim were left in the land of Israel; a few, however, were left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
JOS.11.23	Joshua captured the whole land, as the 
JOS.11.23	So the people rested from war.
JOS.12.2	One was Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon. His kingdom included half of Gilead: from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and from the city in
JOS.12.3	it included the Jordan Valley from Lake Galilee south to Beth Jeshimoth (east of the Dead Sea) and on toward the foot of Mount Pisgah.
JOS.12.4	They also defeated King Og of Bashan, who was one of the last of the Rephaim; he ruled at Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
JOS.12.5	His kingdom included Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all of Bashan as far as the boundaries of Geshur and Maacah, as well as half of Gilead, as far as the territory of King Sihon of Heshbon.
JOS.12.7	Joshua and the people of Israel defeated all the kings in the territory west of the Jordan, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak in the south near Edom. Joshua divided this land among the tribes and gave it to them as a permanent possession. 
JOS.12.8	This portion included the hill country, the western foothills, the Jordan Valley and its foothills, the eastern slopes, and the dry country in the south. This land had been the home of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
JOS.12.9	The people of Israel defeated the kings of the following cities: Jericho, Ai (near Bethel), 
JOS.12.10	Jerusalem, Hebron, 
JOS.12.11	Jarmuth, Lachish, 
JOS.12.12	Eglon, Gezer, 
JOS.12.13	Debir, Geder, 
JOS.12.14	Hormah, Arad, 
JOS.12.15	Libnah, Adullam, 
JOS.12.16	Makkedah, Bethel, 
JOS.12.17	Tappuah, Hepher, 
JOS.12.18	Aphek, Lasharon, 
JOS.12.19	Madon, Hazor, 
JOS.12.20	Shimron Meron, Achshaph, 
JOS.12.21	Taanach, Megiddo, 
JOS.12.22	Kedesh, Jokneam (in Carmel), 
JOS.12.23	Dor (on the coast), Goiim (in Galilee
JOS.12.24	and Tirzah—thirty-one kings in all.
JOS.13.1	Joshua was now very old. The 
JOS.13.2	all the territory of Philistia and Geshur, 
JOS.13.3	as well as all the territory of the Avvim to the south. (The land from the stream Shihor, at the Egyptian border, as far north as the border of Ekron was considered Canaanite; the kings of the Philistines lived at Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.) 
JOS.13.4	There is still all the Canaanite country, and Mearah (which belonged to the Sidonians), as far as Aphek, at the Amorite border; 
JOS.13.5	the land of the Gebalites; all of Lebanon to the east, from Baalgad, which is south of Mount Hermon, to Hamath Pass. 
JOS.13.6	 This includes all the territory of the Sidonians, who live in the hill country between the Lebanon Mountains and Misrephoth Maim. I will drive all these peoples out as the people of Israel advance. You must divide the land among the Israelites, just as I have commanded you to do. 
JOS.13.7	Now then, divide this land among the other nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh, for them to possess as their own.”
JOS.13.9	Their territory extended to Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and the city in the middle of that valley and included all of the plateau from Medeba to Dibon. 
JOS.13.10	It went as far as the border of Ammon and included all the cities that had been ruled by the Amorite king Sihon, who had ruled at Heshbon. 
JOS.13.11	It included Gilead, the regions of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah. 
JOS.13.12	It included the kingdom of Og, the last of the Rephaim, who had ruled at Ashtaroth and Edrei. Moses had defeated these people and driven them out. 
JOS.13.13	However, the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah; they still live in Israel.
JOS.13.15	Moses had given a part of the land to the families of the tribe of Reuben as their possession. 
JOS.13.16	Their territory extended to Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and the city in the middle of that valley and included all the plateau around Medeba. 
JOS.13.17	It included Heshbon and all the cities on the plateau: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baalmeon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Bethpeor, the slopes of Mount Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth. 
JOS.13.21	It included all the cities of the plateau and the whole kingdom of the Amorite king Sihon, who had ruled at Heshbon. Moses defeated him, as well as the rulers of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. All of them had ruled the land for King Sihon. 
JOS.13.22	Among those whom the people of Israel killed was the fortune teller Balaam son of Beor. 
JOS.13.23	The Jordan was the western border of the tribe of Reuben. These were the cities and towns given to the families of the tribe of Reuben as their possession.
JOS.13.24	Moses had also given a part of the land to the families of the tribe of Gad as their possession. 
JOS.13.25	Their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, half the land of Ammon as far as Aroer, which is east of Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	their land extended from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh and Betonim, from Mahanaim to the border of Lodebar. 
JOS.13.27	In the Jordan Valley it included Beth Haram, Bethnimrah, Sukkoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. Their western border was the Jordan River as far north as Lake Galilee. 
JOS.13.28	These were the cities and towns given to the families of the tribe of Gad as their possession.
JOS.13.29	Moses had given a part of the land to the families of half the tribe of Manasseh as their possession. 
JOS.13.30	Their territory extended to Mahanaim and included all of Bashan—the whole kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, as well as all sixty of the villages of Jair in Bashan. 
JOS.13.31	It included half of Gilead, as well as Ashtaroth and Edrei, the capital cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan. All this was given to half the families descended from Machir son of Manasseh.
JOS.13.32	This is how Moses divided the land east of Jericho and the Jordan when he was in the plains of Moab. 
JOS.13.33	 But Moses did not assign any land to the tribe of Levi. He told them that their possession was to be a share of the offerings to the 
JOS.14.1	What follows is an account of how the land of Canaan west of the Jordan was divided among the people of Israel. Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the families of the Israelite tribes divided it among the population. 
JOS.14.2	 As the 
JOS.14.3+JOS.14.4	 Moses had already assigned the land east of the Jordan to the other two and one-half tribes. (The descendants of Joseph were divided into two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim.) However, Moses gave the Levites no portion of the territory. Instead, they received cities to live in, with fields for their cattle and flocks. 
JOS.14.5	The people of Israel divided the land as the 
JOS.14.7	 I was forty years old when the 
JOS.14.8	The men who went with me, however, made our people afraid. But I faithfully obeyed the 
JOS.14.9	 Because I did, Moses promised me that my children and I would certainly receive as our possession the land which I walked over. 
JOS.14.10	But now, look. It has been forty-five years since the 
JOS.14.11	and am just as strong today as I was when Moses sent me out. I am still strong enough for war or for anything else. 
JOS.14.12	Now then, give me the hill country that the 
JOS.14.13	Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him the city of Hebron as his possession. 
JOS.14.14	Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, because he faithfully obeyed the 
JOS.14.15	Before this, Hebron was called the city of Arba. (Arba had been the greatest of the Anakim.)
JOS.14.15	There was now peace in the land.
JOS.15.1	The families of the tribe of Judah received a part of the land described as follows:
JOS.15.1	The land reached south to the southernmost point of the wilderness of Zin, at the border of Edom. 
JOS.15.2	This southern border ran from the south end of the Dead Sea, 
JOS.15.3	went southward from the Akrabbim Pass and on to Zin. It ran south of Kadesh Barnea, past Hezron and up to Addar, turned toward Karka, 
JOS.15.4	went on to Azmon, and followed the stream on the border of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea, where the border ended. That was the southern border of Judah.
JOS.15.5	The eastern border was the Dead Sea, all the way up to the inlet where the Jordan empties into it.
JOS.15.5	The northern border began there, 
JOS.15.6	extended up to Beth Hoglah, and went north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. Then it went up to the Stone of Bohan (Bohan was a son of Reuben), 
JOS.15.7	from Trouble Valley up to Debir, and then turned north toward Gilgal, which faces Adummim Pass on the south side of the valley. It then went on to the springs of Enshemesh, out to Enrogel, 
JOS.15.8	and up through Hinnom Valley on the south side of the hill where the Jebusite city of Jerusalem was located. The border then proceeded up to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of Rephaim Valley. 
JOS.15.9	From there it went to the Springs of Nephtoah and out to the cities near Mount Ephron. There it turned toward Baalah (or Kiriath Jearim), 
JOS.15.10	where it circled west of Baalah toward the hill country of Edom, went on the north side of Mount Jearim (or Chesalon), down to Beth Shemesh, and on past Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	The border then went out to the hill north of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, past Mount Baalah, and on to Jamnia. It ended at the Mediterranean Sea, 
JOS.15.12	which formed the western border.
JOS.15.12	Within these borders lived the people of the families of Judah.
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove the descendants of Anak out of the city—the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
JOS.15.15	From there he went to attack the people living in Debir. (This city used to be called Kiriath Sepher.) 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. 
JOS.15.18	On the wedding day Othniel urged her
JOS.15.19	She answered, “I want some water holes. The land you have given me is in the dry country.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the land that the families of the tribe of Judah received as their possession. 
JOS.15.21	The cities farthest south that belonged to them, those that were near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (or Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Bethpelet, 
JOS.15.28	Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: twenty-nine cities in all, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.33	The cities in the foothills were Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim: fourteen cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.37	There were also Zenan, Hadashah, Migdalgad, 
JOS.15.38	Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish, 
JOS.15.41	Gederoth, Bethdagon, Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.42	There were also Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.45	There was Ekron with its towns and villages, 
JOS.15.46	and all the cities and towns near Ashdod, from Ekron to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.47	There were Ashdod and Gaza, with their towns and villages, reaching to the stream on the border of Egypt and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	In the hill country there were Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath Sepher (or Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoa, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.52	There were Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Hebron, and Zior: nine cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.55	There were Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.58	There were Halhul, Bethzur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon: six cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.60	There were Kiriath Baal (or Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah: two cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.15.61	In the desert there were Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, Salt City, and Engedi: six cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.16.1	The southern boundary of the land assigned to the descendants of Joseph started from the Jordan near Jericho, at a point east of the springs of Jericho, and went into the desert. It went from Jericho up into the hill country as far as Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	From Bethel it went to Luz, passing on to Ataroth Addar, where the Archites lived. 
JOS.16.3	It then went west to the area of the Japhletites, as far as the area of Lower Beth Horon. It went on from there to Gezer and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.16.4	The descendants of Joseph, the tribes of Ephraim and West Manasseh, received this land as their possession.
JOS.16.5	This was the territory of the Ephraimite families: their border ran from Ataroth Addar eastward to Upper Beth Horon, 
JOS.16.6	and from there to the Mediterranean Sea. Michmethath was on their north. East of there the border bent toward Taanath Shiloh and went past it on the east to Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, reaching Jericho and ending at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	The border went west from Tappuah to the stream Kanah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the land given to the families of the tribe of Ephraim as their possession, 
JOS.16.9	along with some towns and villages that were within the borders of Manasseh, but given to the Ephraimites. 
JOS.16.10	 But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived among the Ephraimites to this day, but they have been forced to work as slaves.
JOS.17.1	A part of the land west of the Jordan was assigned to some of the families descended from Joseph's older son Manasseh. Machir, the father of Gilead, was Manasseh's oldest son and a military hero, so Gilead and Bashan, east of the Jordan, were assigned to him. 
JOS.17.2	Land west of the Jordan was assigned to the rest of the families of Manasseh: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and they were heads of families. 
JOS.17.3	Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, did not have any sons, but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	 They went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua son of Nun and to the leaders, and said, “The 
JOS.17.5	This is why Manasseh received ten shares in addition to Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan, 
JOS.17.6	since his female descendants as well as his male descendants were assigned land. The land of Gilead was assigned to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, east of Shechem. The border then went south to include the people of Entappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah, on the border, belonged to the descendants of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	The border then went down to the stream Kanah. The cities south of the stream belonged to Ephraim, even though they were in the territory of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh proceeded along the north side of the stream and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 
JOS.17.10	Ephraim was to the south, and Manasseh was to the north, with the Mediterranean Sea as their western border. Asher was to the northwest, and Issachar to the northeast. 
JOS.17.11	Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth Shan and Ibleam, along with their surrounding towns, as well as Dor (the one on the coast),
JOS.17.12	 The people of Manasseh, however, were not able to drive out the people living in those cities, so the Canaanites continued to live there. 
JOS.17.13	Even when the Israelites became stronger, they did not drive out all the Canaanites, but they did force them to work for them.
JOS.17.14	The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one part of the land to possess as our own? There are very many of us because the 
JOS.17.15	Joshua answered, “If there are so many of you and the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, then go into the forests and clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.”
JOS.17.16	They replied, “The hill country is not big enough for us, but the Canaanites in the plains have iron chariots, both those who live in Beth Shan and its surrounding towns and those who live in Jezreel Valley.”
JOS.17.17	Joshua said to the tribes of Ephraim and West Manasseh, “There are indeed many of you, and you are very powerful. You shall have more than one share. 
JOS.17.18	The hill country will be yours. Even though it is a forest, you will clear it and take possession of it from one end to the other. As for the Canaanites, you will drive them out, even though they do have iron chariots and are a strong people.”
JOS.18.1	After they had conquered the land, the entire community of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of the 
JOS.18.2	There were still seven tribes of the people of Israel who had not yet been assigned their share of the land. 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to the people of Israel, “How long are you going to wait before you go in and take the land that the 
JOS.18.4	Let me have three men from each tribe. I will send them out over the whole country to map out the territory that they would like to have as their possession. Then they are to come back to me. 
JOS.18.5	The land will be divided among them in seven parts; Judah will stay in its territory in the south, and Joseph in its territory in the north. 
JOS.18.6	Write down a description of these seven divisions and bring it to me. Then I will draw lots
JOS.18.7	The Levites, however, will not receive a share of the land with the rest of you, because their share is to serve as the 
JOS.18.8	The men went on their way to map out the land after Joshua had given them these instructions: “Go all over the land and map it out, and come back to me. And then here in Shiloh I will consult the 
JOS.18.9	So the men went all over the land and set down in writing how they divided it into seven parts, making a list of the towns. Then they went back to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua drew lots to consult the 
JOS.18.11	The territory belonging to the families of the tribe of Benjamin was the first to be assigned. Their land lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	On the north their border began at the Jordan and then went up the slope north of Jericho and westward through the hill country as far as the desert of Bethaven. 
JOS.18.13	The border then went to the slope on the south side of Luz (also called Bethel), then down to Ataroth Addar, on the mountain south of Lower Beth Horon. 
JOS.18.14	The border then went in another direction, turning south from the western side of this mountain and going to Kiriath Baal (or Kiriath Jearim), which belongs to the tribe of Judah. This was the western border. 
JOS.18.15	The southern border started on the edge of Kiriath Jearim and went
JOS.18.16	It then went down to the foot of the mountain that overlooks Hinnom Valley, at the north end of Rephaim Valley. It then went south through Hinnom Valley, south of the Jebusite ridge, toward Enrogel. 
JOS.18.17	It then turned north to Enshemesh and then on to Geliloth, opposite Adummim Pass. The border then went down to the Stone of Bohan (Bohan was a son of Reuben) 
JOS.18.18	and passed north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. It then went down into the valley, 
JOS.18.19	passing north of the ridge of Beth Hoglah, and ended at the northern inlet on the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River empties into it. This was the southern border. 
JOS.18.20	The Jordan was the eastern border. These were the borders of the land which the families of the tribe of Benjamin received as their possession.
JOS.18.21	The cities belonging to the families of the tribe of Benjamin were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Chepharammoni, Ophni, and Geba: twelve cities, along with the towns around them. 
JOS.18.25	There were also Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (or Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath Jearim: fourteen cities, along with the towns around them. This is the land which the families of the tribe of Benjamin received as their possession.
JOS.19.1	The second assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Simeon. Its territory extended into the land assigned to the tribe of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	 It included Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 
JOS.19.6	Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteen cities, along with the towns around them.
JOS.19.7	There were also Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan: four cities, along with the towns around them. 
JOS.19.8	This included all the towns around these cities as far as Baalath Beer (or Ramah), in the south. This was the land which the families of the tribe of Simeon received as their possession. 
JOS.19.9	Since Judah's assignment was larger than was needed, part of its territory was given to the tribe of Simeon.
JOS.19.10	The third assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Zebulun. The land which they received reached as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	From there the border went west to Mareal, touching Dabbesheth and the stream east of Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	On the other side of Sarid it went east to the border of Chisloth Tabor, then to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	It continued east from there to Gath Hepher and Ethkazin, turning in the direction of Neah on the way to Rimmon. 
JOS.19.14	On the north the border turned toward Hannathon, ending at Iphtahel Valley. 
JOS.19.15	It included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities, along with the towns around them. 
JOS.19.16	These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Zebulun received as their possession.
JOS.19.17	The fourth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Issachar. 
JOS.19.18	Its area included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
JOS.19.19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez. 
JOS.19.22	The border also touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh, ending at the Jordan. It included sixteen cities along with the towns around them. 
JOS.19.23	These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Issachar received as their possession.
JOS.19.24	The fifth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Asher. 
JOS.19.25	Its area included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allam Melech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west it touched Carmel and Shihor Libnath. 
JOS.19.27	As it turned east, the border went to Bethdagon, touching Zebulun and Iphtahel Valley on the way north to Bethemek and Neiel. It continued north to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	The border then turned to Ramah, reaching the fortified city of Tyre; then it turned to Hosah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. It included Mahalab, Achzib, 
JOS.19.30	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities, along with the towns around them. 
JOS.19.31	These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Asher received as their possession.
JOS.19.32	The sixth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Naphtali. 
JOS.19.33	Its border went from Heleph to the oak in Zaanannim, on to Adaminekeb and to Jamnia, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	There the border turned west to Aznoth Tabor, from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and the Jordan
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, Enhazor, 
JOS.19.38	Yiron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Beth Shemesh: nineteen cities, along with the towns around them. 
JOS.19.39	These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Naphtali received as their possession.
JOS.19.40	The seventh assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Dan. 
JOS.19.41	Its area included Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalbim, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Beneberak, Gathrimmon, 
JOS.19.46	Mejarkon, and Rakkon, as well as the territory around Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	 When the people of Dan lost their land, they went to Laish and attacked it. They captured it, killed its people, and claimed it for themselves. They settled there and changed the name of the city from Laish to Dan, naming it after their ancestor Dan. 
JOS.19.48	These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Dan received as their possession.
JOS.19.49	When the people of Israel finished dividing up the land, they gave Joshua son of Nun a part of the land as his own. 
JOS.19.50	As the 
JOS.19.51	Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the families of the tribes of Israel assigned these parts of the land by drawing lots
JOS.20.2	to say to the people of Israel, “Choose the cities of refuge that I had Moses tell you about. 
JOS.20.3	If any of you accidentally kills someone, you can go there and escape the one who is looking for revenge. 
JOS.20.4	You can run away to one of these cities, go to the place of judgment at the entrance to the city, and explain to the leaders what happened. Then they will let you into the city and give you a place to live in, so that you can stay there. 
JOS.20.5	If the one looking for revenge follows you there, the people of the city must not hand you over to that one. They must protect you because you killed the person accidentally and not out of anger. 
JOS.20.6	You may stay in the city until you have received a public trial and until the death of the man who is then the High Priest. Then you may go back home to your own town, from which you had run away.”
JOS.20.7	So, on the west side of the Jordan they set aside Kedesh in Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim; and Hebron, in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	East of the Jordan, on the desert plateau east of Jericho, they chose Bezer in the territory of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the territory of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the cities of refuge chosen for all the people of Israel and for any foreigner living among them. Any who killed a person accidentally could find protection there from the one looking for revenge; they could not be killed unless they had first received a public trial.
JOS.21.1	The leaders of the Levite families went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of all the tribes of Israel. 
JOS.21.2	 There at Shiloh in the land of Canaan they said to them, “The 
JOS.21.3	So in accordance with the 
JOS.21.4	The families of the Levite clan of Kohath were the first to be assigned cities. The families who were descended from Aaron the priest were assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	The rest of the clan of Kohath was assigned ten cities from the territories of Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The clan of Gershon was assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and East Manasseh.
JOS.21.7	The families of the clan of Merari were assigned twelve cities from the territories of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	By drawing lots,
JOS.21.9	These are the names of the cities from the territories of Judah and Simeon which were given 
JOS.21.10	to the descendants of Aaron who were of the clan of Kohath, which was descended from Levi. Their assignment was the first to be made. 
JOS.21.11	They were given the city of Arba (Arba was Anak's father), now called Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture land surrounding it. 
JOS.21.12	However, the fields of the city, as well as its towns, had already been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	In addition to Hebron (one of the cities of refuge), the following cities were assigned to the descendants of Aaron the priest: Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh, with their pasture lands: nine cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon. 
JOS.21.17	From the territory of Benjamin they were given four cities: Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth, and Almon, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.19	Thirteen cities in all, with their pasture lands, were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
JOS.21.20	The other families of the Levite clan of Kohath were assigned some cities from the territory of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	They were given four cities: Shechem and its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim (one of the cities of refuge), Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.23	From the territory of Dan they were given four cities: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon, and Gathrimmon, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.25	From the territory of West Manasseh they were given two cities: Taanach and Gathrimmon, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.26	These families of the clan of Kohath received ten cities in all, with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.27	Another group of Levites, the clan of Gershon, received from the territory of East Manasseh two cities: Golan in Bashan (one of the cities of refuge) and Beeshterah, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.28	From the territory of Issachar they received four cities: Kishion, Daberath, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth, and Engannim, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.30	From the territory of Asher they received four cities: Mishal, Abdon, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath, and Rehob, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.32	From the territory of Naphtali they received three cities: Kedesh in Galilee, with its pasture lands (one of the cities of refuge), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.33	The various families of the clan of Gershon received a total of thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.34	The rest of the Levites, the clan of Merari, received from the territory of Zebulun four cities: Jokneam, Kartah, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah, and Nahalal, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.36	From the territory of Reuben they received four cities: Bezer, Jahaz, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad they received four cities: Ramoth in Gilead, with its pasture lands (one of the cities of refuge), Mahanaim, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon, and Jazer, with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.40	So the clan of Merari was assigned a total of twelve cities.
JOS.21.41+JOS.21.42	From the land that the people of Israel possessed, a total of forty-eight cities, with the pasture lands around them, was given to the Levites.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	The 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called together the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. 
JOS.22.2	 He said to them, “You have done everything that Moses the 
JOS.22.3	All this time you have never once deserted the other Israelites. You have been careful to obey the commands of the 
JOS.22.4	Now, as he promised, the 
JOS.22.5	Make sure you obey the law that Moses commanded you: love the 
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8	Joshua sent them home with his blessing and with these words: “You are going back home very rich, with a lot of livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and many clothes. Share with your fellow tribesmen what you took from your enemies.” Then they left for home.
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8	Moses had given land east of the Jordan to one half of the tribe of Manasseh, but to the other half Joshua had given land west of the Jordan, along with the other tribes.
JOS.22.9	So the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh went back home. They left the rest of the people of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and started out for their own land, the land of Gilead, which they had taken as the 
JOS.22.10	When the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh arrived at Geliloth, still on the west side
JOS.22.11	The rest of the people of Israel were told, “Listen! The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh have built an altar at Geliloth, on our side of the Jordan!” 
JOS.22.12	When the people of Israel heard this, the whole community came together at Shiloh to go to war against the eastern tribes.
JOS.22.13	Then the people of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead. 
JOS.22.14	Ten leading men went with Phinehas, one from each of the western tribes and each one the head of a family among the clans. 
JOS.22.15	They came to the land of Gilead, to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, 
JOS.22.16	 and speaking for the whole community of the 
JOS.22.17	 Remember our sin at Peor, when the 
JOS.22.18	Are you going to refuse to follow him now? If you rebel against the 
JOS.22.19	Now then, if your land is not fit to worship in, come over into the 
JOS.22.20	 Remember how Achan son of Zerah refused to obey the command about the things condemned to destruction; the whole community of Israel was punished for that. Achan was not the only one who died because of his sin.”
JOS.22.21	The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered the heads of the families of the western tribes: 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One is God! He is the 
JOS.22.23	If we disobeyed the 
JOS.22.24	No! We did it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants would say to ours, ‘What do you have to do with the 
JOS.22.25	He made the Jordan a boundary between us and you people of Reuben and Gad. You have nothing to do with the 
JOS.22.26	So we built an altar, not to burn sacrifices or make offerings, 
JOS.22.27	but instead, as a sign for our people and yours, and for the generations after us, that we do indeed worship the 
JOS.22.28	It was our idea that, if this should ever happen, our descendants could say, ‘Look! Our ancestors made an altar just like the 
JOS.22.29	We would certainly not rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	Phinehas the priest and the ten leading men of the community who were with him, the heads of families of the western tribes, heard what the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh had to say, and they were satisfied. 
JOS.22.31	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them, “Now we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan, to the people of Israel, and reported to them. 
JOS.22.33	The Israelites were satisfied and praised God. They no longer talked about going to war to devastate the land where the people of Reuben and Gad had settled.
JOS.22.34	The people of Reuben and Gad said, “This altar is a witness to all of us that the 
JOS.23.1	Much later the 
JOS.23.2	so he called all Israel, the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people, and said, “I am very old now. 
JOS.23.3	You have seen everything that the 
JOS.23.4	I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left, as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered, from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	So be careful to obey and do everything that is written in the book of the Law of Moses. Do not neglect any part of it, 
JOS.23.7	and then you will not associate with these peoples left among you or speak the names of their gods or use those names in taking vows or worship those gods or bow down to them. 
JOS.23.8	Instead, be faithful to the 
JOS.23.9	The 
JOS.23.10	 Any one of you can make a thousand men run away, because the 
JOS.23.11	Be careful, then, to love the 
JOS.23.12	If you are disloyal and join with the nations that are still left among you and intermarry with them, 
JOS.23.13	you may be sure that the 
JOS.23.14	“Now my time has come to die. Every one of you knows in his heart and soul that the 
JOS.23.15	But just as he kept every promise that he made to you, so he will carry out every threat. 
JOS.23.16	If you do not keep the covenant which the 
JOS.24.1	Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called the elders, the leaders, the judges, and the officers of Israel, and they came into the presence of God. 
JOS.24.2	 Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the 
JOS.24.3	 Then I took Abraham, your ancestor, from the land across the Euphrates and led him through the whole land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
JOS.24.4	 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Edom as his possession, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	 Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought great trouble on Egypt. But I led you out; 
JOS.24.6	 I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry. But when your ancestors got to the Red Sea 
JOS.24.7	they cried out to me for help, and I put darkness between them and the Egyptians. I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them. You know what I did to Egypt.
JOS.24.7	“‘You lived in the desert a long time. 
JOS.24.8	 Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the east side of the Jordan. They fought you, but I gave you victory over them. You took their land, and I destroyed them as you advanced. 
JOS.24.9	 Then the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, fought against you. He sent word to Balaam son of Beor and asked him to put a curse on you. 
JOS.24.10	But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you, and in this way I rescued you from Balak. 
JOS.24.11	 You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I gave you victory over them all. 
JOS.24.12	 As you advanced, I threw them into panic in order to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your swords and bows had nothing to do with it. 
JOS.24.13	 I gave you a land that you had never worked and cities that you had not built. Now you are living there and eating grapes from vines that you did not plant, and olives from trees that you did not plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now then,” Joshua continued, “honor the 
JOS.24.15	If you are not willing to serve him, decide today whom you will serve, the gods your ancestors worshiped in Mesopotamia or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living. As for my family and me, we will serve the 
JOS.24.16	The people replied, “We would never leave the 
JOS.24.17	The 
JOS.24.18	As we advanced into this land, the 
JOS.24.19	Joshua said to the people, “But you may not be able to serve the 
JOS.24.20	and if you leave him to serve foreign gods, he will turn against you and punish you. He will destroy you, even though he was good to you before.”
JOS.24.21	The people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the 
JOS.24.22	Joshua told them, “You are your own witnesses to the fact that you have chosen to serve the 
JOS.24.22	“Yes,” they said, “we are witnesses.”
JOS.24.23	“Then get rid of those foreign gods that you have,” he demanded, “and pledge your loyalty to the 
JOS.24.24	The people then said to Joshua, “We will serve the 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant for
JOS.24.26	Joshua wrote these commands in the book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree in the 
JOS.24.27	He said to all the people, “This stone will be our witness. It has heard all the words that the 
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people away, and everyone returned to their own part of the land.
JOS.24.29	After that, the 
JOS.24.30	 They buried him on his own land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
JOS.24.31	As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served the 
JOS.24.33	Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, the town in the hill country of Ephraim which had been given to his son Phinehas.
JDG.1.1	After Joshua's death the people of Israel asked the 
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	The people of Judah said to the people of Simeon, “Go with us into the territory assigned to us, and we will fight the Canaanites together. Then we will go with you into the territory assigned to you.” So the tribes of Simeon 
JDG.1.4	and Judah went into battle together. The 
JDG.1.5	They found Adonibezek there and fought him. 
JDG.1.6	He ran away, but they chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
JDG.1.7	Adonibezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. God has now done to me what I did to them.” He was taken to Jerusalem, where he died.
JDG.1.8	The people of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed its people and set fire to the city. 
JDG.1.9	After this they went on to fight the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the foothills, and in the dry country to the south. 
JDG.1.10	They marched against the Canaanites living in the city of Hebron, which used to be called Kiriath Arba. There they defeated the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	From there the men of Judah marched against the city of Debir, at that time called Kiriath Sepher. 
JDG.1.12	One of them, called Caleb, said, “I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. 
JDG.1.14	On the wedding day Othniel urged her
JDG.1.15	She answered, “I want some water holes. The land you have given me is in the dry country.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JDG.1.16	The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went on with the people of Judah from Jericho, the city of palm trees, into the barren country south of Arad in Judah. There they settled among the Amalekites.
JDG.1.17	The people of Judah went with the people of Simeon, and together they defeated the Canaanites who lived in the city of Zephath. They put a curse on the city, destroyed it, and named it Hormah.
JDG.1.18+JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	 As Moses had commanded, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove out of the city the three clans descended from Anak. 
JDG.1.21	 But the people of the tribe of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem, and the Jebusites have continued to live there with the people of Benjamin ever since.
JDG.1.22+JDG.1.23	The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh went to attack the city of Bethel, at that time called Luz. The 
JDG.1.24	who saw a man leaving and said to him, “Show us how to get into the city, and we won't hurt you.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them, and the people of Ephraim and Manasseh killed everyone in the city, except this man and his family. 
JDG.1.26	He later went to the land of the Hittites, built a city there, and named it Luz, which is still its name.
JDG.1.28	When the Israelites became stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work for them, but still they did not drive them all out.
JDG.1.30	The tribe of Zebulun did not drive out the people living in the cities of Kitron and Nahalal, and so the Canaanites continued to live there with them and were forced to work for them.
JDG.1.31	The tribe of Asher did not drive out the people living in the cities of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, and Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	The people of Asher lived with the local Canaanites, since they had not been driven out.
JDG.1.33	The tribe of Naphtali did not drive out the people living in the cities of Beth Shemesh and Bethanath. The people of Naphtali lived with the local Canaanites, but forced them to work for them.
JDG.1.34	The Amorites forced the people of the tribe of Dan into the hill country and did not let them come down to the plain. 
JDG.1.35	The Amorites continued to live at Aijalon, Shaalbim, and Mount Heres, but the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh kept them under their rule and forced them to work for them.
JDG.1.36	North of Sela, the Edomite
JDG.2.1	The angel of the 
JDG.2.2	 You must not make any covenant with the people who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.’ But you have not done what I told you. You have done just the opposite! 
JDG.2.3	So I tell you now that I will not drive these people out as you advance. They will be your enemies,
JDG.2.4	When the angel had said this, all the people of Israel began to cry, 
JDG.2.5	and that is why the place is called Bochim.
JDG.2.6	Joshua sent the people of Israel on their way, and each man went to take possession of his own share of the land. 
JDG.2.7	As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served the 
JDG.2.8	The 
JDG.2.9	 He was buried in his own part of the land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	That whole generation also died, and the next generation forgot the 
JDG.2.11	Then the people of Israel sinned against the 
JDG.2.12	They stopped worshiping the 
JDG.2.13	They stopped worshiping the 
JDG.2.14	And so the 
JDG.2.15	Every time they would go into battle, the 
JDG.2.16	Then the 
JDG.2.17	But the Israelites paid no attention to their leaders. Israel was unfaithful to the 
JDG.2.18	Whenever the 
JDG.2.19	But when the leader died, the people would return to the old ways and behave worse than the previous generation. They would serve and worship other gods, and stubbornly continue their own evil ways. 
JDG.2.20	Then the 
JDG.2.21	I will no longer drive out any of the nations that were still in the land when Joshua died. 
JDG.2.22	I will use them to find out whether or not these Israelites will follow my ways, as their ancestors did.” 
JDG.2.23	So the 
JDG.3.1	So then, the 
JDG.3.2	He did this only in order to teach each generation of Israelites about war, especially those who had never been in battle before. 
JDG.3.3	Those left in the land were the five Philistine cities, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Hamath Pass. 
JDG.3.4	They were to be a test for Israel, to find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commands that the 
JDG.3.5	And so the people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods.
JDG.3.7	The people of Israel forgot the 
JDG.3.8	So the 
JDG.3.9	Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.3.10	The spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	There was peace in the land for forty years, and then Othniel died.
JDG.3.12	The people of Israel sinned against the 
JDG.3.13	Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites; they defeated Israel and captured Jericho, the city of palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.3.16	Ehud had made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long. He had it fastened on his right side under his clothes. 
JDG.3.17	Then he took the gifts to Eglon, who was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	When Ehud had given him the gifts, he told the men who had carried them to go back home. 
JDG.3.19	But Ehud himself turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal, went back to Eglon, and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”
JDG.3.19	So the king ordered his servants, “Leave us alone!” And they all went out.
JDG.3.20	Then, as the king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof, Ehud went over to him and said, “I have a message from God for you.” The king stood up. 
JDG.3.21	With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the king's belly. 
JDG.3.22	The whole sword went in, handle and all, and the fat covered it up. Ehud did not pull it out of the king's belly, and it stuck out behind, between his legs.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went outside, closed the doors behind him, locked them, 
JDG.3.24	and left. The servants came and saw that the doors were locked, but they only thought that the king was inside, relieving himself. 
JDG.3.25	They waited as long as they thought they should, but when he still did not open the door, they took the key and opened it. And there was their master, lying dead on the floor.
JDG.3.26	Ehud got away while they were waiting. He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim, he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle; then he led them down from the hills. 
JDG.3.28	He told them, “Follow me! The 
JDG.3.29	That day they killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers; none of them escaped. 
JDG.3.30	That day the Israelites defeated Moab, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath. He too rescued Israel, and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.
JDG.4.1	After Ehud died, the people of Israel sinned against the 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots, and he ruled the people of Israel with cruelty and violence for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet, and she was serving as a judge for the Israelites at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She would sit under a certain palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel would go there for her decisions. 
JDG.4.6	One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam from the city of Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The 
JDG.4.7	I will bring Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, to fight you at the Kishon River. He will have his chariots and soldiers, but I will give you victory over him.’”
JDG.4.8	Then Barak replied, “I will go if you go with me, but if you don't go with me, I won't go either.”
JDG.4.9	She answered, “All right, I will go with you, but you won't get any credit for the victory, because the 
JDG.4.10	Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men followed him. Deborah went with him.
JDG.4.11	In the meantime Heber the Kenite had set up his tent close to Kedesh near the oak tree at Zaanannim. He had moved away from the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses.
JDG.4.12	When Sisera learned that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	he called out his nine hundred iron chariots and all his men, and sent them from Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles to the Kishon River.
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! The 
JDG.4.15	When Barak attacked with his army, the 
JDG.4.16	Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles, and Sisera's whole army was killed. Not a man was left.
JDG.4.17	Sisera ran away to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because King Jabin of Hazor was at peace with Heber's family. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, sir; come into my tent. Don't be afraid.” So he went in, and she hid him behind a curtain.
JDG.4.19	He said to her, “Please give me a drink of water; I'm thirsty.” She opened a leather bag of milk, gave him a drink, and hid him again. 
JDG.4.20	Then he told her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you if anyone is here, say no.”
JDG.4.21	Sisera was so tired that he fell sound asleep. Then Jael took a hammer and a tent peg, quietly went up to him, and killed him by driving the peg right through the side of his head and into the ground. 
JDG.4.22	When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, “Come here! I'll show you the man you're looking for.” So he went in with her, and there was Sisera on the ground, dead, with the tent peg through his head.
JDG.4.23	That day God gave the Israelites victory over Jabin, the Canaanite king. 
JDG.4.24	They pressed harder and harder against him until they destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
JDG.5.2	Praise the 
JDG.5.2	The Israelites were determined to fight;
JDG.5.2	the people gladly volunteered.
JDG.5.3	Listen, you kings!
JDG.5.3	Pay attention, you rulers!
JDG.5.3	I will sing and play music
JDG.5.3	to Israel's God, the 
JDG.5.4	when you came out of the region of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth shook, and rain fell from the sky.
JDG.5.4	Yes, water poured down from the clouds.
JDG.5.5	before the 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael,
JDG.5.6	caravans no longer went through the land,
JDG.5.6	and travelers used the back roads.
JDG.5.7	The towns of Israel stood abandoned, Deborah;
JDG.5.7	they stood empty until you came,
JDG.5.7	came like a mother for Israel.
JDG.5.8	Then there was war in the land
JDG.5.8	when the Israelites chose new gods.
JDG.5.8	Of the forty thousand men in Israel,
JDG.5.8	did anyone carry shield or spear?
JDG.5.9	My heart is with the commanders of Israel,
JDG.5.9	with the people who gladly volunteered.
JDG.5.9	Praise the 
JDG.5.10	Tell of
JDG.5.10	sitting on saddles,
JDG.5.10	and you that must walk wherever you go.
JDG.5.11	Listen! The noisy crowds around the wells
JDG.5.11	are telling of the 
JDG.5.11	the victories of Israel's people!
JDG.5.11	Then the 
JDG.5.12	Lead on, Deborah, lead on!
JDG.5.12	Lead on! Sing a song! Lead on!
JDG.5.12	Forward, Barak son of Abinoam,
JDG.5.12	lead your captives away!
JDG.5.13	Then the faithful ones came down to their leaders;
JDG.5.13	the 
JDG.5.14	They came
JDG.5.14	behind the tribe of Benjamin and its people.
JDG.5.14	The commanders came down from Machir,
JDG.5.14	the officers down from Zebulun.
JDG.5.15	The leaders of Issachar came with Deborah;
JDG.5.15	yes, Issachar came and Barak too,
JDG.5.15	and they followed him into the valley.
JDG.5.15	But the tribe of Reuben was divided;
JDG.5.15	they could not decide to come.
JDG.5.16	Why did they stay behind with the sheep?
JDG.5.16	To listen to shepherds calling the flocks?
JDG.5.16	Yes, the tribe of Reuben was divided;
JDG.5.16	they could not decide to come.
JDG.5.17	The tribe of Gad stayed east of the Jordan,
JDG.5.17	and the tribe of Dan remained by the ships.
JDG.5.17	The tribe of Asher stayed by the seacoast;
JDG.5.17	they remained along the shore.
JDG.5.18	But the people of Zebulun and Naphtali
JDG.5.18	risked their lives on the battlefield.
JDG.5.19	At Taanach, by the stream of Megiddo,
JDG.5.19	the kings came and fought;
JDG.5.19	the kings of Canaan fought,
JDG.5.19	but they took no silver away.
JDG.5.20	The stars fought from the sky;
JDG.5.20	as they moved across the sky,
JDG.5.20	they fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	A flood in the Kishon swept them away—
JDG.5.21	the onrushing Kishon River.
JDG.5.21	I shall march, march on, with strength!
JDG.5.22	Then the horses came galloping on,
JDG.5.22	stamping the ground with their hoofs.
JDG.5.23	“Put a curse on Meroz,” says the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	“a curse, a curse on those who live there.
JDG.5.23	They did not come to help the 
JDG.5.23	come as soldiers to fight for him.”
JDG.5.24	The most fortunate of women is Jael,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite—
JDG.5.24	the most fortunate of women who live in tents.
JDG.5.25	Sisera asked for water, but she gave him milk;
JDG.5.25	she brought him cream in a beautiful bowl.
JDG.5.26	She took a tent peg in one hand,
JDG.5.26	a worker's hammer in the other;
JDG.5.26	she struck Sisera and crushed his skull;
JDG.5.26	she pierced him through the head.
JDG.5.27	He sank to his knees,
JDG.5.27	fell down and lay still at her feet.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he sank to his knees and fell;
JDG.5.27	he fell to the ground, dead.
JDG.5.28	Sisera's mother looked out of the window;
JDG.5.28	she gazed
JDG.5.28	“Why is his chariot so late in coming?” she asked.
JDG.5.28	“Why are his horses so slow to return?”
JDG.5.29	Her wisest friends answered her,
JDG.5.29	and she told herself over and over,
JDG.5.30	“They are only finding things to capture and divide,
JDG.5.30	a woman or two for every soldier,
JDG.5.30	rich cloth for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	embroidered pieces for the neck of the queen.”
JDG.5.31	So may all your enemies die like that, O 
JDG.5.31	but may your friends shine like the rising sun!
JDG.5.31	And there was peace in the land for forty years.
JDG.6.1	Once again the people of Israel sinned against the 
JDG.6.2	The Midianites were stronger than Israel, and the people of Israel hid from them in caves and other safe places in the hills. 
JDG.6.3	Whenever the Israelites would plant their crops, the Midianites would come with the Amalekites and the desert tribes and attack them. 
JDG.6.4	They would camp on the land and destroy the crops as far south as the area around Gaza. They would take all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, and leave nothing for the Israelites to live on. 
JDG.6.5	They would come with their livestock and tents, as thick as locusts. They and their camels were too many to count. They came and devastated the land, 
JDG.6.6	and Israel was helpless against them.
JDG.6.7	Then the people of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.6.8	and he sent them a prophet who brought them this message from the 
JDG.6.9	I rescued you from the Egyptians and from the people who fought you here in this land. I drove them out as you advanced, and I gave you their land. 
JDG.6.10	I told you that I am the 
JDG.6.11	Then the 
JDG.6.12	The 
JDG.6.13	Gideon said to him, “If I may ask, sir, why has all this happened to us if the 
JDG.6.14	Then the 
JDG.6.15	Gideon replied, “But Lord, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least important member of my family.”
JDG.6.16	The 
JDG.6.17	Gideon replied, “If you are pleased with me, give me some proof that you are really the 
JDG.6.18	Please do not leave until I bring you an offering of food.”
JDG.6.18	He said, “I will stay until you come back.”
JDG.6.19	So Gideon went into his house and cooked a young goat and used a bushel of flour to make bread without any yeast. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, brought them to the 
JDG.6.20	The angel told him, “Put the meat and the bread on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” Gideon did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the 
JDG.6.22	Gideon then realized that it was the 
JDG.6.23	But the 
JDG.6.24	Gideon built an altar to the 
JDG.6.25	That night the 
JDG.6.26	Build a well-constructed altar to the 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the 
JDG.6.28	When the people in town got up early the next morning, they found that the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah had been cut down, and that the second bull had been burned on the altar that had been built there. 
JDG.6.29	They asked each other, “Who did this?” They investigated and found out that Gideon son of Joash had done it. 
JDG.6.30	Then they said to Joash, “Bring your son out here, so that we can kill him! He tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the symbol of Asherah beside it.”
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all those who confronted him, “Are you arguing for Baal? Are you defending him? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning. If Baal is a god, let him defend himself. It is his altar that was torn down.” 
JDG.6.32	From then on Gideon was known as Jerubbaal,
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribes assembled, crossed the Jordan River, and camped in Jezreel Valley. 
JDG.6.34	The spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh to call them to follow him. He sent messengers to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they also came to join him.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “You say that you have decided to use me to rescue Israel. 
JDG.6.37	Well, I am putting some wool on the ground where we thresh the wheat. If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground, then I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel.” 
JDG.6.38	That is exactly what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Don't be angry with me; let me speak just once more. Please let me make one more test with the wool. This time let the wool be dry, and the ground be wet.” 
JDG.6.40	That night God did that very thing. The next morning the wool was dry, but the ground was wet with dew.
JDG.7.1	One day Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring. The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill.
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	 Announce to the people, ‘Anyone who is afraid should go back home, and we will stay here at Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand went back, but ten thousand stayed.
JDG.7.4	Then the 
JDG.7.5	Gideon took the men down to the water, and the 
JDG.7.6	There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it; all the others got down on their knees to drink. 
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	So Gideon sent all the Israelites home, except the three hundred, who kept all the supplies and trumpets. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.
JDG.7.9	That night the 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah. 
JDG.7.11	You will hear what they are saying, and then you will have the courage to attack.” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp. 
JDG.7.12	The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and they had as many camels as there are grains of sand on the seashore.
JDG.7.13	When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, “I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent. The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground.”
JDG.7.14	His friend replied, “It's the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can't mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard about the man's dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped the 
JDG.7.16	He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside it. 
JDG.7.17	He told them, “When I get to the edge of the camp, watch me, and do what I do. 
JDG.7.18	When my group and I blow our trumpets, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	Gideon and his one hundred men came to the edge of the camp a while before midnight, just after the guard had been changed. Then they blew the trumpets and broke the jars they were holding, 
JDG.7.20	and the other two groups did the same. They all held the torches in their left hands, the trumpets in their right, and shouted, “A sword for the 
JDG.7.21	Every man stood in his place around the camp, and the whole enemy army ran away yelling. 
JDG.7.22	While Gideon's men were blowing their trumpets, the 
JDG.7.23	Then men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say, “Come down and fight the Midianites. Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah, to keep the Midianites from crossing them.” The men of Ephraim were called together, and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah. 
JDG.7.25	They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock, and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	Then the people of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why didn't you call us when you went to fight the Midianites? Why did you treat us like this?” They complained bitterly about it.
JDG.8.2	But he told them, “What I was able to do is nothing compared with what you have done. Even the little that you people of Ephraim did is worth more than what my whole clan has done. 
JDG.8.3	 After all, through the power of God you killed the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I done to compare with that?” When he said this, they were no longer so angry.
JDG.8.4	By this time Gideon and his three hundred men had come to the Jordan River and had crossed it. They were exhausted, but were still pursuing the enemy. 
JDG.8.5	When they arrived at Sukkoth, he said to the men of the town, “Please give my men some loaves of bread. They are exhausted, and I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings.”
JDG.8.6	But the leaders of Sukkoth said, “Why should we give your army any food? You haven't captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet.”
JDG.8.7	So Gideon said, “All right! When the 
JDG.8.8	Gideon went on to Penuel and made the same request of the people there, but the men of Penuel gave the same answer as the men of Sukkoth. 
JDG.8.9	So he said to them, “I am going to come back safe and sound, and when I do, I will tear this tower down!”
JDG.8.10	Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor with their army. Of the whole army of desert tribesmen, only about 15,000 were left; 120,000 soldiers had been killed. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went on the road along the edge of the desert, east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the army by surprise. 
JDG.8.12	The two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, ran away, but he pursued them and captured them, and caused their whole army to panic.
JDG.8.13	When Gideon was returning from the battle by way of Heres Pass, 
JDG.8.14	he captured a young man from Sukkoth and questioned him. The young man wrote down for Gideon the names of the seventy-seven leading men of Sukkoth. 
JDG.8.15	Then Gideon went to the men of Sukkoth and said, “Remember when you refused to help me? You said that you couldn't give any food to my exhausted army because I hadn't captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet. Well, here they are!” 
JDG.8.16	He then took thorns and briers from the desert and used them to punish the leaders of Sukkoth. 
JDG.8.17	He also tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men of that city.
JDG.8.18	Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What about the men you killed at Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	They answered, “They looked like you—every one of them like the son of a king.”
JDG.8.19	Gideon said, “They were my brothers, my own mother's sons. I solemnly swear that if you had not killed them, I would not kill you.” 
JDG.8.20	Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, “Go ahead, kill them!” But the boy did not draw his sword. He hesitated, because he was still only a boy.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Come on, kill us yourself. It takes a man to do a man's job.” So Gideon killed them and took the ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
JDG.8.22	After that, the Israelites said to Gideon, “Be our ruler—you and your descendants after you. You have saved us from the Midianites.”
JDG.8.23	Gideon answered, “I will not be your ruler, nor will my son. The 
JDG.8.24	But he went on to say, “Let me ask one thing of you. Every one of you give me the earrings you took.” (The Midianites, like other desert people, wore gold earrings.)
JDG.8.25	The people answered, “We'll be glad to give them to you.” They spread out a cloth, and everyone put on it the earrings that he had taken. 
JDG.8.26	The gold earrings that Gideon got weighed over forty pounds, and this did not include the ornaments, necklaces, and purple clothes that the kings of Midian wore, nor the collars that were around the necks of their camels. 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made an idol from the gold and put it in his hometown, Ophrah. All the Israelites abandoned God and went there to worship the idol. It was a trap for Gideon and his family.
JDG.8.28	So Midian was defeated by the Israelites and was no longer a threat. The land was at peace for forty years, until Gideon died.
JDG.8.29	Gideon went back to his own home and lived there. 
JDG.8.30	He had seventy sons, because he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	He also had a concubine in Shechem; she bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, at Ophrah, the town of the clan of Abiezer.
JDG.8.33	After Gideon's death the people of Israel were unfaithful to God again and worshiped the Baals. They made Baal-of-the-Covenant their god, 
JDG.8.34	and no longer served the 
JDG.8.35	They were not grateful to the family of Gideon for all the good that he had done for Israel.
JDG.9.1	Gideon's son Abimelech went to the town of Shechem, where all his mother's relatives lived, and told them 
JDG.9.2	to ask the men of Shechem, “Which would you prefer? To have all seventy of Gideon's sons govern you or to have just one man? Remember that Abimelech is your own flesh and blood.” 
JDG.9.3	His mother's relatives talked to the men of Shechem about this for him, and the men of Shechem decided to follow Abimelech because he was their relative. 
JDG.9.4	They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant, and with this money he hired a bunch of worthless scoundrels to join him. 
JDG.9.5	He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and there on top of a single stone he killed his seventy brothers, Gideon's sons. But Jotham, Gideon's youngest son, hid and was not killed. 
JDG.9.6	Then all the men of Shechem and Bethmillo got together and went to the sacred oak tree at Shechem, where they made Abimelech king.
JDG.9.7	When Jotham heard about this, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted out to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and God may listen to you! 
JDG.9.8	Once upon a time the trees went out to choose a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’ 
JDG.9.9	The olive tree answered, ‘In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my oil, which is used to honor gods and human beings.’ 
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and be our king.’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree answered, ‘In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my good sweet fruit.’ 
JDG.9.12	So the trees then said to the grapevine, ‘You come and be our king.’ 
JDG.9.13	But the vine answered, ‘In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my wine, that makes gods and human beings happy.’ 
JDG.9.14	So then all the trees said to the thorn bush, ‘You come and be our king.’ 
JDG.9.15	The thorn bush answered, ‘If you really want to make me your king, then come and take shelter in my shade. If you don't, fire will blaze out of my thorny branches and burn up the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	“Now then,” Jotham continued, “were you really honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king? Did you respect Gideon's memory and treat his family properly, as his actions deserved? 
JDG.9.17	Remember that my father fought for you. He risked his life to save you from the Midianites. 
JDG.9.18	But today you turned against my father's family. You killed his sons—seventy men on a single stone—and just because Abimelech, his son by his servant woman, is your relative, you have made him king of Shechem. 
JDG.9.19	Now then, if what you did today to Gideon and his family was sincere and honest, then be happy with Abimelech and let him be happy with you. 
JDG.9.20	But if not, may fire blaze out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and Bethmillo. May fire blaze out from the men of Shechem and Bethmillo and burn Abimelech up.” 
JDG.9.21	Then because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech, Jotham ran away and went to live at Beer.
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled Israel for three years. 
JDG.9.23	Then God made Abimelech and the men of Shechem hostile to each other, and they rebelled against Abimelech. 
JDG.9.24	This happened so that Abimelech and the men of Shechem, who encouraged him to murder Gideon's seventy sons, would pay for their crime. 
JDG.9.25	The men of Shechem put men in ambush against Abimelech on the mountaintops, and they robbed everyone who passed their way. Abimelech was told about this.
JDG.9.26	Then Gaal son of Ebed came to Shechem with his brothers, and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
JDG.9.27	They all went out into their vineyards and picked the grapes, made wine from them, and held a festival. They went into the temple of their god, where they ate and drank and made fun of Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	Gaal said, “What kind of men are we in Shechem? Why are we serving Abimelech? Who is he, anyway? The son of Gideon! And Zebul takes orders from him, but why should we serve him? Be loyal to your ancestor Hamor, who founded your clan! 
JDG.9.29	I wish I were leading this people! I would get rid of Abimelech! I would tell
JDG.9.30	Zebul, the ruler of the city, became angry when he heard what Gaal had said. 
JDG.9.31	He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah
JDG.9.32	Now then, you and your men should move by night and hide in the fields. 
JDG.9.33	Get up tomorrow morning at sunrise and make a sudden attack on the city. Then when Gaal and his men come out against you, hit them with all you've got!”
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all his men made their move at night and hid outside Shechem in four groups. 
JDG.9.35	When Abimelech and his men saw Gaal come out and stand at the city gate, they got up from their hiding places. 
JDG.9.36	Gaal saw them and said to Zebul, “Look! There are men coming down from the mountaintops!”
JDG.9.36	“Those are not men,” Zebul answered. “They are just shadows on the mountains.”
JDG.9.37	Gaal said again, “Look! There are men coming down the crest of the mountain and one group is coming along the road from the oak tree of the fortunetellers!”
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where is all your big talk now? You were the one who asked why we should serve this man Abimelech. These are the men you were making fun of. Go on out now and fight them.” 
JDG.9.39	Gaal led the men of Shechem out and fought Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech started after Gaal, and Gaal ran. Many were wounded, even at the city gate. 
JDG.9.41	Abimelech lived in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem, so that they could no longer live there.
JDG.9.42	The next day Abimelech found out that the people of Shechem were planning to go out into the fields, 
JDG.9.43	so he took his men, divided them into three groups, and hid in the fields, waiting. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he came out of hiding to kill them. 
JDG.9.44	While Abimelech and his group hurried forward to guard the city gate, the other two companies attacked the people in the fields and killed them all. 
JDG.9.45	The fighting continued all day long. Abimelech captured the city, killed its people, tore it down, and covered the ground with salt.
JDG.9.46	When all the leading men in the fort at Shechem heard about this, they sought safety in the stronghold of the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant. 
JDG.9.47	Abimelech was told that they had gathered there, 
JDG.9.48	so he went up to Mount Zalmon with his men. There he took an ax, cut a limb off a tree, and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. 
JDG.9.49	So everyone cut off a tree limb; then they followed Abimelech and piled the wood up against the stronghold. They set it on fire, with the people inside, and all the people of the fort died—about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, surrounded that city, and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	There was a strong tower there, and every man and woman in the city, including the leaders, ran to it. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof. 
JDG.9.52	When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he went up to the door to set the tower on fire. 
JDG.9.53	 But a woman threw a millstone down on his head and fractured his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he quickly called the young man who was carrying his weapons and told him, “Draw your sword and kill me. I don't want it said that a woman killed me.” So the young man ran him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
JDG.9.56	And so it was that God paid Abimelech back for the crime that he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	God also made the men of Shechem suffer for their wickedness, just as Jotham, Gideon's son, said they would when he cursed them.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech's death Tola, the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo, came to free Israel. He was from the tribe of Issachar and lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He was Israel's leader for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After Tola came Jair from Gilead. He led Israel for twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys. They had thirty cities in the land of Gilead, which are still called the villages of Jair. 
JDG.10.5	Jair died and was buried at Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Once again the Israelites sinned against the 
JDG.10.7	So the 
JDG.10.8	For eighteen years they oppressed and persecuted all the Israelites who lived in Amorite country east of the Jordan River in Gilead. 
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites even crossed the Jordan to fight the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel was in great distress.
JDG.10.10	Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.10.11	The 
JDG.10.12	the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you in the past, and you cried out to me. Did I not save you from them? 
JDG.10.13	But you still left me and worshiped other gods, so I am not going to rescue you again. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them rescue you when you get in trouble.”
JDG.10.15	But the people of Israel said to the 
JDG.10.16	So they got rid of their foreign gods and worshiped the 
JDG.10.17	Then the Ammonite army prepared for battle and camped in Gilead. The people of Israel came together and camped at Mizpah in Gilead. 
JDG.10.18	There the people and the leaders of the Israelite tribes asked one another, “Who will lead the fight against the Ammonites? Whoever does will be the leader of everyone in Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Jephthah, a brave soldier from Gilead, was the son of a prostitute. His father Gilead 
JDG.11.2	had other sons by his wife, and when they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home. They told him, “You will not inherit anything from our father; you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There he attracted a group of worthless men, and they went around with him.
JDG.11.4	It was some time later that the Ammonites went to war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When this happened, the leaders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	They told him, “Come and lead us, so that we can fight the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	But Jephthah answered, “You hated me so much that you forced me to leave my father's house. Why come to me now that you're in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	They said to Jephthah, “We are turning to you now because we want you to go with us and fight the Ammonites and lead all the people of Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	Jephthah said to them, “If you take me back home to fight the Ammonites and the 
JDG.11.10	They replied, “We agree. The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the leaders of Gilead, and the people made him their ruler and leader. Jephthah stated his terms at Mizpah in the presence of the 
JDG.11.12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon to say, “What is your quarrel with us? Why have you invaded our country?”
JDG.11.13	The king of Ammon answered Jephthah's messengers, “When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River. Now you must give it back peacefully.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of Ammon 
JDG.11.15	with this answer: “It is not true that Israel took away the land of Moab or the land of Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	This is what happened: when the Israelites left Egypt, they went through the desert to the Gulf of Aqaba and came to Kadesh. 
JDG.11.17	 Then they sent messengers to the king of Edom to ask permission to go through his land. But the king of Edom would not let them. They also asked the king of Moab, but neither would he let them go through his land. So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	 Then they went on through the desert, going around the land of Edom and the land of Moab until they came to the east side of Moab, on the other side of the Arnon River. They camped there, but they did not cross the Arnon because it was the boundary of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	 Then the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and asked him for permission to go through his country to their own land. 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon would not let Israel do it. He brought his whole army together, camped at Jahaz, and attacked Israel. 
JDG.11.21	But the 
JDG.11.22	They occupied all the Amorite territory from the Arnon in the south to the Jabbok in the north and from the desert on the east to the Jordan on the west. 
JDG.11.23	So it was the 
JDG.11.24	Are you going to try to take it back? You can keep whatever your god Chemosh has given you. But we are going to keep everything that the 
JDG.11.25	 Do you think you are any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? He never challenged Israel, did he? Did he ever go to war against us? 
JDG.11.26	For three hundred years Israel has occupied Heshbon and Aroer, and the towns around them, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon River. Why haven't you taken them back in all this time? 
JDG.11.27	No, I have not done you any wrong. You are doing wrong by making war on me. The 
JDG.11.28	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to this message from Jephthah.
JDG.11.29	Then the spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	Jephthah promised the 
JDG.11.31	I will burn as an offering the first person that comes out of my house to meet me, when I come back from the victory. I will offer that person to you as a sacrifice.”
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah crossed the river to fight the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.11.33	He struck at them from Aroer to the area around Minnith, twenty cities in all, and as far as Abel Keramim. There was a great slaughter, and the Ammonites were defeated by Israel.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah went back home to Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him, dancing and playing the tambourine. She was his only child. 
JDG.11.35	 When he saw her, he tore his clothes in sorrow and said, “Oh, my daughter! You are breaking my heart! Why must it be you that causes me pain? I have made a solemn promise to the 
JDG.11.36	She told him, “If you have made a promise to the 
JDG.11.37	But she asked her father, “Do this one thing for me. Leave me alone for two months, so that I can go with my friends to wander in the mountains and grieve that I must die a virgin.” 
JDG.11.38	He told her to go and sent her away for two months. She and her friends went up into the mountains and grieved because she was going to die unmarried and childless. 
JDG.11.39	After two months she came back to her father. He did what he had promised the 
JDG.11.39	This was the origin of the custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	that the Israelite women would go out for four days every year to grieve for the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim prepared for battle; they crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We'll burn the house down over your head!”
JDG.12.2	But Jephthah told them, “My people and I had a serious quarrel with the Ammonites. I did call you, but you would not rescue me from them. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you were not going to, I risked my life and crossed the border to fight them, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah brought all the men of Gilead together, fought the men of Ephraim and defeated them. (The Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites in Ephraim and Manasseh, you are deserters from Ephraim!”) 
JDG.12.5	In order to keep the Ephraimites from escaping, the Gileadites captured the places where the Jordan could be crossed. When any Ephraimite who was trying to escape would ask permission to cross, the men of Gilead would ask, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	they would tell him to say “Shibboleth.” But he would say “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they would grab him and kill him there at one of the Jordan River crossings. At that time forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites were killed.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah led Israel for six years. Then he died and was buried in his hometown
JDG.12.8	After Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought thirty young women from outside the clan for his sons to marry. Ibzan led Israel for seven years, 
JDG.12.10	then he died and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After Ibzan, Elon from Zebulun led Israel for ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then he died and was buried at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon led Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon led Israel for eight years, 
JDG.12.15	then he died and was buried at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	The Israelites sinned against the 
JDG.13.2	At that time there was a man named Manoah from the town of Zorah. He was a member of the tribe of Dan. His wife had never been able to have children. 
JDG.13.3	The 
JDG.13.4	Be sure not to drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food; 
JDG.13.5	 and after your son is born, you must never cut his hair, because from the day of his birth he will be dedicated to God as a nazirite.
JDG.13.6	Then the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God has come to me, and he looked as frightening as the angel
JDG.13.7	But he did tell me that I would become pregnant and have a son. He told me not to drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food, because the boy is to be dedicated to God as a nazirite as long as he lives.”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to the 
JDG.13.9	God did what Manoah asked, and his angel came back to the woman while she was sitting in the field. Her husband Manoah was not with her, 
JDG.13.10	so she ran at once and told him, “Look! The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me again.”
JDG.13.11	Manoah got up and followed his wife. He went to the man and asked, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	“Yes,” he answered.
JDG.13.12	Then Manoah said, “Now then, when your words come true, what must the boy do? What kind of a life must he lead?”
JDG.13.13	The 
JDG.13.14	She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine; she must not drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food. She must do everything that I have told her.”
JDG.13.15+JDG.13.16	Not knowing that it was the 
JDG.13.15+JDG.13.16	But the angel said, “If I do stay, I will not eat your food. But if you want to prepare it, burn it as an offering to the 
JDG.13.17	Manoah replied, “Tell us your name, so that we can honor you when your words come true.”
JDG.13.18	The angel asked, “Why do you want to know my name? It is a name of wonder.”
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took a young goat and some grain, and offered them on the rock altar to the 
JDG.13.20+JDG.13.21	While the flames were going up from the altar, Manoah and his wife saw the 
JDG.13.22	Manoah said to his wife, “We are sure to die, because we have seen God!”
JDG.13.23	But his wife answered, “If the 
JDG.13.24	The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew and the 
JDG.13.25	And the 
JDG.14.1	One day Samson went down to Timnah, where he noticed a certain young Philistine woman. 
JDG.14.2	He went back home and told his father and mother, “There is a Philistine woman down at Timnah who caught my attention. Get her for me; I want to marry her.”
JDG.14.3	But his father and mother asked him, “Why do you have to go to those heathen Philistines to get a wife? Can't you find someone in our own clan, among all our people?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson told his father, “She is the one I want you to get for me. I like her.”
JDG.14.4	His parents did not know that it was the 
JDG.14.5	So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother. As they were going through the vineyards there, he heard a young lion roaring. 
JDG.14.6	Suddenly the power of the 
JDG.14.7	Then he went and talked to the young woman, and he liked her. 
JDG.14.8	A few days later Samson went back to marry her. On the way he left the road to look at the lion he had killed, and he was surprised to find a swarm of bees and some honey inside the dead body. 
JDG.14.9	He scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. Then he went to his father and mother and gave them some. They ate it, but Samson did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the dead body of a lion.
JDG.14.10	His father went to the woman's house, and Samson gave a banquet there. This was a custom among the young men. 
JDG.14.11	When the Philistines saw him, they sent thirty young men to stay with him. 
JDG.14.12+JDG.14.13	Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle. I'll bet each one of you a piece of fine linen and a change of fine clothes that you can't tell me its meaning before the seven days of the wedding feast are over.”
JDG.14.12+JDG.14.13	“Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let's hear it.”
JDG.14.14	He said,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came something to eat;
JDG.14.14	Out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	Three days later they had still not figured out what the riddle meant.
JDG.14.15	On the fourth
JDG.14.16	So Samson's wife went to him in tears and said, “You don't love me! You just hate me! You told my friends a riddle and didn't tell me what it means!”
JDG.14.16	He said, “Look, I haven't even told my father and mother. Why should I tell you?” 
JDG.14.17	She cried about it for the whole seven days of the feast. But on the seventh day he told her what the riddle meant, for she nagged him so about it. Then she told the Philistines. 
JDG.14.18	So on the seventh day, before Samson went into the bedroom,
JDG.14.18	“What could be sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What could be stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	Samson replied,
JDG.14.18	“If you hadn't been plowing with my cow,
JDG.14.18	You wouldn't know the answer now.”
JDG.14.19	Suddenly the power of the 
JDG.14.20	and his wife was given to the man that had been his best man at the wedding.
JDG.15.1	Some time later Samson went to visit his wife during the wheat harvest and took her a young goat. He told her father, “I want to go to my wife's room.”
JDG.15.1	But he wouldn't let him go in. 
JDG.15.2	He told Samson, “I really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your friend. But her younger sister is prettier, anyway. You can have her, instead.”
JDG.15.3	Samson said, “This time I'm not going to be responsible for what I do to the Philistines!” 
JDG.15.4	So he went and caught three hundred foxes. Two at a time, he tied their tails together and put torches in the knots. 
JDG.15.5	Then he set fire to the torches and turned the foxes loose in the Philistine wheat fields. In this way he burned up not only the wheat that had been harvested but also the wheat that was still in the fields. The olive orchards were also burned. 
JDG.15.6	When the Philistines asked who had done this, they learned that Samson had done it because his father-in-law, a man from Timnah, had given Samson's wife to a friend of Samson's. So the Philistines went and burned the woman to death and burned down her father's house.
JDG.15.7	Samson told them, “So this is how you act! I swear that I won't stop until I pay you back!” 
JDG.15.8	He attacked them fiercely and killed many of them. Then he went and stayed in the cave in the cliff at Etam.
JDG.15.9	The Philistines came and camped in Judah, and attacked the town of Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah asked them, “Why are you attacking us?”
JDG.15.10	They answered, “We came to take Samson prisoner and to treat him as he treated us.” 
JDG.15.11	So these three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the cliff at Etam and said to Samson, “Don't you know that the Philistines are our rulers? What have you done to us?”
JDG.15.11	He answered, “I did to them just what they did to me.”
JDG.15.12	They told him, “We have come here to tie you up, so we can hand you over to them.”
JDG.15.12	Samson said, “Give me your word that you won't kill me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	“All right,” they said, “we are only going to tie you up and hand you over to them. We won't kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him back from the cliff.
JDG.15.14	When he got to Lehi, the Philistines came running toward him, shouting at him. Suddenly the power of the 
JDG.15.15	Then he found a jawbone of a donkey that had recently died. He reached down and picked it up, and killed a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	So Samson sang,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey I killed a thousand men;
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey I piled them up in piles.”
JDG.15.17	After that, he threw the jawbone away. The place where this happened was named Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	Then Samson became very thirsty, so he called to the 
JDG.15.19	Then God opened a hollow place in the ground there at Lehi, and water came out of it. Samson drank it and began to feel much better. So the spring was named Hakkore;
JDG.15.20	Samson led Israel for twenty years while the Philistines ruled the land.
JDG.16.1	One day Samson went to the Philistine city of Gaza, where he met a prostitute and went to bed with her. 
JDG.16.2	The people of Gaza found out that Samson was there, so they surrounded the place and waited for him all night long at the city gate. They were quiet all night, thinking to themselves, “We'll wait until daybreak, and then we'll kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up and took hold of the city gate and pulled it up—doors, posts, lock, and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them far off to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron.
JDG.16.4	After this, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley. 
JDG.16.5	The five Philistine kings went to her and said, “Trick Samson into telling you why he is so strong and how we can overpower him, tie him up, and make him helpless. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes you so strong. If someone wanted to tie you up and make you helpless, how could he do it?”
JDG.16.7	Samson answered, “If they tie me up with seven new bowstrings that are not dried out, I'll be as weak as anybody else.”
JDG.16.8	So the Philistine kings brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that were not dried out, and she tied Samson up. 
JDG.16.9	She had some men waiting in another room, so she shouted, “Samson! The Philistines are coming!” But he snapped the bowstrings just as thread breaks when fire touches it. So they still did not know the secret of his strength.
JDG.16.10	Delilah told Samson, “Look, you've been making a fool of me and not telling me the truth. Please tell me how someone could tie you up.”
JDG.16.11	He told her, “If they tie me with new ropes that have never been used, I'll be as weak as anybody else.”
JDG.16.12	So Delilah got some new ropes and tied him up. Then she shouted, “Samson! The Philistines are coming!” The men were waiting in another room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread.
JDG.16.13	Delilah said to Samson, “You're still making a fool of me and not telling me the truth. Tell me how someone could tie you up.”
JDG.16.13	He told her, “If you weave my seven locks of hair into a loom, and make it tight with a peg, I'll be as weak as anybody else.”
JDG.16.14	Delilah then lulled him to sleep, took his seven locks of hair, and wove them into the loom.
JDG.16.15	So she said to him, “How can you say you love me, when you don't mean it? You've made a fool of me three times, and you still haven't told me what makes you so strong.” 
JDG.16.16	She kept on asking him, day after day. He got so sick and tired of her bothering him about it 
JDG.16.17	that he finally told her the truth. “My hair has never been cut,” he said. “I have been dedicated to God as a nazirite
JDG.16.18	When Delilah realized that he had told her the truth, she sent a message to the Philistine kings and said, “Come back one more time. He has told me the truth.” Then they came and brought the money with them. 
JDG.16.19	Delilah lulled Samson to sleep in her lap and then called a man, who cut off
JDG.16.20	Then she shouted, “Samson! The Philistines are coming!” He woke up and thought, “I'll get loose and go free, as always.” He did not know that the 
JDG.16.21	The Philistines captured him and put his eyes out. They took him to Gaza, chained him with bronze chains, and put him to work grinding at the mill in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	But his hair started growing back.
JDG.16.23	The Philistine kings met together to celebrate and offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They sang, “Our god has given us victory over our enemy Samson!” 
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	They were enjoying themselves, and so they said, “Call Samson, and let's make him entertain us!”
JDG.16.26	Samson said to the boy who was leading him by the hand, “Let me touch the columns that hold up the building. I want to lean on them.” 
JDG.16.27	The building was crowded with men and women. All five Philistine kings were there, and there were about three thousand men and women on the roof, watching Samson entertain them.
JDG.16.28	Then Samson prayed, “Sovereign 
JDG.16.29	So Samson took hold of the two middle columns holding up the building. Putting one hand on each column, he pushed against them 
JDG.16.30	and shouted, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He pushed with all his might, and the building fell down on the five kings and everyone else. Samson killed more people at his death than he had killed during his life.
JDG.16.31	His brothers and the rest of his family came down to get his body. They took him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had been Israel's leader for twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was once a man named Micah, who lived in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.2	He told his mother, “When someone stole those eleven hundred pieces of silver from you, you put a curse on the robber. I heard you do it. Look, I have the money. I am the one who took it.”
JDG.17.2	His mother said, “May the 
JDG.17.3	He gave the money back to his mother, and she said, “To keep the curse from falling on my son, I myself am solemnly dedicating the silver to the 
JDG.17.4	Then he gave them back to his mother. She took two hundred of the pieces of silver and gave them to a metalworker, who made an idol, carving it from wood and covering it with the silver. It was placed in Micah's house.
JDG.17.5	This man Micah had his own place of worship. He made some idols and an ephod,
JDG.17.6	 There was no king in Israel at that time; everyone did whatever they wanted.
JDG.17.7	At that same time there was a young Levite who had been living in the town of Bethlehem in Judah. 
JDG.17.8	He left Bethlehem to find another place to live. While he was traveling, he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.9	Micah asked him, “Where do you come from?”
JDG.17.9	He answered, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a place to live.”
JDG.17.10	Micah said, “Stay with me. Be my adviser and priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, some clothes, and your food.”
JDG.17.11	The young Levite agreed to stay with Micah and became like a son to him. 
JDG.17.12	Micah appointed him as his priest, and he lived in Micah's home. 
JDG.17.13	Micah said, “Now that I have a Levite as my priest, I know that the 
JDG.18.1	There was no king in Israel at that time. In those days the tribe of Dan was looking for territory to claim and settle in because they had not yet received any land of their own among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So the people of Dan chose five qualified
JDG.18.3	While they were there, they recognized the accent of the young Levite, so they went up to him and asked, “What are you doing here? Who brought you here?”
JDG.18.4	He answered, “I have an arrangement with Micah, who pays me to serve as his priest.”
JDG.18.5	They said to him, “Please ask God if we are going to be successful on our trip.”
JDG.18.6	The priest answered, “You have nothing to worry about. The 
JDG.18.7	So the five men left and went to the town of Laish. They saw how the people there lived in security like the Sidonians. They were a peaceful, quiet people, with no argument with anyone; they had all they needed.
JDG.18.8	When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, the people asked them what they had found out. 
JDG.18.9	“Come on,” they replied. “Let's attack Laish. We saw the land, and it's very good. Don't stay here doing nothing; hurry! Go on in and take it over! 
JDG.18.10	When you get there, you will find that the people don't suspect a thing. It is a big country; it has everything a person could want, and God has given it to you.”
JDG.18.11	So six hundred men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol, ready for battle. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place is still called Camp of Dan. 
JDG.18.13	They went on from there and came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who had gone to spy on the country around Laish said to their companions, “Did you know that here in one of these houses there is a wooden idol covered with silver? There are also other idols and an ephod. What do you think we should do?” 
JDG.18.15	So they went into Micah's house, where the young Levite lived, and asked the Levite how he was getting along. 
JDG.18.16	Meanwhile the six hundred Danite soldiers, ready for battle, were standing at the gate. 
JDG.18.17	The five spies went straight on into the house and took the wooden idol covered with silver, the other idols, and the ephod, while the priest stayed at the gate with the six hundred armed men.
JDG.18.18	When the men went into Micah's house and took the sacred objects, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	They told him, “Keep quiet. Don't say a word. Come with us and be our priest and adviser. Wouldn't you rather be a priest for a whole Israelite tribe than for the family of one man?” 
JDG.18.20	This made the priest very happy, so he took the sacred objects and went along with them.
JDG.18.21	They turned around and started off, with their children, their livestock, and their belongings going ahead. 
JDG.18.22	They had traveled a good distance from the house when Micah called his neighbors out for battle. They caught up with the Danites 
JDG.18.23	and shouted at them. The Danites turned around and asked Micah, “What's the matter? Why all this mob?”
JDG.18.24	Micah answered, “What do you mean, ‘What's the matter?’ You take my priest and the gods that I made, and walk off? What have I got left?”
JDG.18.25	The Danites told him, “You had better not say anything else unless you want these men to get angry and attack you. You and your whole family would die.” 
JDG.18.26	Then the Danites went on. Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back home.
JDG.18.27+JDG.18.28	After the Danites had taken the priest and the things that Micah had made, they went and attacked Laish, that town of peaceful, quiet people which was in the same valley as Bethrehob. They killed the inhabitants and burned the town. There was no one to save them, because Laish was a long way from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any other people. The Danites rebuilt the town and settled down there. 
JDG.18.29	They changed its name from Laish to Dan, after their ancestor Dan, the son of Jacob. 
JDG.18.30	The Danites set up the idol to be worshiped, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses, served as a priest for the Danites, and his descendants served as their priests until the people were taken away into exile. 
JDG.18.31	Micah's idol remained there as long as the Tent where God was worshiped remained at Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days before Israel had a king, there was a Levite living far back in the hill country of Ephraim. He took a young woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine. 
JDG.19.2	But she became angry with him, went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, and stayed there four months. 
JDG.19.3	Then the man decided to go after her and try to persuade her to return to him. He took his servant and two donkeys with him. The woman showed the Levite into the house, and when her father saw him, he gave him a hearty greeting. 
JDG.19.4	The father insisted that he stay, and so he stayed for three days. The couple had their meals and spent the nights there. 
JDG.19.5	On the morning of the fourth day they woke up early and got ready to go. But the woman's father said to the Levite, “Have something to eat first. You'll feel better. You can go later.”
JDG.19.6	So the two men sat down and ate and drank together. Then the woman's father told him, “Please spend the night and enjoy yourself.”
JDG.19.7	The Levite got up to go, but the father urged him to stay, so he spent another night there. 
JDG.19.8	Early in the morning of the fifth day he started to leave, but the woman's father said, “Eat something, please. Wait until later in the day.” So the two men ate together.
JDG.19.9	When the man, his concubine, and the servant once more started to leave, the father said, “Look, it's almost evening now; you might as well stay all night. It will be dark soon; stay here and have a good time. Tomorrow you can get up early for the trip and go home.”
JDG.19.10+JDG.19.11	But the man did not want to spend another night there, so he and his concubine started on their way, with their servant and two donkeys with pack saddles. It was late in the day when they came near Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), so the servant said to his master, “Why don't we stop and spend the night here in this Jebusite city?”
JDG.19.12+JDG.19.13	But his master said, “We're not going to stop in a city where the people are not Israelites. We'll pass on by and go a little farther and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they passed by Jebus and continued on their way. It was sunset when they came to Gibeah in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They turned off the road to go and spend the night there. They went into town and sat down in the city square, but no one offered to take them home for the night.
JDG.19.16	While they were there, an old man came by at the end of a day's work on the farm. He was originally from the hill country of Ephraim, but he was now living in Gibeah. (The other people there were from the tribe of Benjamin.) 
JDG.19.17	The old man noticed the traveler in the city square and asked him, “Where do you come from? Where are you going?”
JDG.19.18	The Levite answered, “We have been in Bethlehem in Judah, and now we are on our way home
JDG.19.19	even though we have fodder and straw for our donkeys, as well as bread and wine for my concubine and me and for my servant. We have everything we need.”
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “You are welcome in my home! I'll take care of you; you don't have to spend the night in the square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he took them home with him and fed their donkeys. His guests washed their feet and had a meal.
JDG.19.23	But the old man went outside and said to them, “No, my friends! Please! Don't do such an evil, immoral thing! This man is my guest. 
JDG.19.24	Look! Here is his concubine and my own virgin daughter. I'll bring them out now, and you can have them. Do whatever you want to with them. But don't do such an awful thing to this man!” 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his concubine and put her outside with them. They raped her and abused her all night long and didn't stop until morning.
JDG.19.26	At dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the old man's house, where her husband was. She was still there when daylight came. 
JDG.19.27	Her husband got up that morning, and when he opened the door to go on his way, he found his concubine lying in front of the house with her hands reaching for the door. 
JDG.19.28	He said, “Get up. Let's go.” But there was no answer. So he put her body across the donkey and started on his way home. 
JDG.19.29	 When he arrived, he went in the house and got a knife. He took his concubine's body, cut it into twelve pieces, and sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw it said, “We have never heard of such a thing! Nothing like this has ever happened since the Israelites left Egypt! We have to do something about this! What will it be?”
JDG.20.1	All the people of Israel from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, as well as from the land of Gilead in the east, answered the call. They gathered in one body in the 
JDG.20.2	The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were present at this gathering of God's people, and there were 400,000 foot soldiers. 
JDG.20.3	Meanwhile the people of Benjamin heard that all the other Israelites had gathered at Mizpah.
JDG.20.3	The Israelites asked, “Tell us, how was this crime committed?” 
JDG.20.4	The Levite whose concubine had been murdered answered, “My concubine and I went to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	The men of Gibeah came to get me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me; instead they raped my concubine, and she died. 
JDG.20.6	I took her body, cut it in pieces, and sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel. These people have committed an evil and immoral act among us. 
JDG.20.7	All of you here are Israelites. What are we going to do about this?”
JDG.20.8	All the people stood up together and said, “None of us, whether he lives in a tent or in a house, will go home. 
JDG.20.9	This is what we will do: we will draw lots and choose some men to attack Gibeah.
JDG.20.10	One tenth of the men in Israel will provide food for the army, and the others will go and punish Gibeah
JDG.20.11	So all the men in Israel assembled with one purpose—to attack the town.
JDG.20.12	The Israelite tribes sent messengers all through the territory of the tribe of Benjamin to say, “What is this crime that you have committed? 
JDG.20.13	Now hand over those perverts in Gibeah, so that we can kill them and remove this evil from Israel.” But the people of Benjamin paid no attention to the other Israelites. 
JDG.20.14	From all the cities of Benjamin they came to Gibeah to fight the other people of Israel. 
JDG.20.15+JDG.20.16	They called out twenty-six thousand soldiers from their cities that day. Besides these, the citizens of Gibeah gathered seven hundred specially chosen men
JDG.20.17	Not counting the tribe of Benjamin, the Israelites gathered 400,000 trained soldiers.
JDG.20.18	The Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel, and there they asked God, “Which tribe should attack the Benjaminites first?”
JDG.20.18	The 
JDG.20.19	So the Israelites started out the next morning and camped near the city of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	They went to attack the army of Benjamin, and placed the soldiers in position facing the city. 
JDG.20.21	The army of Benjamin came out of the city, and before the day was over they had killed twenty-two thousand Israelite soldiers. 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23	Then the Israelites went to the place of worship and mourned in the presence of the 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23	The 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23	So the Israelite army was encouraged, and they placed their soldiers in position again, where they had been the day before. 
JDG.20.24	They marched against the army of Benjamin a second time. 
JDG.20.25	And for the second time the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah, and this time they killed eighteen thousand trained Israelite soldiers. 
JDG.20.26	Then all the people of Israel went up to Bethel and mourned. They sat there in the 
JDG.20.27+JDG.20.28	God's Covenant Box was there at Bethel in those days, and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, was in charge of it. The people asked the 
JDG.20.27+JDG.20.28	The 
JDG.20.29	So the Israelites put some soldiers in hiding around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	Then for the third straight day they marched against the army of Benjamin and placed their soldiers in battle position facing Gibeah, as they had done before. 
JDG.20.31	The Benjaminites came out to fight and were led away from the city. As they had before, they began killing some Israelites in the open country, on the road to Bethel and on the road to Gibeah. They killed about thirty Israelites. 
JDG.20.32	The Benjaminites said, “We've beaten them just as before.”
JDG.20.32	But the Israelites had planned to retreat and lead them away from the city onto the roads. 
JDG.20.33	So when the main army of the Israelites pulled back and regrouped at Baaltamar, the men surrounding Gibeah suddenly rushed out of their hiding places in the rocky country around the city.
JDG.20.34	Ten thousand men, specially chosen out of all Israel, attacked Gibeah, and the fighting was hard. The Benjaminites had not realized that they were about to be destroyed. 
JDG.20.35	The 
JDG.20.36	and the Benjaminites realized they were defeated.
JDG.20.36	The main body of the Israelite army had retreated from the Benjaminites because they were relying on the men that they had put in hiding around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	These men ran quickly toward Gibeah; they spread out in the city and killed everyone there. 
JDG.20.38	The main Israelite army and the men in hiding had arranged a signal. When they saw a big cloud of smoke going up from the town, 
JDG.20.39	the Israelites out on the battlefield were to turn around. By this time the Benjaminites had already killed the thirty Israelites. They told themselves, “Yes, we've beaten them just as before.” 
JDG.20.40	Then the signal appeared; a cloud of smoke began to go up from the town. The Benjaminites looked behind them and were amazed to see the whole city going up in flames. 
JDG.20.41	Then the Israelites turned around, and the Benjaminites were thrown into panic because they realized that they were about to be destroyed. 
JDG.20.42	They retreated from the Israelites and ran toward the open country, but they could not escape. They were caught between the main army and the men who were now coming out of the city,
JDG.20.43	The Israelites had the enemy trapped, and without stopping they pursued them as far as a point east of Gibeah, killing them as they went.
JDG.20.44	Eighteen thousand of the best Benjaminite soldiers were killed. 
JDG.20.45	The others turned and ran toward the open country to Rimmon Rock. Five thousand of them were killed on the roads. The Israelites continued to pursue the rest to Gidom, killing two thousand. 
JDG.20.46	In all, twenty-five thousand Benjaminites were killed that day—all of them brave soldiers.
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men were able to escape to the open country to Rimmon Rock, and they stayed there four months. 
JDG.20.48	The Israelites turned back against the rest of the Benjaminites and killed them all—men, women, and children, and animals as well. They burned every town in the area.
JDG.21.1	When the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, they had made a solemn promise to the 
JDG.21.2	So now the people of Israel went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening. Loudly and bitterly they mourned: 
JDG.21.3	“
JDG.21.4	Early the next morning the people got up and built an altar there. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole. 
JDG.21.5	They asked, “Is there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in the 
JDG.21.6	The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites and said, “Today Israel has lost one of its tribes. 
JDG.21.7	What shall we do to provide wives for the men of Benjamin who are left? We have made a solemn promise to the 
JDG.21.8	When they asked if there was some group out of the tribes of Israel that had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah, they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there; 
JDG.21.9	at the roll call of the army no one from Jabesh had responded. 
JDG.21.10	So the assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders, “Go and kill everyone in Jabesh, including women and children. 
JDG.21.11	Kill all the males, and also every woman who is not a virgin.” 
JDG.21.12	They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh, so they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war. 
JDG.21.14	The Benjaminites came back, and the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed. But there were not enough of them.
JDG.21.15	The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because the 
JDG.21.16	So the leaders of the gathering said, “There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin. What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left? 
JDG.21.17	Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive, 
JDG.21.18	but we cannot allow them to marry our daughters, because we have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters.”
JDG.21.19	Then they thought, “The yearly festival of the 
JDG.21.20	They told the Benjaminites, “Go and hide in the vineyards 
JDG.21.21	and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you. 
JDG.21.22	If their fathers or brothers come to you
JDG.21.23	The Benjaminites did this; each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away. Then they went back to their own territory, rebuilt their towns, and lived there. 
JDG.21.24	At the same time the rest of the Israelites left, and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property.
RUT.1.1+RUT.1.2	Long ago, in the days before Israel had a king, there was a famine in the land. So a man named Elimelech, who belonged to the clan of Ephrath and who lived in Bethlehem in Judah, went with his wife Naomi and their two sons Mahlon and Chilion to live for a while in the country of Moab. While they were living there, 
RUT.1.3	Elimelech died, and Naomi was left alone with her two sons, 
RUT.1.4	who married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. About ten years later 
RUT.1.5	Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left all alone, without husband or sons.
RUT.1.6	Some time later Naomi heard that the 
RUT.1.7	They started out together to go back to Judah, but on the way 
RUT.1.8	she said to them, “Go back home and stay with your mothers. May the 
RUT.1.9	And may the 
RUT.1.9	So Naomi kissed them good-bye. But they started crying 
RUT.1.10	and said to her, “No! We will go with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	“You must go back, my daughters,” Naomi answered. “Why do you want to come with me? Do you think I could have sons again for you to marry? 
RUT.1.12	Go back home, for I am too old to get married again. Even if I thought there was still hope, and so got married tonight and had sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you wait until they had grown up? Would this keep you from marrying someone else? No, my daughters, you know that's impossible. The 
RUT.1.14	Again they started crying. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye and went back home,
RUT.1.15	So Naomi said to her, “Ruth, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god.
RUT.1.16	But Ruth answered, “Don't ask me to leave you! Let me go with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
RUT.1.17	Wherever you die, I will die, and that is where I will be buried. May the 
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.
RUT.1.19	They went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town became excited, and the women there exclaimed, “Is this really Naomi?”
RUT.1.20	“Don't call me Naomi,” she answered; “call me Marah,
RUT.1.21	When I left here, I had plenty, but the 
RUT.1.22	This, then, was how Naomi came back from Moab with Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the barley harvest was just beginning.
RUT.2.1	Naomi had a relative named Boaz, a rich and influential man who belonged to the family of her husband Elimelech. 
RUT.2.2	 One day Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields to gather the grain that the harvest workers leave. I am sure to find someone who will let me work with him.”
RUT.2.2	Naomi answered, “Go ahead, daughter.”
RUT.2.3	So Ruth went out to the fields and walked behind the workers, picking up the heads of grain which they left. It so happened that she was in a field that belonged to Boaz.
RUT.2.4	Some time later Boaz himself arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the workers. “The 
RUT.2.4	“The 
RUT.2.5	Boaz asked the man in charge, “Who is that young woman?”
RUT.2.6	The man answered, “She is the foreigner who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
RUT.2.7	She asked me to let her follow the workers and gather grain. She has been working since early morning and has just now stopped to rest for a while under the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Let me give you some advice. Don't gather grain anywhere except in this field. Work with the women here; 
RUT.2.9	watch them to see where they are reaping and stay with them. I have ordered my men not to molest you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and drink from the water jars that they have filled.”
RUT.2.10	Ruth bowed down with her face touching the ground, and said to Boaz, “Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should you be so kind to a foreigner?”
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered, “I have heard about everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. I know how you left your father and mother and your own country and how you came to live among a people you had never known before. 
RUT.2.12	May the 
RUT.2.13	Ruth answered, “You are very kind
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come and have a piece of bread, and dip it in the sauce.” So she sat with the workers, and Boaz passed some roasted grain to her. She ate until she was satisfied, and she still had some food left over. 
RUT.2.15+RUT.2.16	After she had left to go and gather grain, Boaz ordered the workers, “Let her gather grain even where the bundles are lying, and don't say anything to stop her. Besides that, pull out some heads of grain from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up.”
RUT.2.17	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening, and when she had beaten it out, she found she had nearly twenty-five pounds. 
RUT.2.18	She took the grain back into town and showed her mother-in-law how much she had gathered. She also gave her the food left over from the meal. 
RUT.2.19	Naomi asked her, “Where did you gather all this grain today? Whose field have you been working in? May God bless the man who took an interest in you!”
RUT.2.19	So Ruth told Naomi that she had been working in a field belonging to a man named Boaz.
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth said, “Best of all, he told me to keep gathering grain with his workers until they finish the harvest.”
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth, “Yes, daughter, it will be better for you to work with the women in Boaz' field. You might be molested if you went to someone else's field.” 
RUT.2.23	So Ruth worked with them and gathered grain until all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she continued to live with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Some time later Naomi said to Ruth, “I must find a husband for you, so that you will have a home of your own. 
RUT.3.2	Remember that this man Boaz, whose women you have been working with, is our relative. Now listen. This evening he will be threshing the barley. 
RUT.3.3	So wash yourself, put on some perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go where he is threshing, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	Be sure to notice where he lies down, and after he falls asleep, go and lift the covers and lie down at his feet. He will tell you what to do.”
RUT.3.5	Ruth answered, “I will do everything you say.”
RUT.3.6	So Ruth went to the threshing place and did just what her mother-in-law had told her. 
RUT.3.7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking, he was in a good mood. He went to the pile of barley and lay down to sleep. Ruth slipped over quietly, lifted the covers and lay down at his feet. 
RUT.3.8	During the night he woke up suddenly, turned over, and was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	“Who are you?” he asked.
RUT.3.9	“It's Ruth, sir,” she answered. “Because you are a close relative, you are responsible for taking care of me. So please marry me.”
RUT.3.10	“The 
RUT.3.11	Now don't worry, Ruth. I will do everything you ask; as everyone in town knows, you are a fine woman. 
RUT.3.12	 It is true that I am a close relative and am responsible for you, but there is a man who is a closer relative than I am. 
RUT.3.13	Stay here the rest of the night, and in the morning we will find out whether or not he will take responsibility for you. If so, well and good; if not, then I swear by the living 
RUT.3.14	So she lay there at his feet, but she got up before it was light enough for her to be seen, because Boaz did not want anyone to know that she had been there. 
RUT.3.15	Boaz said to her, “Take off your cloak and spread it out here.” She did, and he poured out almost fifty pounds of barley and helped her lift it to her shoulder. Then she returned to town with it. 
RUT.3.16	When she arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, “How did you get along, daughter?”
RUT.3.16	Ruth told her everything that Boaz had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	She added, “He told me I must not come back to you empty-handed, so he gave me all this barley.”
RUT.3.18	Naomi said to her, “Now be patient, Ruth, until you see how this all turns out. Boaz will not rest today until he settles the matter.”
RUT.4.1	Boaz went to the meeting place at the town gate and sat down there. Then Elimelech's nearest relative, the man whom Boaz had mentioned, came by, and Boaz called to him, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz got ten of the leaders of the town and asked them to sit down there too. When they were seated, 
RUT.4.3	he said to his relative, “Now that Naomi has come back from Moab, she wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech, 
RUT.4.4	and I think you ought to know about it. Now then, if you want it, buy it in the presence of these men sitting here. But if you don't want it, say so, because the right to buy it belongs first to you and then to me.”
RUT.4.4	The man said, “I will buy it.”
RUT.4.5	Boaz said, “Very well, if you buy the field from Naomi, then you are also buying Ruth,
RUT.4.6	The man answered, “In that case I will give up my right to buy the field, because it would mean that my own children would not inherit it. You buy it; I would rather not.”
RUT.4.8	So when the man said to Boaz, “You buy it,” he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz.
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the others there, “You are all witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and to his sons Chilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	 In addition, Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon's widow, becomes my wife. This will keep the property in the dead man's family, and his family line will continue among his people and in his hometown. You are witnesses to this today.”
RUT.4.12	 May the children that the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth home as his wife. The 
RUT.4.14	The women said to Naomi, “Praise the 
RUT.4.15	Your daughter-in-law loves you, and has done more for you than seven sons. And now she has given you a grandson, who will bring new life to you and give you security in your old age.” 
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the child, held him close,
RUT.4.17	The women of the neighborhood named the boy Obed. They told everyone, “A son has been born to Naomi!”
RUT.4.17	Obed became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
RUT.4.18+RUT.4.19+RUT.4.20+RUT.4.21+RUT.4.22	This is the family line from Perez to David: Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David.
1SA.1.1	There was a man named Elkanah, from the tribe of Ephraim, who lived in the town of Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham and grandson of Elihu, and belonged to the family of Tohu, a part of the clan of Zuph. 
1SA.1.2	Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not. 
1SA.1.3	Every year Elkanah went from Ramah to worship and offer sacrifices to the 
1SA.1.4	Each time Elkanah offered his sacrifice, he would give one share of the meat to Peninnah and one share to each of her children. 
1SA.1.5	And even though he loved Hannah very much he would give her only one share, because
1SA.1.6	Peninnah, her rival, would torment and humiliate her, because the 
1SA.1.7	This went on year after year; whenever they went to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	Her husband Elkanah would ask her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why are you always so sad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?”
1SA.1.9+1SA.1.10	One time, after they had finished their meal in the house of the 
1SA.1.11	 Hannah made a solemn promise: “
1SA.1.12	Hannah continued to pray to the 
1SA.1.13	She was praying silently; her lips were moving, but she made no sound. So Eli thought that she was drunk, 
1SA.1.14	and he said to her, “Stop making a drunken show of yourself! Stop your drinking and sober up!”
1SA.1.15	“No, I'm not drunk, sir,” she answered. “I haven't been drinking! I am desperate, and I have been praying, pouring out my troubles to the 
1SA.1.16	Don't think I am a worthless woman. I have been praying like this because I'm so miserable.”
1SA.1.17	“Go in peace,” Eli said, “and may the God of Israel give you what you have asked him for.”
1SA.1.18	“May you always think kindly of me,” she replied. Then she went away, ate some food, and was no longer sad.
1SA.1.19	The next morning Elkanah and his family got up early, and after worshiping the 
1SA.1.20	So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
1SA.1.21	The time came again for Elkanah and his family to go to Shiloh and offer to the 
1SA.1.22	But this time Hannah did not go. She told her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will take him to the house of the 
1SA.1.23	Elkanah answered, “All right, do whatever you think best; stay at home until you have weaned him. And may the 
1SA.1.24	After she had weaned him, she took him to Shiloh, taking along a three-year-old bull,
1SA.1.25	After they had killed the bull, they took the child to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	Hannah said to him, “Excuse me, sir. Do you remember me? I am the woman you saw standing here, praying to the 
1SA.1.27	I asked him for this child, and he gave me what I asked for. 
1SA.1.28	So I am dedicating him to the 
1SA.1.28	Then they
1SA.2.1	“The 
1SA.2.1	how happy I am because of what he has done!
1SA.2.1	I laugh at my enemies;
1SA.2.1	how joyful I am because God has helped me!
1SA.2.2	“No one is holy like the 
1SA.2.2	there is none like him,
1SA.2.2	no protector like our God.

1SA.2.3	silence your proud words.

1SA.2.3	and he judges all that people do.
1SA.2.4	The bows of strong soldiers are broken,
1SA.2.4	but the weak grow strong.
1SA.2.5	The people who once were well fed
1SA.2.5	now hire themselves out to get food,
1SA.2.5	but the hungry are hungry no more.
1SA.2.5	The childless wife has borne seven children,
1SA.2.5	but the mother of many is left with none.
1SA.2.6	he sends people to the world of the dead
1SA.2.6	and brings them back again.
1SA.2.7	He makes some people poor and others rich;
1SA.2.7	he humbles some and makes others great.
1SA.2.8	He lifts the poor from the dust
1SA.2.8	and raises the needy from their misery.
1SA.2.8	He makes them companions of princes
1SA.2.8	and puts them in places of honor.
1SA.2.8	The foundations of the earth belong to the 
1SA.2.8	on them he has built the world.

1SA.2.10	The 
1SA.2.10	he will give power to his king,
1SA.2.10	he will make his chosen king victorious.”
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed in Shiloh and served the 
1SA.2.12	The sons of Eli were scoundrels. They paid no attention to the 
1SA.2.13	or to the regulations concerning what the priests could demand from the people. Instead, when someone was offering a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork. While the meat was still cooking, 
1SA.2.14	he would stick the fork into the cooking pot, and whatever the fork brought out belonged to the priest. All the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices were treated like this. 
1SA.2.15	In addition, even before the fat was taken off and burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, “Give me some meat for the priest to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw meat.”
1SA.2.16	If the person answered, “Let us do what is right and burn the fat first; then take what you want,” the priest's servant would say, “No! Give it to me now! If you don't, I will have to take it by force!”
1SA.2.17	This sin of the sons of Eli was extremely serious in the 
1SA.2.18	In the meantime the boy Samuel continued to serve the 
1SA.2.19	Each year his mother would make a little robe and take it to him when she accompanied her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say to Elkanah, “May the 
1SA.2.20	After that they would go back home.
1SA.2.21	The 
1SA.2.22	Eli was now very old. He kept hearing about everything his sons were doing to the Israelites and that they were even sleeping with the women who worked at the entrance to the Tent of the 
1SA.2.23	So he said to them, “Why are you doing these things? Everybody tells me about the evil you are doing. 
1SA.2.24	Stop it, my sons! This is an awful thing the people of the 
1SA.2.25	If anyone sins against someone else, God can defend the one who is wrong; but who can defend someone who sins against the 
1SA.2.25	But they would not listen to their father, for the 
1SA.2.27	A prophet came to Eli with this message from the 
1SA.2.28	 From all the tribes of Israel I chose his family to be my priests, to serve at the altar, to burn the incense, and to wear the ephod
1SA.2.29	Why, then, do you look with greed
1SA.2.30	I, the 
1SA.2.31	Listen, the time is coming when I will kill all the young men in your family and your clan, so that no man in your family will live to be old. 
1SA.2.32	You will be troubled and look with envy
1SA.2.33	Yet I will keep one of your descendants alive, and he will serve me as priest. But he
1SA.2.34	 When your two sons Hophni and Phinehas both die on the same day, this will show you that everything I have said will come true. 
1SA.2.35	I will choose a priest who will be faithful to me and do everything I want him to. I will give him descendants, who will always serve in the presence of my chosen king. 
1SA.2.36	Any of your descendants who survive will have to go to that priest and ask him for money and food, and beg to be allowed to help the priests, in order to have something to eat.”
1SA.3.1	In those days, when the boy Samuel was serving the 
1SA.3.2	One night Eli, who was now almost blind, was sleeping in his own room; 
1SA.3.3	Samuel was sleeping in the sanctuary, where the sacred Covenant Box was. Before dawn, while the lamp was still burning, 
1SA.3.4	the 
1SA.3.5	and ran to Eli and said, “You called me, and here I am.”
1SA.3.5	But Eli answered, “I didn't call you; go back to bed.” So Samuel went back to bed.
1SA.3.6+1SA.3.7	The 
1SA.3.6+1SA.3.7	But Eli answered, “My son, I didn't call you; go back to bed.”
1SA.3.8	The 
1SA.3.8	Then Eli realized that it was the 
1SA.3.9	so he said to him, “Go back to bed; and if he calls you again, say, ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.10	Samuel answered, “Speak; your servant is listening.”
1SA.3.11	The 
1SA.3.12	On that day I will carry out all my threats against Eli's family, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	I have already told him
1SA.3.14	So I solemnly declare to the family of Eli that no sacrifice or offering will ever be able to remove the consequences of this terrible sin.”
1SA.3.15	Samuel stayed in bed until morning; then he got up and opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	Eli called him, “Samuel, my boy!”
1SA.3.16	“Yes, sir,” answered Samuel.
1SA.3.17	“What did the 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything; he did not keep anything back. Eli said, “He is the 
1SA.3.19	As Samuel grew up, the 
1SA.3.20	So all the people of Israel, from one end of the country to the other, knew that Samuel was indeed a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	At that time the Philistines gathered to go to war against Israel, so
1SA.4.2	The Philistines attacked, and after fierce fighting they defeated the Israelites and killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When the survivors came back to camp, the leaders of Israel said, “Why did the 
1SA.4.4	 So they sent messengers to Shiloh and got the Covenant Box of the 
1SA.4.5	When the Covenant Box arrived, the Israelites gave such a loud shout of joy that the earth shook. 
1SA.4.6	The Philistines heard the shouting and said, “Listen to all that shouting in the Hebrew camp! What does it mean?” When they found out that the 
1SA.4.7	they were afraid, and said, “A god has come into their camp! We're lost! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before! 
1SA.4.8	Who can save us from those powerful gods? They are the gods who slaughtered the Egyptians in the desert! 
1SA.4.9	Be brave, Philistines! Fight like men, or we will become slaves to the Hebrews, just as they were our slaves. So fight like men!”
1SA.4.10	The Philistines fought hard and defeated the Israelites, who went running to their homes. There was a great slaughter: thirty thousand Israelite soldiers were killed. 
1SA.4.11	God's Covenant Box was captured, and Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were both killed.
1SA.4.12	A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran all the way from the battlefield to Shiloh and arrived there the same day. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head. 
1SA.4.13	Eli, who was very worried about the Covenant Box, was sitting in his seat beside the road, staring. The man spread the news throughout the town, and everyone cried out in fear. 
1SA.4.14	Eli heard the noise and asked, “What is all this noise about?” The man hurried to Eli to tell him the news. ( 
1SA.4.15	Eli was now ninety-eight years old and almost completely blind.) 
1SA.4.16	The man said, “I have escaped from the battle and have run all the way here today.”
1SA.4.16	Eli asked him, “What happened, my son?”
1SA.4.17	The messenger answered, “Israel ran away from the Philistines; it was a terrible defeat for us! Besides that, your sons Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and God's Covenant Box was captured!”
1SA.4.18	When the man mentioned the Covenant Box, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate. He was so old and fat that the fall broke his neck, and he died. He had been a leader in Israel for forty years.
1SA.4.19	Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, and it was almost time for her baby to be born. When she heard that God's Covenant Box had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she suddenly went into labor and gave birth. 
1SA.4.20	As she was dying, the women helping her said to her, “Be brave! You have a son!” But she paid no attention and did not answer. 
1SA.4.21	She named the boy Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	“God's glory has left Israel,” she said, “because God's Covenant Box has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	After the Philistines captured the Covenant Box, they carried it from Ebenezer to their city of Ashdod, 
1SA.5.2	took it into the temple of their god Dagon, and set it up beside his statue. 
1SA.5.3	Early the next morning the people of Ashdod saw that the statue of Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground in front of the 
1SA.5.4	Early the following morning they saw that the statue had again fallen down in front of the Covenant Box. This time its head and both its arms were broken off and were lying in the doorway; only the body was left. ( 
1SA.5.5	That is why even today the priests of Dagon and all his worshipers in Ashdod step over that place and do not walk on it.)
1SA.5.6	The 
1SA.5.7	When they saw what was happening, they said, “The God of Israel is punishing us and our god Dagon. We can't let the Covenant Box stay here any longer.” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent messengers and called together all five of the Philistine kings and asked them, “What shall we do with the Covenant Box of the God of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	“Take it over to Gath,” they answered; so they took it to Gath, another Philistine city. 
1SA.5.9	But after it arrived there, the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the Covenant Box to Ekron, another Philistine city; but when it arrived there, the people cried out, “They have brought the Covenant Box of the God of Israel here, in order to kill us all!” 
1SA.5.11	So again they sent for all the Philistine kings and said, “Send the Covenant Box of Israel back to its own place, so that it won't kill us and our families.” There was panic throughout the city because God was punishing them so severely. 
1SA.5.12	Even those who did not die developed tumors and the people cried out to their gods for help.
1SA.6.1	After the 
1SA.6.2	the people called the priests and the magicians and asked, “What shall we do with the Covenant Box of the 
1SA.6.3	They answered, “If you return the Covenant Box of the God of Israel, you must, of course, send with it a gift to him to pay for your sin. The Covenant Box must not go back without a gift. In this way you will be healed, and you will find out why he has kept on punishing you.”
1SA.6.4	“What gift shall we send him?” the people asked.
1SA.6.4	They answered, “Five gold models of tumors and five gold mice, one of each for each Philistine king. The same plague was sent on all of you and on the five kings. 
1SA.6.5	You must make these models of the tumors and of the mice that are ravaging your country, and you must give honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will stop punishing you, your gods, and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why should you be stubborn, as the king of Egypt and the Egyptians were? Don't forget how God made fools of them until they let the Israelites leave Egypt. 
1SA.6.7	So prepare a new wagon and two cows that have never been yoked; hitch them to the wagon and drive their calves back to the barn. 
1SA.6.8	Take the 
1SA.6.9	Then watch it go; if it goes toward the town of Beth Shemesh, this means that it is the God of the Israelites who has sent this terrible disaster on us. But if it doesn't, then we will know that he did not send the plague; it was only a matter of chance.”
1SA.6.10	They did what they were told: they took two cows and hitched them to the wagon, and shut the calves in the barn. 
1SA.6.11	They put the Covenant Box in the wagon, together with the box containing the gold models of the mice and of the tumors. 
1SA.6.12	The cows started off on the road to Beth Shemesh and headed straight toward it, without turning off the road. They were mooing as they went. The five Philistine kings followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
1SA.6.13	The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping wheat in the valley, when suddenly they looked up and saw the Covenant Box. They were overjoyed at the sight. 
1SA.6.14	The wagon came to a field belonging to a man named Joshua, who lived in Beth Shemesh, and it stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the wooden wagon and killed the cows and burned them as a burnt sacrifice to the 
1SA.6.15	The Levites lifted off the Covenant Box of the 
1SA.6.16	The five Philistine kings watched them do this and then went back to Ekron that same day.
1SA.6.17	The Philistines sent the five gold tumors to the 
1SA.6.18	They also sent gold mice, one for each of the cities ruled by the five Philistine kings, both the fortified towns and the villages without walls. The large rock in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, on which they placed the 
1SA.6.19	The 
1SA.6.20	So the men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who can stand before the

1SA.7.3	Samuel said to the people of Israel, “If you are going to turn to the 
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte, and worshiped only the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel called for all the Israelites to meet at Mizpah, telling them, “I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	So they all gathered at Mizpah. They drew some water and poured it out as an offering to the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the five Philistine kings started out with their men to attack them. The Israelites heard about it and were afraid, 
1SA.7.8	and said to Samuel, “Keep praying to the 
1SA.7.9	 Samuel killed a young lamb and burned it whole as a sacrifice to the 
1SA.7.10	While Samuel was offering the sacrifice, the Philistines moved forward to attack; but just then the 
1SA.7.11	The Israelites marched out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines almost as far as Bethcar, killing them along the way.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone, set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and said, “The 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were defeated, and the 
1SA.7.14	All the cities which the Philistines had captured between Ekron and Gath were returned to Israel, and so Israel got back all its territory. And there was peace also between the Israelites and the Canaanites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel ruled Israel as long as he lived. 
1SA.7.16	Every year he would go around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and in these places he would settle disputes. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would go back to his home in Ramah, where also he would serve as judge. In Ramah he built an altar to the 
1SA.8.1	When Samuel grew old, he made his sons judges in Israel. 
1SA.8.2	The older son was named Joel and the younger one Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But they did not follow their father's example; they were interested only in making money, so they accepted bribes and did not decide cases honestly.
1SA.8.4	Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah, 
1SA.8.5	 and said to him, “Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have.” 
1SA.8.6	Samuel was displeased with their request for a king; so he prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	and the 
1SA.8.8	Ever since I brought them out of Egypt, they have turned away from me and worshiped other gods; and now they are doing to you what they have always done to me. 
1SA.8.9	So then, listen to them, but give them strict warnings and explain how their kings will treat them.”
1SA.8.10	Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king everything that the 
1SA.8.11	“This is how your king will treat you,” Samuel explained. “He will make soldiers of your sons; some of them will serve in his war chariots, others in his cavalry, and others will run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He will make some of them officers in charge of a thousand men, and others in charge of fifty men. Your sons will have to plow his fields, harvest his crops, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	Your daughters will have to make perfumes for him and work as his cooks and his bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and of your grapes for his court officers and other officials. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your servants and your best cattle
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your flocks. And you yourselves will become his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	When that time comes, you will complain bitterly because of your king, whom you yourselves chose, but the 
1SA.8.19	The people paid no attention to Samuel, but said, “No! We want a king, 
1SA.8.20	so that we will be like other nations, with our own king to rule us and to lead us out to war and to fight our battles.” 
1SA.8.21	Samuel listened to everything they said and then went and told it to the 
1SA.8.22	The 
1SA.9.1	There was a wealthy and influential man named Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin; he was the son of Abiel and grandson of Zeror, and belonged to the family of Becorath, a part of the clan of Aphiah. 
1SA.9.2	He had a son named Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Saul was a foot taller than anyone else in Israel and more handsome as well.
1SA.9.3	Some donkeys belonging to Kish had wandered off, so he said to Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	They went through the hill country of Ephraim and the region of Shalishah, but did not find them; so they went on through the region of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then they went through the territory of Benjamin, but still did not find them. 
1SA.9.5	When they came into the region of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Let's go back home, or my father might stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”
1SA.9.6	The servant answered, “Wait! In this town there is a holy man who is highly respected because everything he says comes true. Let's go to him, and maybe he can tell us where we can find the donkeys.”
1SA.9.7	“If we go to him, what can we give him?” Saul asked. “There is no food left in our packs, and we don't have a thing to give him, do we?”
1SA.9.8	The servant answered, “I have a small silver coin. I can give him that, and then he will tell us where we can find them.”
1SA.9.9+1SA.9.10+1SA.9.11	Saul replied, “A good idea! Let's go.” So they went to the town where the holy man lived. As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women who were coming out to draw water. They asked these women, “Is the seer in town?”
1SA.9.9+1SA.9.10+1SA.9.11	(At that time a prophet was called a seer, and so whenever someone wanted to ask God a question, he would say, “Let's go to the seer.”)
1SA.9.12+1SA.9.13	“Yes, he is,” the young women answered. “In fact, he is just ahead of you. If you hurry, you will catch up with him. As soon as you go into town, you will find him. He arrived in town today because the people are going to offer a sacrifice on the altar on the hill. The people who are invited won't start eating until he gets there, because he has to bless the sacrifice first. If you go now, you will find him before he goes up the hill to eat.” 
1SA.9.14	So Saul and his servant went on to the town, and as they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way to the place of worship.
1SA.9.15	Now on the previous day the 
1SA.9.16	“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin; anoint him as ruler of my people Israel, and he will rescue them from the Philistines. I have seen the suffering of my people and have heard their cries for help.”
1SA.9.17	When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul went over to Samuel, who was near the gate, and asked, “Tell me, where does the seer live?”
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered, “I am the seer. Go on ahead of me to the place of worship. Both of you are to eat with me today. Tomorrow morning I will answer all your questions and send you on your way. 
1SA.9.20	As for the donkeys that were lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they have already been found. But who is it that the people of Israel want so much?
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, “I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important one in the tribe. Why, then, do you talk like this to me?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel led Saul and his servant into the large room and gave them a place at the head of the table where the guests, about thirty in all, were seated. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, which I told you to set aside.” 
1SA.9.24	So the cook brought the choice piece of the leg and placed it before Saul. Samuel
1SA.9.24	So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
1SA.9.25	When they went down from the place of worship to the town, they fixed up a bed for Saul
1SA.9.26	and he slept there.
1SA.9.26	At dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, and I will send you on your way.” Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out to the street together. 
1SA.9.27	When they arrived at the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” The servant left, and Samuel continued, “Stay here a minute, and I will tell you what God has said.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, “The 
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They will tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found, so that your father isn't worried any more about them but about you, and he keeps asking, ‘What shall I do about my son?’ 
1SA.10.3	You will go on from there until you come to the sacred tree at Tabor, where you will meet three men on their way to offer a sacrifice to God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and the third one will have a leather bag full of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves, which you are to accept. 
1SA.10.5	Then you will go to the Hill of God in Gibeah, where there is a Philistine camp. At the entrance to the town you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the altar on the hill, playing harps, drums, flutes, and lyres. They will be dancing and shouting. 
1SA.10.6	Suddenly the spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	When these things happen, do whatever God leads you to do. 
1SA.10.8	You will go ahead of me to Gilgal, where I will meet you and offer burnt sacrifices and fellowship sacrifices. Wait there seven days until I come and tell you what to do.”
1SA.10.9	When Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave Saul a new nature. And everything Samuel had told him happened that day. 
1SA.10.10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Suddenly the spirit of God took control of him, and he joined in their ecstatic dancing and shouting. 
1SA.10.11	People who had known him before saw him doing this and asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Has Saul become a prophet?” 
1SA.10.12	 A man who lived there asked, “How about these other prophets—who do you think their fathers are?” This is how the saying originated, “Has even Saul become a prophet?” 
1SA.10.13	When Saul finished his ecstatic dancing and shouting, he went to the altar on the hill.
1SA.10.14	Saul's uncle saw him and the servant, and he asked them, “Where have you been?”
1SA.10.14	“Looking for the donkeys,” Saul answered. “When we couldn't find them, we went to see Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	“And what did he tell you?” Saul's uncle asked.
1SA.10.16	“He told us that the animals had been found,” Saul answered—but he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about his becoming king.
1SA.10.17	Samuel called the people together for a religious gathering at Mizpah 
1SA.10.18	and said to them, “The 
1SA.10.19	I am your God, the one who rescues you from all your troubles and difficulties, but today you have rejected me and have asked me to give you a king. Very well, then, gather yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	Then Samuel had each tribe come forward, and the 
1SA.10.21	Then Samuel had the families of the tribe of Benjamin come forward, and the family of Matri was picked out. Then the men of the family of Matri came forward,
1SA.10.22	they asked the 
1SA.10.22	The 
1SA.10.23	So they ran and brought Saul out to the people, and they could see that he was a foot taller than anyone else. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to the people, “Here is the man the 
1SA.10.24	All the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of a king, and then wrote them in a book, which he deposited in a holy place. Then he sent everyone home. 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went back home to Gibeah. Some powerful men,
1SA.10.27	But some worthless people said, “How can this fellow do us any good?” They despised Saul and did not bring him any gifts.
1SA.11.1	About a month later King Nahash of Ammon led his army against the town of Jabesh in the territory of Gilead and besieged it. The men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will accept you as our ruler.”
1SA.11.2	Nahash answered, “I will make a treaty with you on one condition: I will put out everyone's right eye and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”
1SA.11.3	The leaders of Jabesh said, “Give us seven days to send messengers throughout the land of Israel. If no one will help us, then we will surrender to you.”
1SA.11.4	The messengers arrived at Gibeah, where Saul lived, and when they told the news, the people started crying in despair. 
1SA.11.5	Saul was just then coming in from the field with his oxen, and he asked, “What's wrong? Why is everyone crying?” They told him what the messengers from Jabesh had reported. 
1SA.11.6	When Saul heard this, the spirit of God took control of him, and he became furious. 
1SA.11.7	He took two oxen, cut them in pieces, and had messengers carry the pieces throughout the land of Israel with this warning: “Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel into battle will have this done to his oxen!”
1SA.11.7	The people of Israel were afraid of what the 
1SA.11.8	Saul gathered them at Bezek: there were 300,000 from Israel and 30,000 from Judah. 
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers from Jabesh, “Tell your people that before noon tomorrow they will be rescued.” When the people of Jabesh received the message, they were overjoyed 
1SA.11.10	and said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do with us whatever you wish.”
1SA.11.11	That night Saul divided his men into three groups, and at dawn the next day they rushed into the enemy camp and attacked the Ammonites. By noon they had slaughtered them. The survivors scattered, each man running off by himself.
1SA.11.12	Then the people of Israel said to Samuel, “Where are the people who said that Saul should not be our king? Hand them over to us, and we will kill them!”
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this is the day the 
1SA.11.14	And Samuel said to them, “Let us all go to Gilgal and once more proclaim Saul as our king.” 
1SA.11.15	So they all went to Gilgal, and there at the holy place they proclaimed Saul king. They offered fellowship sacrifices, and Saul and all the people of Israel celebrated the event.
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, “I have done what you asked me to do. I have given you a king to rule you, 
1SA.12.2	and now you have him to lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are with you. I have been your leader from my youth until now. 
1SA.12.3	 Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, accuse me now in the presence of the 
1SA.12.4	The people answered, “No, you have not cheated us or oppressed us; you have not taken anything from anyone.”
1SA.12.5	Samuel replied, “The 
1SA.12.5	“Yes, the 
1SA.12.7	Now stand where you are, and I will accuse you before the 
1SA.12.8	 When Jacob and his family went to Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them,
1SA.12.9	 But the people forgot the 
1SA.12.10	 Then they cried to the 
1SA.12.11	 And the 
1SA.12.12	 But when you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was about to attack you, you rejected the 
1SA.12.13	“Now here is the king you chose; you asked for him, and now the 
1SA.12.14	All will go well with you if you honor the 
1SA.12.15	But if you do not listen to the 
1SA.12.16	So then, stand where you are, and you will see the great thing which the 
1SA.12.17	It's the dry season, isn't it? But I will pray, and the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel prayed, and on that same day the 
1SA.12.19	and they said to Samuel, “Please, sir, pray to the 
1SA.12.20	“Don't be afraid,” Samuel answered. “Even though you have done such an evil thing, do not turn away from the 
1SA.12.21	Don't go after
1SA.12.22	The 
1SA.12.23	As for me, the 
1SA.12.24	Obey the 
1SA.12.25	But if you continue to sin, you and your king will be destroyed.”
1SA.13.2	Saul picked three thousand men, keeping two thousand of them with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel and sending one thousand with his son Jonathan to Gibeah, in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. The rest of the men Saul sent home.
1SA.13.3	Jonathan killed the Philistine commander
1SA.13.4	All the Israelites were told that Saul had killed the Philistine commander and that the Philistines hated them. So the people answered the call to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines assembled to fight the Israelites; they had thirty thousand war chariots, six thousand cavalry troops, and as many soldiers as there are grains of sand on the seashore. They went to Michmash, east of Bethaven, and camped there. 
1SA.13.6	Then they launched a strong attack against the Israelites, putting them in a desperate situation. Some of the Israelites hid in caves and holes or among the rocks or in pits and wells; 
1SA.13.7	others crossed the Jordan River into the territories of Gad and Gilead.
1SA.13.7	Saul was still at Gilgal, and the people with him were trembling with fear. 
1SA.13.8	 He waited seven days for Samuel, as Samuel had instructed him to do, but Samuel still had not come to Gilgal. The people began to desert Saul, 
1SA.13.9	so he said to them, “Bring me the burnt sacrifices and the fellowship sacrifices.” He offered a burnt sacrifice, 
1SA.13.10	and just as he was finishing, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet him and welcome him, 
1SA.13.11	but Samuel said, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul answered, “The people were deserting me, and you had not come when you said you would; besides that, the Philistines are gathering at Michmash. 
1SA.13.12	So I thought, ‘The Philistines are going to attack me here in Gilgal, and I have not tried to win the 
1SA.13.13	“That was a foolish thing to do,” Samuel answered. “You have not obeyed the command the 
1SA.13.14	 But now your rule will not continue. Because you have disobeyed him, the 
1SA.13.15	Samuel left Gilgal and went on his way. The rest of the people followed Saul as he went to join his soldiers. They went from Gilgal
1SA.13.16	Saul, his son Jonathan, and their men camped in Geba in the territory of Benjamin; the Philistine camp was at Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	The Philistine soldiers went out on raids from their camp in three groups: one group went toward Ophrah in the territory of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another went toward Beth Horon, and the other one went to the border overlooking Zeboim Valley and the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	There were no blacksmiths in Israel because the Philistines were determined to keep the Hebrews from making swords and spears. ( 
1SA.13.20	The Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their plows, hoes, axes, and sickles
1SA.13.21	the charge was one small coin for sharpening axes and for fixing goads,
1SA.13.22	And so on the day of battle none of the Israelite soldiers except Saul and his son Jonathan had swords or spears.
1SA.13.23	The Philistines sent a group of soldiers to defend Michmash Pass.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan said to the young man who carried his weapons, “Let's go across to the Philistine camp.” But Jonathan did not tell his father Saul, 
1SA.14.2	who was camping under a pomegranate tree in Migron, not far from Gibeah; he had about six hundred men with him. 
1SA.14.3	(The priest carrying the ephod was Ahijah, the son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub, who was the son of Phinehas and grandson of Eli, the priest of the 
1SA.14.4	In Michmash Pass, which Jonathan had to go through to get over to the Philistine camp, there were two large jagged rocks, one on each side of the pass: one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	One was on the north side of the pass, facing Michmash, and the other was on the south side, facing Geba.
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to the young man, “Let's cross over to the camp of those heathen Philistines. Maybe the 
1SA.14.7	The young man answered, “Whatever you want to do,
1SA.14.8	“All right,” Jonathan said. “We will go across and let the Philistines see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they tell us to wait for them to come to us, then we will stay where we are. 
1SA.14.10	But if they tell us to go to them, then we will, because that will be the sign that the 
1SA.14.11	So they let the Philistines see them, and the Philistines said, “Look! Some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they have been hiding in!” 
1SA.14.12	Then they called out to Jonathan and the young man, “Come on up here! We have something to tell
1SA.14.12	Jonathan said to the young man, “Follow me. The 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan climbed up out of the pass on his hands and knees, and the young man followed him. Jonathan attacked the Philistines and knocked them down, and the young man killed them. 
1SA.14.14	In that first slaughter Jonathan and the young man killed about twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
1SA.14.15	All the Philistines in the countryside were terrified; the raiders and the soldiers in the camp trembled with fear; the earth shook, and there was great panic.
1SA.14.16	Saul's men on watch at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin saw the Philistines running in confusion. 
1SA.14.17	So Saul said to his men, “Count the soldiers and find out who is missing.” They did so and found that Jonathan and the young man who carried his weapons were missing. 
1SA.14.18	“Bring the ephod
1SA.14.19	As Saul was speaking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp kept getting worse, so Saul said to him, “There's no time to consult the 
1SA.14.20	Then he and his men marched into battle against the Philistines, who were fighting each other in complete confusion. 
1SA.14.21	Some Hebrews, who had been on the Philistine side and had gone with them to the camp, changed sides again
1SA.14.22	Others, who had been hiding in the hills of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines were running away, so they also joined in and attacked the Philistines, 
1SA.14.23	fighting all the way beyond Bethaven. The 
1SA.14.24	The Israelites were weak with hunger that day, because Saul, with a solemn oath, had given the order: “A curse be on anyone who eats any food today before I take revenge on my enemies.” So nobody had eaten anything all day. 
1SA.14.25	They all
1SA.14.26	The woods were full of honey, but no one ate any of it because they were all afraid of Saul's curse. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard his father threaten the people with a curse; so he reached out with the stick he was carrying, dipped it in a honeycomb, and ate some honey. At once he felt much better. 
1SA.14.28	But one of the men told him, “We are all weak from hunger, but your father threatened us and said, ‘A curse be on anyone who eats any food today.’”
1SA.14.29	Jonathan answered, “What a terrible thing my father has done to our people! See how much better I feel because I ate some honey! 
1SA.14.30	How much better it would have been today if our people had eaten the food they took when they defeated the enemy. Just think how many more Philistines they would have killed!”
1SA.14.31	That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines, fighting all the way from Michmash to Aijalon. By this time the Israelites were very weak from hunger, 
1SA.14.32	and so they rushed over to what they had captured from the enemy, took sheep and cattle, slaughtered them on the spot, and ate the meat with the blood still in it. 
1SA.14.33	 Saul was told, “Look, the people are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	“You are traitors!” Saul cried out. “Roll a big stone over here
1SA.14.34	Then he gave another order: “Go among the people and tell them all to bring their cattle and sheep here. They are to slaughter them and eat them here; they must not sin against the 
1SA.14.35	Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Saul said to his men, “Let's go down and attack the Philistines in the night, plunder them until dawn, and kill them all.”
1SA.14.36	“Do whatever you think best,” they answered.
1SA.14.36	But the priest said, “Let's consult God first.”
1SA.14.37	So Saul asked God, “Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give us victory?” But God did not answer that day. 
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said to the leaders of the people, “Come here and find out what sin was committed today. 
1SA.14.39	I promise by the living 
1SA.14.40	Then Saul said to them, “All of you stand over there, and Jonathan and I will stand over here.”
1SA.14.40	“Do whatever you think best,” they answered.
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Decide between my son Jonathan and me.” And Jonathan was indicated. 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul asked Jonathan, “What have you done?”
1SA.14.43	Jonathan answered, “I ate a little honey with the stick I was holding. Here I am—I am ready to die.”
1SA.14.44	Saul said to him, “May God strike me dead if you are not put to death!”
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Will Jonathan, who won this great victory for Israel, be put to death? No! We promise by the living 
1SA.14.46	After that, Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they went back to their own territory.
1SA.14.47	After Saul became king of Israel, he fought all his enemies everywhere: the people of Moab, of Ammon, and of Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he fought he was victorious.
1SA.14.48	He fought heroically and defeated even the people of Amalek. He saved the Israelites from all attacks.
1SA.14.49	Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His older daughter was named Merab, and the younger one Michal. 
1SA.14.50	His wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; his army commander was his cousin Abner, the son of his uncle Ner. 
1SA.14.51	Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	As long as he lived, Saul had to fight fiercely against the Philistines. So whenever he found a man who was strong or brave, he would enlist him in his army.
1SA.15.2	 He is going to punish the people of Amalek because their ancestors opposed the Israelites when they were coming from Egypt. 
1SA.15.3	Go and attack the Amalekites and completely destroy everything they have. Don't leave a thing; kill all the men, women, children, and babies; the cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.”
1SA.15.4	Saul called his forces together and inspected them at Telem: there were 200,000 soldiers from Israel and 10,000 from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Then he and his men went to the city of Amalek and waited in ambush in a dry riverbed. 
1SA.15.6	He sent a warning to the Kenites, a people whose ancestors had been kind to the Israelites when they came from Egypt: “Go away and leave the Amalekites, so that I won't kill you along with them.” So the Kenites left.
1SA.15.7	Saul defeated the Amalekites, fighting all the way from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt; 
1SA.15.8	he captured King Agag of Amalek alive and killed all the people. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and his men spared Agag's life and did not kill the best sheep and cattle, the best calves and lambs,
1SA.15.10	The 
1SA.15.11	“I am sorry that I made Saul king; he has turned away from me and disobeyed my commands.” Samuel was angry, and all night long he pleaded with the 
1SA.15.12	Early the following morning he went off to find Saul. He heard that Saul had gone to the town of Carmel, where he had built a monument to himself, and then had gone on to Gilgal. 
1SA.15.13	Samuel went up to Saul, who greeted him, saying, “The 
1SA.15.14	Samuel asked, “Why, then, do I hear cattle mooing and sheep bleating?”
1SA.15.15	Saul answered, “My men took them from the Amalekites. They kept the best sheep and cattle to offer as a sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.16	“Stop,” Samuel ordered, “and I will tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	“Tell me,” Saul said.
1SA.15.17	Samuel answered, “Even though you consider yourself of no importance, you are the leader of the tribes of Israel. The 
1SA.15.18	and he sent you out with orders to destroy those wicked people of Amalek. He told you to fight until you had killed them all. 
1SA.15.19	Why, then, did you not obey him? Why did you rush to grab the loot, and so do what displeases the 
1SA.15.20	“I did obey the 
1SA.15.21	But my men did not kill the best sheep and cattle that they captured; instead, they brought them here to Gilgal to offer as a sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	Samuel said, “Which does the 
1SA.15.23	Rebellion against him is as bad as witchcraft, and arrogance is as sinful as idolatry. Because you rejected the 
1SA.15.24	“Yes, I have sinned,” Saul replied. “I disobeyed the 
1SA.15.25	But now I beg you, forgive my sin and go back with me, so that I can worship the 
1SA.15.26	“I will not go back with you,” Samuel answered. “You rejected the 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	Israel's majestic God does not lie or change his mind. He is not a human being—he does not change his mind.”
1SA.15.30	“I have sinned,” Saul replied. “But at least show me respect in front of the leaders of my people and all of Israel. Go back with me so that I can worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back with him, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	“Bring King Agag here to me,” Samuel ordered. Agag came to him, trembling with fear, thinking to himself, “What a bitter thing it is to die!”
1SA.15.33	Samuel said, “As your sword has made many mothers childless, so now your mother will become childless.” And he cut Agag to pieces in front of the altar in Gilgal.
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, and King Saul went home to Gibeah. 
1SA.15.35	As long as Samuel lived, he never again saw the king; but he grieved over him. The 
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	“How can I do that?” Samuel asked. “If Saul hears about it, he will kill me!”
1SA.16.2	The 
1SA.16.3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell you what to do. You will anoint as king the man I tell you to.”
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	“Yes,” he answered. “I have come to offer a sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they arrived, Samuel saw Jesse's son Eliab and said to himself, “This man standing here in the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called his son Abinadab and brought him to Samuel. But Samuel said, “No, the 
1SA.16.9	Jesse then brought Shammah. “No, the 
1SA.16.10	In this way Jesse brought seven of his sons to Samuel. And Samuel said to him, “No, the 
1SA.16.11	Then he asked him, “Do you have any more sons?”
1SA.16.11	Jesse answered, “There is still the youngest, but he is out taking care of the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	“Tell him to come here,” Samuel said. “We won't offer the sacrifice until he comes.” 
1SA.16.12	So Jesse sent for him. He was a handsome, healthy young man, and his eyes sparkled. The 
1SA.16.13	Samuel took the olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers. Immediately the spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	The 
1SA.16.15	His servants said to him, “We know that an evil spirit sent by God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	So give us the order, sir, and we will look for a man who knows how to play the harp. Then when the evil spirit comes on you, the man can play his harp, and you will be all right again.”
1SA.16.17	Saul ordered them, “Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	One of his attendants said, “Jesse of the town of Bethlehem has a son who is a good musician. He is also a brave and handsome man, a good soldier, and an able speaker. The 
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, “Send me your son David, the one who takes care of the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	Jesse sent David to Saul with a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a leather bag full of wine. 
1SA.16.21	David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much and chose him as the man to carry his weapons. 
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent a message to Jesse: “I like David. Let him stay here in my service.” 
1SA.16.23	From then on, whenever the evil spirit sent by God came on Saul, David would get his harp and play it. The evil spirit would leave, and Saul would feel better and be all right again.
1SA.17.1	The Philistines gathered for battle in Socoh, a town in Judah; they camped at a place called Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in Elah Valley, where they got ready to fight the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines lined up on one hill and the Israelites on another, with a valley between them.
1SA.17.4	A man named Goliath, from the city of Gath, came out from the Philistine camp to challenge the Israelites. He was over nine feet
1SA.17.5	and wore bronze armor that weighed about 125 pounds and a bronze helmet. 
1SA.17.6	His legs were also protected by bronze armor, and he carried a bronze javelin slung over his shoulder. 
1SA.17.7	His spear was as thick as the bar on a weaver's loom, and its iron head weighed about fifteen pounds. A soldier walked in front of him carrying his shield. 
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and shouted at the Israelites, “What are you doing there, lined up for battle? I am a Philistine, you slaves of Saul! Choose one of your men to fight me. 
1SA.17.9	If he wins and kills me, we will be your slaves; but if I win and kill him, you will be our slaves. 
1SA.17.10	Here and now I challenge the Israelite army. I dare you to pick someone to fight me!” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and his men heard this, they were terrified.
1SA.17.12	David was the son of Jesse, who was an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and at the time Saul was king, he was already a very old man.
1SA.17.13	His three oldest sons had gone with Saul to war. The oldest was Eliab, the next was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest son, and while the three oldest brothers stayed with Saul, 
1SA.17.15	David would go back to Bethlehem from time to time, to take care of his father's sheep.
1SA.17.16	Goliath challenged the Israelites every morning and evening for forty days.
1SA.17.17	One day Jesse said to David, “Take a half-bushel of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and hurry with them to your brothers in the camp. 
1SA.17.18	And take these ten cheeses to the commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are getting along and bring back something to show that you saw them and that they are well. 
1SA.17.19	King Saul, your brothers, and all the other Israelites are in Elah Valley fighting the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	David got up early the next morning, left someone else in charge of the sheep, took the food, and went as Jesse had told him to. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelites were going out to their battle line, shouting the war cry. 
1SA.17.21	The Philistine and the Israelite armies took positions for battle, facing each other. 
1SA.17.22	David left the food with the officer in charge of the supplies, ran to the battle line, went to his brothers, and asked how they were getting along. 
1SA.17.23	As he was talking with them, Goliath came forward and challenged the Israelites as he had done before. And David heard him. 
1SA.17.24	When the Israelites saw Goliath, they ran away in terror. 
1SA.17.25	“Look at him!” they said to each other. “Listen to his challenge! King Saul has promised to give a big reward to the man who kills him; the king will also give him his daughter to marry and will not require his father's family to pay taxes.”
1SA.17.26	David asked the men who were near him, “What will the man get who kills this Philistine and frees Israel from this disgrace? After all, who is this heathen Philistine to defy the army of the living God?” 
1SA.17.27	They told him what would be done for the man who killed Goliath.
1SA.17.28	Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard David talking to the men. He became angry with David and said, “What are you doing here? Who is taking care of those sheep of yours out there in the wilderness? You smart aleck, you! You just came to watch the fighting!”
1SA.17.29	“Now what have I done?” David asked. “Can't I even ask a question?” 
1SA.17.30	He turned to another man and asked him the same question, and every time he asked, he got the same answer.
1SA.17.31	Some men heard what David had said, and they told Saul, who sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Your Majesty, no one should be afraid of this Philistine! I will go and fight him.”
1SA.17.33	“No,” answered Saul. “How could you fight him? You're just a boy, and he has been a soldier all his life!”
1SA.17.34	“Your Majesty,” David said, “I take care of my father's sheep. Any time a lion or a bear carries off a lamb, 
1SA.17.35	I go after it, attack it, and rescue the lamb. And if the lion or bear turns on me, I grab it by the throat and beat it to death. 
1SA.17.36	I have killed lions and bears, and I will do the same to this heathen Philistine, who has defied the army of the living God. 
1SA.17.37	The 
1SA.17.37	“All right,” Saul answered. “Go, and the 
1SA.17.38	He gave his own armor to David for him to wear: a bronze helmet, which he put on David's head, and a coat of armor. 
1SA.17.39	David strapped Saul's sword over the armor and tried to walk, but he couldn't, because he wasn't used to wearing them. “I can't fight with all this,” he said to Saul. “I'm not used to it.” So he took it all off. 
1SA.17.40	He took his shepherd's stick and then picked up five smooth stones from the stream and put them in his bag. With his sling ready, he went out to meet Goliath.
1SA.17.41	The Philistine started walking toward David, with his shield bearer walking in front of him. He kept coming closer, 
1SA.17.42	and when he got a good look at David, he was filled with scorn for him because he was just a nice, good-looking boy. 
1SA.17.43	He said to David, “What's that stick for? Do you think I'm a dog?” And he called down curses from his god on David. 
1SA.17.44	“Come on,” he challenged David, “and I will give your body to the birds and animals to eat.”
1SA.17.45	David answered, “You are coming against me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This very day the 
1SA.17.47	and everyone here will see that the 
1SA.17.48	Goliath started walking toward David again, and David ran quickly toward the Philistine battle line to fight him. 
1SA.17.49	He reached into his bag and took out a stone, which he slung at Goliath. It hit him on the forehead and broke his skull, and Goliath fell face downward on the ground. 
1SA.17.50	 And so, without a sword, David defeated and killed Goliath with a sling and a stone! 
1SA.17.51	 He ran to him, stood over him, took Goliath's sword out of its sheath, and cut off his head and killed him.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they ran away. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah shouted and ran after them, pursuing them all the way to Gath
1SA.17.53	When the Israelites came back from pursuing the Philistines, they looted their camp. 
1SA.17.54	David got Goliath's head and took it to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath's weapons in his own tent.
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David going out to fight Goliath, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, “Abner, whose son is he?”
1SA.17.55	“I have no idea, Your Majesty,” Abner answered.
1SA.17.56	“Then go and find out,” Saul ordered.
1SA.17.57	So when David returned to camp after killing Goliath, Abner took him to Saul. David was still carrying Goliath's head. 
1SA.17.58	Saul asked him, “Young man, whose son are you?”
1SA.17.58	“I am the son of your servant Jesse from Bethlehem,” David answered.
1SA.18.1	Saul and David finished their conversation. After that, Saul's son Jonathan was deeply attracted to David and came to love him as much as he loved himself. 
1SA.18.2	Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him go back home. 
1SA.18.3	Jonathan swore eternal friendship with David because of his deep affection for him. 
1SA.18.4	He took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, together with his armor and also his sword, bow, and belt. 
1SA.18.5	David was successful in all the missions on which Saul sent him, and so Saul made him an officer in his army. This pleased all of Saul's officers and men.
1SA.18.6	As David was returning after killing Goliath and as the soldiers were coming back home, women from every town in Israel came out to meet King Saul. They were singing joyful songs, dancing, and playing tambourines and lyres. 
1SA.18.7	 In their celebration the women sang, “Saul has killed thousands, but David tens of thousands.” 
1SA.18.8	Saul did not like this, and he became very angry. He said, “For David they claim tens of thousands, but only thousands for me. They will be making him king next!” 
1SA.18.9	And so he was jealous and suspicious of David from that day on.
1SA.18.10	The next day an evil spirit from God suddenly took control of Saul, and he raved in his house like a madman. David was playing the harp, as he did every day, and Saul was holding a spear. 
1SA.18.11	“I'll pin him to the wall,” Saul said to himself, and he threw the spear at him twice; but David dodged each time.
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David because the 
1SA.18.13	So Saul sent him away and put him in command of a thousand men. David led his men in battle 
1SA.18.14	and was successful in all he did, because the 
1SA.18.15	Saul noticed David's success and became even more afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But everyone in Israel and Judah loved David because he was such a successful leader.
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife on condition that you serve me as a brave and loyal soldier, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	David answered, “Who am I and what is my family that I should become the king's son-in-law?” 
1SA.18.19	But when the time came for Merab to be given to David, she was given instead to a man named Adriel from Meholah.
1SA.18.20	Saul's daughter Michal, however, fell in love with David, and when Saul heard of this, he was pleased. 
1SA.18.21	He said to himself, “I'll give Michal to David; I will use her to trap him, and he will be killed by the Philistines.” So for the second time Saul said to David, “You will be my son-in-law.” 
1SA.18.22	He ordered his officials to speak privately with David and tell him, “The king is pleased with you and all his officials like you; now is a good time for you to marry his daughter.”
1SA.18.23	So they told this to David, and he answered, “It's a great honor to become the king's son-in-law, too great for someone poor and insignificant like me.”
1SA.18.24	The officials told Saul what David had said, 
1SA.18.25	and Saul ordered them to tell David: “All the king wants from you as payment for the bride are the foreskins of a hundred dead Philistines, as revenge on his enemies.” (This was how Saul planned to have David killed by the Philistines.) 
1SA.18.26	Saul's officials reported to David what Saul had said, and David was delighted with the thought of becoming the king's son-in-law. Before the day set for the wedding, 
1SA.18.27	David and his men went and killed two hundred Philistines. He took their foreskins to the king and counted them all out to him, so that he might become his son-in-law. So Saul had to give his daughter Michal in marriage to David.
1SA.18.28	Saul realized clearly that the 
1SA.18.29	So he became even more afraid of David and was his enemy as long as he lived.
1SA.18.30	The Philistine armies would come and fight, but in every battle David was more successful than any of Saul's other officers. As a result David became very famous.
1SA.19.1	Saul told his son Jonathan and all his officials that he planned to kill
1SA.19.2	and so he told him, “My father is trying to kill you. Please be careful tomorrow morning; hide in some secret place and stay there. 
1SA.19.3	I will go and stand by my father in the field where you are hiding, and I will speak to him about you. If I find out anything, I will let you know.”
1SA.19.4	Jonathan praised David to Saul and said, “Sir, don't do wrong to your servant David. He has never done you any wrong; on the contrary, everything he has done has been a great help to you. 
1SA.19.5	He risked his life when he killed Goliath, and the 
1SA.19.6	Saul was convinced by what Jonathan said and made a vow in the 
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan called David and told him everything; then he took him to Saul, and David served the king as he had before.
1SA.19.8	War with the Philistines broke out again. David attacked them and defeated them so thoroughly that they fled.
1SA.19.9	One day an evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear, but David dodged, and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped.
1SA.19.12	She let him down from a window, and he ran away and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then she took the household idol, laid it on the bed, put a pillow made of goats' hair at its head, and put a cover over it. 
1SA.19.14	When Saul's men came to get David, Michal told them that he was sick. 
1SA.19.15	But Saul sent them back to see David for themselves. He ordered them, “Carry him here in his bed, and I will kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	They went inside and found the household idol in the bed and the goats' hair pillow at its head. 
1SA.19.17	Saul asked Michal, “Why have you tricked me like this and let my enemy escape?”
1SA.19.17	She answered, “He said he would kill me if I didn't help him escape.”
1SA.19.18	David escaped and went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
1SA.19.19	Saul was told that David was in Naioth in Ramah, 
1SA.19.20	so he sent some men to arrest him. They saw
1SA.19.21	When Saul heard of this, he sent more messengers, and they also began to dance and shout. He sent messengers the third time, and the same thing happened to them. 
1SA.19.22	Then he himself started out to Ramah. When he came to the large well in Secu, he asked where Samuel and David were and was told that they were at Naioth. 
1SA.19.23	As he was going there, the spirit of God took control of him also, and he danced and shouted all the way to Naioth. 
1SA.19.24	 He took off his clothes and danced and shouted in Samuel's presence, and lay naked all that day and all that night. (This is how the saying originated, “Has even Saul become a prophet?”)
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and went to Jonathan. “What have I done?” he asked. “What crime have I committed? What wrong have I done to your father to make him want to kill me?”
1SA.20.2	Jonathan answered, “God forbid that you should die! My father tells me everything he does, important or not, and he would not hide this from me. It just isn't so!”
1SA.20.3	But David answered,
1SA.20.4	Jonathan said, “I'll do anything you want.”
1SA.20.6	If your father notices that I am not at the table, tell him that I begged your permission to hurry home to Bethlehem, since it's the time for the annual sacrifice there for my whole family. 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘All right,’ I will be safe; but if he becomes angry, you will know that he is determined to harm me. 
1SA.20.8	Please do me this favor, and keep the sacred promise you made to me. But if I'm guilty, kill me yourself! Why take me to your father to be killed?”
1SA.20.9	“Don't even think such a thing!” Jonathan answered. “If I knew for sure that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?”
1SA.20.10	David then asked, “Who will let me know if your father answers you angrily?”
1SA.20.11	“Let's go out to the fields,” Jonathan answered. So they went, 
1SA.20.12	and Jonathan said to David, “May the 
1SA.20.13	If he intends to harm you, may the 
1SA.20.14	And if I remain alive, please keep your sacred promise and be loyal to me; but if I die,
1SA.20.15	 show the same kind of loyalty to my family forever. And when the 
1SA.20.16	may our promise to each other still be unbroken. If it is broken, the 
1SA.20.17	Once again Jonathan made David promise to love him, for Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself. 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Since tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, your absence will be noticed if you aren't at the meal. 
1SA.20.19	The day after tomorrow your absence will be noticed
1SA.20.20	I will then shoot three arrows at it, as though it were a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then I will tell my servant to go and find them. And if I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,’ that means that you are safe and can come out. I swear by the living 
1SA.20.22	But if I tell him, ‘The arrows are on the other side of you,’ then leave, because the 
1SA.20.23	As for the promise we have made to each other, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the fields. At the New Moon Festival, King Saul came to the meal 
1SA.20.25	and sat in his usual place by the wall. Abner sat next to him, and Jonathan sat across the table from him.
1SA.20.26	but Saul said nothing that day, because he thought, “Something has happened to him, and he is not ritually pure.” 
1SA.20.27	On the following day, the day after the New Moon Festival, David's place was still empty, and Saul asked Jonathan, “Why didn't David come to the meal either yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered, “He begged me to let him go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	‘Please let me go,’ he said, ‘because our family is celebrating the sacrificial feast in town, and my brother ordered me to be there. So then, if you are my friend, let me go and see my relatives.’ That is why he isn't in his place at your table.”
1SA.20.30	Saul became furious with Jonathan and said to him, “How rebellious and faithless your mother was! Now I know you are taking sides with David and are disgracing yourself and that mother of yours! 
1SA.20.31	Don't you realize that as long as David is alive, you will never be king of this country? Now go and bring him here—he must die!”
1SA.20.32	“Why should he die?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?”
1SA.20.33	At that, Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him, and Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David. 
1SA.20.34	Jonathan got up from the table in a rage and ate nothing that day—the second day of the New Moon Festival. He was deeply distressed about David, because Saul had insulted him. 
1SA.20.35	The following morning Jonathan went to the fields to meet David, as they had agreed. He took a young boy with him 
1SA.20.36	and said to him, “Run and find the arrows I'm going to shoot.” The boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy reached the place where the arrow had fallen, Jonathan shouted to him, “The arrow is farther on! 
1SA.20.38	Don't just stand there! Hurry up!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master, 
1SA.20.39	not knowing what it all meant; only Jonathan and David knew. 
1SA.20.40	Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him to take them back to town.
1SA.20.41	After the boy had left, David got up from behind the pile of stones,
1SA.20.42	Then Jonathan said to David, “God be with you. The 
1SA.21.2	“I am here on the king's business,” David answered. “He told me not to let anyone know what he sent me to do. As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 
1SA.21.3	Now, then, what supplies do you have? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have.”
1SA.21.4	The priest said, “I don't have any ordinary bread, only sacred bread; you can have it if your men haven't had sexual relations recently.”
1SA.21.5	“Of course they haven't,” answered David. “My men always keep themselves ritually pure even when we go out on an ordinary mission; how much more this time when we are on a special mission!”
1SA.21.6	( 
1SA.21.7	Saul's chief herdsman, Doeg, who was from Edom, happened to be there that day, because he had to fulfill a religious obligation.)
1SA.21.8	David said to Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword you can give me? The king's orders made me leave in such a hurry that I didn't have time to get my sword or any other weapon.”
1SA.21.9	“Give it to me,” David said. “There is not a better sword anywhere!”
1SA.21.10	So David left, fleeing from Saul, and went to King Achish of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	 The king's officials said to Achish, “Isn't this David, the king of his country? This is the man about whom the women sang, as they danced, ‘Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.’”
1SA.21.13	 So whenever David was around them, he pretended to be insane and acted like a madman when they tried to restrain him; he would scribble on the city
1SA.21.14	So Achish said to his officials, “Look! The man is crazy! Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Don't I have enough madmen already? Why bring another one to bother me with his crazy actions right here in my own house?”
1SA.22.2	People who were oppressed or in debt or dissatisfied went to him, about four hundred men in all, and he became their leader.
1SA.22.3	David went on from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I find out what God is going to do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	So David left his parents with the king of Moab, and they stayed there as long as David was hiding out in the cave.
1SA.22.5	Then the prophet Gad came to David and said, “Don't stay here; go at once to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	One day Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under a tamarisk tree on a hill, with his spear in his hand, and all his officers were standing around him. He was told that David and his men had been located, 
1SA.22.7	and he said to his officers, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Do you think that David will give fields and vineyards to all of you, and make you officers in his army? 
1SA.22.8	Is that why you are plotting against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made an alliance with David. No one is concerned about me or tells me that David, one of my own men, is right now looking for a chance to kill me, and that my son has encouraged him!”
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech asked the 
1SA.22.11	So King Saul sent for the priest Ahimelech and all his relatives, who were also priests in Nob, and they came to him. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said to Ahimelech, “Listen, Ahimelech!”
1SA.22.12	“At your service, sir,” he answered.
1SA.22.13	Saul asked him, “Why are you and David plotting against me? Why did you give him some food and a sword, and consult God for him? Now he has turned against me and is waiting for a chance to kill me!”
1SA.22.14	Ahimelech answered, “David is the most faithful officer you have! He is your own son-in-law, captain of
1SA.22.15	Yes, I consulted God for him, and it wasn't the first time.
1SA.22.16	The king said, “Ahimelech, you and all your relatives must die.” 
1SA.22.17	Then he said to the guards standing near him, “Kill the 
1SA.22.18	So Saul said to Doeg, “You kill them!”—and Doeg killed them all. On that day he killed eighty-five priests who were qualified to carry the ephod. 
1SA.22.19	Saul also had all the other inhabitants of Nob, the city of priests, put to death: men and women, children and babies, cattle, donkeys, and sheep—they were all killed.
1SA.22.20	But Abiathar, one of Ahimelech's sons, escaped, and went and joined David. 
1SA.22.21	He told him how Saul had slaughtered the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	David said to him, “When I saw Doeg there that day, I knew that he would be sure to tell Saul. So I am responsible
1SA.22.23	Stay with me and don't be afraid. Saul wants to kill both you and me, but you will be safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	David heard that the Philistines were attacking the town of Keilah and were stealing the newly harvested grain. 
1SA.23.2	So he asked the 
1SA.23.2	“Yes,” the 
1SA.23.3	But David's men said to him, “We have enough to be afraid of here in Judah; it will be much worse if we go to Keilah and attack the Philistine forces!” 
1SA.23.4	So David consulted the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and attacked the Philistines; they killed many of them and took their livestock. And so it was that David saved the town.
1SA.23.6	When Abiathar son of Ahimelech escaped and joined David in Keilah, he took the ephod with him.
1SA.23.7	Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has put him in my power. David has trapped himself by going into a walled town with fortified gates.” 
1SA.23.8	So Saul called his troops to war, to march against Keilah and besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	When David heard that Saul was planning to attack him, he said to the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “
1SA.23.11	Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to Saul? Will Saul really come, as I have heard? 
1SA.23.11	The 
1SA.23.12	“And will the citizens of Keilah hand my men and me over to Saul?” David asked again.
1SA.23.12	“They will,” the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men—about six hundred in all—left Keilah at once and kept on the move. When Saul heard that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up his plan.
1SA.23.14	David stayed in hiding in the hill country, in the wilderness near Ziph. Saul was always trying to find him, but God did not turn David over to him. 
1SA.23.15	David saw that Saul was out to kill him.
1SA.23.15	David was at Horesh, in the wilderness near Ziph. 
1SA.23.16	Jonathan went to him there and encouraged him with assurances of God's protection, 
1SA.23.17	saying to him, “Don't be afraid. My father Saul won't be able to harm you. He knows very well that you are the one who will be the king of Israel and that I will be next in rank to you.” 
1SA.23.18	 The two of them made a sacred promise of friendship to each other. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
1SA.23.20	We know, Your Majesty, how much you want to capture him; so come to our territory, and we will make sure that you catch him.”
1SA.23.21	Saul answered, “May the 
1SA.23.22	Go and make sure once more; find out for certain where he is and who has seen him there. I hear that he is very cunning. 
1SA.23.23	Find out exactly the places where he hides, and be sure to bring back a report to me right away. Then I will go with you, and if he is still in the region, I will hunt him down, even if I have to search the whole land of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	So they left and returned to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in a desolate valley in the southern part of the Judean wilderness. 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his men set out to look for David, but he heard about it and went to a rocky hill in the wilderness of Maon and stayed there. When Saul heard about this, he went after David. 
1SA.23.26	Saul and his men were on one side of the hill, separated from David and his men, who were on the other side. They were hurrying to get away from Saul and his men, who were closing in on them and were about to capture them. 
1SA.23.27	Just then a messenger arrived and said to Saul, “Come back at once! The Philistines are invading the country!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to fight the Philistines. That is why that place is called Separation Hill. 
1SA.23.29	David left and went to the region of Engedi, where he stayed in hiding.
1SA.24.1	When Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, he was told that David was in the wilderness near Engedi. 
1SA.24.2	Saul took three thousand of the best soldiers in Israel and went looking for David and his men east of Wild Goat Rocks. 
1SA.24.3	 He came to a cave close to some sheep pens by the road and went in to relieve himself. It happened to be the very cave in which David and his men were hiding far back in the cave. 
1SA.24.4	They said to him, “This is your chance! The 
1SA.24.5	But then David's conscience began to hurt, 
1SA.24.6	 and he said to his men, “May the 
1SA.24.7	So David convinced his men that they should not attack Saul.
1SA.24.7	Saul got up, left the cave, and started away. 
1SA.24.8	Then David went out after him and called to him, “Your Majesty!” Saul turned around, and David bowed down to the ground in respect 
1SA.24.9	and said, “Why do you listen to people who say that I am trying to harm you? 
1SA.24.10	You can see for yourself that just now in the cave the 
1SA.24.11	Look, my father, look at the piece of your robe I am holding! I could have killed you, but instead I only cut this off. This should convince you that I have no thought of rebelling against you or of harming you. You are hunting me down to kill me, even though I have not done you any wrong. 
1SA.24.12	May the 
1SA.24.13	You know the old saying, ‘Evil is done only by evil people.’ And so I will not harm you. 
1SA.24.14	 Look at what the king of Israel is trying to kill! Look at what he is chasing! A dead dog, a flea! 
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	When David had finished speaking, Saul said, “Is that really you, David my son?” And he started crying. 
1SA.24.17	Then he said to David, “You are right, and I am wrong. You have been so good to me, while I have done such wrong to you! 
1SA.24.18	Today you have shown how good you are to me, because you did not kill me, even though the 
1SA.24.19	How often does someone catch an enemy and then let him get away unharmed? The 
1SA.24.20	Now I am sure that you will be king of Israel and that the kingdom will continue under your rule. 
1SA.24.21	But promise me in the 
1SA.24.22	David promised that he would.
1SA.24.22	Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went back to their hiding place.
1SA.25.1	Samuel died, and all the Israelites came together and mourned for him. Then they buried him at his home in Ramah.
1SA.25.1	After this, David went to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2+1SA.25.3	There was a man of the clan of Caleb named Nabal, who was from the town of Maon, and who owned land near the town of Carmel. He was a very rich man, the owner of three thousand sheep and one thousand goats. His wife Abigail was beautiful and intelligent, but he was a mean, bad-tempered man.
1SA.25.2+1SA.25.3	Nabal was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 
1SA.25.4	and David, who was in the wilderness, heard about it, 
1SA.25.5	so he sent ten young men with orders to go to Carmel, find Nabal, and give him his greetings. 
1SA.25.6	He instructed them to say to Nabal: “David sends you greetings, my friend, with his best wishes for you, your family, and all that is yours. 
1SA.25.7	He heard that you were shearing your sheep, and he wants you to know that your shepherds have been with us and we did not harm them. Nothing that belonged to them was stolen all the time they were at Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Just ask them, and they will tell you. We have come on a feast day, and David asks you to receive us kindly. Please give what you can to us your servants and to your dear friend David.”
1SA.25.9	David's men delivered this message to Nabal in David's name. Then they waited there, 
1SA.25.10	and Nabal finally answered, “David? Who is he? I've never heard of him! The country is full of runaway slaves nowadays! 
1SA.25.11	I'm not going to take my bread and water, and the animals I have butchered for my sheepshearers, and give them to people who come from I don't know where!”
1SA.25.12	David's men went back to him and told him what Nabal had said. 
1SA.25.13	“Buckle on your swords!” he ordered, and they all did. David also buckled on his sword and left with about four hundred of his men, leaving two hundred behind with the supplies.
1SA.25.14	One of Nabal's servants said to Nabal's wife Abigail, “Have you heard? David sent some messengers from the wilderness with greetings for our master, but he insulted them. 
1SA.25.15	Yet they were very good to us; they never bothered us, and all the time we were with them in the fields, nothing that belonged to us was stolen. 
1SA.25.16	They protected us day and night the whole time we were with them looking after our flocks. 
1SA.25.17	Please think this over and decide what to do. This could be disastrous for our master and all his family. He is so mean that he won't listen to anybody!”
1SA.25.18	Abigail quickly gathered two hundred loaves of bread, two leather bags full of wine, five roasted sheep, two bushels of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dried figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 
1SA.25.19	Then she said to the servants, “You go on ahead and I will follow you.” But she said nothing to her husband.
1SA.25.20	She was riding her donkey around a bend on a hillside when suddenly she met David and his men coming toward her. 
1SA.25.21	David had been thinking, “Why did I ever protect that fellow's property out here in the wilderness? Not a thing that belonged to him was stolen, and this is how he pays me back for the help I gave him! 
1SA.25.22	May God strike me
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted and threw herself on the ground 
1SA.25.24	at David's feet, and said to him, “Please, sir, listen to me! Let me take the blame. 
1SA.25.25	Please, don't pay any attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing! He is exactly what his name means—a fool!
1SA.25.26	It is the 
1SA.25.27	Please, sir, accept this present I have brought you, and give it to your men. 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive me, sir, for any wrong I have done. The 
1SA.25.29	If anyone should attack you and try to kill you, the 
1SA.25.30	And when the 
1SA.25.31	then you will not have to feel regret or remorse, sir, for having killed without cause or for having taken your own revenge. And when the 
1SA.25.32	David said to her, “Praise the 
1SA.25.33	Thank God for your good sense and for what you have done today in keeping me from the crime of murder and from taking my own revenge. 
1SA.25.34	The 
1SA.25.35	Then David accepted what she had brought him and said to her, “Go back home and don't worry. I will do what you want.”
1SA.25.36	Abigail went back to Nabal, who was at home having a feast fit for a king. He was drunk and in a good mood, so she did not tell him anything until the next morning. 
1SA.25.37	Then, after he had sobered up, she told him everything. He suffered a stroke and was completely paralyzed. 
1SA.25.38	Some ten days later the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Praise the 
1SA.25.39	Then David sent a proposal of marriage to Abigail. 
1SA.25.40	His servants went to her at Carmel and said to her, “David sent us to take you to him to be his wife.”
1SA.25.41	Abigail bowed down to the ground and said, “I am his servant, ready to wash the feet of his servants.” 
1SA.25.42	She rose quickly and mounted her donkey. Accompanied by her five maids, she went with David's servants and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David had married Ahinoam from Jezreel, and now Abigail also became his wife. 
1SA.25.44	 Meanwhile, Saul had given his daughter Michal, who had been David's wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from the town of Gallim.
1SA.26.2	Saul went at once with three thousand of the best soldiers in Israel to the wilderness of Ziph to look for David, 
1SA.26.3	and camped by the road on Mount Hachilah. David was still in the wilderness, and when he learned that Saul had come to look for him, 
1SA.26.4	he sent spies and found out that Saul was indeed there. 
1SA.26.5	He went at once and located the exact place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, slept. Saul slept inside the camp, and his men camped around him.
1SA.26.6	Then David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai the brother of Joab (their mother was Zeruiah), “Which of you two will go to Saul's camp with me?”
1SA.26.6	“I will,” Abishai answered.
1SA.26.7	So that night David and Abishai entered Saul's camp and found Saul sleeping in the center of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the troops were sleeping around him. 
1SA.26.8	Abishai said to David, “God has put your enemy in your power tonight. Now let me plunge his own spear through him and pin him to the ground with just one blow—I won't have to strike twice!”
1SA.26.9	But David said, “You must not harm him! The 
1SA.26.10	By the living 
1SA.26.11	 The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the water jar from right beside Saul's head, and he and Abishai left. No one saw it or knew what had happened or even woke up—they were all sound asleep, because the 
1SA.26.13	Then David crossed over to the other side of the valley to the top of the hill, a safe distance away, 
1SA.26.14	and shouted to Saul's troops and to Abner, “Abner! Can you hear me?”
1SA.26.14	“Who is that shouting and waking up the king?” Abner asked.
1SA.26.15	David answered, “Abner, aren't you the greatest man in Israel? So why aren't you protecting your master, the king? Just now someone entered the camp to kill your master. 
1SA.26.16	You failed in your duty, Abner! I swear by the living 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognized David's voice and asked, “David, is that you, my son?”
1SA.26.17	“Yes, Your Majesty,” David answered. 
1SA.26.18	And he added, “Why, sir, are you still pursuing me, your servant? What have I done? What crime have I committed? 
1SA.26.19	Your Majesty, listen to what I have to say. If it is the 
1SA.26.20	Don't let me be killed on foreign soil, away from the 
1SA.26.21	Saul answered, “I have done wrong. Come back, David, my son! I will never harm you again, because you have spared my life tonight. I have been a fool! I have done a terrible thing!”
1SA.26.22	David replied, “Here is your spear, Your Majesty. Let one of your men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	Just as I have spared your life today, may the 
1SA.26.25	Saul said to David, “God bless you, my son! You will succeed in everything you do!”
1SA.26.25	So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
1SA.27.1	David said to himself, “One of these days Saul will kill me. The best thing for me to do is to escape to Philistia. Then Saul will give up looking for me in Israel, and I will be safe.” 
1SA.27.2	So David and his six hundred men went over at once to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David and his men settled there in Gath with their families. David had his two wives with him, Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel. 
1SA.27.4	When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he gave up trying to find him.
1SA.27.5	David said to Achish, “If you are my friend, let me have a small town to live in. There is no need, sir, for me to live with you in the capital city.” 
1SA.27.6	So Achish gave him the town of Ziklag, and for this reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
1SA.27.7	David lived in Philistia for sixteen months.
1SA.27.8	During that time David and his men would attack the people of Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek, who had been living in the region a very long time. He would raid their land as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt, 
1SA.27.9	killing all the men and women and taking the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and even the clothes. Then he would come back to Achish, 
1SA.27.10	who would ask him, “Where did you go on a raid this time?” and David would tell him that he had gone to the southern part of Judah or to the territory of the clan of Jerahmeel or to the territory where the Kenites lived. 
1SA.27.11	David would kill everyone, men and women, so that no one could go back to Gath and report what he and his men had really done. This is what David did the whole time he lived in Philistia. 
1SA.27.12	But Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He is hated so much by his own people the Israelites that he will have to serve me all his life.”
1SA.28.1	Some time later the Philistines gathered their troops to fight Israel, and Achish said to David, “Of course you understand that you and your men are to fight on my side.”
1SA.28.2	“Of course,” David answered. “I am your servant, and you will see for yourself what I can do.”
1SA.28.2	Achish said, “Good! I will make you my permanent bodyguard.”
1SA.28.4	The Philistine troops assembled and camped near the town of Shunem; Saul gathered the Israelites and camped at Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified, 
1SA.28.6	 and so he asked the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul ordered his officials, “Find me a woman who is a medium, and I will go and consult her.”
1SA.28.7	“There is one in Endor,” they answered.
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself; he put on different clothes, and after dark he went with two of his men to see the woman. “Consult the spirits for me and tell me what is going to happen,” he said to her. “Call up the spirit of the man I name.”
1SA.28.9	The woman answered, “Surely you know what King Saul has done, how he forced the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel.
1SA.28.10	Then Saul made a sacred vow. “By the living 
1SA.28.11	“Samuel,” he answered.
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and said to Saul, “Why have you tricked me? You are King Saul!”
1SA.28.13	“Don't be afraid!” the king said to her. “What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	“I see a spirit coming up from the earth,” she answered.
1SA.28.14	“What does it look like?” he asked.
1SA.28.14	“It's an old man coming up,” she answered. “He is wearing a cloak.”
1SA.28.14	Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed to the ground in respect.
1SA.28.15	Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me? Why did you make me come back?”
1SA.28.15	Saul answered, “I am in great trouble! The Philistines are at war with me, and God has abandoned me. He doesn't answer me any more, either by prophets or by dreams. And so I have called you, for you to tell me what I must do.”
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “Why do you call me when the 
1SA.28.17	 The 
1SA.28.18	 You disobeyed the 
1SA.28.19	He will give you and Israel over to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will join me, and the 
1SA.28.20	At once Saul fell down and lay stretched out on the ground, terrified by what Samuel had said. He was weak, because he had not eaten anything all day and all night. 
1SA.28.21	The woman went over to him and saw that he was terrified, so she said to him, “Please, sir, I risked my life by doing what you asked. 
1SA.28.22	Now please do what I ask. Let me fix you some food. You must eat so that you will be strong enough to travel.”
1SA.28.23	Saul refused and said he would not eat anything. But his officers also urged him to eat. He finally gave in, got up from the ground, and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	The woman quickly killed a calf which she had been fattening. Then she took some flour, prepared it, and baked some bread without yeast. 
1SA.28.25	She set the food before Saul and his officers, and they ate it. And they left that same night.
1SA.29.1	The Philistines brought all their troops together at Aphek, while the Israelites camped at the spring in Jezreel Valley. 
1SA.29.2	The five Philistine kings marched out with their units of a hundred and of a thousand men; David and his men marched in the rear with King Achish. 
1SA.29.3	The Philistine commanders saw them and asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”
1SA.29.3	Achish answered, “This is David, an official of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me for quite some time now. He has done nothing I can find fault with since the day he came over to me.”
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said to him, “Send that fellow back to the town you gave him. Don't let him go into battle with us; he might turn against us during the fighting. What better way is there for him to win back his master's favor than by the death of our men? 
1SA.29.5	 After all, this is David, the one about whom the women sang, as they danced, ‘Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.’”
1SA.29.6	Achish called David and said to him, “I swear by the living God of Israel that you have been loyal to me; and I would be pleased to have you go with me and fight in this battle. I have not found any fault in you from the day you came over to me. But the other kings don't approve of you. 
1SA.29.7	So go back home in peace, and don't do anything that would displease them.”
1SA.29.8	David answered, “What have I done wrong, sir? If, as you say, you haven't found any fault in me since the day I started serving you, why shouldn't I go with you, my master and king, and fight your enemies?”
1SA.29.9	“I agree,” Achish replied. “I consider you as loyal as an angel of God. But the other kings have said that you can't go with us into battle. 
1SA.29.10	So then, David, tomorrow morning all of you who left Saul and came over to me will have to get up early and leave as soon as it's light.”
1SA.29.11	So David and his men started out early the following morning to go back to Philistia, and the Philistines went on to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	Two days later David and his men arrived back at Ziklag. The Amalekites had raided southern Judah and attacked Ziklag. They had burned down the town 
1SA.30.2	and captured all the women; they had not killed anyone, but had taken everyone with them when they left. 
1SA.30.3	When David and his men arrived, they found that the town had been burned down and that their wives, sons, and daughters had been carried away. 
1SA.30.4	David and his men started crying and did not stop until they were completely exhausted. 
1SA.30.5	 Even David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken away.
1SA.30.6	David was now in great trouble, because his men were all very bitter about losing their children, and they were threatening to stone him; but the 
1SA.30.7	 David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod,” and Abiathar brought it to him. 
1SA.30.8	David asked the 
1SA.30.8	He answered, “Go after them; you will catch them and rescue the captives.”
1SA.30.9	So David and his six hundred men started out, and when they arrived at Besor Brook, some of them stayed there. 
1SA.30.10	David continued on his way with four hundred men; the other two hundred men were too tired to cross the brook and so stayed behind. 
1SA.30.11	The men with David found a young Egyptian out in the country and brought him to David. They gave him some food and water, 
1SA.30.12	some dried figs, and two bunches of raisins. After he had eaten, his strength returned; he had not had anything to eat or drink for three full days. 
1SA.30.13	David asked him, “Who is your master, and where are you from?”
1SA.30.13	“I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite,” he answered. “My master left me behind three days ago because I got sick. 
1SA.30.14	We had raided the territory of the Cherethites in the southern part of Judah and the territory of the clan of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	“Will you lead me to those raiders?” David asked him.
1SA.30.15	He answered, “I will if you promise me in God's name that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master.” 
1SA.30.16	And he led David to them.
1SA.30.16	The raiders were scattered all over the place, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the enormous amount of loot they had captured from Philistia and Judah. 
1SA.30.17	At dawn the next day David attacked them and fought until evening. Except for four hundred young men who mounted camels and got away, none of them escaped. 
1SA.30.18	David rescued everyone and everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives; 
1SA.30.19	nothing at all was missing. David got back all his men's sons and daughters, and all the loot the Amalekites had taken. 
1SA.30.20	He also recovered all the flocks and herds; his men drove all the livestock in front of them
1SA.30.21	Then David went back to the two hundred men who had been too weak to go with him and had stayed behind at Besor Brook. They came forward to meet David and his men, and David went up to them and greeted them warmly. 
1SA.30.22	But some mean and worthless men who had gone with David said, “They didn't go with us, and so we won't give them any of the loot. They can take their wives and children and go away.”
1SA.30.23	But David answered, “My brothers, you can't do this with what the 
1SA.30.24	No one can agree with what you say! All must share alike: whoever stays behind with the supplies gets the same share as the one who goes into battle.” 
1SA.30.25	David made this a rule, and it has been followed in Israel ever since.
1SA.30.26	When David returned to Ziklag, he sent part of the loot to his friends, the leaders of Judah, with the message, “Here is a present for you from the loot we took from the 
1SA.30.27	He sent it to the people in Bethel, to the people in Ramah in the southern part of Judah, and to the people in the towns of Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	and Racal; to the clan of Jerahmeel, to the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	and to the people in the towns of Hormah, Borashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	and Hebron. He sent it to all the places where he and his men had roamed.
1SA.31.1	The Philistines fought a battle against the Israelites on Mount Gilboa. Many Israelites were killed there, and the rest of them, including King Saul and his sons, fled. 
1SA.31.2	But the Philistines caught up with them and killed three of Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
1SA.31.3	The fighting was heavy around Saul, and he himself was hit by enemy arrows and badly wounded. 
1SA.31.4	He said to the young man carrying his weapons, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that these godless Philistines won't gloat over me and kill me.” But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it. 
1SA.31.5	The young man saw that Saul was dead, so he too threw himself on his own sword and died with Saul. 
1SA.31.6	And that is how Saul, his three sons, and the young man died; all of Saul's men died that day. 
1SA.31.7	When the Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and east of the Jordan River heard that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had been killed, they abandoned their towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied the towns.
1SA.31.8	The day after the battle the Philistines went to plunder the corpses, and they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons lying on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off Saul's head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers with them throughout Philistia to tell the good news to their idols and to their people. 
1SA.31.10	Then they put his weapons in the temple of the goddess Astarte, and they nailed his body to the wall of the city of Beth Shan.
1SA.31.11	When the people of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	the bravest men started out and marched all night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall, brought them back to Jabesh, and burned them there. 
1SA.31.13	Then they took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in town, and fasted for seven days.
2SA.1.1	After Saul's death David came back from his victory over the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag for two days. 
2SA.1.2	The next day a young man arrived from Saul's camp. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head. He went to David and bowed to the ground in respect. 
2SA.1.3	David asked him, “Where have you come from?”
2SA.1.3	“I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he answered.
2SA.1.4	“Tell me what happened,” David said.
2SA.1.4	“Our army ran away from the battle,” he replied, “and many of our men were killed. Saul and his son Jonathan were also killed.”
2SA.1.5	“How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?” David asked him.
2SA.1.7	Then he turned around, saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Yes, sir!’ 
2SA.1.8	He asked who I was, and I told him that I was an Amalekite. 
2SA.1.9	Then he said, ‘Come here and kill me! I have been badly wounded, and I'm about to die.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I went up to him and killed him, because I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them to you, sir.”
2SA.1.11	David tore his clothes in sorrow, and all his men did the same. 
2SA.1.12	They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of the 
2SA.1.13	David asked the young man who had brought him the news, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	He answered, “I'm an Amalekite, but I live in your country.”
2SA.1.14	David asked him, “How is it that you dared kill the 
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of his men and said, “Kill him!” The man struck the Amalekite and mortally wounded him, 
2SA.1.16	and David said to the Amalekite, “You brought this on yourself. You condemned yourself when you confessed that you killed the one whom the 
2SA.1.17	David sang this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	 and ordered it
2SA.1.19	“On the hills of Israel our leaders are dead!
2SA.1.19	The bravest of our soldiers have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Do not announce it in Gath
2SA.1.20	or in the streets of Ashkelon.
2SA.1.20	Do not make the women of Philistia glad;
2SA.1.20	do not let the daughters of pagans rejoice.
2SA.1.21	“May no rain or dew fall on Gilboa's hills;
2SA.1.21	may its fields be always barren!
2SA.1.21	For the shields of the brave lie there in disgrace;
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil.
2SA.1.22	Jonathan's bow was deadly,
2SA.1.22	the sword of Saul was merciless,
2SA.1.22	striking down the mighty, killing the enemy.
2SA.1.23	“Saul and Jonathan, so wonderful and dear;
2SA.1.23	together in life, together in death;
2SA.1.23	swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	“Women of Israel, mourn for Saul!
2SA.1.24	He clothed you in rich scarlet dresses
2SA.1.24	and adorned you with jewels and gold.
2SA.1.25	“The brave soldiers have fallen,
2SA.1.25	they were killed in battle.
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies dead in the hills.
2SA.1.26	“I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan;
2SA.1.26	how dear you were to me!
2SA.1.26	How wonderful was your love for me,
2SA.1.26	better even than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	“The brave soldiers have fallen,
2SA.1.27	their weapons abandoned and useless.”
2SA.2.1	After this, David asked the 
2SA.2.1	“Yes,” the 
2SA.2.1	“Which one?” David asked.
2SA.2.1	“Hebron,” the 
2SA.2.2	 So David went to Hebron, taking with him his two wives: Ahinoam, who was from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal's widow, who was from Carmel. 
2SA.2.3	He also took his men and their families, and they settled in the towns around Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	 Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and anointed David as king of Judah.
2SA.2.4	When David heard that the people of Jabesh in Gilead had buried Saul, 
2SA.2.5	he sent some men there with the message: “May the 
2SA.2.6	And now may the 
2SA.2.7	Be strong and brave! Saul your king is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me as their king.”
2SA.2.8	The commander of Saul's army, Abner son of Ner, had fled with Saul's son Ishbosheth across the Jordan to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.9	There Abner made Ishbosheth king of the territories of Gilead, Asher,
2SA.2.10	He was forty years old when he was made king of Israel, and he ruled for two years.
2SA.2.10	But the tribe of Judah was loyal to David, 
2SA.2.11	and he ruled in Hebron over Judah for seven and a half years.
2SA.2.12	Abner and the officials of Ishbosheth went from Mahanaim to the city of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, and David's other officials met them at the pool, where they all sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the opposite side. 
2SA.2.14	Abner said to Joab, “Let's have some of the young men from each side fight an armed contest.”
2SA.2.14	“All right,” Joab answered.
2SA.2.15	So twelve men, representing Ishbosheth and the tribe of Benjamin, fought twelve of David's men. 
2SA.2.16	Each man caught his opponent by the head and plunged his sword into his opponent's side, so that all twenty-four of them fell down dead together. And so that place in Gibeon is called “Field of Swords.”
2SA.2.17	Then a furious battle broke out, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men. 
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel, who could run as fast as a wild deer, 
2SA.2.19	started chasing Abner, running straight for him. 
2SA.2.20	Abner looked back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	“Yes,” he answered.
2SA.2.21	“Stop chasing me!” Abner said. “Run after one of the soldiers and take what he has.” But Asahel kept on chasing him. 
2SA.2.22	Once more Abner said to him, “Stop chasing me! Why force me to kill you? How could I face your brother Joab?” 
2SA.2.23	But Asahel would not quit; so Abner, with a backward thrust
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai started out after Abner, and at sunset they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	The men from the tribe of Benjamin gathered around Abner again and took their stand on the top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Abner called out to Joab, “Do we have to go on fighting forever? Can't you see that in the end there will be nothing but bitterness? We are your relatives. How long will it be before you order your men to stop chasing us?”
2SA.2.27	“I swear by the living God,” Joab answered, “that if you had not spoken, my men would have kept on chasing you until tomorrow morning.” 
2SA.2.28	Then Joab blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to stop pursuing the Israelites; and so the fighting stopped.
2SA.2.29	Abner and his men marched through the Jordan Valley all that night; they crossed the Jordan River, and after marching all the next morning, they arrived back at Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	When Joab gave up the chase, he gathered all his men and found that nineteen of them were missing, in addition to Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	David's men had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin. 
2SA.2.32	Joab and his men took Asahel's body and buried it in the family tomb at Bethlehem. Then they marched all night and at dawn arrived back at Hebron.
2SA.3.1	The fighting between the forces supporting Saul's family and those supporting David went on for a long time. As David became stronger and stronger, his opponents became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	The following six sons, in order of their birth, were born to David at Hebron: Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam, from Jezreel; 
2SA.3.3	Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel; Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith; Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital; 
2SA.3.5	Ithream, whose mother was Eglah. All of these sons were born in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	As the fighting continued between David's forces and the forces loyal to Saul's family, Abner became more and more powerful among Saul's followers.
2SA.3.7	One day Ishbosheth son of Saul accused Abner of sleeping with Saul's concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. 
2SA.3.8	This made Abner furious. “Do you think that I would betray Saul? Do you really think I'm serving Judah?” he exclaimed. “From the very first I have been loyal to the cause of your father Saul, his brothers, and his friends, and I have kept you from being defeated by David; yet today you find fault with me about a woman! 
2SA.3.9+2SA.3.10	 The 
2SA.3.11	Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he could not say a word.
2SA.3.12	Abner sent messengers to David, who at that time was at Hebron,
2SA.3.13	“Good!” David answered. “I will make an agreement with you on one condition: you must bring Saul's daughter Michal to me when you come to see me.” 
2SA.3.14	 And David also sent messengers to Ishbosheth to say, “Give me back my wife Michal. I paid a hundred Philistine foreskins in order to marry her.” 
2SA.3.15	So Ishbosheth had her taken from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	Paltiel followed her all the way to the town of Bahurim, crying as he went. But when Abner said, “Go back home,” he did.
2SA.3.17	Abner went to the leaders of Israel and said to them, “For a long time you have wanted David to be your king. 
2SA.3.18	Now here is your chance. Remember that the 
2SA.3.19	Abner spoke also to the people of the tribe of Benjamin and then went to Hebron to tell David what the people of Benjamin and of Israel had agreed to do.
2SA.3.20	When Abner came to David at Hebron with twenty men, David gave a feast for them. 
2SA.3.21	Abner told David, “I will go now and win all Israel over to Your Majesty. They will accept you as king, and then you will get what you have wanted and will rule over the whole land.” David gave Abner a guarantee of safety and sent him on his way.
2SA.3.22	Later on Joab and David's other officials returned from a raid, bringing a large amount of loot with them. Abner, however, was no longer there at Hebron with David, because David had sent him away with a guarantee of safety. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and his men arrived, he was told that Abner had come to King David and had been sent away with a guarantee of safety. 
2SA.3.24	So Joab went to the king and said to him, “What have you done? Abner came to you—why did you let him go like that? 
2SA.3.25	He came here to deceive you and to find out everything you do and everywhere you go. Surely you know that!”
2SA.3.26	After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from Sirah Well; but David knew nothing about it. 
2SA.3.27	When Abner arrived in Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. And so Abner was murdered because he had killed Joab's brother Asahel. 
2SA.3.28	When David heard the news, he said, “The 
2SA.3.29	May the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a woman's work or is killed in battle or doesn't have enough to eat!” 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge on Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	Then David ordered Joab and his men to tear their clothes, wear sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And at the funeral King David himself walked behind the coffin. 
2SA.3.32	Abner was buried at Hebron, and the king wept aloud at the grave, and so did all the people. 
2SA.3.33	David sang this lament for Abner:
2SA.3.33	“Why did Abner have to die like a fool?
2SA.3.34	His hands were not tied,
2SA.3.34	And his feet were not bound;
2SA.3.34	He died like someone killed by criminals!”
2SA.3.34	And the people wept for him again.
2SA.3.35	All day long the people tried to get David to eat something, but he made a solemn promise, “May God strike me dead if I eat anything before the day is over!” 
2SA.3.36	They took note of this and were pleased. Indeed, everything the king did pleased the people. 
2SA.3.37	All of David's people and all the people in Israel understood that the king had no part in the murder of Abner. 
2SA.3.38	The king said to his officials, “Don't you realize that this day a great leader in Israel has died? 
2SA.3.39	Even though I am the king chosen by God, I feel weak today. These sons of Zeruiah are too violent for me. May the 
2SA.4.1	When Saul's son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed in Hebron, he was afraid, and all the people of Israel were alarmed. 
2SA.4.2	Ishbosheth had two officers who were leaders of raiding parties, Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon, from Beeroth in the tribe of Benjamin. (Beeroth is counted as part of Benjamin. 
2SA.4.3	Its original inhabitants had fled to Gittaim, where they have lived ever since.)
2SA.4.5	Rechab and Baanah set out for Ishbosheth's house and arrived there about noon, while he was taking his midday rest. 
2SA.4.6	The woman at the door had become drowsy while she was sifting wheat and had fallen asleep, so Rechab and Baanah slipped in.
2SA.4.7	Once inside, they went to Ishbosheth's bedroom, where he was sound asleep, and killed him. Then they cut off his head, took it with them, and walked all night through the Jordan Valley. 
2SA.4.8	They presented the head to King David at Hebron and said to him, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul, who tried to kill you. Today the 
2SA.4.9	David answered them, “I take a vow by the living 
2SA.4.10	 The messenger who came to me at Ziklag and told me of Saul's death thought he was bringing good news. I seized him and had him put to death. That was the reward I gave him for his good news! 
2SA.4.11	How much worse it will be for evil men who murder an innocent man asleep in his own house! I will now take revenge on you for murdering him and will wipe you off the face of the earth!” 
2SA.4.12	David gave the order, and his soldiers killed Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet, which they hung up near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb there at Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and said to him, “We are your own flesh and blood. 
2SA.5.2	In the past, even when Saul was still our king, you led the people of Israel in battle, and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the leaders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them, they anointed him, and he became king of Israel. 
2SA.5.4	 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he ruled for forty years. 
2SA.5.5	He ruled in Hebron over Judah for seven and a half years, and in Jerusalem over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.
2SA.5.7	But David did capture their fortress of Zion, and it became known as “David's City.”)
2SA.5.8	That day David said to his men, “Does anybody here hate the Jebusites as much as I do? Enough to kill them? Then go up through the water tunnel and attack those poor blind cripples.” (That is why it is said, “The blind and the crippled cannot enter the 
2SA.5.9	After capturing the fortress, David lived in it and named it “David's City.” He built the city around it, starting at the place where land was filled in on the east side of the hill. 
2SA.5.10	He grew stronger all the time, because the 
2SA.5.11	King Hiram of Tyre sent a trade mission to David; he provided him with cedar logs and with carpenters and stone masons to build a palace. 
2SA.5.12	And so David realized that the 
2SA.5.13	After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David took more concubines and wives, and had more sons and daughters. 
2SA.5.14	The following children were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	The Philistines were told that David had been made king of Israel, so their army set out to capture him. When David heard of it, he went down to a fortified place. 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines arrived at Rephaim Valley and occupied it. 
2SA.5.19	David asked the 
2SA.5.19	“Yes, attack!” the 
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal Perazim and there he defeated the Philistines. He said, “The 
2SA.5.21	When the Philistines fled, they left their idols behind, and David and his men carried them away.
2SA.5.22	Then the Philistines went back to Rephaim Valley and occupied it again. 
2SA.5.23	Once more David consulted the 
2SA.5.24	When you hear the sound of marching in the treetops, then attack because I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.” 
2SA.5.25	David did what the 
2SA.6.1	Once more David called together the best soldiers in Israel, a total of thirty thousand men, 
2SA.6.2	 and led them to Baalah
2SA.6.3	 They took it from Abinadab's home on the hill and placed it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart, 
2SA.6.4	with Ahio walking in front. 
2SA.6.5	David and all the Israelites were dancing and singing with all their might
2SA.6.6	As they came to the threshing place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Covenant Box. 
2SA.6.7	At once the 
2SA.6.8	and so that place has been called Perez Uzzah
2SA.6.9	Then David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem; instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath. 
2SA.6.11	 It stayed there three months, and the 
2SA.6.12	King David heard that because of the Covenant Box the 
2SA.6.13	After the men carrying the Covenant Box had gone six steps, David had them stop while he offered the 
2SA.6.14	David, wearing only a linen cloth around his waist, danced with all his might to honor the 
2SA.6.15	And so he and all the Israelites took the Covenant Box up to Jerusalem with shouts of joy and the sound of trumpets.
2SA.6.16	As the Box was being brought into the city, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and jumping around in the sacred dance, and she was disgusted with him. 
2SA.6.17	They brought the Box and put it in its place in the Tent that David had set up for it. Then he offered sacrifices and fellowship offerings to the 
2SA.6.18	When he had finished offering the sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	 and distributed food to them all. He gave each man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a piece of roasted meat,
2SA.6.20	Afterward, when David went home to greet his family, Michal came out to meet him. “The king of Israel made a big name for himself today!” she said. “He exposed himself like a fool in the sight of the servant women of his officials!”
2SA.6.21	David answered, “I was dancing to honor the 
2SA.6.22	and will disgrace myself even more. You
2SA.6.23	Michal, Saul's daughter, never had any children.
2SA.7.1	King David was settled in his palace, and the 
2SA.7.2	Then the king said to the prophet Nathan, “Here I am living in a house built of cedar, but God's Covenant Box is kept in a tent!”
2SA.7.3	Nathan answered, “Do whatever you have in mind, because the 
2SA.7.4	But that night the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David that I say to him, ‘You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in. 
2SA.7.6	From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now, I have never lived in a temple; I have traveled around living in a tent. 
2SA.7.7	In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders
2SA.7.8	“So tell my servant David that I, the 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have defeated all your enemies as you advanced. I will make you as famous as the greatest leaders in the world. 
2SA.7.10+2SA.7.11	I have chosen a place for my people Israel and have settled them there, where they will live without being oppressed any more. Ever since they entered this land, they have been attacked by violent people, but this will not happen again. I promise to keep you safe from all your enemies and to give you descendants. 
2SA.7.12	 When you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will make one of your sons king and will keep his kingdom strong. 
2SA.7.13	He will be the one to build a temple for me, and I will make sure that his dynasty continues forever. 
2SA.7.14	 I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him as a father punishes his son. 
2SA.7.15	But I will not withdraw my support from him as I did from Saul, whom I removed so that you could be king. 
2SA.7.16	 You will always have descendants, and I will make your kingdom last forever. Your dynasty will never end.’”
2SA.7.17	Nathan told David everything that God had revealed to him.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went into the Tent of the 
2SA.7.19	Yet now you are doing even more, Sovereign 
2SA.7.20	What more can I say to you! You know me, your servant. 
2SA.7.21	It was your will and purpose to do this; you have done all these great things in order to instruct me. 
2SA.7.22	How great you are, Sovereign 
2SA.7.23	 There is no other nation on earth like Israel, whom you rescued from slavery to make them your own people. The great and wonderful things you did for them
2SA.7.24	You have made Israel your own people forever, and you, 
2SA.7.25	“And now, 
2SA.7.26	Your fame will be great, and people will forever say, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	 Almighty, God of Israel! I have the courage to pray this prayer to you, because you have revealed all this to me, your servant, and have told me that you will make my descendants kings.
2SA.7.28	“And now, Sovereign 
2SA.7.29	I ask you to bless my descendants so that they will continue to enjoy your favor. You, Sovereign 
2SA.8.1	Some time later King David attacked the Philistines again, defeated them, and ended their control over the land.
2SA.8.2	Then he defeated the Moabites. He made the prisoners lie down on the ground and put two out of every three of them to death. So the Moabites became his subjects and paid taxes to him.
2SA.8.3	Then he defeated the king of the Syrian state of Zobah, Hadadezer son of Rehob, as Hadadezer was on his way to restore his control over the territory by the upper Euphrates River. 
2SA.8.4	David captured seventeen hundred of his cavalry and twenty thousand of his foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled all the rest.
2SA.8.5	When the Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer, David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men. 
2SA.8.6	Then he set up military camps in
2SA.8.7	David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	He also took a great quantity of bronze from Betah and Berothai, cities ruled by Hadadezer.
2SA.8.9	King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated all of Hadadezer's army. 
2SA.8.10	So he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for his victory over Hadadezer, against whom Toi had fought many times. Joram took David presents made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
2SA.8.11	King David dedicated them for use in worship, along with the silver and gold he took from the nations he had conquered— 
2SA.8.12	Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek—as well as part of the loot he had taken from Hadadezer.
2SA.8.14	He set up military camps
2SA.8.15	David ruled over all of Israel and made sure that his people were always treated fairly and justly. 
2SA.8.16	Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, was the commander of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was the court secretary; 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of
2SA.9.2	There was a servant of Saul's family named Ziba, and he was told to go to David. “Are you Ziba?” the king asked.
2SA.9.2	“At your service, sir,” he answered.
2SA.9.3	Ziba answered, “There is still one of Jonathan's sons. He is crippled.”
2SA.9.4	“Where is he?” the king asked.
2SA.9.4	“At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar,” Ziba answered. 
2SA.9.5	So King David sent for him.
2SA.9.6	When Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, arrived, he bowed down before David in respect. David said, “Mephibosheth,” and he answered, “At your service, sir.”
2SA.9.7	“Don't be afraid,” David replied. “I will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always be welcome at my table.”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth bowed again and said, “I am no better than a dead dog, sir! Why should you be so good to me?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said, “I am giving Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for your master Saul's family and bring in the harvest, to provide food for them. But Mephibosheth himself will always be a guest at my table.” (Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
2SA.9.11	Ziba answered, “I will do everything Your Majesty commands.”
2SA.9.11	So Mephibosheth ate at the king's
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. All the members of Ziba's family became servants of Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, lived in Jerusalem, eating all his meals at the king's table.
2SA.10.1	Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
2SA.10.2	King David said, “I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy.
2SA.10.2	When they arrived in Ammon, 
2SA.10.3	the Ammonite leaders said to the king, “Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the city, so that he can conquer us!”
2SA.10.4	Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off one side of their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard about what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again.
2SA.10.6	The Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they hired twenty thousand Syrian soldiers from Bethrehob and Zobah, twelve thousand men from Tob, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men. 
2SA.10.7	David heard of it and sent Joab against them with the whole army. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, while the others, both the Syrians and the men from Tob and Maacah, took up their position in the open countryside.
2SA.10.9	Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians. 
2SA.10.10	He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	Joab said to him, “If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the 
2SA.10.13	Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, and so they called all their troops together. 
2SA.10.16	King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians who were on the east side of the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
2SA.10.17	When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and marched to Helam, where the Syrians took up their position facing him. The fighting began, 
2SA.10.18	and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry, and they wounded Shobach, the enemy commander, who died on the battlefield. 
2SA.10.19	When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, they made peace with them and became their subjects. And the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.
2SA.11.2	One day, late in the afternoon, David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof. As he walked around up there, he saw a woman taking a bath in her house. She was very beautiful. 
2SA.11.3	So he sent a messenger to find out who she was, and learned that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite. 
2SA.11.4	David sent messengers to get her; they brought her to him and he made love to her. (She had just finished her monthly ritual of purification.) Then she went back home. 
2SA.11.5	Afterward she discovered that she was pregnant and sent a message to David to tell him.
2SA.11.6	David then sent a message to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah arrived, David asked him if Joab and the troops were well, and how the fighting was going. 
2SA.11.8	Then he said to Uriah, “Go on home and rest a while.” Uriah left, and David had a present sent to his home. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah did not go home; instead he slept at the palace gate with the king's guards. 
2SA.11.10	When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he asked him, “You have just returned after a long absence; why didn't you go home?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah answered, “The men of Israel and Judah are away in battle, and the Covenant Box is with them; my commander Joab and his officers are camping out in the open. How could I go home, eat and drink, and sleep with my wife? By all that's sacred, I swear that I could never do such a thing!”
2SA.11.12	So David said, “Then stay here the rest of the day, and tomorrow I'll send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	David invited him to supper and got him drunk. But again that night Uriah did not go home; instead he slept on his blanket
2SA.11.14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	He wrote: “Put Uriah in the front line, where the fighting is heaviest, then retreat and let him be killed.” 
2SA.11.16	So while Joab was besieging the city, he sent Uriah to a place where he knew the enemy was strong. 
2SA.11.17	The enemy troops came out of the city and fought Joab's forces; some of David's officers were killed, and so was Uriah.
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent a report to David telling him about the battle, 
2SA.11.19	and he instructed the messenger, “After you have told the king all about the battle, 
2SA.11.20	he may get angry and ask you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight them? Didn't you realize that they would shoot arrows from the walls? 
2SA.11.21	 Don't you remember how Abimelech son of Gideon was killed? It was at Thebez, where a woman threw a millstone down from the wall and killed him. Why, then, did you go so near the wall?’ If the king asks you this, tell him, ‘Your officer Uriah was also killed.’”
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went to David and told him what Joab had commanded him to say. 
2SA.11.23	He said, “Our enemies were stronger than we were and came out of the city to fight us in the open, but we drove them back to the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	Then they shot arrows at us from the wall, and some of Your Majesty's officers were killed; your officer Uriah was also killed.”
2SA.11.25	David said to the messenger, “Encourage Joab and tell him not to be upset, since you never can tell who will die in battle. Tell him to launch a stronger attack on the city and capture it.”
2SA.11.26	When Bathsheba heard that her husband had been killed, she mourned for him. 
2SA.11.27	When the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to the palace; she became his wife and bore him a son. But the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had many cattle and sheep, 
2SA.12.3	while the poor man had only one lamb, which he had bought. He took care of it, and it grew up in his home with his children. He would feed it some of his own food, let it drink from his cup, and hold it in his lap. The lamb was like a daughter to him. 
2SA.12.4	One day a visitor arrived at the rich man's home. The rich man didn't want to kill one of his own animals to fix a meal for him; instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared a meal for his guest.”
2SA.12.5	David became very angry at the rich man and said, “I swear by the living 
2SA.12.6	For having done such a cruel thing, he must pay back four times as much as he took.”
2SA.12.7	“You are that man,” Nathan said to David. “And this is what the 
2SA.12.8	I gave you his kingdom and his wives; I made you king over Israel and Judah. If this had not been enough, I would have given you twice as much. 
2SA.12.9	Why, then, have you disobeyed my commands? Why did you do this evil thing? You had Uriah killed in battle; you let the Ammonites kill him, and then you took his wife! 
2SA.12.10	Now, in every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriah's wife. 
2SA.12.11	 I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble on you. You will see it when I take your wives from you and give them to another man; and he will have intercourse with them in broad daylight. 
2SA.12.12	You sinned in secret, but I will make this happen in broad daylight for all Israel to see.’”
2SA.12.13	“I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.13	Nathan replied, “The 
2SA.12.14	But because you have shown such contempt for the 
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went home.
2SA.12.15	The 
2SA.12.16	David prayed to God that the child would get well. He refused to eat anything, and every night he went into his room and spent the night lying on the floor. 
2SA.12.17	His court officials went to him and tried to make him get up, but he refused and would not eat anything with them. 
2SA.12.18	A week later the child died, and David's officials were afraid to tell him the news. They said, “While the child was living, David wouldn't answer us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that his child is dead? He might do himself some harm!”
2SA.12.19	When David noticed them whispering to each other, he realized that the child had died. So he asked them, “Is the child dead?”
2SA.12.19	“Yes, he is,” they answered.
2SA.12.20	David got up from the floor, took a bath, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. Then he went and worshiped in the house of the 
2SA.12.21	“We don't understand this,” his officials said to him. “While the child was alive, you wept for him and would not eat; but as soon as he died, you got up and ate!”
2SA.12.22	“Yes,” David answered, “I did fast and weep while he was still alive. I thought that the 
2SA.12.23	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Could I bring the child back to life? I will some day go to where he is, but he can never come back to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He had intercourse with her, and she bore a son, whom David named Solomon. The 
2SA.12.25	and commanded the prophet Nathan to name the boy Jedidiah,
2SA.12.26	Meanwhile Joab continued his campaign against Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, and was about to capture it. 
2SA.12.27	He sent messengers to David to report: “I have attacked Rabbah and have captured its water supply. 
2SA.12.28	Now gather the rest of your forces, attack the city and take it yourself. I don't want to get the credit for capturing it.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered his forces, went to Rabbah, attacked it, and conquered it. 
2SA.12.30	From the head of the idol of the Ammonite god Molech
2SA.12.31	and put its people to work with saws, iron hoes, and iron axes, and forced them to work at
2SA.13.1	David's son Absalom had a beautiful unmarried sister named Tamar. Amnon, another of David's sons, fell in love with her. 
2SA.13.2	He was so much in love with her that he became sick, because it seemed impossible for him to have her; as a virgin, she was kept from meeting men. 
2SA.13.3	But he had a friend, a very shrewd man named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah. 
2SA.13.4	Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king's son, yet day after day I see you looking sad. What's the matter?”
2SA.13.4	“I'm in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom,” he answered.
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to him, “Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her, and then serve it to me herself.’” 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon pretended that he was sick and went to bed.
2SA.13.6	King David went to see him, and Amnon said to him, “Please let Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her, and then serve them to me herself.”
2SA.13.7	So David sent word to Tamar in the palace: “Go to Amnon's house and fix him some food.” 
2SA.13.8	She went there and found him in bed. She took some dough, prepared it, and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes 
2SA.13.9	and emptied them out of the pan for him to eat, but he wouldn't. He said, “Send everyone away”—and they all left. 
2SA.13.10	Then he said to her, “Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me yourself.” She took the cakes and went over to him. 
2SA.13.11	As she offered them to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”
2SA.13.12	“No,” she said. “Don't force me to do such a degrading thing! That's awful! 
2SA.13.13	How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you—you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please, speak to the king, and I'm sure that he will give me to you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, “Get out!”
2SA.13.16	“No,” she answered. “To send me away like this is a greater crime
2SA.13.16	But Amnon would not listen to her; 
2SA.13.17	he called in his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!” 
2SA.13.18	The servant put her out and locked the door.
2SA.13.18	Tamar was wearing a long robe with full sleeves,
2SA.13.19	She sprinkled ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying. 
2SA.13.20	When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, “Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half brother, so don't tell anyone about it.” So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely.
2SA.13.21	When King David heard what had happened, he was furious. 
2SA.13.22	And Absalom hated Amnon so much for having raped his sister Tamar that he would no longer even speak to him.
2SA.13.23	Two years later Absalom was having his sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim, and he invited all the king's sons to be there. 
2SA.13.24	He went to King David and said, “Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials come and take part in the festivities?”
2SA.13.25	“No, my son,” the king answered. “It would be too much trouble for you if we all went.” Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave.
2SA.13.26	But Absalom said, “Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?”
2SA.13.26	“Why should he?” the king asked. 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom.
2SA.13.27	Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king
2SA.13.28	and instructed his servants: “Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!” 
2SA.13.29	So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled.
2SA.13.30	While they were on their way home, David was told: “Absalom has killed all your sons—not one of them is left!” 
2SA.13.31	The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also. 
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, “Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed.”
2SA.13.34	In the meantime Absalom had fled.
2SA.13.34	Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim.
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to David, “Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would.” 
2SA.13.36	As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also cried bitterly.
2SA.13.39	but when he got over Amnon's death, he was filled with longing for his son Absalom.
2SA.14.1	Joab knew that King David missed Absalom very much, 
2SA.14.2	so he sent for a clever woman who lived in Tekoa. When she arrived, he said to her, “Pretend that you are in mourning; put on your mourning clothes, and don't comb your hair. Act like a woman who has been in mourning for a long time. 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and say to him what I tell you to say.” Then Joab told her what to say.
2SA.14.4	The woman went to the king, bowed down to the ground in respect, and said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”
2SA.14.5	“What do you want?” he asked her.
2SA.14.5	“I am a poor widow, sir,” she answered. “My husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	Sir, I had two sons, and one day they got into a quarrel out in the fields, where there was no one to separate them, and one of them killed the other. 
2SA.14.7	And now, sir, all my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them, so that they can kill him for murdering his brother. If they do this, I will be left without a son. They will destroy my last hope and leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive.”
2SA.14.8	“Go back home,” the king answered, “and I will take care of the matter.”
2SA.14.9	“Your Majesty,” she said, “whatever you do, my family and I will take the blame; you and the royal family are innocent.”
2SA.14.10	The king replied, “If anyone threatens you, bring him to me, and he will never bother you again.”
2SA.14.11	She said, “Your Majesty, please pray to the 
2SA.14.11	“I promise by the living 
2SA.14.12	“Please, Your Majesty, let me say just one more thing,” the woman said.
2SA.14.12	“All right,” he answered.
2SA.14.13	She said to him, “Why have you done such a wrong to God's people? You have not allowed your own son to return from exile, and so you have condemned yourself by what you have just said. 
2SA.14.14	We will all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which can't be gathered again. Even God does not bring the dead back to life, but the king can at least find a way to bring a man back from exile.
2SA.14.15	Now, Your Majesty, the reason I have come to speak to you is that the people threatened me, and so I said to myself that I would speak to you in the hope that you would do what I ask. 
2SA.14.16	I thought you would listen to me and save me from the one who is trying to kill my son and me and so remove us from the land God gave his people. 
2SA.14.17	 I said to myself that your promise, sir, would make me safe, because the king is like God's angel and can distinguish good from evil.
2SA.14.18	The king answered, “I'm going to ask you a question, and you must tell me the whole truth.”
2SA.14.18	“Ask me anything, Your Majesty,” she answered.
2SA.14.19	“Did Joab put you up to this?” he asked her.
2SA.14.19	She answered, “I swear by all that is sacred, Your Majesty, that there is no way to avoid answering your question.
2SA.14.20	But he did it in order to straighten out this whole matter. Your Majesty is as wise as the angel of God and knows everything that happens.”
2SA.14.21	Later on the king said to Joab, “I have decided to do what you want. Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here.”
2SA.14.22	Joab threw himself to the ground in front of David in respect, and said, “God bless you, Your Majesty! Now I know that you are pleased with me, because you have granted my request.” 
2SA.14.23	Then he got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	The king, however, gave orders that Absalom should not live in the palace. “I don't want to see him,” the king said. So Absalom lived in his own house and did not appear before the king.
2SA.14.25	There was no one in Israel as famous for his good looks as Absalom; he had no defect from head to toe. 
2SA.14.26	His hair was very thick, and he had to cut it once a year, when it grew too long and heavy. It would weigh about five pounds according to the royal standard of weights. 
2SA.14.27	Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar, a very beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king. 
2SA.14.29	Then he sent for Joab, to ask him to go to the king for him; but Joab would not come. Again Absalom sent for him, and again Joab refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	So Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and it has barley growing in it. Go and set fire to it.” So they went and set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, “Why did your servants set fire to my field?”
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered, “Because you wouldn't come when I sent for you. I wanted you to go to the king and ask for me: ‘Why did I leave Geshur and come here? It would have been better for me to have stayed there.’” And Absalom went on, “I want you to arrange for me to see the king, and if I'm guilty, then let him put me to death.”
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to King David and told him what Absalom had said. The king sent for Absalom, who went to him and bowed down to the ground in front of him. The king welcomed him with a kiss.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself, and an escort of fifty men. 
2SA.15.2	He would get up early and go and stand by the road at the city gate. Whenever someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle, Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from. And after the man had told him what tribe he was from, 
2SA.15.3	Absalom would say, “Look, the law is on your side, but there is no representative of the king to hear your case.” 
2SA.15.4	And he would add, “How I wish I were a judge! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me, and I would give him justice.” 
2SA.15.5	When the man would approach Absalom to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment, and so he won their loyalty.
2SA.15.7	After four
2SA.15.8	While I was living in Geshur in Syria, I promised the 
2SA.15.9	“Go in peace,” the king said. So Absalom went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But he sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel to say, “When you hear the sound of trumpets, shout, ‘Absalom has become king at Hebron!’” 
2SA.15.11	There were two hundred men who at Absalom's invitation had gone from Jerusalem with him; they knew nothing of the plot and went in all good faith. 
2SA.15.12	And while he was offering sacrifices, Absalom also sent to the town of Gilo for Ahithophel, who was one of King David's advisers. The plot against the king gained strength, and Absalom's followers grew in number.
2SA.15.13	A messenger reported to David, “The Israelites are pledging their loyalty to Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	So David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “We must get away at once if we want to escape from Absalom! Hurry! Or else he will soon be here and defeat us and kill everyone in the city!”
2SA.15.15	“Yes, Your Majesty,” they answered. “We are ready to do whatever you say.” 
2SA.15.16	So the king left, accompanied by all his family and officials, except for ten concubines, whom he left behind to take care of the palace.
2SA.15.17	As the king and all his men were leaving the city, they stopped at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	All his officials stood
2SA.15.19	and the king said to Ittai, their leader, “Why are you going with us? Go back and stay with the new king. You are a foreigner, a refugee away from your own country. 
2SA.15.20	You have lived here only a short time, so why should I make you wander around with me? I don't even know where I'm going. Go back and take all your people with you—and may the 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered, “Your Majesty, I swear to you in the 
2SA.15.22	“Fine!” David answered. “March on!” So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependents. 
2SA.15.23	The people cried loudly as David's followers left. The king crossed Kidron Brook, followed by his men, and together they went out toward the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Zadok the priest was there, and with him were the Levites, carrying the sacred Covenant Box. They set it down
2SA.15.25	Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the Covenant Box back to the city. If the 
2SA.15.26	But if he isn't pleased with me—well, then, let him do to me what he wishes.” 
2SA.15.27	And he went on to say to Zadok, “Look,
2SA.15.28	Meanwhile, I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until I receive news from you.” 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the Covenant Box back into Jerusalem and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	David went on up the Mount of Olives crying; he was barefoot and had his head covered as a sign of grief. All who followed him covered their heads and cried also. 
2SA.15.31	When David was told
2SA.15.32	When David reached the top of the hill, where there was a place of worship, his trusted friend Hushai the Archite met him with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “You will be of no help to me if you come with me, 
2SA.15.34	but you can help me by returning to the city and telling Absalom that you will now serve him as faithfully as you served his father. And do all you can to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives. 
2SA.15.35	The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be there; tell them everything you hear in the king's palace. 
2SA.15.36	They have their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan with them, and you can send them to me with all the information you gather.”
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David's friend, returned to the city just as Absalom was arriving.
2SA.16.2	King David asked him, “What are you going to do with all that?”
2SA.16.2	Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for Your Majesty's family to ride, the bread and the fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is for them to drink when they get tired in the wilderness.”
2SA.16.3	“He is staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba answered, “because he is convinced that the Israelites will now restore to him the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”
2SA.16.4	The king said to Ziba, “Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is yours.”
2SA.16.4	“I am your servant,” Ziba replied. “May I always please Your Majesty!”
2SA.16.5	When King David arrived at Bahurim, one of Saul's relatives, Shimei son of Gera, came out to meet him, cursing him as he came. 
2SA.16.6	Shimei started throwing stones at David and his officials, even though David was surrounded by his men and his bodyguards. 
2SA.16.7	Shimei cursed him and said, “Get out! Get out! Murderer! Criminal! 
2SA.16.8	You took Saul's kingdom, and now the 
2SA.16.9	Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, said to the king, “Your Majesty, why do you let this dog curse you? Let me go over there and cut off his head!”
2SA.16.10	“This is none of your business,” the king said to Abishai and his brother Joab. “If he curses me because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai and to all his officials, “My own son is trying to kill me; so why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite? The 
2SA.16.12	Perhaps the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them, walking on the hillside; he was cursing and throwing stones and dirt at them as he went. 
2SA.16.14	The king and all his men were worn out when they reached the Jordan,
2SA.16.15	Absalom and all the Israelites with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with them. 
2SA.16.16	When Hushai, David's trusted friend, met Absalom, he shouted, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	“What has happened to your loyalty to your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why didn't you go with him?”
2SA.16.18	Hushai answered, “How could I? I am for the one chosen by the 
2SA.16.19	After all, whom should I serve, if not my master's son? As I served your father, so now I will serve you.”
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Now that we are here, what do you advise us to do?”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel answered, “Go and have intercourse with your father's concubines whom he left behind to take care of the palace. Then everyone in Israel will know that your father regards you as his enemy, and your followers will be greatly encouraged.” 
2SA.16.22	 So they set up a tent for Absalom on the palace roof, and in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his father's concubines.
2SA.16.23	Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God; both David and Absalom followed it.
2SA.17.1	Not long after that, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men, and tonight I will set out after David. 
2SA.17.2	I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged. He will be frightened, and all his men will run away. I will kill only the king 
2SA.17.3	and then bring back all his men to you, like a bride returning to her husband. You want to kill only one man;
2SA.17.4	This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders.
2SA.17.5	Absalom said, “Now call Hushai, and let us hear what he has to say.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai arrived, Absalom said to him, “This is the advice that Ahithophel has given us; shall we follow it? If not, you tell us what to do.”
2SA.17.7	Hushai answered, “The advice Ahithophel gave you this time is no good. 
2SA.17.8	You know that your father David and his men are hard fighters and that they are as fierce as a mother bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier and does not stay with his men at night. 
2SA.17.9	Right now he is probably hiding in a cave or some other place. As soon as David attacks your men, whoever hears about it will say that your men have been defeated. 
2SA.17.10	Then even the bravest men, as fearless as lions, will be afraid because everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great soldier and that his men are hard fighters. 
2SA.17.11	My advice is that you bring all the Israelites together from one end of the country to the other, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore, and that you lead them personally in battle. 
2SA.17.12	We will find David wherever he is, and attack him before he knows what's happening. Neither he nor any of his men will survive. 
2SA.17.13	If he retreats into a city, our people will all bring ropes and just pull the city
2SA.17.14	Absalom and all the Israelites said, “Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's.” The 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar what advice he had given to Absalom and the Israelite leaders and what advice Ahithophel had given. 
2SA.17.16	Hushai added, “Quick, now! Send a message to David not to spend the night at the river crossings in the wilderness, but to cross the Jordan at once, so that he and his men won't all be caught and killed.”
2SA.17.17	Abiathar's son Jonathan and Zadok's son Ahimaaz were waiting at the spring of Enrogel, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, because they did not dare be seen entering the city. A servant woman would regularly go and tell them what was happening, and then they would go and tell King David. 
2SA.17.18	But one day a boy happened to see them, and he told Absalom; so they hurried off to hide in the house of a certain man in Bahurim. He had a well near his house, and they got down in it. 
2SA.17.19	The man's wife took a covering, spread it over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it, so that no one would notice anything. 
2SA.17.20	Absalom's officials came to the house and asked the woman, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	“They crossed the river,” she answered.
2SA.17.20	The men looked for them but could not find them, and so they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.17.21	After they left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the well and went and reported to King David. They told him what Ahithophel had planned against him and said, “Hurry up and cross the river.” 
2SA.17.22	So David and his men started crossing the Jordan, and by daybreak they had all gone across.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown. After putting his affairs in order, he hanged himself. He was buried in the family grave.
2SA.17.24	David had reached the town of Mahanaim by the time Absalom and the Israelites had crossed the Jordan. ( 
2SA.17.25	Absalom had put Amasa in command of the army in the place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether the Ishmaelite;
2SA.17.26	Absalom and his men camped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	When David arrived at Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash, from the city of Rabbah in Ammon, and by Machir son of Ammiel, from Lodebar, and by Barzillai, from Rogelim in Gilead. 
2SA.17.28+2SA.17.29	They brought bowls, clay pots, and bedding, and also food for David and his men: wheat, barley, meal, roasted grain, beans, peas,
2SA.18.1	King David brought all his men together, divided them into units of a thousand and of a hundred, and placed officers in command of them. 
2SA.18.2	Then he sent them out in three groups, with Joab and Joab's brother Abishai and Ittai from Gath, each in command of a group. And the king said to his men, “I will go with you myself.”
2SA.18.3	“You mustn't go with us,” they answered. “It won't make any difference to the enemy if the rest of us turn and run, or even if half of us are killed; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It will be better if you stay here in the city and send us help.”
2SA.18.4	“I will do whatever you think best,” the king answered. Then he stood by the side of the gate as his men marched out in units of a thousand and of a hundred. 
2SA.18.5	He gave orders to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake don't harm the young man Absalom.” And all the troops heard David give this command to his officers.
2SA.18.6	David's army went out into the countryside and fought the Israelites in Ephraim Forest. 
2SA.18.7	The Israelites were defeated by David's men; it was a terrible defeat, with twenty thousand men killed that day. 
2SA.18.8	The fighting spread over the countryside, and more men died in the forest than were killed in battle.
2SA.18.9	Suddenly Absalom met some of David's men. Absalom was riding a mule, and as it went under a large oak tree, Absalom's head got caught in the branches. The mule ran on and Absalom was left hanging in midair. 
2SA.18.10	One of David's men saw him and reported to Joab, “Sir, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”
2SA.18.11	Joab answered, “If you saw him, why didn't you kill him on the spot? I myself would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”
2SA.18.12	But the man answered, “Even if you gave me a thousand pieces of silver, I wouldn't lift a finger against the king's son. We all heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake don't harm the young man Absalom.’ 
2SA.18.13	But if I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about it—he hears about everything—and you would not have defended me.”
2SA.18.14	“I'm not going to waste any more time with you,” Joab said. He took three spears and plunged them into Absalom's chest while he was still alive, hanging in the oak tree. 
2SA.18.15	Then ten of Joab's soldiers closed in on Absalom and finished killing him.
2SA.18.16	Joab had the trumpet blown to stop the fighting, and his troops came back from pursuing the Israelites. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom's body, threw it into a deep pit in the forest, and covered it with a huge pile of stones. All the Israelites fled to their own hometowns.
2SA.18.18	During his lifetime Absalom had built a monument for himself in King's Valley, because he had no son to keep his name alive. So he named it after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom's Monument.
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said to Joab, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the 
2SA.18.20	“No,” Joab said, “today you will not take any good news. Some other day you may do so, but not today, for the king's son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then he said to his Ethiopian
2SA.18.22	Ahimaaz insisted, “I don't care what happens; please let me take the news also.”
2SA.18.22	“Why do you want to do it, my son?” Joab asked. “You will get no reward for it.”
2SA.18.23	“Whatever happens,” Ahimaaz said again, “I want to go.”
2SA.18.23	“Then go,” Joab said. So Ahimaaz ran off down the road through the Jordan Valley, and soon he passed the slave.
2SA.18.24	David was sitting in the space between the inner and outer gates of the city. The lookout went up to the top of the wall and stood on the roof of the gateway; he looked out and saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	He called down and told the king, and the king said, “If he is alone, he is bringing good news.” The runner kept coming closer.
2SA.18.26	Then the lookout saw another man running alone, and he called down to the gatekeeper, “Look! There's another man running!”
2SA.18.26	The king answered, “This one also is bringing good news.”
2SA.18.27	The lookout said, “I can see that the first man runs like Ahimaaz.”
2SA.18.27	“He's a good man,” the king said, “and he is bringing good news.”
2SA.18.28	Ahimaaz called out a greeting to the king, threw himself down to the ground before him, and said, “Praise the 
2SA.18.29	“Is the young man Absalom all right?” the king asked.
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “Sir, when your officer Joab sent me, I saw a great commotion, but I couldn't tell what it was.”
2SA.18.30	“Stand over there,” the king told him; and he went over and stood there.
2SA.18.31	Then the Ethiopian
2SA.18.32	“Is the young man Absalom all right?” the king asked.
2SA.18.32	The slave answered, “I wish that what has happened to him would happen to all your enemies, sir, and to all who rebel against you.”
2SA.18.33	The king was overcome with grief. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he cried, “O my son! My son Absalom! Absalom, my son! If only I had died in your place, my son! Absalom, my son!”
2SA.19.1	Joab was told that King David was weeping and mourning for Absalom. 
2SA.19.2	And so the joy of victory was turned into sadness for all of David's troops that day, because they heard that the king was mourning for his son. 
2SA.19.3	They went back into the city quietly, like soldiers who are ashamed because they are running away from battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face and cried loudly, “O my son! My son Absalom! Absalom, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Joab went to the king's house and said to him, “Today you have humiliated your men—the men who saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and of your wives and concubines. 
2SA.19.6	You oppose those who love you and support those who hate you! You have made it clear that your officers and men mean nothing to you. I can see that you would be quite happy if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. 
2SA.19.7	Now go and reassure your men. I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king got up, and went and sat near the city gate. His men heard that he was there, and they all gathered around him.
2SA.19.8	Meanwhile all the Israelites had fled to their own hometowns. 
2SA.19.9	All over the country they started quarreling among themselves. “King David saved us from our enemies,” they said to one another. “He rescued us from the Philistines, but now he has fled from Absalom and left the country. 
2SA.19.10	We anointed Absalom as our king, but he has been killed in battle. So why doesn't somebody try to bring King David back?”
2SA.19.11	The news of what the Israelites were saying reached King David.
2SA.19.12	You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood; why should you be the last to bring me back?” 
2SA.19.13	David also told them to say to Amasa, “You are my relative. From now on I am putting you in charge of the army in place of Joab. May God strike me dead if I don't!” 
2SA.19.14	David's words won the complete loyalty of all the men of Judah, and they sent him word to return with all his officials.
2SA.19.15	On his way back the king was met at the Jordan River by the men of Judah, who had come to Gilgal to escort him across the river. 
2SA.19.16	 At the same time the Benjaminite Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim hurried to the Jordan to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	He had with him a thousand men from the tribe of Benjamin. And Ziba, the servant of Saul's family, also came with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, and they arrived at the Jordan before the king. 
2SA.19.18	They crossed
2SA.19.18	As the king was getting ready to cross, Shimei threw himself down in front of him 
2SA.19.19	and said, “Your Majesty, please forget the wrong I did that day you left Jerusalem. Don't hold it against me or think about it any more. 
2SA.19.20	I know, sir, that I have sinned, and this is why I am the first one from the northern tribes to come and meet Your Majesty today.”
2SA.19.21	Abishai son of Zeruiah spoke up: “Shimei should be put to death because he cursed the one whom the 
2SA.19.22	But David said to Abishai and his brother Joab, “Who asked your opinion? Are you going to give me trouble? I am the one who is king of Israel now, and no Israelite will be put to death today.” 
2SA.19.23	And he said to Shimei, “I give you my word that you will not be put to death.”
2SA.19.25	When Mephibosheth arrived from
2SA.19.26	He answered, “As you know, Your Majesty, I am crippled. I told my servant to saddle my donkey so that I could ride along with you, but he betrayed me. 
2SA.19.27	He lied about me to Your Majesty, but you are like God's angel, so do what seems right to you. 
2SA.19.28	All of my father's family deserved to be put to death by Your Majesty, but you gave me the right to eat at your table. I have no right to ask for any more favors from Your Majesty.”
2SA.19.29	The king answered, “You don't have to say anything more. I have decided that you and Ziba will share Saul's property.”
2SA.19.30	“Let Ziba have it all,” Mephibosheth answered. “It's enough for me that Your Majesty has come home safely.”
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He was very rich and had supplied the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim. 
2SA.19.33	The king said to him, “Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of you.”
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai answered, “I don't have long to live; why should I go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am already eighty years old, and nothing gives me pleasure any more. I can't taste what I eat and drink, and I can't hear the voices of singers. I would only be a burden to Your Majesty. 
2SA.19.36	I don't deserve such a great reward. So I will go just a little way with you beyond the Jordan. 
2SA.19.37	Then let me go back home and die near my parents' grave. Here is my son Chimham, who will serve you; take him with you, Your Majesty, and do for him as you think best.”
2SA.19.38	The king answered, “I will take him with me and do for him whatever you want. And I will do for you anything you ask.” 
2SA.19.39	Then David and all of his men crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai went back home.
2SA.19.40	When the king had crossed, escorted by all the people of Judah and half the people of Israel, he went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. 
2SA.19.41	Then all the Israelites went to the king and said to him, “Your Majesty, why did our brothers, the men of Judah, think they had the right to take you away and escort you, your family, and your men across the Jordan?”
2SA.19.42	The men of Judah answered, “We did it because the king is one of us. So why should this make you angry? He hasn't paid for our food nor has he given us anything.”
2SA.19.43	The Israelites replied, “We have ten times as many claims on King David as you have, even if he is one of you. Why do you look down on us? Don't forget that we were the first to talk about bringing the king back!”
2SA.19.43	But the men of Judah were more violent in making their claims than the men of Israel.
2SA.20.2	So the Israelites deserted David and went with Sheba, but the men of Judah remained loyal and followed David from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.4	The king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together and be back here with them by the day after tomorrow.” 
2SA.20.5	Amasa went to call them, but he did not get back by the time the king had told him to. 
2SA.20.6	So the king said to Abishai, “Sheba will give us more trouble than Absalom. Take my men and go after him, or else he may occupy some fortified towns and escape from us.” 
2SA.20.7	So Joab's men, the royal bodyguards, and all the other soldiers left Jerusalem with Abishai to go after Sheba. 
2SA.20.8	When they reached the large rock at Gibeon, Amasa met them. Joab was dressed for battle, with a sword in its sheath fastened to his belt. As he came forward, the sword fell out. 
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my friend?” and took hold of his beard with his right hand in order to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	Amasa was not on guard against the sword that Joab was holding in his other hand, and Joab stabbed him in the belly, and his insides spilled out on the ground. He died immediately, and Joab did not have to strike again.
2SA.20.10	Then Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba. 
2SA.20.11	One of Joab's men stood by Amasa's body and called out, “Everyone who is for Joab and David follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	Amasa's body, covered with blood, was lying in the middle of the road. Joab's man saw that everybody was stopping, so he dragged the body from the road out into the field and threw a blanket over it. 
2SA.20.13	After the body had been removed from the road, everyone followed Joab in pursuit of Sheba.
2SA.20.14	Sheba passed through the territory of all the tribes of Israel and came to the city of Abel Beth Maacah, and all the members of the clan of Bikri
2SA.20.15	Joab's men heard that Sheba was there, and so they went and besieged the city. They built ramps of earth against the outer wall and also began to dig under the wall to make it fall down. 
2SA.20.16	There was a wise woman in the city who shouted from the wall, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here; I want to speak with him.” 
2SA.20.17	Joab went, and she asked, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“Yes, I am,” he answered.
2SA.20.17	“Listen to me, sir,” she said.
2SA.20.17	“I'm listening,” he answered.
2SA.20.18	She said, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Go and get your answer in the city of Abel’—and that's just what they did. 
2SA.20.19	Ours is a great city, one of the most peaceful and loyal in Israel. Why are you trying to destroy it? Do you want to ruin what belongs to the 
2SA.20.20	“Never!” Joab answered. “I will never ruin or destroy your city! 
2SA.20.21	That is not our plan. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, who is from the hill country of Ephraim, started a rebellion against King David. Hand over this one man, and I will withdraw from the city.”
2SA.20.21	“We will throw his head over the wall to you,” she said. 
2SA.20.22	Then she went to the people of the city with her plan, and they cut off Sheba's head and threw it over the wall to Joab. He blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to leave the city, and they went back home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
2SA.20.23	Joab was in command of the army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; 
2SA.20.24	Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
2SA.20.25	Sheva was the court secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests, 
2SA.20.26	and Ira from the town of Jair was also one of David's priests.
2SA.21.1	During David's reign there was a severe famine which lasted for three full years. So David consulted the 
2SA.21.2	 The people of Gibeon were not Israelites; they were a small group of Amorites whom the Israelites had promised to protect, but Saul had tried to destroy them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.) 
2SA.21.3	So David summoned the people of Gibeon and said to them, “What can I do for you? I want to make up for the wrong that was done to you, so that you will bless the 
2SA.21.4	They answered, “Our quarrel with Saul and his family can't be settled with silver or gold, nor do we want to kill any Israelite.”
2SA.21.4	“What, then, do you think I should do for you?” David asked.
2SA.21.5	They answered, “Saul wanted to destroy us and leave none of us alive anywhere in Israel. 
2SA.21.6	So hand over seven of his male descendants, and we will hang them before the 
2SA.21.6	“I will hand them over,” the king answered.
2SA.21.8	 However, he took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons that Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul; he also took the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai, who was from Meholah. 
2SA.21.9	David handed them over to the people of Gibeon, who hanged them on the mountain before the 
2SA.21.10	Then Saul's concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, used sackcloth to make a shelter for herself on the rock where the corpses were, and she stayed there from the beginning of harvest until the autumn rains came. During the day she would keep the birds away from the corpses, and at night she would protect them from wild animals.
2SA.21.11	When David heard what Rizpah had done, 
2SA.21.12	 he went and got the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from the people of Jabesh in Gilead. (They had stolen them from the public square in Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged the bodies on the day they killed Saul on Mount Gilboa.) 
2SA.21.13	David took the bones of Saul and Jonathan and also gathered up the bones of the seven men who had been hanged. 
2SA.21.14	Then they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in the grave of Saul's father Kish, in Zela in the territory of Benjamin, doing all that the king had commanded. And after that, God answered their prayers for the country.
2SA.21.15	There was another war between the Philistines and Israel, and David and his men went and fought the Philistines. During one of the battles David grew tired. 
2SA.21.16	A giant named Ishbibenob, who was carrying a bronze spear that weighed about seven and a half pounds and who was wearing a new sword, thought he could kill David. 
2SA.21.17	 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's help, attacked the giant, and killed him. Then David's men made David promise that he would never again go out with them to battle. “You are the hope of Israel, and we don't want to lose you,” they said.
2SA.21.18	After this there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, during which Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Saph.
2SA.21.19	There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair
2SA.21.20	Then there was another battle at Gath, where there was a giant who loved to fight. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. 
2SA.21.21	He defied the Israelites, and Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shammah, killed him.
2SA.21.22	These four were descendants of the giants of Gath, and they were killed by David and his men.
2SA.22.1	When the 
2SA.22.2	The 
2SA.22.2	he is my strong fortress.
2SA.22.3	My God is my protection,
2SA.22.3	and with him I am safe.
2SA.22.3	He protects me like a shield;
2SA.22.3	he defends me and keeps me safe.
2SA.22.3	He is my savior;
2SA.22.3	he protects me and saves me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I call to the

2SA.22.5	the waves of destruction rolled over me.
2SA.22.6	The danger of death was around me,
2SA.22.6	and the grave set its trap for me.
2SA.22.7	In my trouble I called to the 
2SA.22.7	I called to my God for help.
2SA.22.7	In his temple he heard my voice;
2SA.22.7	he listened to my cry for help.
2SA.22.8	Then the earth trembled and shook;
2SA.22.8	the foundations of the sky rocked and quivered
2SA.22.8	because God was angry!
2SA.22.9	Smoke poured out of his nostrils,
2SA.22.9	a consuming flame and burning coals from his mouth.
2SA.22.10	He tore the sky open and came down,
2SA.22.10	with a dark cloud under his feet.
2SA.22.11	He flew swiftly on his winged creature;
2SA.22.11	he traveled on the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He covered himself with darkness;
2SA.22.12	thick clouds, full of
2SA.22.13	burning coals flamed up from the lightning before him.
2SA.22.14	Then the 
2SA.22.14	and the voice of Almighty God was heard.
2SA.22.15	He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies;
2SA.22.15	with flashes of lightning he sent them running.
2SA.22.16	The floor of the ocean was laid bare,
2SA.22.16	and the foundations of the earth were uncovered
2SA.22.16	when the

2SA.22.17	The

2SA.22.18	He rescued me from my powerful enemies
2SA.22.18	and from all those who hate me—
2SA.22.18	they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	When I was in trouble, they attacked me,
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He helped me out of danger;
2SA.22.20	he saved me because he was pleased with me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.21	he blesses me because I am innocent.
2SA.22.22	I have obeyed the law of the 
2SA.22.22	I have not turned away from my God.
2SA.22.23	I have observed all his laws;
2SA.22.23	I have not disobeyed his commands.
2SA.22.24	He knows that I am faultless,
2SA.22.24	that I have kept myself from doing wrong.
2SA.22.25	And so he rewards me because I do what is right,
2SA.22.25	because he knows that I am innocent.
2SA.22.26	O 
2SA.22.26	and completely good to those
2SA.22.27	You are pure to those who are pure,
2SA.22.27	but hostile to those who are wicked.
2SA.22.28	You save those who are humble,
2SA.22.28	but you humble those who are proud.
2SA.22.29	You, 
2SA.22.29	you dispel my darkness.
2SA.22.30	You give me strength to attack my enemies
2SA.22.30	and power to overcome their defenses.
2SA.22.31	This God—how perfect are his deeds,
2SA.22.31	how dependable his words!
2SA.22.31	He is like a shield
2SA.22.31	for all who seek his protection.

2SA.22.34	he keeps me safe on the mountains.
2SA.22.35	He trains me for battle,
2SA.22.35	so that I can use the strongest bow.
2SA.22.36	O 
2SA.22.36	your help has made me great.
2SA.22.37	You have kept me from being captured,
2SA.22.37	and I have never fallen.
2SA.22.38	I pursue my enemies and defeat them;
2SA.22.38	I do not stop until I destroy them.
2SA.22.39	I strike them down, and they cannot rise;
2SA.22.39	they lie defeated before me.
2SA.22.40	You give me strength for the battle
2SA.22.40	and victory over my enemies.
2SA.22.41	You make my enemies run from me;
2SA.22.41	I destroy those who hate me.
2SA.22.42	They look for help, but no one saves them;
2SA.22.42	they call to the 
2SA.22.43	I crush them, and they become like dust;
2SA.22.43	I trample on them like mud in the streets.
2SA.22.44	You saved me from my rebellious people
2SA.22.44	and maintained my rule over the nations;
2SA.22.44	people I did not know have now become my subjects.
2SA.22.45	Foreigners bow before me;
2SA.22.45	when they hear me, they obey.
2SA.22.46	They lose their courage
2SA.22.46	and come trembling
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.47	Proclaim the greatness of the strong God who saves me!
2SA.22.48	He gives me victory over my enemies;
2SA.22.48	he subdues the nations under me
2SA.22.49	and saves me from my foes.
2SA.22.49	O 
2SA.22.49	and protect me from violent men.
2SA.22.50	I sing praises to you.
2SA.22.51	God gives great victories to his king;
2SA.22.51	he shows constant love to the one he has chosen,
2SA.22.51	to David and his descendants forever.
2SA.23.1	David son of Jesse was the man whom God made great, whom the God of Jacob chose to be king, and who was the composer of beautiful songs for Israel. These are David's last words:
2SA.23.2	The spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	his message is on my lips.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel has spoken;
2SA.23.3	the protector of Israel said to me:
2SA.23.3	“The king who rules with justice,
2SA.23.3	who rules in obedience to God,
2SA.23.4	is like the sun shining on a cloudless dawn,
2SA.23.4	the sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain.”
2SA.23.5	And that is how God will bless my descendants,
2SA.23.5	because he has made an eternal covenant with me,
2SA.23.5	an agreement that will not be broken,
2SA.23.5	a promise that will not be changed.
2SA.23.5	That is all I desire;
2SA.23.5	that will be my victory,
2SA.23.5	and God will surely bring it about.
2SA.23.6	But godless people are like thorns that are thrown away;
2SA.23.6	no one can touch them barehanded.
2SA.23.7	You must use an iron tool or a spear;
2SA.23.7	they will be burned completely.
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David's famous soldiers: the first was Josheb Basshebeth from Tachemon, who was the leader of “The Three”;
2SA.23.9	The second of the famous three was Eleazar son of Dodo, of the clan of Ahoh. One day he and David challenged the Philistines who had gathered for battle. The Israelites fell back, 
2SA.23.10	but he stood his ground and fought the Philistines until his hand was so cramped that he could not let go of his sword. The 
2SA.23.11	The third of the famous three was Shammah son of Agee from Harar. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi, where there was a field of peas. The Israelites fled from the Philistines, 
2SA.23.12	but Shammah stood his ground in the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. The 
2SA.23.13	Near the beginning of harvest time
2SA.23.14	At that time David was on a fortified hill, and a group of Philistines had occupied Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	David grew homesick and said, “How I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!” 
2SA.23.16	The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp, drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it; instead he poured it out as an offering to the 
2SA.23.17	and said, “
2SA.23.17	Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers.
2SA.23.18	Joab's brother Abishai (their mother was Zeruiah) was the leader of “The Famous Thirty.” He fought with his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and became famous among “The Thirty.”
2SA.23.19	He was the most famous of “The Thirty”
2SA.23.20	Benaiah son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel was another famous soldier; he did many brave deeds, including killing two great Moabite warriors. He once went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
2SA.23.21	He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man who was armed with a spear. Benaiah attacked him with his club, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with it. 
2SA.23.22	Those were the brave deeds of Benaiah, who was one of “The Thirty.”
2SA.23.23	He was outstanding among them, but was not as famous as “The Three.” David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

2SA.24.1	On another occasion the 
2SA.24.2	So David gave orders to Joab, the commander of his army: “Go with your officers through all the tribes of Israel from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are.”
2SA.24.3	But Joab answered the king, “Your Majesty, may the 
2SA.24.4	But the king made Joab and his officers obey his order; they left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel.
2SA.24.5	They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer, the city in the middle of the valley, in the territory of Gad.
2SA.24.6	and on to Gilead and to Kadesh, in Hittite territory.
2SA.24.7	Then they went south to the fortified city of Tyre, on to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites, and finally to Beersheba, in the southern part of Judah. 
2SA.24.8	So after nine months and twenty days they returned to Jerusalem, having traveled through the whole country. 
2SA.24.9	They reported to the king the total number of men capable of military service: 800,000 in Israel and 500,000 in Judah.
2SA.24.10	But after David had taken the census, his conscience began to hurt, and he said to the 
2SA.24.11+2SA.24.12	The 
2SA.24.13	Gad went to him, told him what the 
2SA.24.14	David answered, “I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people. Let the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	When the 
2SA.24.17	David saw the angel who was killing the people, and said to the 
2SA.24.18	That same day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	David obeyed the 
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his officials coming up to him. He threw himself on the ground in front of David 
2SA.24.21	and asked, “Your Majesty, why are you here?”
2SA.24.21	David answered, “To buy your threshing place and build an altar for the 
2SA.24.22	“Take it, Your Majesty,” Araunah said, “and offer to the 
2SA.24.23	Araunah gave it all to the king
2SA.24.24	But the king answered, “No, I will pay you for it. I will not offer to the 
2SA.24.25	Then he built an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	King David was now a very old man, and although his servants covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	So his officials said to him, “Your Majesty, let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.” 
1KI.1.3	A search was made all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	She was very beautiful, and waited on the king and took care of him, but he did not have intercourse with her.
1KI.1.7	He talked with Joab (whose mother was Zeruiah) and with Abiathar the priest, and they agreed to support his cause. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's bodyguards were not on Adonijah's side.
1KI.1.9	One day Adonijah offered a sacrifice of sheep, bulls, and fattened calves at Snake Rock, near the spring of Enrogel. He invited the other sons of King David and the king's officials who were from Judah to come to this sacrificial feast, 
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite his half brother Solomon or Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king's bodyguards.
1KI.1.12	If you want to save your life and the life of your son Solomon, I would advise you to 
1KI.1.13	go at once to King David and ask him, ‘Your Majesty, didn't you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king? How is it, then, that Adonijah has become king?’” 
1KI.1.14	And Nathan added, “Then, while you are still talking with King David, I will come in and confirm your story.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, was taking care of him. 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed low before the king, and he asked, “What do you want?”
1KI.1.17	She answered, “Your Majesty, you made me a solemn promise in the name of the 
1KI.1.18	But Adonijah has already become king, and you don't know anything about it. 
1KI.1.19	He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves, and he invited your sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of your army to the feast, but he did not invite your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	Your Majesty, all the people of Israel are looking to you to tell them who is to succeed you as king. 
1KI.1.21	If you don't, as soon as you are dead, my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors.”
1KI.1.22	She was still speaking, when Nathan arrived at the palace. 
1KI.1.23	The king was told that the prophet was there, and Nathan went in and bowed low before the king. 
1KI.1.24	Then he said, “Your Majesty, have you announced that Adonijah would succeed you as king? 
1KI.1.25	This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited all your sons, Joab the commander of your army,
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me, sir, or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king?”
1KI.1.28	King David said, “Ask Bathsheba to come back in”—and she came and stood before him. 
1KI.1.29	Then he said to her, “I promise you by the living 
1KI.1.30	that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of the 
1KI.1.31	Bathsheba bowed low and said, “May my lord the king live forever!”
1KI.1.32	Then King David sent for Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah. When they came in, 
1KI.1.33	he said to them, “Take my court officials with you; have my son Solomon ride my own mule, and escort him down to Gihon Spring, 
1KI.1.34	where Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, because he is the one I have chosen to be the ruler of Israel and Judah.”
1KI.1.36	“It shall be done,” answered Benaiah, “and may the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok took the container of olive oil which he had brought from the Tent of the 
1KI.1.40	Then they all followed him back, shouting for joy and playing flutes, making enough noise to shake the ground.
1KI.1.41	As Adonijah and all his guests were finishing the feast, they heard the noise. And when Joab heard the trumpet, he asked, “What's the meaning of all that noise in the city?” 
1KI.1.42	Before he finished speaking, Jonathan, the son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. “Come on in,” Adonijah said. “You're a good man—you must be bringing good news.”
1KI.1.43	“I'm afraid not,” Jonathan answered. “His Majesty King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	He sent Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards to escort him. They had him ride on the king's mule, 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok and Nathan anointed him as king at Gihon Spring. Then they went into the city, shouting for joy, and the people are now in an uproar. That's the noise you just heard. 
1KI.1.46	Solomon is now the king. 
1KI.1.47	What is more, the court officials went in to pay their respects to His Majesty King David and said, ‘May your God make Solomon even more famous than you, and may Solomon's reign be even more prosperous than yours.’ Then King David bowed in worship on his bed 
1KI.1.48	and prayed, ‘Let us praise the 
1KI.1.49	Then Adonijah's guests were afraid, and they all got up and left, each going his own way. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah, in great fear of Solomon, went to the Tent of the 
1KI.1.51	King Solomon was told that Adonijah was afraid of him and that he was holding on to the corners of the altar and had said, “First, I want King Solomon to swear to me that he will not have me put to death.”
1KI.1.52	Solomon replied, “If he is loyal, not even a hair on his head will be touched; but if he is not, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar. Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him, and the king said to him, “You may go home.”
1KI.2.1	When David was about to die, he called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions: 
1KI.2.2	“My time to die has come. Be confident and determined, 
1KI.2.3	and do what the 
1KI.2.4	If you obey him, the 
1KI.2.6	You know what to do; you must not let him die a natural death.
1KI.2.9	But you must not let him go unpunished. You know what to do, and you must see to it that he is put to death.”
1KI.2.10	David died and was buried in David's City. 
1KI.2.11	 He had been king of Israel for forty years, ruling seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	 Solomon succeeded his father David as king, and his royal power was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Then Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, went to Bathsheba, who was Solomon's mother. “Is this a friendly visit?” she asked.
1KI.2.13	“It is,” he answered, 
1KI.2.14	and then he added, “I have something to ask of you.”
1KI.2.14	“What is it?” she asked.
1KI.2.15	He answered, “You know that I should have become king and that everyone in Israel expected it. But it happened differently, and my brother became king because it was the 
1KI.2.16	And now I have one request to make; please do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.16	“What is it?” Bathsheba asked.
1KI.2.18	“Very well,” she answered. “I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to the king to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king stood up to greet his mother and bowed to her. Then he sat on his throne and had another one brought in on which she sat at his right. 
1KI.2.20	She said, “I have a small favor to ask of you; please do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.20	“What is it, mother?” he asked. “I will not refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	She answered, “Let your brother Adonijah have Abishag as his wife.”
1KI.2.22	“Why do you ask me to give Abishag to him?” the king asked. “You might as well ask me to give him the throne too. After all, he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab are on his side!”
1KI.2.23	Then Solomon made a solemn promise in the 
1KI.2.24	The 
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Adonijah.
1KI.2.27	 Then Solomon dismissed Abiathar from serving as a priest of the 
1KI.2.28	Joab heard what had happened. (He had supported Adonijah, but not Absalom.) So he fled to the Tent of the 
1KI.2.29	When the news reached King Solomon that Joab had fled to the Tent and was by the altar, Solomon sent a messenger to Joab to ask him why he had fled to the altar. Joab answered that he had fled to the 
1KI.2.30	He went to the Tent of the 
1KI.2.30	“No,” Joab answered. “I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said.
1KI.2.31	“Do what Joab says,” Solomon answered. “Kill him and bury him. Then neither I nor any other of David's descendants will any longer be held responsible for what Joab did when he killed innocent men. 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	The punishment for their murders will fall on Joab and on his descendants forever. But the 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah went to the Tent of the 
1KI.2.35	The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Live in it and don't leave the city. 
1KI.2.37	If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook, you will certainly die—and you yourself will be to blame.”
1KI.2.38	“Very well, Your Majesty,” Shimei answered. “I will do what you say.” So he lived in Jerusalem a long time.
1KI.2.39	Three years later, however, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath, Achish son of Maacah. When Shimei heard that they were in Gath, 
1KI.2.40	he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath, to find his slaves. He found them and brought them back home. 
1KI.2.41	When Solomon heard what Shimei had done, 
1KI.2.42	he sent for him and said, “I made you promise in the 
1KI.2.43	Why, then, have you broken your promise and disobeyed my command? 
1KI.2.44	You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David. The 
1KI.2.45	But he will bless me, and he will make David's kingdom secure forever.”
1KI.2.46	Then the king gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Shimei. Solomon was now in complete control.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. He brought her to live in David's City until he had finished building his palace, the Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. 
1KI.3.2	A temple had not yet been built for the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.5	That night the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon answered, “You always showed great love for my father David, your servant, and he was good, loyal, and honest in his relation with you. And you have continued to show him your great and constant love by giving him a son who today rules in his place. 
1KI.3.7	O 
1KI.3.8	Here I am among the people you have chosen to be your own, a people who are so many that they cannot be counted. 
1KI.3.9	So give me the wisdom I need to rule your people with justice and to know the difference between good and evil. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?”
1KI.3.10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this, 
1KI.3.11	and so he said to him, “Because you have asked for the wisdom to rule justly, instead of long life for yourself or riches or the death of your enemies, 
1KI.3.12	I will do what you have asked. I will give you more wisdom and understanding than anyone has ever had before or will ever have again. 
1KI.3.13	I will also give you what you have not asked for: all your life you will have wealth and honor, more than that of any other king. 
1KI.3.14	And if you obey me and keep my laws and commands, as your father David did, I will give you a long life.”
1KI.3.15	Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the 
1KI.3.16	One day two prostitutes came and presented themselves before King Solomon. 
1KI.3.17	One of them said, “Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a baby boy at home while she was there. 
1KI.3.18	Two days after my child was born, she also gave birth to a baby boy. Only the two of us were there in the house—no one else was present. 
1KI.3.19	Then one night she accidentally rolled over on her baby and smothered it. 
1KI.3.20	She got up during the night, took my son from my side while I was asleep, and carried him to her bed; then she put the dead child in my bed. 
1KI.3.21	The next morning, when I woke up and was going to nurse my baby, I saw that it was dead. I looked at it more closely and saw that it was not my child.”
1KI.3.22	But the other woman said, “No! The living child is mine, and the dead one is yours!”
1KI.3.22	The first woman answered back, “No! The dead child is yours, and the living one is mine!”
1KI.3.22	And so they argued before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then King Solomon said, “Each of you claims that the living child is hers and that the dead child belongs to the other one.” 
1KI.3.24	He sent for a sword, and when it was brought, 
1KI.3.25	he said, “Cut the living child in two and give each woman half of it.”
1KI.3.26	The real mother, her heart full of love for her son, said to the king, “Please, Your Majesty, don't kill the child! Give it to her!”
1KI.3.26	But the other woman said, “Don't give it to either of us; go on and cut it in two.”
1KI.3.27	Then Solomon said, “Don't kill the child! Give it to the first woman—she is its real mother.”
1KI.3.28	When the people of Israel heard of Solomon's decision, they were all filled with deep respect for him, because they knew then that God had given him the wisdom to settle disputes fairly.
1KI.4.1	Solomon was king of all Israel, 
1KI.4.2	and these were his high officials:
1KI.4.2	The priest: Azariah son of Zadok
1KI.4.3	The court secretaries: Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha

1KI.4.5	Chief of the district governors: Azariah son of Nathan
1KI.4.5	Royal Adviser: the priest Zabud son of Nathan
1KI.4.6	In charge of the palace servants: Ahishar
1KI.4.6	In charge of the forced labor: Adoniram son of Abda
1KI.4.7	Solomon appointed twelve men as district governors in Israel. They were to provide food from their districts for the king and his household, each man being responsible for one month out of the year. 
1KI.4.8	The following are the names of these twelve officers and the districts they were in charge of:
1KI.4.8	Benhur: the hill country of Ephraim
1KI.4.9	Bendeker: the cities of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, Elon, and Beth Hanan
1KI.4.10	Benhesed: the cities of Arubboth and Socoh and all the territory of Hepher
1KI.4.11	Benabinadab, who was married to Solomon's daughter Taphath: the whole region of Dor
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud: the cities of Taanach, Megiddo, and all the region near Beth Shan, near the town of Zarethan, south of the town of Jezreel, as far as the city of Abel Meholah and the city of Jokmeam
1KI.4.13	Bengeber: the city of Ramoth in Gilead, and the villages in Gilead belonging to the clan of Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, and the region of Argob in Bashan, sixty large towns in all, fortified with walls and with bronze bars on the gates
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo: the district of Mahanaim
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, who was married to Basemath, another of Solomon's daughters: the territory of Naphtali
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai: the region of Asher and the town of Bealoth
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah: the territory of Issachar
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela: the territory of Benjamin
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri: the region of Gilead, which had been ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan
1KI.4.19	Besides these twelve, there was one governor over the whole land.
1KI.4.20	The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; they ate and drank, and were happy. 
1KI.4.21	 Solomon's kingdom included all the nations from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border. They paid him taxes and were subject to him all his life.
1KI.4.22	The supplies Solomon needed each day were 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of meal; 
1KI.4.23	10 stall-fed cattle, 20 pasture-fed cattle, and 100 sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and poultry.
1KI.4.24	Solomon ruled over all the land west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah on the Euphrates as far west as the city of Gaza. All the kings west of the Euphrates were subject to him, and he was at peace with all the neighboring countries. 
1KI.4.25	As long as he lived, the people throughout Judah and Israel lived in safety, each family with its own grapevines and fig trees.
1KI.4.27	His twelve governors, each one in the month assigned to him, supplied the food King Solomon needed for himself and for all who ate in the palace; they always supplied everything needed. 
1KI.4.28	Each governor also supplied his share of barley and straw, where it was needed,
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon unusual wisdom and insight, and knowledge too great to be measured. 
1KI.4.30	Solomon was wiser than the wise men of the East or the wise men of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	 He was the wisest of all men: wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame spread throughout all the neighboring countries. 
1KI.4.32	 He composed three thousand proverbs and more than a thousand songs. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke of trees and plants, from the Lebanon cedars to the hyssop that grows on walls; he talked about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	Kings all over the world heard of his wisdom and sent people to listen to him.
1KI.5.1	King Hiram of Tyre had always been a friend of David's, and when he heard that Solomon had succeeded his father David as king, he sent ambassadors to him. 
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent back this message to Hiram: 
1KI.5.3	“You know that because of the constant wars my father David had to fight against the enemy countries all around him, he could not build a temple for the worship of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	 The 
1KI.5.6	So send your men to Lebanon to cut down cedars for me. My men will work with them, and I will pay your men whatever you decide. As you well know, my men don't know how to cut down trees as well as yours do.”
1KI.5.7	Hiram was extremely pleased when he received Solomon's message, and he said, “Praise the 
1KI.5.8	Then Hiram sent Solomon the following message: “I have received your message, and I am ready to do what you ask. I will provide the cedars and the pine trees. 
1KI.5.9	My men will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea and will tie them together in rafts to float them down the coast to the place you choose. There my men will untie them, and your men will take charge of them. On your part, I would like you to supply the food for my men.”
1KI.5.10	So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and pine logs that he wanted, 
1KI.5.11	and Solomon provided Hiram with 100,000 bushels of wheat and 110,000 gallons
1KI.5.12	The 
1KI.5.13	King Solomon drafted 30,000 men as forced labor from all over Israel, 
1KI.5.14	 and put Adoniram in charge of them. He divided them into three groups of 10,000 men, and each group spent one month in Lebanon and two months back home. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon also had 80,000 stone cutters in the hill country, with 70,000 men to carry the stones, 
1KI.5.16	and he placed 3,300 foremen in charge of them to supervise their work. 
1KI.5.17	At King Solomon's command they cut fine large stones for the foundation of the Temple. 
1KI.5.18	Solomon's and Hiram's workers and men from the city of Byblos prepared the stones and the timber to build the Temple.
1KI.6.1	Four hundred and eighty years after the people of Israel left Egypt, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the second month, the month of Ziv, Solomon began work on the Temple. 
1KI.6.2	Inside it was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
1KI.6.3	The entrance room was 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, as wide as the sanctuary itself. 
1KI.6.4	The walls of the Temple had openings in them, narrower on the outside than on the inside. 
1KI.6.5	Against the outside walls, on the sides and the back of the Temple, a three-storied annex was built, each story 7½ feet high. 
1KI.6.6	Each room in the lowest story was 7½ feet wide, in the middle story 9 feet wide, and in the top story 10½ feet wide. The Temple wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without having their beams built into it.
1KI.6.7	The stones with which the Temple was built had been prepared at the quarry, so that there was no noise made by hammers, axes, or any other iron tools as the Temple was being built.
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the lowest
1KI.6.9	So King Solomon finished building the Temple. He put in a ceiling made of beams and boards of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	The three-storied annex, each story
1KI.6.11	The 
1KI.6.12	“If you obey all my laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised your father David. 
1KI.6.13	I will live among my people Israel in this Temple that you are building, and I will never abandon them.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon finished building the Temple.
1KI.6.15	The inside walls were covered with cedar panels from the floor to the ceiling, and the floor was made of pine. 
1KI.6.16	 An inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was built in the rear of the Temple. It was 30 feet long and was partitioned off by cedar boards reaching from the floor to the ceiling.
1KI.6.17	The room in front of the Most Holy Place was 60 feet long. 
1KI.6.18	The cedar panels were decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers; the whole interior was covered with cedar, so that the stones of the walls could not be seen.
1KI.6.19	In the rear of the Temple an inner room was built, where the 
1KI.6.20	This inner room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high, all covered with pure gold. The altar was covered with cedar panels.
1KI.6.21	The inside of the Temple was covered with gold, and gold chains were placed across the entrance of the inner room, which was also covered with gold. 
1KI.6.22	 The whole interior of the Temple was covered with gold, as well as the altar in the Most Holy Place.
1KI.6.24+1KI.6.25+1KI.6.26	Both were of the same size and shape. Each had two wings, each wing 7½ feet long, so that the distance from one wing tip to the other was 15 feet. 
1KI.6.27	They were placed side by side in the Most Holy Place, so that two of their outstretched wings touched each other in the middle of the room, and the other two wings touched the walls. 
1KI.6.28	The two winged creatures were covered with gold.
1KI.6.29	The walls of the main room and of the inner room were all decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers. 
1KI.6.30	Even the floor was covered with gold.
1KI.6.31	A double door made of olive wood was set in place at the entrance of the Most Holy Place; the top of the doorway was a pointed arch. 
1KI.6.32	The doors were decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers. The doors, the winged creatures, and the palm trees were covered with gold. 
1KI.6.33	For the entrance to the main room a rectangular doorframe of olive wood was made. 
1KI.6.34	There were two folding doors made of pine 
1KI.6.35	and decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers, which were evenly covered with gold.
1KI.6.36	An inner court was built in front of the Temple, enclosed with walls which had one layer of cedar beams for every three layers of stone.
1KI.6.37	The foundation of the Temple was laid in the second month, the month of Ziv, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. 
1KI.6.38	In the eighth month, the month of Bul, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, the Temple was completely finished exactly as it had been planned. It had taken Solomon seven years to build it.
1KI.7.1	Solomon also built a palace for himself, and it took him thirteen years. 
1KI.7.2+1KI.7.3	The Hall of the Forest of Lebanon
1KI.7.4	On each of the two side walls there were three rows of windows. 
1KI.7.5	The doorways and the windows
1KI.7.6	The Hall of Columns was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. It had a covered porch, supported by columns.
1KI.7.7	The Throne Room, also called the Hall of Judgment, where Solomon decided cases, had cedar panels from the floor to the rafters.
1KI.7.9	All these buildings and the great court were made of fine stones from the foundations to the eaves. The stones were prepared at the quarry and cut to measure, with their inner and outer sides trimmed with saws. 
1KI.7.10	The foundations were made of large stones prepared at the quarry, some of them twelve feet long and others fifteen feet long. 
1KI.7.11	On top of them were other stones, cut to measure, and cedar beams. 
1KI.7.12	The palace court, the inner court of the Temple, and the entrance room of the Temple had walls with one layer of cedar beams for every three layers of cut stones.
1KI.7.13	King Solomon sent for a man named Huram, a craftsman living in the city of Tyre, who was skilled in bronze work. 
1KI.7.14	His father, who was no longer living, was from Tyre, and had also been a skilled bronze craftsman; his mother was from the tribe of Naphtali. Huram was an intelligent and experienced craftsman. He accepted King Solomon's invitation to be in charge of all the bronze work.
1KI.7.15	Huram cast two bronze columns, each one 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference,
1KI.7.16	He also made two bronze capitals, each one 7½ feet tall, to be placed on top of the columns. 
1KI.7.17	The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains
1KI.7.18	and two rows of bronze pomegranates.
1KI.7.19	The capitals were shaped like lilies, 6 feet tall, 
1KI.7.20	and were placed on a rounded section which was above the chain design. There were 200 pomegranates in two rows around each
1KI.7.21	Huram placed these two bronze columns in front of the entrance of the Temple: the one on the south side was named Jachin
1KI.7.22	The lily-shaped bronze capitals were on top of the columns.
1KI.7.22	And so the work on the columns was completed.
1KI.7.23	Huram made a round tank of bronze, 7½ feet deep, 15 feet in diameter, and 45 feet in circumference. 
1KI.7.24	All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank
1KI.7.25	The tank rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward, three facing in each direction. 
1KI.7.26	The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a lily. The tank held about 10,000 gallons.
1KI.7.27	Huram also made ten bronze carts; each was 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4½ feet high. 
1KI.7.28	They were made of square panels which were set in frames, 
1KI.7.29	with the figures of lions, bulls, and winged creatures on the panels; and on the frames, above and underneath the lions and bulls, there were spiral figures in relief. 
1KI.7.30	Each cart had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. At the four corners were bronze supports for a basin; the supports were decorated with spiral figures in relief. 
1KI.7.31	There was a circular frame on top for the basin. It projected upward 18 inches from the top of the cart and 7 inches down into it. It had carvings around it. 
1KI.7.32	The wheels were 25 inches high; they were under the panels, and the axles were of one piece with the carts. 
1KI.7.33	The wheels were like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of bronze. 
1KI.7.34	There were four supports at the bottom corners of each cart, which were of one piece with the cart. 
1KI.7.35	There was a 9-inch band around the top of each cart; its supports and the panels were of one piece with the cart. 
1KI.7.36	The supports and panels were decorated with figures of winged creatures, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was space for them, with spiral figures all around. 
1KI.7.37	This, then, is how the carts were made; they were all alike, having the same size and shape.
1KI.7.39	He placed five of the carts on the south side of the Temple, and the other five on the north side; the tank he placed at the southeast corner.
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	Huram also made pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed all his work for King Solomon for the 
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The two columns
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the columns
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The design of interwoven chains on each capital
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The 400 bronze pomegranates, in two rows of 100 each around the design on each capital
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The ten carts
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The ten basins
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The tank
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The twelve bulls supporting the tank
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	The pots, shovels, and bowls
1KI.7.40+1KI.7.41+1KI.7.42+1KI.7.43+1KI.7.44+1KI.7.45	All this equipment for the Temple, which Huram made for King Solomon, was of polished bronze. 
1KI.7.46	The king had it all made in the foundry between Sukkoth and Zarethan, in the Jordan Valley. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon did not have these bronze objects weighed, because there were too many of them, and so their weight was never determined.
1KI.7.49	 the ten lampstands that stood in front of the Most Holy Place, five on the south side and five on the north; the flowers, lamps, and tongs; 
1KI.7.50	the cups, lamp snuffers, bowls, dishes for incense, and the pans used for carrying live coals; and the hinges for the doors of the Most Holy Place and of the outer doors of the Temple. All these furnishings were made of gold.
1KI.8.2	 They all assembled during the Festival of Shelters in the seventh month, in the month of Ethanim. 
1KI.8.3	When all the leaders had gathered, the priests lifted the Covenant Box 
1KI.8.4	and carried it to the Temple. The Levites and the priests also moved the Tent of the 
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle—too many to count. 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests carried the Covenant Box into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the winged creatures. 
1KI.8.7	Their outstretched wings covered the box and the poles it was carried by. 
1KI.8.8	The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.) 
1KI.8.9	 There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the 
1KI.8.11	shining with the dazzling light of the 
1KI.8.12	 Then Solomon prayed:
1KI.8.12	“You, 
1KI.8.12	yet you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness.
1KI.8.13	Now I have built a majestic temple for you,
1KI.8.13	a place for you to live in forever.”
1KI.8.14	As the people stood there, King Solomon turned to face them, and he asked God's blessing on them. 
1KI.8.15	He said, “Praise the 
1KI.8.16	 ‘From the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen any city in all the land of Israel in which a temple should be built where I would be worshiped. But I chose you, David, to rule my people.’”
1KI.8.18	but the 
1KI.8.19	 but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.’
1KI.8.20	“And now the 
1KI.8.21	I have also provided a place in the Temple for the Covenant Box containing the stone tablets of the covenant which the 
1KI.8.22	Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar, where he raised his arms 
1KI.8.23	and prayed, “
1KI.8.24	You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled. 
1KI.8.25	 And now, 
1KI.8.26	So now, O God of Israel, let everything come true that you promised to my father David, your servant.
1KI.8.28	 my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer, and grant the requests I make to you today. 
1KI.8.29	 Watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have chosen to be worshiped. Hear me when I face this Temple and pray. 
1KI.8.30	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us.
1KI.8.31	“When a person is accused of wronging another and is brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that he is innocent, 
1KI.8.32	O 
1KI.8.33	“When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness, 
1KI.8.34	listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	“When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you, and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you, 
1KI.8.36	listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of the king and of the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O 
1KI.8.37	“When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them, 
1KI.8.38	listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
1KI.8.39	hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven, forgive them, and help them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each person as he deserves, 
1KI.8.40	so that your people may obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors.
1KI.8.41+1KI.8.42	“When a foreigner who lives in a distant land hears of your fame and of the great things you have done for your people and comes to worship you and to pray at this Temple, 
1KI.8.43	listen to his prayer. In heaven, where you live, hear him and do what he asks you to do, so that all the peoples of the world may know you and obey you, as your people Israel do. Then they will know that this Temple I have built is the place where you are to be worshiped.
1KI.8.44	“When you command your people to go into battle against their enemies and they pray to you, wherever they are, facing this city which you have chosen and this Temple which I have built for you, 
1KI.8.45	listen to their prayers. Hear them in heaven and give them victory.
1KI.8.46	“When your people sin against you—and there is no one who does not sin—and in your anger you let their enemies defeat them and take them as prisoners to some other land, even if that land is far away, 
1KI.8.47	listen to your people's prayers. If there in that land they repent and pray to you, confessing how sinful and wicked they have been, hear their prayers, O 
1KI.8.48	If in that land they truly and sincerely repent and pray to you as they face toward this land which you gave to our ancestors, this city which you have chosen, and this Temple which I have built for you, 
1KI.8.49	then listen to their prayers. In your home in heaven hear them and be merciful to them. 
1KI.8.50	Forgive all their sins and their rebellion against you, and make their enemies treat them with kindness. 
1KI.8.51	They are your own people, whom you brought out of Egypt, that blazing furnace.
1KI.8.52	“Sovereign 
1KI.8.53	You chose them from all the peoples to be your own people, as you told them through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt.”
1KI.8.54	After Solomon had finished praying to the 
1KI.8.55	In a loud voice he asked God's blessings on all the people assembled there. He said, 
1KI.8.56	 “Praise the 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	may he make us obedient to him, so that we will always live as he wants us to live, keeping all the laws and commands he gave our ancestors. 
1KI.8.59	May the 
1KI.8.60	And so all the nations of the world will know that the 
1KI.8.61	May you, his people, always be faithful to the 
1KI.8.62	Then King Solomon and all the people there offered sacrifices to the 
1KI.8.63	He sacrificed 22,000 head of cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings. And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple. 
1KI.8.64	That same day he also consecrated the central part of the courtyard, the area in front of the Temple, and then he offered there the sacrifices burned whole, the grain offerings, and the fat of the animals for the fellowship offerings. He did this because the bronze altar was too small for all these offerings.
1KI.8.65	There at the Temple, Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day Solomon sent the people home. They all praised him and went home happy because of all the blessings that the 
1KI.9.1	After King Solomon had finished building the Temple and the palace and everything else he wanted to build, 
1KI.9.2	 the

1KI.9.4	If you will serve me in honesty and integrity, as your father David did, and if you obey my laws and do everything I have commanded you, 
1KI.9.5	 I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants. 
1KI.9.6	But if you or your descendants stop following me, disobey the laws and commands I have given you, and worship other gods, 
1KI.9.7	then I will remove my people Israel from the land that I have given them. I will also abandon this Temple which I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule Israel and treat her with contempt. 
1KI.9.8	 This Temple will become a pile of ruins,
1KI.9.9	People will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the 
1KI.9.10	It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace. 
1KI.9.11	King Hiram of Tyre had provided him with all the cedar and pine and with all the gold he wanted for this work. After it was finished, King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	Hiram went to see them, and he did not like them. 
1KI.9.13	So he said to Solomon, “So these, my brother, are the towns you have given me!” For this reason the area is still called Cabul.
1KI.9.14	Hiram had sent Solomon almost five tons of gold.
1KI.9.15	King Solomon used forced labor to build the Temple and the palace, to fill in land on the east side of the city, and to build the city wall. He also used it to rebuild the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. ( 
1KI.9.16	The king of Egypt had attacked Gezer and captured it, killing its inhabitants and setting fire to the city. Then he gave it as a wedding present to his daughter when she married Solomon, 
1KI.9.17	and Solomon rebuilt it.) Using his forced labor, Solomon also rebuilt Lower Beth Horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness of Judah, 
1KI.9.19	the cities where his supplies were kept, the cities for his horses and chariots, and everything else he wanted to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and elsewhere in his kingdom. 
1KI.9.20+1KI.9.21	For his forced labor Solomon used the descendants of the people of Canaan whom the Israelites had not killed when they took possession of their land. These included Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, whose descendants continue to be slaves down to the present time. 
1KI.9.22	Solomon did not make slaves of Israelites; they served as his soldiers, officers, commanders, chariot captains, and cavalry.
1KI.9.23	There were 550 officials in charge of the forced labor working on Solomon's various building projects.
1KI.9.24	Solomon filled in the land on the east side of the city, after his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, had moved from David's City to the palace Solomon built for her.
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Eziongeber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	King Hiram sent some experienced sailors from his fleet to serve with Solomon's men. 
1KI.9.28	They sailed to the land of Ophir and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold.
1KI.10.2	She brought with her a large group of attendants, as well as camels loaded with spices, jewels, and a large amount of gold. When she and Solomon met, she asked him all the questions that she could think of. 
1KI.10.3	He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain. 
1KI.10.4	The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built. 
1KI.10.5	She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered in the Temple. It left her breathless and amazed. 
1KI.10.6	She said to King Solomon, “What I heard in my own country about you
1KI.10.7	But I couldn't believe it until I had come and seen it all for myself. But I didn't hear even half of it; your wisdom and wealth are much greater than what I was told. 
1KI.10.8	How fortunate are your wives!
1KI.10.9	Praise the 
1KI.10.10	She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought: almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. The amount of spices she gave him was by far the greatest that he ever received at any time.
1KI.10.10	( 
1KI.10.11	Hiram's fleet, which had brought gold from Ophir, also brought from there a large amount of juniper wood and jewels. 
1KI.10.12	Solomon used the wood to build railings in the Temple and the palace, and also to make harps and lyres for the musicians. It was the finest juniper wood ever imported into Israel; none like it has ever been seen again.)
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for, besides all the other customary gifts that he had generously given her. Then she and her attendants returned to the land of Sheba.
1KI.10.14	Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold, 
1KI.10.15	in addition to the taxes
1KI.10.16	Solomon made two hundred large shields and had each one overlaid with almost fifteen pounds of gold. 
1KI.10.17	He also made three hundred smaller shields, overlaying each one of them with nearly four pounds of gold. He had all these shields placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon.
1KI.10.18	He also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with the finest gold. 
1KI.10.19+1KI.10.20	The throne had six steps leading up to it, with the figure of a lion at each end of every step, a total of twelve lions. At the back of the throne was the figure of a bull's head, and beside each of the two armrests was the figure of a lion. No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom.
1KI.10.21	All of Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. No silver was used, since it was not considered valuable in Solomon's day. 
1KI.10.22	He had a fleet of ocean-going ships sailing with Hiram's fleet. Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.
1KI.10.23	King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king, 
1KI.10.24	and the whole world wanted to come and listen to the wisdom that God had given him. 
1KI.10.25	Everyone who came brought him a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year.
1KI.10.27	 During his reign silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
1KI.10.28	 The king's agents controlled the export of horses from Musri
1KI.10.29	and the export of chariots from Egypt. They supplied the Hittite and Syrian kings with horses and chariots, selling chariots for 600 pieces of silver each and horses for 150 each.
1KI.11.2	 He married them even though the 
1KI.11.3	Solomon married seven hundred princesses and also had three hundred concubines. They made him turn away from God, 
1KI.11.4	and by the time he was old they had led him into the worship of foreign gods. He was not faithful to the 
1KI.11.5	He worshiped Astarte, the goddess of Sidon, and Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. 
1KI.11.6	He sinned against the 
1KI.11.7	On the mountain east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	He also built places of worship where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.
1KI.11.9+1KI.11.10	Even though the 
1KI.11.11	and said to him, “Because you have deliberately broken your covenant with me and disobeyed my commands, I promise that I will take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your officials. 
1KI.11.12	However, for the sake of your father David I will not do this in your lifetime, but during the reign of your son. 
1KI.11.13	And I will not take the whole kingdom away from him; instead, I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have made my own.”
1KI.11.14	So the 
1KI.11.15+1KI.11.16	Long before this, when David had conquered Edom, Joab the commander of his army had gone there to bury the dead. He and his men remained in Edom six months, and during that time they killed every male in Edom 
1KI.11.17	except Hadad and some of his father's Edomite servants, who escaped to Egypt. (At that time Hadad was just a child.) 
1KI.11.18	They left Midian and went to Paran, where some other men joined them. Then they traveled to Egypt and went to the king, who gave Hadad some land and a house and provided him with food. 
1KI.11.19	Hadad won the friendship of the king, and the king gave his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, to Hadad in marriage. 
1KI.11.20	She bore him a son, Genubath, who was raised by the queen in the palace, where he lived with the king's sons.
1KI.11.21	When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David had died and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to the king, “Let me go back to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	“Why?” the king asked. “Have I failed to give you something? Is that why you want to go back home?”
1KI.11.22	“Just let me go,” Hadad answered the king. And he went back to his country.
1KI.11.22	As king of Edom, Hadad was an evil, bitter enemy of Israel.
1KI.11.23	God also caused Rezon son of Eliada to turn against Solomon. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
1KI.11.24	and had become the leader of a gang of outlaws. (This happened after David had defeated Hadadezer and had slaughtered his Syrian allies.) Rezon and his gang went and lived in Damascus, where his followers made him king of Syria. 
1KI.11.25	He was an enemy of Israel during the lifetime of Solomon.
1KI.11.26	Another man who turned against King Solomon was one of his officials, Jeroboam son of Nebat, from Zeredah in Ephraim. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. 
1KI.11.27	This is the story of the revolt.
1KI.11.27	Solomon was filling in the land on the east side of Jerusalem and repairing the city walls. 
1KI.11.28	Jeroboam was an able young man, and when Solomon noticed how hard he worked, he put him in charge of all the forced labor in the territory of the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim. 
1KI.11.29	One day, as Jeroboam was traveling from Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him alone on the road in the open country. 
1KI.11.30	Ahijah took off the new robe he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, 
1KI.11.31	and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, because the 
1KI.11.32	Solomon will keep one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to be my own from the whole land of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has
1KI.11.34	But I will not take the whole kingdom away from Solomon, and I will keep him in power as long as he lives. This I will do for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who obeyed my laws and commands. 
1KI.11.35	I will take the kingdom away from Solomon's son and will give you ten tribes, 
1KI.11.36	but I will let Solomon's son keep one tribe, so that I will always have a descendant of my servant David ruling in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen as the place where I am worshiped. 
1KI.11.37	Jeroboam, I will make you king of Israel, and you will rule over all the territory that you want. 
1KI.11.38	If you obey me completely, live by my laws, and win my approval by doing what I command, as my servant David did, I will always be with you. I will make you king of Israel and will make sure that your descendants rule after you, just as I have done for David. 
1KI.11.39	Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David, but not for all time.’”
1KI.11.40	And so Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he escaped to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon's death.
1KI.11.41	Everything else that Solomon did, his career, and his wisdom, are all recorded in 
1KI.11.42	He was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
1KI.11.43	He died and was buried in David's City, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned from
1KI.12.3	The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and then they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father Solomon treated us harshly and placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects.”
1KI.12.5	“Come back in three days and I will give you my answer,” he replied. So they left.
1KI.12.6	King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. “What answer do you advise me to give these people?” he asked.
1KI.12.7	They replied, “If you want to serve this people well, give a favorable answer to their request, and they will always serve you loyally.”
1KI.12.8	But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers. 
1KI.12.9	“What do you advise me to do?” he asked. “What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?”
1KI.12.10	They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist!’ 
1KI.12.11	Tell them, ‘My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!’”
1KI.12.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them. 
1KI.12.13	The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people, 
1KI.12.14	as the younger men had advised. He said, “My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!” 
1KI.12.15	It was the will of the 
1KI.12.16	So the people of Israel rebelled, 
1KI.12.17	leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah.
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David.
1KI.12.20	When the people of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they invited him to a meeting of the people and made him king of Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David's descendants.
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel. 
1KI.12.22	But God told the prophet Shemaiah 
1KI.12.23	to give this message to Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin: 
1KI.12.24	“Do not attack your own relatives, the people of Israel. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will.” They all obeyed the 
1KI.12.25	King Jeroboam of Israel fortified the town of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there for a while. Then he left and fortified the town of Penuel. 
1KI.12.26+1KI.12.27	He said to himself, “As things are now, if my people go to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices to the 
1KI.12.29	He placed one of the gold bull-calves in Bethel and the other in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	And so the people sinned, going to worship in Bethel and in Dan.
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam also built places of worship on hilltops, and he chose priests from families who were not of the tribe of Levi.
1KI.12.33	And on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the day that he himself had set, he went to Bethel and offered a sacrifice on the altar in celebration of the festival he had instituted for the people of Israel.
1KI.13.1	At the 
1KI.13.2	 Following the 
1KI.13.3	And the prophet went on to say, “This altar will fall apart, and the ashes on it will be scattered. Then you will know that the 
1KI.13.4	When King Jeroboam heard this, he pointed at him and ordered, “Seize that man!” At once the king's arm became paralyzed so that he couldn't pull it back. 
1KI.13.5	The altar suddenly fell apart and the ashes spilled to the ground, as the prophet had predicted in the name of the 
1KI.13.6	King Jeroboam said to the prophet, “Please pray for me to the 
1KI.13.6	The prophet prayed to the 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the prophet, “Come home with me and have something to eat. I will reward you for what you have done.”
1KI.13.8	The prophet answered, “Even if you gave me half of your wealth, I would not go with you or eat or drink anything with you. 
1KI.13.9	The 
1KI.13.10	So he did not go back the same way he had come, but by another road.
1KI.13.11	At that time there was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons
1KI.13.12	“Which way did he go when he left?” the old prophet asked them. They showed him
1KI.13.13	and he told them to saddle his donkey for him. They did so, and he rode off 
1KI.13.14	down the road after the prophet from Judah and found him sitting under an oak tree. “Are you the prophet from Judah?” he asked.
1KI.13.14	“I am,” the man answered.
1KI.13.15	“Come home and have a meal with me,” he said.
1KI.13.16	But the prophet from Judah answered, “I can't go home with you or accept your hospitality. And I won't eat or drink anything with you here, 
1KI.13.17	because the 
1KI.13.18	Then the old prophet from Bethel said to him, “I, too, am a prophet just like you, and at the 
1KI.13.19	So the prophet from Judah went home with the old prophet and had a meal with him. 
1KI.13.20	As they were sitting at the table, the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried out to the prophet from Judah, “The 
1KI.13.22	Instead, you returned and ate a meal in a place he had ordered you not to eat in. Because of this you will be killed, and your body will not be buried in your family grave.”
1KI.13.23	After they had finished eating, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet from Judah, 
1KI.13.24	who rode off. On the way a lion met him and killed him. His body lay on the road, and the donkey and the lion stood beside it. 
1KI.13.25	Some men passed by and saw the body on the road, with the lion standing near by. They went on into Bethel and reported what they had seen.
1KI.13.26	When the old prophet heard about it, he said, “That is the prophet who disobeyed the 
1KI.13.27	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle my donkey for me.” They did so, 
1KI.13.28	and he rode off and found the prophet's body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing by it. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	The old prophet picked up the body, put it on the donkey, and brought it back to Bethel to mourn over it and bury it. 
1KI.13.30	He buried it in his own family grave, and he and his sons mourned over it, saying, “Oh my brother, my brother!” 
1KI.13.31	After the burial the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in this grave and lay my body next to his. 
1KI.13.32	The words that he spoke at the 
1KI.13.33	King Jeroboam of Israel still did not turn from his evil ways but continued to choose priests from ordinary families to serve at the altars he had built. He ordained as priest anyone who wanted to be one. 
1KI.13.34	This sin on his part brought about the ruin and total destruction of his dynasty.
1KI.14.1	At that time King Jeroboam's son Abijah got sick. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you, and go to Shiloh, where the prophet Ahijah lives, the one who said I would be king of Israel. 
1KI.14.3	Take him ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Ask him what is going to happen to our son, and he will tell you.”
1KI.14.4	So she went to Ahijah's home in Shiloh. Old age had made Ahijah blind. 
1KI.14.5	The 
1KI.14.5	When Jeroboam's wife arrived, she pretended to be someone else. 
1KI.14.6	But when Ahijah heard her coming in the door, he said, “Come in. I know you are Jeroboam's wife. Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have bad news for you. 
1KI.14.7	Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what the 
1KI.14.8	I took the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who was completely loyal to me, obeyed my commands, and did only what I approve of. 
1KI.14.9	You have committed far greater sins than those who ruled before you. You have rejected me and have aroused my anger by making idols and metal images to worship. 
1KI.14.10	 Because of this I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will kill all your male descendants, young and old alike. I will get rid of your family; they will be swept away like dung. 
1KI.14.11	Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures. I, the 
1KI.14.12	And Ahijah went on to say to Jeroboam's wife, “Now go back home. As soon as you enter the town, your son will die. 
1KI.14.13	All the people of Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He will be the only member of Jeroboam's family who will be properly buried, because he is the only one with whom the 
1KI.14.14	The 
1KI.14.15	The 
1KI.14.16	The 
1KI.14.17	Jeroboam's wife went back to Tirzah. Just as she entered her home, the child died. 
1KI.14.18	The people of Israel mourned for him and buried him, as the 
1KI.14.19	Everything else that King Jeroboam did, the wars he fought and how he ruled, are all recorded in 
1KI.14.20	Jeroboam ruled as king for twenty-two years. He died and was buried, and his son Nadab succeeded him as king.
1KI.14.21	Solomon's son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	The people of Judah sinned against the 
1KI.14.23	 They built places of worship for false gods and put up stone pillars and symbols of Asherah to worship on the hills and under shady trees. 
1KI.14.24	 Worst of all, there were men and women who served as prostitutes at those pagan places of worship. The people of Judah practiced all the shameful things done by the people whom the 
1KI.14.26	 He took away all the treasures in the Temple and in the palace, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 
1KI.14.27	To replace them, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates. 
1KI.14.28	Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom.
1KI.14.29	Everything else that King Rehoboam did is recorded in 
1KI.14.30	During all this time Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly at war with each other. 
1KI.14.31	Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah, 
1KI.15.2	and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. 
1KI.15.3	He committed the same sins as his father and was not completely loyal to the 
1KI.15.4	 But for David's sake the 
1KI.15.5	 The 
1KI.15.6	 The war which had begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued throughout Abijah's lifetime. 
1KI.15.7	And everything else that Abijah did is recorded in 
1KI.15.8	Abijah died and was buried in David's City, and his son Asa succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa became king of Judah, 
1KI.15.10	and he ruled forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. 
1KI.15.11	Asa did what pleased the 
1KI.15.12	 He expelled from the country all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan places of worship, and he removed all the idols his predecessors had made. 
1KI.15.13	He removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol and burned it in Kidron Valley. 
1KI.15.14	Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship, he remained faithful to the 
1KI.15.15	He placed in the Temple all the objects his father had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated.
1KI.15.16	King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	So King Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the Temple and the palace, and sent it by some of his officials to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion, with this message: 
1KI.15.19	“Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory.”
1KI.15.20	King Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, the area near Lake Galilee, and the whole territory of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When King Baasha heard what had happened, he stopped fortifying Ramah and went to Tirzah.
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa sent out an order throughout all of Judah requiring everyone, without exception, to help carry away from Ramah the stones and timber that Baasha had been using to fortify it. With this material Asa fortified Mizpah and Geba, a city in the territory of Benjamin.
1KI.15.23	Everything else that King Asa did, his brave deeds and the towns he fortified, are all recorded in 
1KI.15.24	Asa died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.25	In the second year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Jeroboam's son Nadab became king of Israel, and he ruled for two years. 
1KI.15.26	Like his father before him, he sinned against the 
1KI.15.27	Baasha son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar, plotted against Nadab and killed him as Nadab and his army were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia. 
1KI.15.28	This happened during the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah. And so Baasha succeeded Nadab as king of Israel. 
1KI.15.29	 At once he began killing all the members of Jeroboam's family. In accordance with what the 
1KI.15.30	This happened because Jeroboam aroused the anger of the 
1KI.15.31	Everything else that Nadab did is recorded in 
1KI.15.32	King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against the 
1KI.16.1	The 
1KI.16.2	“You were a nobody, but I made you the leader of my people Israel. And now you have sinned like Jeroboam and have led my people into sin. Their sins have aroused my anger, 
1KI.16.3	and so I will do away with you and your family, just as I did with Jeroboam. 
1KI.16.4	Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures.”
1KI.16.5	Everything else that Baasha did and all his brave deeds are recorded in 
1KI.16.6	Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah succeeded him as king.
1KI.16.7	That message from the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for two years. 
1KI.16.9	Zimri, one of his officers who was in charge of half of the king's chariots, plotted against him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk in the home of Arza, who was in charge of the palace. 
1KI.16.10	Zimri entered the house, assassinated Elah, and succeeded him as king. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah.
1KI.16.11	As soon as Zimri became king he killed off all the members of Baasha's family. Every male relative and friend was put to death. 
1KI.16.12	And so, in accordance with what the 
1KI.16.13	Because of their idolatry and because they led Israel into sin, Baasha and his son Elah had aroused the anger of the 
1KI.16.14	Everything else that Elah did is recorded in 
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Zimri ruled in Tirzah over Israel for seven days. The Israelite troops were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia, 
1KI.16.16	and when they heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and assassinated him, then and there they all proclaimed their commander Omri king of Israel. 
1KI.16.17	Omri and his troops left Gibbethon and went and besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city had fallen, he went into the palace's inner fortress, set the palace on fire, and died in the flames. 
1KI.16.19	This happened because of his sins against the 
1KI.16.20	Everything else that Zimri did, including the account of his conspiracy, is recorded in 
1KI.16.21	The people of Israel were divided: some of them wanted to make Tibni son of Ginath king, and the others were in favor of Omri. 
1KI.16.22	In the end, those in favor of Omri won out; Tibni died and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	So in the thirty-first year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled for twelve years. The first six years he ruled in Tirzah, 
1KI.16.24	and then he bought the hill of Samaria for six thousand pieces of silver from a man named Shemer. Omri fortified the hill, built a town there, and named it Samaria, after Shemer, the former owner of the hill.
1KI.16.25	Omri sinned against the 
1KI.16.26	Like Jeroboam before him, he aroused the anger of the 
1KI.16.27	Everything else that Omri did and all his accomplishments are recorded in 
1KI.16.28	Omri died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab succeeded him as king.
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	He sinned against the 
1KI.16.31	It was not enough for him to sin like King Jeroboam; he went further and married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon, and worshiped Baal. 
1KI.16.32	He built a temple to Baal in Samaria, made an altar for him, and put it in the temple. 
1KI.16.33	He also put up an image of the goddess Asherah. He did more to arouse the anger of the 
1KI.16.34	 During his reign Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho. As the 
1KI.17.2	Then the 
1KI.17.3	“Leave this place and go east and hide yourself near Cherith Brook, east of the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	The brook will supply you with water to drink, and I have commanded ravens to bring you food there.”
1KI.17.5	Elijah obeyed the 
1KI.17.6	He drank water from the brook, and ravens brought him bread and meat every morning and every evening. 
1KI.17.7	After a while the brook dried up because of the lack of rain.
1KI.17.8	Then the 
1KI.17.9	 “Now go to the town of Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay there. I have commanded a widow who lives there to feed you.” 
1KI.17.10	So Elijah went to Zarephath, and as he came to the town gate, he saw a widow gathering firewood. “Please bring me a drink of water,” he said to her. 
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to get it, he called out, “And please bring me some bread, too.”
1KI.17.12	She answered, “By the living 
1KI.17.13	“Don't worry,” Elijah said to her. “Go on and prepare your meal. But first make a small loaf from what you have and bring it to me, and then prepare the rest for you and your son. 
1KI.17.14	For this is what the 
1KI.17.15	The widow went and did as Elijah had told her, and all of them had enough food for many days. 
1KI.17.16	As the 
1KI.17.17	Some time later the widow's son got sick; he got worse and worse, and finally he died. 
1KI.17.18	She said to Elijah, “Man of God, why did you do this to me? Did you come here to remind God of my sins and so cause my son's death?”
1KI.17.19	“Give the boy to me,” Elijah said. He took the boy from her arms, carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying, and laid him on the bed. 
1KI.17.20	Then he prayed aloud, “O 
1KI.17.21	 Then Elijah stretched himself out on the boy three times and prayed, “O 
1KI.17.22	The 
1KI.17.23	Elijah took the boy back downstairs to his mother and said to her, “Look, your son is alive!”
1KI.17.24	She answered, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the 
1KI.18.1	After some time, in the third year of the drought, the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah started out.
1KI.18.2	The famine in Samaria was at its worst, 
1KI.18.3	so Ahab called in Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devout worshiper of the 
1KI.18.4	and when Jezebel was killing the 
1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “Let us go and look
1KI.18.6	They agreed on which part of the land each one would explore, and set off in different directions.
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was on his way, he suddenly met Elijah. He recognized him, bowed low before him, and asked, “Is it really you, sir?”
1KI.18.8	“Yes, I'm Elijah,” he answered. “Go and tell your master the king that I am here.”
1KI.18.9	Obadiah answered, “What have I done that you want to put me in danger of being killed by King Ahab? 
1KI.18.10	By the living 
1KI.18.11	And now you want me to go and tell him that you are here? 
1KI.18.12	What if the spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Haven't you heard that when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	So how can you order me to go and tell the king that you are here? He will kill me!”
1KI.18.15	Elijah answered, “By the living 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to King Ahab and told him, and Ahab set off to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw him, he said, “So there you are—the worst troublemaker in Israel!”
1KI.18.18	“I'm not the troublemaker,” Elijah answered. “You are—you and your father. You are disobeying the 
1KI.18.19	Now order all the people of Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel. Bring along the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the goddess Asherah who are supported by Queen Jezebel.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and the prophets of Baal to meet at Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Elijah went up to the people and said, “How much longer will it take you to make up your minds? If the 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said, “I am the only prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Bring two bulls; let the prophets of Baal take one, kill it, cut it in pieces, and put it on the wood—but don't light the fire. I will do the same with the other bull. 
1KI.18.24	Then let the prophets of Baal pray to their god, and I will pray to the 
1KI.18.24	The people shouted their approval.
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since there are so many of you, you take a bull and prepare it first. Pray to your god, but don't set fire to the wood.”
1KI.18.26	They took the bull that was brought to them, prepared it, and prayed to Baal until noon. They shouted, “Answer us, Baal!” and kept dancing around the altar they had built. But no answer came.
1KI.18.27	At noon Elijah started making fun of them: “Pray louder! He is a god! Maybe he is day-dreaming or relieving himself, or perhaps he's gone off on a trip! Or maybe he's sleeping, and you've got to wake him up!” 
1KI.18.28	So the prophets prayed louder and cut themselves with knives and daggers, according to their ritual, until blood flowed. 
1KI.18.29	They kept on ranting and raving until the middle of the afternoon; but no answer came, not a sound was heard.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to the people, “Come closer to me,” and they all gathered around him. He set about repairing the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	 He took twelve stones, one for each of the twelve tribes named for the sons of Jacob, the man to whom the 
1KI.18.32	With these stones he rebuilt the altar for the worship of the 
1KI.18.33	Then he placed the wood on the altar, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the offering and the wood.” They did so, 
1KI.18.34	and he said, “Do it again”—and they did. “Do it once more,” he said—and they did. 
1KI.18.35	The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench.
1KI.18.36	At the hour of the afternoon sacrifice the prophet Elijah approached the altar and prayed, “O 
1KI.18.37	Answer me, 
1KI.18.38	The 
1KI.18.39	When the people saw this, they threw themselves on the ground and exclaimed, “The 
1KI.18.40	Elijah ordered, “Seize the prophets of Baal; don't let any of them get away!” The people seized them all, and Elijah led them down to Kishon Brook and killed them.
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Now, go and eat. I hear the roar of rain approaching.” 
1KI.18.42	 While Ahab went to eat, Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel, where he bowed down to the ground, with his head between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	He said to his servant, “Go and look toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	The servant went and returned, saying, “I didn't see a thing.” Seven times in all Elijah told him to go and look. 
1KI.18.44	The seventh time he returned and said, “I saw a little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, coming up from the sea.”
1KI.18.44	Elijah ordered his servant, “Go to King Ahab and tell him to get in his chariot and go back home before the rain stops him.”
1KI.18.45	In a little while the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind began to blow, and a heavy rain began to fall. Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	The power of the 
1KI.19.1	King Ahab told his wife Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets of Baal to death. 
1KI.19.2	She sent a message to Elijah: “May the gods strike me dead if by this time tomorrow I don't do the same thing to you that you did to the prophets.” 
1KI.19.3	Elijah was afraid and fled for his life; he took his servant and went to Beersheba in Judah.
1KI.19.3	Leaving the servant there, 
1KI.19.4	 Elijah walked a whole day into the wilderness. He stopped and sat down in the shade of a tree and wished he would die. “It's too much, 
1KI.19.5	He lay down under the tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Wake up and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	He looked around and saw a loaf of bread and a jar of water near his head. He ate and drank, and lay down again. 
1KI.19.7	The 
1KI.19.8	Elijah got up, ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to walk forty days to Sinai, the holy mountain. 
1KI.19.9	There he went into a cave to spend the night.
1KI.19.9	Suddenly the 
1KI.19.11	“Go out and stand before me on top of the mountain,” the 
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake there was a fire—but the 
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?”
1KI.19.14	He answered, “
1KI.19.16	 anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. 
1KI.19.17	Anyone who escapes being put to death by Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and anyone who escapes Jehu will be killed by Elisha. 
1KI.19.18	 Yet I will leave seven thousand people alive in Israel—all those who are loyal to me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol.”
1KI.19.19	Elijah left and found Elisha plowing with a team of oxen; there were eleven teams ahead of him, and he was plowing with the last one. Elijah took off his cloak and put it on Elisha. 
1KI.19.20	Elisha then left his oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you.”
1KI.19.20	Elijah answered, “All right, go back. I'm not stopping you!”
1KI.19.21	Then Elisha went to his team of oxen, killed them, and cooked the meat, using the yoke as fuel for the fire. He gave the meat to the people, and they ate it. Then he went and followed Elijah as his helper.
1KI.20.1	King Benhadad of Syria gathered all his troops, and supported by thirty-two other rulers with their horses and chariots, he marched up, laid siege to Samaria, and launched attacks against it. 
1KI.20.2	He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel to say, “King Benhadad demands that 
1KI.20.3	you surrender to him your silver and gold, your women and the strongest of your children.”
1KI.20.4	“Tell my lord, King Benhadad, that I agree; he can have me and everything I own,” Ahab answered.
1KI.20.5	Later the messengers came back to Ahab with another demand from Benhadad: “I sent you word that you were to hand over to me your silver and gold, your women and your children. 
1KI.20.6	Now, however, I will send my officers to search your palace and the homes of your officials, and to take everything they
1KI.20.7	King Ahab called in all the leaders of the country and said, “You see that this man wants to ruin us. He sent me a message demanding my wives and children, my silver and gold, and I agreed.”
1KI.20.8	The leaders and the people answered, “Don't pay any attention to him; don't give in.”
1KI.20.9	So Ahab replied to Benhadad's messengers, “Tell my lord the king that I agreed to his first demand, but I cannot agree to the second.”
1KI.20.9	The messengers left and then returned with another message 
1KI.20.10	from Benhadad: “I will bring enough men to destroy this city of yours and carry off the rubble in their hands. May the gods strike me dead if I don't!”
1KI.20.11	King Ahab answered, “Tell King Benhadad that a real soldier does his bragging 
1KI.20.12	Benhadad received Ahab's answer as he and his allies, the other rulers, were drinking in their tents. He ordered his men to get ready to attack the city, and so they moved into position.
1KI.20.13	Meanwhile, a prophet went to King Ahab and said, “The 
1KI.20.14	“Who will lead the attack?” Ahab asked.
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “The 
1KI.20.14	“Who will command the main force?” the king asked.
1KI.20.14	“You,” the prophet answered.
1KI.20.15	So the king called out the young soldiers who were under the district commanders, 232 in all. Then he called out the Israelite army, a total of seven thousand men.
1KI.20.16	The attack began at noon, as Benhadad and his thirty-two allies were getting drunk in their tents. 
1KI.20.17	The young soldiers advanced first. Scouts sent out by Benhadad reported to him that a group of soldiers was coming out of Samaria. 
1KI.20.18	He ordered, “Take them alive, no matter whether they are coming to fight or to ask for peace.”
1KI.20.19	The young soldiers led the attack, followed by the Israelite army, 
1KI.20.20	and each one killed the man he fought. The Syrians fled, with the Israelites in hot pursuit, but Benhadad escaped on horseback, accompanied by some of the cavalry. 
1KI.20.21	King Ahab took to the field, captured
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet went to King Ahab and said, “Go back and build up your forces and make careful plans, because the king of Syria will attack again next spring.”
1KI.20.23	King Benhadad's officials said to him, “The gods of Israel are mountain gods, and that is why the Israelites defeated us. But we will certainly defeat them if we fight them in the plains. 
1KI.20.24	Now, remove the thirty-two rulers from their commands and replace them with field commanders. 
1KI.20.25	Then call up an army as large as the one that deserted you, with the same number of horses and chariots. We will fight the Israelites in the plains, and this time we will defeat them.”
1KI.20.25	King Benhadad agreed and followed their advice. 
1KI.20.26	The following spring he called up his men and marched with them to the city of Aphek to attack the Israelites. 
1KI.20.27	The Israelites were called up and equipped; they marched out and camped in two groups facing the Syrians. The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats compared to the Syrians, who spread out over the countryside.
1KI.20.28	A prophet went to King Ahab and said, “This is what the 
1KI.20.29	For seven days the Syrians and the Israelites stayed in their camps, facing each other. On the seventh day they started fighting, and the Israelites killed a hundred thousand Syrians. 
1KI.20.30	The survivors fled into the city of Aphek, where the city walls fell on twenty-seven thousand of them.
1KI.20.30	Benhadad also escaped into the city and took refuge in the back room of a house. 
1KI.20.31	His officials went to him and said, “We have heard that the Israelite kings are merciful. Give us permission to go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our necks, and maybe he will spare your life.” 
1KI.20.32	So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their necks, went to Ahab and said, “Your servant Benhadad pleads with you for his life.”
1KI.20.32	Ahab answered, “Is he still alive? Good! He's like a brother to me!”
1KI.20.33	Benhadad's officials were watching for a good sign, and when Ahab said “brother,” they took it up at once, and said, “As you say, Benhadad is your brother!”
1KI.20.33	“Bring him to me,” Ahab ordered. When Benhadad arrived, Ahab invited him to get in the chariot with him. 
1KI.20.34	Benhadad said to him, “I will restore to you the towns my father took from your father, and you may set up a commercial center for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Ahab replied, “On these terms, then, I will set you free.” He made a treaty with him and let him go.
1KI.20.35	At the 
1KI.20.36	 so he said to him, “Because you have disobeyed the 
1KI.20.37	Then this same prophet went to another man and said, “Hit me!” This man did so; he hit him a hard blow and hurt him. 
1KI.20.38	The prophet bandaged his face with a cloth, to disguise himself, and went and stood by the road, waiting for the king of Israel to pass. 
1KI.20.39	As the king was passing by, the prophet called out to him and said, “Your Majesty, I was fighting in the battle when a soldier brought a captured enemy to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if he escapes, you will pay for it with your life or else pay a fine of three thousand pieces of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	But I got busy with other things, and the man escaped.”
1KI.20.40	The king answered, “You have pronounced your own sentence, and you will have to pay the penalty.”
1KI.20.41	The prophet tore the cloth from his face, and at once the king recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	The prophet then said to the king, “This is the word of the 
1KI.20.43	The king went back home to Samaria, worried and depressed.
1KI.21.1	Near King Ahab's palace in Jezreel there was a vineyard owned by a man named Naboth. 
1KI.21.2	One day Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard; it is close to my palace, and I want to use the land for a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard for it or, if you prefer, I will pay you a fair price.”
1KI.21.3	“I inherited this vineyard from my ancestors,” Naboth replied. “The 
1KI.21.4	Ahab went home, depressed and angry over what Naboth had said to him. He lay down on his bed, facing the wall, and would not eat. 
1KI.21.5	His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, “Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?”
1KI.21.6	He answered, “Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!”
1KI.21.7	“Well, are you the king or aren't you?” Jezebel replied. “Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!”
1KI.21.8	Then she wrote some letters, signed Ahab's name to them, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the officials and leading citizens of Jezreel. 
1KI.21.9	The letters said: “Proclaim a day of fasting, call the people together, and give Naboth the place of honor. 
1KI.21.10	Get a couple of scoundrels to accuse him to his face of cursing God and the king. Then take him out of the city and stone him to death.”
1KI.21.11	The officials and leading citizens of Jezreel did what Jezebel had commanded. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a day of fasting, called the people together, and gave Naboth the place of honor. 
1KI.21.13	The two scoundrels publicly accused him of cursing God and the king, and so he was taken outside the city and stoned to death. 
1KI.21.14	The message was sent to Jezebel: “Naboth has been put to death.”
1KI.21.15	As soon as Jezebel received the message, she said to Ahab, “Naboth is dead. Now go and take possession of the vineyard which he refused to sell to you.” 
1KI.21.16	At once Ahab went to the vineyard to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the 
1KI.21.18	“Go to King Ahab of Samaria. You will find him in Naboth's vineyard, about to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	Tell him that I, the 
1KI.21.20	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, “Have you caught up with me, my enemy?”
1KI.21.20	“Yes, I have,” Elijah answered. “You have devoted yourself completely to doing what is wrong in the 
1KI.21.21	So the 
1KI.21.22	Your family will become like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have stirred up my anger by leading Israel into sin.’ 
1KI.21.23	 And concerning Jezebel, the 
1KI.21.24	Any of your relatives who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures.”
1KI.21.24	( 
1KI.21.25	There was no one else who had devoted himself so completely to doing wrong in the 
1KI.21.26	He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the 
1KI.21.27	When Elijah finished speaking, Ahab tore his clothes, took them off, and put on sackcloth. He refused food, slept in the sackcloth, and went about gloomy and depressed.
1KI.21.28	The 
1KI.21.29	“Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has done this, I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime; it will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family.”
1KI.22.1	There was peace between Israel and Syria for the next two years, 
1KI.22.2	but in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to see King Ahab of Israel.
1KI.22.3	Ahab asked his officials, “Why is it that we have not done anything to get back Ramoth in Gilead from the king of Syria? It belongs to us!” 
1KI.22.4	And Ahab asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?”
1KI.22.4	“I am ready when you are,” Jehoshaphat answered, “and so are my soldiers and my cavalry. 
1KI.22.5	But first let's consult the 
1KI.22.6	So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, “Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?”
1KI.22.6	“Attack it,” they answered. “The Lord will give you victory.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the 
1KI.22.8	Ahab answered, “There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad.”
1KI.22.8	“You shouldn't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
1KI.22.9	Then Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.
1KI.22.10	The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
1KI.22.11	One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, “This is what the 
1KI.22.12	All the other prophets said the same thing. “March against Ramoth and you will win,” they said. “The 
1KI.22.13	Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same.”
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah answered, “By the living 
1KI.22.15	When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?”
1KI.22.15	“Attack!” Micaiah answered. “Of course you'll win. The 
1KI.22.16	But Ahab replied, “When you speak to me in the name of the 
1KI.22.18	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me? It's always something bad!”
1KI.22.20	The 
1KI.22.21	until a spirit stepped forward, approached the 
1KI.22.22	‘How?’ the 
1KI.22.23	And Micaiah concluded: “This is what has happened. The 
1KI.22.24	Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, “Since when did the 
1KI.22.25	“You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,” Micaiah replied.
1KI.22.26	Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, “Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash. 
1KI.22.27	Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely.”
1KI.22.28	“If you return safely,” Micaiah exclaimed, “then the 
1KI.22.29	Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments.” So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise.
1KI.22.31	The king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.32	So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But when he cried out, 
1KI.22.33	they realized that he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped their attack. 
1KI.22.34	By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. “I'm wounded!” he cried out to his chariot driver. “Turn around and pull out of the battle!”
1KI.22.35	While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. The blood from his wound ran down and covered the bottom of the chariot, and at evening he died. 
1KI.22.36	Near sunset the order went out through the Israelite ranks: “Each of you go back to your own country and city!”
1KI.22.37	So died King Ahab. His body was taken to Samaria and buried. 
1KI.22.38	His chariot was cleaned up at the pool of Samaria, where dogs licked up his blood and prostitutes washed themselves, as the 
1KI.22.39	Everything else that King Ahab did, including an account of his palace decorated with ivory and of all the cities he built, is recorded in 
1KI.22.40	At his death his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.41	In the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah 
1KI.22.42	at the age of thirty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of the 
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, all his bravery and his battles, are recorded in 
1KI.22.46	He got rid of all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan altars who were still left from the days of his father Asa.
1KI.22.47	The land of Edom had no king; it was ruled by a deputy appointed by the king of Judah.
1KI.22.48	King Jehoshaphat had ocean-going ships built to sail to the land of Ophir for gold; but they were wrecked at Eziongeber and never sailed. 
1KI.22.49	Then King Ahaziah of Israel offered to let his men sail with Jehoshaphat's men, but Jehoshaphat refused the offer.
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.51	In the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for two years. 
1KI.22.52	He sinned against the 
1KI.22.53	He worshiped and served Baal, and like his father before him, he aroused the anger of the 
2KI.1.1	After the death of King Ahab of Israel the country of Moab rebelled against Israel.
2KI.1.2	King Ahaziah of Israel fell off the balcony on the roof of his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent some messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, in order to find out whether or not he would recover. 
2KI.1.3	But an angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Tell the king that the 
2KI.1.4	Elijah did as the 
2KI.1.5	and the messengers returned to the king. “Why have you come back?” he asked.
2KI.1.6	They answered, “We were met by a man who told us to come back and tell you that the 
2KI.1.7	“What did the man look like?” the king asked.
2KI.1.8	“It's Elijah!” the king exclaimed.
2KI.1.9	Then he sent an officer with fifty men to get Elijah. The officer found him sitting on a hill and said to him, “Man of God, the king orders you to come down.”
2KI.1.11	The king sent another officer with fifty men, who went up
2KI.1.12	“If I am a man of God,” Elijah answered, “may fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!” At once the fire of God came down and killed the officer and his men.
2KI.1.13	Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men. He went up the hill, fell on his knees in front of Elijah, and pleaded, “Man of God, be merciful to me and my men. Spare our lives! 
2KI.1.14	The two other officers and their men were killed by fire from heaven; but please be merciful to me!”
2KI.1.15	The angel of the 
2KI.1.16	and said to him, “This is what the 
2KI.1.17	Ahaziah died, as the 
2KI.1.18	Everything else that King Ahaziah did is recorded in 
2KI.2.1	The time came for the 
2KI.2.2	and on the way Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the 
2KI.2.2	But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living 
2KI.2.3	A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.3	“Yes, I know,” Elisha answered. “But let's not talk about it.”
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the 
2KI.2.4	But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living 
2KI.2.5	A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.5	“Yes, I know,” Elisha answered. “But let's not talk about it.”
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the 
2KI.2.6	But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living 
2KI.2.7	and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan. Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river, and the fifty prophets stood a short distance away. 
2KI.2.8	Then Elijah took off his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it; the water divided, and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground. 
2KI.2.9	 There, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken away.”
2KI.2.9	“Let me receive the share of your power that will make me your successor,”
2KI.2.10	“That is a difficult request to grant,” Elijah replied. “But you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you; if you don't see me, you won't receive it.”
2KI.2.11	They kept talking as they walked on; then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them, and Elijah was taken up to heaven by a whirlwind. 
2KI.2.12	 Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah, “My father, my father! Mighty defender of Israel! You are gone!” And he never saw Elijah again.
2KI.2.12	In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two. 
2KI.2.13	Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said, “Where is the 
2KI.2.15	The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said, “The power of Elijah is on Elisha!” They went to meet him, bowed down before him, 
2KI.2.16	and said, “There are fifty of us here, all strong men. Let us go and look for your master. Maybe the spirit of the 
2KI.2.16	“No, you must not go,” Elisha answered.
2KI.2.17	But they insisted until he gave in and let them go. The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days, but didn't find him. 
2KI.2.18	Then they returned to Elisha, who had waited at Jericho, and he said to them, “Didn't I tell you not to go?”
2KI.2.19	Some men from Jericho went to Elisha and said, “As you know, sir, this is a fine city, but the water is bad and causes miscarriages.”
2KI.2.20	“Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me,” he ordered. They brought it to him, 
2KI.2.21	and he went to the spring, threw the salt in the water, and said, “This is what the 
2KI.2.22	And that water has been pure ever since, just as Elisha said it would be.
2KI.2.23	Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel, and on the way some boys came out of a town and made fun of him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they shouted.
2KI.2.24	Elisha turned around, glared at them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	Elisha went on to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He sinned against the 
2KI.3.3	Yet, like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him, he led Israel into sin and would not stop.
2KI.3.4	King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, and every year he gave as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 sheep. 
2KI.3.5	But when King Ahab of Israel died, Mesha rebelled against Israel. 
2KI.3.6	At once King Joram left Samaria and gathered all his troops. 
2KI.3.7	He sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you join me in war against him?”
2KI.3.7	“I will,” King Jehoshaphat replied. “I am at your disposal, and so are my men and my horses. 
2KI.3.8	What route shall we take for the attack?”
2KI.3.8	“We will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom,” Joram answered.
2KI.3.9	So King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom set out. After marching seven days, they ran out of water, and there was none left for the men or the pack animals. 
2KI.3.10	“We're done for!” King Joram exclaimed. “The 
2KI.3.11	King Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there a prophet here through whom we can consult the 
2KI.3.11	An officer of King Joram's forces answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was Elijah's assistant.”
2KI.3.12	“He is a true prophet,” King Jehoshaphat said. So the three kings went to Elisha.
2KI.3.13	“Why should I help you?” Elisha said to the king of Israel. “Go and consult those prophets that your father and mother consulted.”
2KI.3.13	“No!” Joram replied. “It is the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha answered, “By the living 
2KI.3.15	Now get me a musician.”
2KI.3.15	As the musician played his harp, the power of the 
2KI.3.16	and he said, “This is what the 
2KI.3.17	Even though you will not see any rain or wind, this stream bed will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your pack animals will have plenty to drink.’” 
2KI.3.18	And Elisha continued, “But this is an easy thing for the 
2KI.3.19	You will conquer all their beautiful fortified cities; you will cut down all their fruit trees, stop all their springs, and ruin all their fertile fields by covering them with stones.”
2KI.3.20	The next morning, at the time of the regular morning sacrifice, water came flowing from the direction of Edom and covered the ground.
2KI.3.21	When the Moabites heard that the three kings had come to attack them, all the men who could bear arms, from the oldest to the youngest, were called out and stationed at the border. 
2KI.3.22	When they got up the following morning, the sun was shining on the water, making it look as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	“It's blood!” they exclaimed. “The three enemy armies must have fought and killed each other! Let's go and loot their camp!”
2KI.3.24	But when they reached the camp, the Israelites attacked them and drove them back. The Israelites kept up the pursuit,
2KI.3.25	and destroying their cities. As they passed by a fertile field, every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered; they also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees. At last only the capital city of Kir Heres
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Syria,
2KI.3.27	So he took his oldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him on the city wall as a sacrifice to the god of Moab. The Israelites were terrified
2KI.4.1	The widow of a member of a group of prophets went to Elisha and said, “Sir, my husband has died! As you know, he was a God-fearing man, but now a man he owed money to has come to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt.”
2KI.4.2	“What shall I do for you?” he asked. “Tell me, what do you have at home?”
2KI.4.2	“Nothing at all, except a small jar of olive oil,” she answered.
2KI.4.3	“Go to your neighbors and borrow as many empty jars as you can,” Elisha told her. 
2KI.4.4	“Then you and your sons go into the house, close the door, and start pouring oil into the jars. Set each one aside as soon as it is full.”
2KI.4.5	So the woman went into her house with her sons, closed the door, took the small jar of olive oil, and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her. 
2KI.4.6	When they had filled all the jars, she asked if there were any more. “That was the last one,” one of her sons answered. And the olive oil stopped flowing. 
2KI.4.7	She went back to Elisha, the prophet, who said to her, “Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts, and there will be enough money left over for you and your sons to live on.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She invited him to a meal, and from then on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house. 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “I am sure that this man who comes here so often is a holy man. 
2KI.4.10	Let's build a small room on the roof, put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in it, and he can stay there whenever he visits us.”
2KI.4.11	One day Elisha returned to Shunem and went up to his room to rest. 
2KI.4.12	He told his servant Gehazi to go and call the woman. When she came, 
2KI.4.13	he said to Gehazi, “Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs. Maybe she would like me to go to the king or the army commander and put in a good word for her.”
2KI.4.13	“I have all I need here among my own people,” she answered.
2KI.4.14	Elisha asked Gehazi, “What can I do for her then?”
2KI.4.14	He answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is an old man.”
2KI.4.15	“Tell her to come here,” Elisha ordered. She came and stood in the doorway, 
2KI.4.16	 and Elisha said to her, “By this time next year you will be holding a son in your arms.”
2KI.4.16	“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Please, sir, don't lie to me. You are a man of God!”
2KI.4.17	But, as Elisha had said, at about that time the following year she gave birth to a son.
2KI.4.18	Some years later, at harvest time, the boy went out one morning to join his father, who was in the field with the harvest workers. 
2KI.4.19	Suddenly he cried out to his father, “My head hurts! My head hurts!”
2KI.4.19	“Carry the boy to his mother,” the father said to a servant. 
2KI.4.20	The servant carried the boy back to his mother, who held him in her lap until noon, at which time he died. 
2KI.4.21	She carried him up to Elisha's room, put him on the bed and left, closing the door behind her. 
2KI.4.22	Then she called her husband and said to him, “Send a servant here with a donkey. I need to go to the prophet Elisha. I'll be back as soon as I can.”
2KI.4.23	“Why do you have to go today?” her husband asked. “It's neither a Sabbath nor a New Moon Festival.”
2KI.4.23	“Never mind,” she answered. 
2KI.4.24	Then she had the donkey saddled, and ordered the servant, “Make the donkey go as fast as it can, and don't slow down unless I tell you to.” 
2KI.4.25	So she set out and went to Mount Carmel, where Elisha was.
2KI.4.25	Elisha saw her coming while she was still some distance away, and he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there comes the woman from Shunem! 
2KI.4.26	Hurry to her and find out if everything is all right with her, her husband, and her son.”
2KI.4.26	She told Gehazi that everything was all right, 
2KI.4.27	but when she came to Elisha, she bowed down before him and took hold of his feet. Gehazi was about to push her away, but Elisha said, “Leave her alone. Can't you see she's deeply distressed? And the 
2KI.4.28	The woman said to him, “Sir, did I ask you for a son? Didn't I tell you not to get my hopes up?”
2KI.4.29	Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, “Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.”
2KI.4.30	The woman said to Elisha, “I swear by my loyalty to the living 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went on ahead and held Elisha's stick over the child, but there was no sound or any other sign of life. So he went back to meet Elisha and said, “The boy didn't wake up.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha arrived, he went alone into the room and saw the boy lying dead on the bed. 
2KI.4.33	He closed the door and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	 Then he lay down on the boy, placing his mouth, eyes, and hands on the boy's mouth, eyes, and hands. As he lay stretched out over the boy, the boy's body started to get warm. 
2KI.4.35	Elisha got up, walked around the room, and then went back and again stretched himself over the boy. The boy sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	Elisha called Gehazi and told him to call the boy's mother. When she came in, he said to her, “Here's your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She fell at Elisha's feet, with her face touching the ground; then she took her son and left.
2KI.4.38	Once, when there was a famine throughout the land, Elisha returned to Gilgal. While he was teaching a group of prophets, he told his servant to put a big pot on the fire and make some stew for them. 
2KI.4.39	One of them went out in the fields to get some herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry. He brought them back and sliced them up into the stew, not knowing what they were. 
2KI.4.40	The stew was poured out for the men to eat, but as soon as they tasted it they exclaimed to Elisha, “It's poisoned!”—and wouldn't eat it. 
2KI.4.41	Elisha asked for some meal, threw it into the pot, and said, “Pour out some more stew for them.” And then there was nothing wrong with it.
2KI.4.42	Another time, a man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year, and some freshly-cut heads of grain. Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this, 
2KI.4.43	but he answered, “Do you think this is enough for a hundred men?”
2KI.4.43	Elisha replied, “Give it to them to eat, because the 
2KI.4.44	So the servant set the food before them, and as the 
2KI.5.2	In one of their raids against Israel, the Syrians had carried off a little Israelite girl, who became a servant of Naaman's wife. 
2KI.5.3	One day she said to her mistress, “I wish that my master could go to the prophet who lives in Samaria! He would cure him of his disease.” 
2KI.5.4	When Naaman heard of this, he went to the king and told him what the girl had said. 
2KI.5.5	The king said, “Go to the king of Israel and take this letter to him.”
2KI.5.5	So Naaman set out, taking thirty thousand pieces of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of fine clothes. 
2KI.5.6	The letter that he took read: “This letter will introduce my officer Naaman. I want you to cure him of his disease.”
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and exclaimed, “How can the king of Syria expect me to cure this man? Does he think that I am God,
2KI.5.8	When the prophet Elisha heard what had happened, he sent word to the king: “Why are you so upset? Send the man to me, and I'll show him that there is a prophet in Israel!”
2KI.5.9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariot and stopped at the entrance to Elisha's house. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a servant out to tell him to go and wash himself seven times in the Jordan River, and he would be completely cured of his disease. 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman left in a rage, saying, “I thought that he would at least come out to me, pray to the 
2KI.5.12	Besides, aren't the rivers Abana and Pharpar, back in Damascus, better than any river in Israel? I could have washed in them and been cured!”
2KI.5.13	His servants went up to him and said, “Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. Now why can't you just wash yourself, as he said, and be cured?” 
2KI.5.14	So Naaman went down to the Jordan, dipped himself in it seven times, as Elisha had instructed, and he was completely cured. His flesh became firm and healthy like that of a child. 
2KI.5.15	He returned to Elisha with all his men and said, “Now I know that there is no god but the God of Israel; so please, sir, accept a gift from me.”
2KI.5.16	Elisha answered, “By the living 
2KI.5.16	Naaman insisted that he accept it, but he would not. 
2KI.5.17	So Naaman said, “If you won't accept my gift, then let me have two mule-loads of earth to take home with me,
2KI.5.18	So I hope that the 
2KI.5.19	“Go in peace,” Elisha said. And Naaman left.
2KI.5.19	He had gone only a short distance, 
2KI.5.20	when Elisha's servant Gehazi said to himself, “My master has let Naaman get away without paying a thing! He should have accepted what that Syrian offered him. By the living 
2KI.5.21	So he set off after Naaman. When Naaman saw a man running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him, and asked, “Is something wrong?”
2KI.5.22	“No,” Gehazi answered. “But my master sent me to tell you that just now two members of the group of prophets in the hill country of Ephraim arrived, and he would like you to give them three thousand pieces of silver and two changes of fine clothes.”
2KI.5.23	“Please take six thousand pieces of silver,” Naaman replied. He insisted on it, tied up the silver in two bags, gave them and two changes of fine clothes to two of his servants, and sent them on ahead of Gehazi. 
2KI.5.24	When they reached the hill where Elisha lived, Gehazi took the two bags and carried them into the house. Then he sent Naaman's servants back. 
2KI.5.25	He went back into the house, and Elisha asked him, “Where have you been?”
2KI.5.25	“Oh, nowhere, sir,” he answered.
2KI.5.26	But Elisha said, “Wasn't I there in spirit when the man got out of his chariot to meet you? This is no time to accept money and clothes, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, or servants! 
2KI.5.27	And now Naaman's disease will come upon you, and you and your descendants will have it forever!”
2KI.5.27	When Gehazi left, he had the disease—his skin was as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	One day the group of prophets that Elisha was in charge of complained to him, “The place where we live is too small! 
2KI.6.2	Give us permission to go to the Jordan and cut down some trees, so that we can build a place to live.”
2KI.6.2	“All right,” Elisha answered.
2KI.6.3	One of them urged him to go with them; he agreed, 
2KI.6.4	and they set out together. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began to work. 
2KI.6.5	As one of them was cutting down a tree, suddenly his iron ax head fell in the water. “What shall I do, sir?” he exclaimed to Elisha. “It was a borrowed ax!”
2KI.6.6	“Where did it fall?” Elisha asked.
2KI.6.6	The man showed him the place, and Elisha cut off a stick, threw it in the water, and made the ax head float. 
2KI.6.7	“Take it out,” he ordered, and the man reached down and picked it up.
2KI.6.8	The king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his officers and chose a place to set up his camp. 
2KI.6.9	But Elisha sent word to the king of Israel, warning him not to go near that place, because the Syrians were waiting in ambush there. 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel warned the people who lived in that place, and they were on guard. This happened several times.
2KI.6.11	The Syrian king became greatly upset over this; he called in his officers and asked them, “Which one of you is on the side of the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	One of them answered, “No one is, Your Majesty. The prophet Elisha tells the king of Israel what you say even in the privacy of your own room.”
2KI.6.13	“Find out where he is,” the king ordered, “and I will capture him.”
2KI.6.13	When he was told that Elisha was in Dothan, 
2KI.6.14	he sent a large force there with horses and chariots. They reached the town at night and surrounded it. 
2KI.6.15	Early the next morning Elisha's servant got up, went out of the house, and saw the Syrian troops with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. He went back to Elisha and exclaimed, “We are doomed, sir! What shall we do?”
2KI.6.16	“Don't be afraid,” Elisha answered. “We have more on our side than they have on theirs.” 
2KI.6.17	Then he prayed, “O 
2KI.6.18	When the Syrians attacked, Elisha prayed, “O 
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha went to them and said, “You are on the wrong road; this is not the town you are looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are after.” And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	As soon as they had entered the city, Elisha prayed, “Open their eyes, 
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw the Syrians, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, sir? Shall I kill them?”
2KI.6.22	“No,” he answered. “Not even soldiers you had captured in combat would you put to death. Give them something to eat and drink, and let them return to their king.” 
2KI.6.23	So the king of Israel provided a great feast for them; and after they had eaten and drunk, he sent them back to the king of Syria. From then on the Syrians stopped raiding the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	Some time later King Benhadad of Syria led his entire army against Israel and laid siege to the city of Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	As a result of the siege the food shortage in the city was so severe that a donkey's head cost eighty pieces of silver, and half a pound of dove's dung
2KI.6.26	The king of Israel was walking by on the city wall when a woman cried out, “Help me, Your Majesty!”
2KI.6.27	He replied, “If the 
2KI.6.28	What's your trouble?”
2KI.6.28	She answered, “The other day this woman here suggested that we eat my child, and then eat her child the next day. 
2KI.6.29	 So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I told her that we would eat her son, but she had hidden him!”
2KI.6.30	Hearing this, the king tore his clothes in dismay, and the people who were close to the wall could see that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes. 
2KI.6.31	He exclaimed, “May God strike me dead if Elisha is not beheaded before the day is over!” 
2KI.6.32	And he sent a messenger to get Elisha.
2KI.6.32	Meanwhile Elisha was at home with some elders who were visiting him. Before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “That murderer is sending someone to kill me! Now, when he gets here, shut the door and don't let him come in. The king himself will be right behind him.” 
2KI.6.33	He had hardly finished saying this, when the king
2KI.7.1	Elisha answered, “Listen to what the 
2KI.7.2	The personal attendant of the king said to Elisha, “That can't happen—not even if the 
2KI.7.2	“You will see it happen, but you won't get to eat any of the food,” Elisha replied.
2KI.7.3	Four men who were suffering from a dreaded skin disease were outside the gates of Samaria, and they said to each other, “Why should we wait here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	It's no use going into the city, because we would starve to death in there; but if we stay here, we'll die also. So let's go to the Syrian camp; the worst they can do is kill us, but maybe they will spare our lives.” 
2KI.7.5	So, as it began to get dark, they went to the Syrian camp, but when they reached it, no one was there. 
2KI.7.6	The Lord had made the Syrians hear what sounded like the advance of a large army with horses and chariots, and the Syrians thought that the king of Israel had hired Hittite and Egyptian kings and their armies to attack them. 
2KI.7.7	So that evening the Syrians had fled for their lives, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys, and leaving the camp just as it was.
2KI.7.8	When the four men reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, ate and drank what was there, grabbed the silver, gold, and clothing they found, and went off and hid them; then they returned, entered another tent, and did the same thing. 
2KI.7.9	But then they said to each other, “We shouldn't be doing this! We have good news, and we shouldn't keep it to ourselves. If we wait until morning to tell it, we are sure to be punished. Let's go right now and tell the king's officers!” 
2KI.7.10	So they left the Syrian camp, went back to Samaria, and called out to the guards at the gates: “We went to the Syrian camp and didn't see or hear anybody; the horses and donkeys have not been untied, and the tents are just as the Syrians left them.”
2KI.7.11	The guards announced the news, and it was reported in the palace. 
2KI.7.12	It was still night, but the king got out of bed and said to his officials, “I'll tell you what the Syrians are planning! They know about the famine here, so they have left their camp to go and hide in the countryside. They think that we will leave the city to find food, and then they will take us alive and capture the city.”
2KI.7.13	One of his officials said, “The people here in the city are doomed anyway, like those that have already died. So let's send some men with five of the horses that are left, so that we can find out what has happened.”
2KI.7.14	They chose some men, and the king sent them in two chariots with instructions to go and find out what had happened to the Syrian army. 
2KI.7.15	The men went as far as the Jordan, and all along the road they saw the clothes and equipment that the Syrians had abandoned as they fled. Then they returned and reported to the king. 
2KI.7.16	The people of Samaria rushed out and looted the Syrian camp. And as the 
2KI.7.17	It so happened that the king of Israel had put the city gate under the command of the officer who was his personal attendant. The officer was trampled to death there by the people and died, as Elisha had predicted when the king went to see him. 
2KI.7.18	Elisha had told the king that by that time the following day ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley would be sold in Samaria for one piece of silver, 
2KI.7.19	to which the officer had answered, “That can't happen—not even if the 
2KI.7.20	And that is just what happened to him—he died, trampled to death by the people at the city gate.
2KI.8.2	She had followed his instructions and had gone with her family to live in Philistia for the seven years.
2KI.8.3	At the end of the seven years she returned to Israel and went to the king to ask that her house and her land be restored to her. 
2KI.8.4	She found the king talking with Gehazi, Elisha's servant; the king wanted to know about Elisha's miracles. 
2KI.8.5	While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life, the woman made her appeal to the king. Gehazi said to him, “Your Majesty, here is the woman and here is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!” 
2KI.8.6	In answer to the king's question, she confirmed Gehazi's story, and so the king called an official and told him to give back to her everything that was hers, including the value of all the crops that her fields had produced during the seven years she had been away.
2KI.8.7	Elisha went to Damascus at a time when King Benhadad of Syria was sick. When the king was told that Elisha was there, 
2KI.8.8	he said to Hazael, one of his officials, “Take a gift to the prophet and ask him to consult the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael loaded forty camels with all kinds of the finest products of Damascus and went to Elisha. When Hazael met him, he said, “Your servant King Benhadad has sent me to ask you whether or not he will recover from his sickness.”
2KI.8.10	Elisha answered, “The 
2KI.8.11	Then Elisha stared at him with a horrified look on his face until Hazael became ill at ease. Suddenly Elisha burst into tears. 
2KI.8.12	“Why are you crying, sir?” Hazael asked.
2KI.8.12	“Because I know the horrible things you will do against the people of Israel,” Elisha answered. “You will set their fortresses on fire, slaughter their finest young men, batter their children to death, and rip open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	“The 
2KI.8.14	Hazael went back to Benhadad, who asked him, “What did Elisha say?”
2KI.8.14	“He told me that you would certainly get well,” Hazael answered. 
2KI.8.15	But on the following day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and smothered the king.
2KI.8.15	And Hazael succeeded Benhadad as king of Syria.
2KI.8.16	In the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel,
2KI.8.17	at the age of thirty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. 
2KI.8.18	His wife was Ahab's daughter, and like the family of Ahab he followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel. He sinned against the 
2KI.8.19	 but the 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram set out with all his chariots to Zair, where the Edomite army surrounded them. During the night he and his chariot commanders managed to break out and escape, and his soldiers scattered to their homes. 
2KI.8.22	Edom has been independent of
2KI.8.23	Everything else that Jehoram did is recorded in 
2KI.8.24	Jehoram died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah 
2KI.8.26	at the age of twenty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother was Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Since Ahaziah was related to King Ahab by marriage, he sinned against the 
2KI.8.28	King Ahaziah joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle. 
2KI.8.29	He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds, and Ahaziah went there to visit him.
2KI.9.1	Meanwhile the prophet Elisha called one of the young prophets and said to him, “Get ready and go to Ramoth in Gilead. Take this jar of olive oil with you, 
2KI.9.2	and when you get there look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a private room away from his companions, 
2KI.9.3	pour this olive oil on his head, and say, ‘The 
2KI.9.4	So the young prophet went to Ramoth, 
2KI.9.5	where he found the army officers in a conference. He said, “Sir, I have a message for you.”
2KI.9.5	Jehu asked, “Which one of us are you speaking to?”
2KI.9.5	“To you, sir,” he replied. 
2KI.9.6	 Then the two of them went indoors, and the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him, “The 
2KI.9.7	You are to kill your master the king, that son of Ahab, so that I may punish Jezebel for murdering my prophets and my other servants. 
2KI.9.8	All of Ahab's family and descendants are to die; I will get rid of every male in his family, young and old alike. 
2KI.9.9	I will treat his family as I did the families of King Jeroboam of Israel and of King Baasha of Israel. 
2KI.9.10	 Jezebel will not be buried; her body will be eaten by dogs in the territory of Jezreel.’” After saying this, the young prophet left the room and fled.
2KI.9.11	Jehu went back to his fellow officers, who asked him, “Is everything all right? What did that crazy fellow want with you?”
2KI.9.11	“You know what he wanted,” Jehu answered.
2KI.9.12	“No we don't!” they replied. “Tell us what he said!”
2KI.9.12	“He told me that the 
2KI.9.13	At once Jehu's fellow officers spread their cloaks at the top of the steps for Jehu to stand on, blew trumpets, and shouted, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14+2KI.9.15	Then Jehu plotted against King Joram, who was in Jezreel, where he had gone to recover from the wounds which he had received in the battle at Ramoth against King Hazael of Syria. So Jehu said to his fellow officers, “If you are with me, make sure that no one slips out of Ramoth to go and warn the people in Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	Then he got into his chariot and set off for Jezreel. Joram had still not recovered, and King Ahaziah of Judah was there, visiting him.
2KI.9.17	A guard on duty in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men approaching. “I see some men riding up!” he called out.
2KI.9.17	Joram replied, “Send a rider to find out if they are friends or enemies.”
2KI.9.18	The messenger rode out to Jehu and said to him, “The king wants to know if you come as a friend.”
2KI.9.18	“That's none of your business!” Jehu answered. “Fall in behind me.”
2KI.9.18	The guard on the watchtower reported that the messenger had reached the group but was not returning. 
2KI.9.19	Another messenger was sent out, who asked Jehu the same question. Again Jehu answered, “That's none of your business! Fall in behind me.”
2KI.9.20	Once more the guard reported that the messenger had reached the group but was not returning. And he added, “The leader of the group is driving his chariot like a madman, just like Jehu!”
2KI.9.21	“Get my chariot ready,” King Joram ordered. It was done, and he and King Ahaziah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the field which had belonged to Naboth. 
2KI.9.22	“Are you coming in peace?” Joram asked him.
2KI.9.22	“How can there be peace,” Jehu answered, “when we still have all the witchcraft and idolatry that your mother Jezebel started?”
2KI.9.23	“It's treason, Ahaziah!” Joram cried out, as he turned his chariot around and fled. 
2KI.9.24	Jehu drew his bow, and with all his strength shot an arrow that struck Joram in the back and pierced his heart. Joram fell dead in his chariot, 
2KI.9.25	and Jehu said to his aide Bidkar, “Get his body and throw it in the field that belonged to Naboth. Remember that when you and I were riding together behind King Joram's father Ahab, the 
2KI.9.26	 ‘I saw the murder of Naboth and his sons yesterday. And I promise that I will punish you here in this same field.’ So take Joram's body,” Jehu ordered his aide, “and throw it in the field that belonged to Naboth, so as to fulfill the 
2KI.9.27	King Ahaziah saw what happened, so he fled in his chariot toward the town of Beth Haggan, pursued by Jehu. “Kill him too!” Jehu ordered his men, and they wounded him
2KI.9.28	His officials took his body back to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in the royal tombs in David's City.
2KI.9.29	Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year that Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel.
2KI.9.30	Jehu arrived in Jezreel. Jezebel, having heard what had happened, put on eye shadow, arranged her hair, and stood looking down at the street from a window in the palace. 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu came through the gate, she called out, “You Zimri!
2KI.9.32	Jehu looked up and shouted, “Who is on my side?” Two or three palace officials looked down at him from a window, 
2KI.9.33	and Jehu said to them, “Throw her down!” They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses. Jehu drove his horses and chariot over her body, 
2KI.9.34	entered the palace, and had a meal. Only then did he say, “Take that cursed woman and bury her; after all, she is a king's daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	But the men who went out to bury her found nothing except her skull and the bones of her hands and feet. 
2KI.9.36	 When they reported this to Jehu, he said, “This is what the 
2KI.9.37	Her remains will be scattered there like dung, so that no one will be able to identify them.’”
2KI.10.1	There were seventy descendants of King Ahab living in the city of Samaria. Jehu wrote a letter and sent copies to the rulers of the city,
2KI.10.2	“You are in charge of the king's descendants, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, weapons, and fortified cities. So then, as soon as you receive this letter, 
2KI.10.3	you are to choose the best qualified of the king's descendants, make him king, and fight to defend him.”
2KI.10.4	The rulers of Samaria were terrified. “How can we oppose Jehu,” they said, “when neither King Joram nor King Ahaziah could?” 
2KI.10.5	So the officer in charge of the palace and the official in charge of the city, together with the leading citizens and the guardians, sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we are ready to do anything you say. But we will not make anyone king; do whatever you think best.”
2KI.10.6	Jehu wrote them another letter: “If you are with me and are ready to follow my orders, bring the heads of King Ahab's descendants to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
2KI.10.6	The seventy descendants of King Ahab were under the care of the leading citizens of Samaria, who were bringing them up. 
2KI.10.7	When Jehu's letter was received, the leaders of Samaria killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
2KI.10.8	When Jehu was told that the heads of Ahab's descendants had been brought, he ordered them to be piled up in two heaps at the city gate and to be left there until the following morning. 
2KI.10.9	In the morning he went out to the gate and said to the people who were there, “I was the one who plotted against King Joram and killed him; you are not responsible for that. But who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	This proves that everything that the 
2KI.10.11	 Then Jehu put to death all the other relatives of Ahab living in Jezreel, and all his officers, close friends, and priests; not one of them was left alive.
2KI.10.12	Jehu left Jezreel to go to Samaria. On the way, at a place called “Shepherds' Camp,” 
2KI.10.13	he met some relatives of the late King Ahaziah of Judah and asked them, “Who are you?”
2KI.10.13	“Ahaziah's relatives,” they answered. “We are going to Jezreel to pay our respects to the children of Queen Jezebel and to the rest of the royal family.” 
2KI.10.14	Jehu ordered his men, “Take them alive!” They seized them, and he put them to death near a pit there. There were forty-two people in all, and not one of them was left alive.
2KI.10.15	Jehu started out again, and on his way he was met by Jonadab son of Rechab. Jehu greeted him and said, “You and I think alike. Will you support me?”
2KI.10.15	“I will,” Jonadab answered.
2KI.10.15	“Give me your hand, then,” Jehu replied. They clasped hands, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot, 
2KI.10.16	saying, “Come with me and see for yourself how devoted I am to the 
2KI.10.17	When they arrived there, Jehu killed all of Ahab's relatives, not sparing even one. This is what the 
2KI.10.18	Jehu called the people of Samaria together and said, “King Ahab served the god Baal a little, but I will serve him much more. 
2KI.10.19	Call together all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests. No one is excused; I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal, and whoever is not present will be put to death.” (This was a trick on the part of Jehu by which he meant to kill all the worshipers of Baal.) 
2KI.10.20	Then Jehu ordered, “Proclaim a day of worship in honor of Baal!” The proclamation was made, 
2KI.10.21	and Jehu sent word throughout all the land of Israel. All who worshiped Baal came; not one of them failed to come. They all went into the temple of Baal, filling it from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	Then Jehu ordered the priest in charge of the sacred robes to bring the robes out and give them to the worshipers. 
2KI.10.23	After that, Jehu himself went into the temple with Jonadab son of Rechab and said to the people there, “Make sure that only worshipers of Baal are present and that no worshiper of the 
2KI.10.24	Then he and Jonadab went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings to Baal. He had stationed eighty men outside the temple and had instructed them: “You are to kill all these people; anyone who lets one of them escape will pay for it with his life!”
2KI.10.25	As soon as Jehu had presented the offerings, he said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them all; don't let anyone escape!” They went in with drawn swords, killed them all, and dragged the bodies outside. Then they went on into the inner sanctuary of the temple, 
2KI.10.26	brought out the sacred pillar that was there, and burned it. 
2KI.10.27	So they destroyed the sacred pillar and the temple, and turned the temple into a latrine—which it still is today.
2KI.10.28	That was how Jehu wiped out the worship of Baal in Israel. 
2KI.10.29	 But he imitated the sin of King Jeroboam, who led Israel into the sin of worshiping the gold bull-calves he set up in Bethel and in Dan. 
2KI.10.30	The 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu did not obey with all his heart the Law of the 
2KI.10.32	At that time the 
2KI.10.33	east of the Jordan, as far south as the town of Aroer on the Arnon River—this included the territories of Gilead and Bashan, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and East Manasseh lived.
2KI.10.34	Everything else that Jehu did, including his brave deeds, is recorded in 
2KI.10.35	He died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king. 
2KI.10.36	Jehu had ruled in Samaria as king of Israel for twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	As soon as King Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned of her son's murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family to be killed. 
2KI.11.2	Only Ahaziah's son Joash escaped. He was about to be killed with the others, but was rescued by his aunt Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half sister. She took him and his nurse into a bedroom in the Temple and hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. 
2KI.11.3	For six years Jehosheba took care of the boy and kept him hidden in the Temple, while Athaliah ruled as queen.
2KI.11.4	But in the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the officers in charge of the royal bodyguard and of the palace guards, and told them to come to the Temple, where he made them agree under oath to what he planned to do. He showed them King Ahaziah's son Joash 
2KI.11.5	and gave them the following orders: “When you come on duty on the Sabbath, one third of you are to guard the palace; 
2KI.11.6	another third are to stand guard at the Sur Gate, and the other third are to stand guard at the gate behind the other guards.
2KI.11.7	The two groups that go off duty on the Sabbath are to stand guard at the Temple to protect the king. 
2KI.11.8	You are to guard King Joash with drawn swords and stay with him wherever he goes. Anyone who comes near you is to be killed.”
2KI.11.9	The officers obeyed Jehoiada's instructions and brought their men to him—those going off duty on the Sabbath and those going on duty. 
2KI.11.10	He gave the officers the spears
2KI.11.11	and he stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple, to protect the king. 
2KI.11.12	Then Jehoiada led Joash out, placed the crown on his head, and gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship. Then Joash was anointed and proclaimed king. The people clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	Queen Athaliah heard the noise being made by the guards and the people, so she hurried to the Temple, where the crowd had gathered. 
2KI.11.14	 There she saw the new king standing by the column at the entrance of the Temple, as was the custom. He was surrounded by the officers and the trumpeters, and the people were all shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in distress and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”
2KI.11.15	Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area, so he ordered the army officers: “Take her out between the rows of guards, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her.” 
2KI.11.16	They seized her, took her to the palace, and there at the Horse Gate they killed her.
2KI.11.17	The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people make a covenant with the 
2KI.11.18	Then the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down; they smashed the altars and the idols, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
2KI.11.18	Jehoiada put guards on duty at the Temple, 
2KI.11.19	and then he, the officers, the royal bodyguard, and the palace guards escorted the king from the Temple to the palace, followed by all the people. Joash entered by the Guard Gate and took his place on the throne. 
2KI.11.20	All the people were filled with happiness, and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been killed in the palace.
2KI.11.21	Joash became king of Judah at the age of seven.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of the reign of King Jehu of Israel, Joash became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother was Zibiah from the city of Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	Throughout his life he did what pleased the 
2KI.12.3	However, the pagan places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2KI.12.5	Each priest was to be responsible for the money brought by those he served, and the money was to be used to repair the Temple, as needed.
2KI.12.6	But by the twenty-third year of Joash's reign the priests still had not made any repairs in the Temple. 
2KI.12.7	So he called in Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them, “Why aren't you repairing the Temple? From now on you are not to keep the money you receive; you must hand it over, so that the repairs can be made.” 
2KI.12.8	The priests agreed to this and also agreed not to make the repairs in the Temple.
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada took a box, made a hole in the lid, and placed the box by the altar, on the right side as one enters the Temple. The priests on duty at the entrance put in the box all the money given by the worshipers. 
2KI.12.10	Whenever there was a large amount of money in the box, the royal secretary and the High Priest would come, melt down the silver, and weigh it.
2KI.12.11	After recording the exact amount, they would hand the silver over to the men in charge of the work in the Temple, and these would pay the carpenters, the builders, 
2KI.12.12	the masons, and the stone cutters, buy the timber and the stones used in the repairs, and pay all other necessary expenses. 
2KI.12.13	None of the money, however, was used to pay for making silver cups, bowls, trumpets, or tools for tending the lamps, or any other article of silver or of gold. 
2KI.12.14	It was all used to pay the workers and to buy the materials used in the repairs. 
2KI.12.15	 The men in charge of the work were thoroughly honest, so there was no need to require them to account for the funds. 
2KI.12.16	 The money given for the repayment offerings and for the offerings for sin was not deposited in the box; it belonged to the priests.
2KI.12.17	At that time King Hazael of Syria attacked the city of Gath and conquered it; then he decided to attack Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	King Joash of Judah took all the offerings that his predecessors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated to the 
2KI.12.19	Everything else that King Joash did is recorded in 
2KI.12.20+2KI.12.21	King Joash's officials plotted against him, and two of them, Jozacar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer, killed him at the house built on the land that was filled in on the east side of Jerusalem, on the road that goes down to Silla. Joash was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash son of Ahaziah as king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for seventeen years. 
2KI.13.2	Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against the 
2KI.13.3	So the 
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz prayed to the 
2KI.13.5	The

2KI.13.17	Then, following the prophet's instructions, the king opened the window that faced toward Syria. “Shoot the arrow!” Elisha ordered. As soon as the king shot the arrow, the prophet exclaimed, “You are the 
2KI.13.18	Then Elisha told the king to take the other arrows and strike the ground with them. The king struck the ground three times, and then stopped. 
2KI.13.19	This made Elisha angry, and he said to the king, “You should have struck five or six times, and then you would have won complete victory over the Syrians; but now you will defeat them only three times.”

2KI.14.5	As soon as Amaziah was firmly in power, he executed the officials who had killed his father, the king. 
2KI.14.6	 However, he did not kill their children but followed what the 
2KI.14.7	Amaziah killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers in Salt Valley; he captured the city of Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, the name it still has.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash of Israel, challenging him to fight.
2KI.14.9	But King Jehoash sent back the following reply: “Once a thorn bush on the Lebanon Mountains sent a message to a cedar: ‘Give your daughter in marriage to my son.’ A wild animal passed by and trampled the bush down. 
2KI.14.10	Now Amaziah, you have defeated the Edomites, and you are filled with pride. Be satisfied with your fame and stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and your people?”
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah refused to listen, so King Jehoash marched out with his men and fought against him at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Amaziah's army was defeated, and all his soldiers fled to their homes. 
2KI.14.13	Jehoash took Amaziah prisoner, advanced on Jerusalem, and tore down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of two hundred yards.

2KI.16.2	at the age of twenty, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not follow the good example of his ancestor King David; instead, he did what was not pleasing to the 
2KI.16.3	 and followed the example of the kings of Israel. He even sacrificed his own son as a burnt offering to idols, imitating the disgusting practice of the people whom the 
2KI.16.4	At the pagan places of worship, on the hills, and under every shady tree, Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense.
2KI.16.6	At the same time the king of Edom
2KI.16.7	Ahaz sent men to Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, with this message: “I am your devoted servant. Come and rescue me from the kings of Syria and of Israel, who are attacking me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold from the Temple and the palace treasury, and sent it as a present to the emperor.

2KI.16.11	So Uriah built an altar just like it and finished it before Ahaz returned. 
2KI.16.12	On his return from Damascus, Ahaz saw that the altar was finished,

Pour on it the blood of all the animals that are sacrificed. But keep the bronze altar for me to use for divination.” 
2KI.16.16	Uriah did as the king commanded.

2KI.17.3	Emperor Shalmaneser of Assyria made war against him; Hoshea surrendered to Shalmaneser and paid him tribute every year. 
2KI.17.4	But one year Hoshea sent messengers to So, king of Egypt,

2KI.17.6	which was the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea, the Assyrian emperor
2KI.17.7	Samaria fell because the Israelites sinned against the

2KI.17.9	The Israelites did
2KI.17.10	 On all the hills and under every shady tree they put up stone pillars and images of the goddess Asherah, 
2KI.17.11	and they burned incense on all the pagan altars, following the practice of the people whom the

2KI.17.13	The 
2KI.17.14	But they would not obey; they were stubborn like their ancestors, who had not trusted in the 
2KI.17.15	They refused to obey his instructions, they did not keep the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and they disregarded his warnings. They worshiped worthless idols and became worthless themselves, and they followed the customs of the surrounding nations, disobeying the 
2KI.17.16	 They broke all the laws of the 
2KI.17.17	 They sacrificed their sons and daughters as burnt offerings to pagan gods; they consulted mediums and fortunetellers, and they devoted themselves completely to doing what is wrong in the 
2KI.17.18	The 
2KI.17.19	But even the people of Judah did not obey the laws of the 
2KI.17.20	The 
2KI.17.21	After the 
2KI.17.22	They followed Jeroboam and continued to practice all the sins he had committed, 
2KI.17.23	until at last the 
2KI.17.24	The emperor of Assyria took people from the cities of Babylon, Cuth, Ivvah, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria
2KI.17.25	When they first settled there, they did not worship the 
2KI.17.26	The emperor of Assyria was told that the people he had settled in the cities of Samaria did not know the law of the god of that land, and so the god had sent lions, which were killing them. 
2KI.17.27	So the emperor commanded: “Send back one of the priests we brought as prisoners; have him
2KI.17.28	So an Israelite priest who had been deported from Samaria went and lived in Bethel, where he taught the people how to worship the 
2KI.17.29	But the people who settled in Samaria continued to make their own idols, and they placed them in the shrines that the Israelites had built. Each different group made idols in the cities they were living in: 
2KI.17.30	the people of Babylon made idols of the god Succoth Benoth; the people of Cuth, idols of Nergal; the people of Hamath, idols of Ashima; 
2KI.17.31	the people of Ivvah, idols of Nibhaz and Tartak; and the people of Sepharvaim sacrificed their children as burnt offerings to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech. 
2KI.17.32	These people also worshiped the 
2KI.17.33	So they worshiped the 
2KI.17.35	 The 
2KI.17.36	 You shall obey me, the 
2KI.17.37	You shall always obey the laws and commands that I wrote for you. You shall not obey other gods, 
2KI.17.38	and you shall not forget the covenant I made with you. 
2KI.17.39	You shall obey me, the 
2KI.17.40	But those people would not listen, and they continued to follow their old customs.
2KI.17.41	So those people worshiped the 
2KI.18.1	In the third year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah as king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah 
2KI.18.2	at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	Following the example of his ancestor King David, he did what was pleasing to the 
2KI.18.4	 He destroyed the pagan places of worship, broke the stone pillars, and cut down the images of the goddess Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze snake that Moses had made, which was called Nehushtan. Up to that time the people of Israel had burned incense in its honor. 
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	He was faithful to the 
2KI.18.7	So the 
2KI.18.8	He defeated the Philistines and raided their settlements, from the smallest village to the largest city, including Gaza and its surrounding territory.
2KI.18.9	In the fourth year of Hezekiah's reign—which was the seventh year of King Hoshea's reign over Israel—Emperor Shalmaneser of Assyria invaded Israel and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.18.10	In the third year of the siege Samaria fell; this was the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign and the ninth year of Hoshea's reign. 
2KI.18.11	The Assyrian emperor
2KI.18.12	Samaria fell because the Israelites did not obey the 
2KI.18.13	In the fourteenth year of the reign of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and conquered them. 
2KI.18.14	Hezekiah sent a message to Sennacherib, who was in Lachish: “I have done wrong; please stop your attack, and I will pay whatever you demand.” The emperor's answer was that Hezekiah should send him ten tons of silver and one ton of gold. 
2KI.18.15	Hezekiah sent him all the silver in the Temple and in the palace treasury; 
2KI.18.16	he also stripped the gold from the temple doors and the gold with which he himself had covered the doorposts, and he sent it all to Sennacherib. 
2KI.18.17	The Assyrian emperor sent a large army from Lachish to attack Hezekiah at Jerusalem; it was commanded by his three highest officials. When they arrived at Jerusalem, they occupied the road where the cloth makers work by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. 
2KI.18.18	Then they sent for King Hezekiah, and three of his officials went out to meet them: Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace; Shebna, the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, who was in charge of the records. 
2KI.18.19	One of the Assyrian officials told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident. 
2KI.18.20	He demanded, “Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might? Who do you think will help you rebel against Assyria? 
2KI.18.21	You are expecting Egypt to help you, but that would be like using a reed as a walking stick—it would break and jab your hand. That is what the king of Egypt is like when anyone relies on him.”
2KI.18.22	The Assyrian official went on, “Or will you tell me that you are relying on the 
2KI.18.23	I will make a bargain with you in the name of the emperor. I will give you two thousand horses if you can find that many men to ride them! 
2KI.18.24	You are no match for even the lowest ranking Assyrian official, and yet you expect the Egyptians to send you chariots and cavalry! 
2KI.18.25	Do you think I have attacked your country and destroyed it without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the official, “Speak Aramaic to us, sir. We understand it. Don't speak Hebrew; all the people on the wall are listening.”
2KI.18.27	He replied, “Do you think you and the king are the only ones the emperor sent me to say all these things to? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall, who will have to eat their excrement and drink their urine, just as you will.”
2KI.18.28	Then the official stood up and shouted in Hebrew, “Listen to what the emperor of Assyria is telling you! 
2KI.18.29	He warns you not to let Hezekiah deceive you. Hezekiah can't save you. 
2KI.18.30	And don't let him persuade you to rely on the 
2KI.18.31	Don't listen to Hezekiah. The emperor of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. You will all be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells— 
2KI.18.32	until the emperor resettles you in a country much like your own, where there are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread; it is a land of olives, olive oil, and honey. If you do what he commands, you will not die, but live. Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the 
2KI.18.33	Did the gods of any other nations save their countries from the emperor of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are they now, the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did anyone save Samaria? 
2KI.18.35	When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our emperor? Then what makes you think the 
2KI.18.36	The people kept quiet, just as King Hezekiah had told them to; they did not say a word. 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes in grief, and went and reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said.
2KI.19.1	As soon as King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes in grief, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple of the 
2KI.19.2	He sent Eliakim, the official in charge of the palace, Shebna, the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They also were wearing sackcloth. 
2KI.19.3	This is the message which he told them to give Isaiah: “Today is a day of suffering; we are being punished and are in disgrace. We are like a woman who is ready to give birth, but is too weak to do it. 
2KI.19.4	The Assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living God. May the 
2KI.19.5	When Isaiah received King Hezekiah's message, 
2KI.19.6	he sent back this answer: “The 
2KI.19.7	The 
2KI.19.8	The Assyrian official learned that the emperor had left Lachish and was fighting against the nearby city of Libnah; so he went there to consult him. 
2KI.19.9	Word reached the Assyrians that the Egyptian army, led by King Tirhakah of Ethiopia,
2KI.19.10	to tell him, “The god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands, but don't let that deceive you. 
2KI.19.11	You have heard what an Assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy. Do you think that you can escape? 
2KI.19.12	My ancestors destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and killed the people of Betheden who lived in Telassar, and none of their gods could save them. 
2KI.19.13	Where are the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
2KI.19.14	King Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went to the Temple, placed the letter there in the presence of the 
2KI.19.15	 and prayed, “O 
2KI.19.16	Now, 
2KI.19.17	We all know, 
2KI.19.18	and burned up their gods—which were no gods at all, only images of wood and stone made by human hands. 
2KI.19.19	Now, 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah sent a message telling King Hezekiah that in answer to the king's prayer 
2KI.19.21	the 
2KI.19.22	Whom do you think you have been insulting and ridiculing? You have been disrespectful to me, the holy God of Israel. 
2KI.19.23	You sent your messengers to boast to me that with all your chariots you had conquered the highest mountains of Lebanon. You boasted that there you cut down the tallest cedars and the finest cypress trees and that you reached the deepest parts of the forests. 
2KI.19.24	You boasted that you dug wells and drank water in foreign lands and that the feet of your soldiers tramped the Nile River dry.
2KI.19.25	“Have you never heard that I planned all this long ago? And now I have carried it out. I gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble. 
2KI.19.26	The people who lived there were powerless; they were frightened and stunned. They were like grass in a field or weeds growing on a roof when the hot east wind blasts them.
2KI.19.27	“But I know everything about you, what you do and where you go. I know how you rage against me. 
2KI.19.28	I have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours, and now I will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth, and take you back by the same road you came.”
2KI.19.29	Then Isaiah said to King Hezekiah, “Here is a sign of what will happen. This year and next you will have only wild grain to eat, but the following year you will be able to plant your grain and harvest it, and plant vines and eat grapes. 
2KI.19.30	Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit. 
2KI.19.31	There will be people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive, because the 
2KI.19.32	“And this is what the 
2KI.19.33	He will go back by the same road he came, without entering this city. I, the 
2KI.19.34	I will defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.’”
2KI.19.35	That night an angel of the 
2KI.19.36	Then the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	One day, when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords and then escaped to the land of Ararat. Another of his sons, Esarhaddon, succeeded him as emperor.
2KI.20.1	About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and said to him, “The 
2KI.20.2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed: 
2KI.20.3	“Remember, 
2KI.20.4	Isaiah left the king, but before he had passed through the central courtyard of the palace the 
2KI.20.5	to go back to Hezekiah, ruler of the 
2KI.20.6	I will let you live fifteen years longer. I will rescue you and this city Jerusalem from the emperor of Assyria. I will defend this city, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.”
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah told the king's attendants to put on his boil a paste made of figs, and he would get well.
2KI.20.8	King Hezekiah asked, “What is the sign to prove that the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah replied, “The 
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It's easy to have the shadow go forward ten steps!
2KI.20.11	Isaiah prayed to the 
2KI.20.12	About that same time the king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been sick, so he sent him a letter and a present. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth—his silver and gold, his spices and perfumes, and all his military equipment. There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them. 
2KI.20.14	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did these men come from and what did they say to you?”
2KI.20.14	Hezekiah answered, “They came from a very distant country, from Babylonia.”
2KI.20.15	“What did they see in the palace?”
2KI.20.15	“They saw everything. There is nothing in the storerooms that I didn't show them.”
2KI.20.16	Isaiah then told the king, “The 
2KI.20.17	 a time is coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylonia. Nothing will be left. 
2KI.20.18	 Some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylonia.”
2KI.20.19	King Hezekiah understood this to mean that there would be peace and security during his lifetime, so he replied, “The message you have given me from the 
2KI.20.20	Everything else that King Hezekiah did, his brave deeds, and an account of how he built a reservoir and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city, are all recorded in 
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. His mother was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	 Following the disgusting practices of the nations whom the 
2KI.21.3	He rebuilt the pagan places of worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he built altars for the worship of Baal and made an image of the goddess Asherah, as King Ahab of Israel had done. Manasseh also worshiped the stars. 
2KI.21.4	 He built pagan altars in the Temple, the place that the 
2KI.21.5	In the two courtyards of the Temple he built altars for the worship of the stars. 
2KI.21.6	He sacrificed his son as a burnt offering. He practiced divination and magic and consulted
2KI.21.7	 He placed the symbol of the goddess Asherah in the Temple, the place about which the 
2KI.21.8	And if the people of Israel will obey all my commands and keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them, then I will not allow them to be driven out of the land that I gave to their ancestors.” 
2KI.21.9	But the people of Judah did not obey the 
2KI.21.10	Through his servants the prophets the 
2KI.21.11	“King Manasseh has done these disgusting things, things far worse than what the Canaanites did; and with his idols he has led the people of Judah into sin. 
2KI.21.12	So I, the 
2KI.21.13	I will punish Jerusalem as I did Samaria, as I did King Ahab of Israel and his descendants. I will wipe Jerusalem clean of its people, as clean as a plate that has been wiped and turned upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will abandon the people who survive, and will hand them over to their enemies, who will conquer them and plunder their land. 
2KI.21.15	I will do this to my people because they have sinned against me and have stirred up my anger from the time their ancestors came out of Egypt to this day.”
2KI.21.16	Manasseh killed so many innocent people that the streets of Jerusalem were flowing with blood; he did this in addition to leading the people of Judah into idolatry, causing them to sin against the 
2KI.21.17	Everything else that Manasseh did, including the sins he committed, is recorded in 
2KI.21.18	Manasseh died and was buried in the palace garden, the garden of Uzza, and his son Amon succeeded him as king.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for two years. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz from the town of Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	Like his father Manasseh, he sinned against the 
2KI.21.21	he imitated his father's actions, and he worshiped the idols that his father had worshiped. 
2KI.21.22	He rejected the 
2KI.21.23	Amon's officials plotted against him and assassinated him in the palace. 
2KI.21.24	The people of Judah killed Amon's assassins and made his son Josiah king.
2KI.21.25	Everything else that Amon did is recorded in 
2KI.21.26	Amon was buried in the tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah succeeded him as king.
2KI.22.2	Josiah did what was pleasing to the 
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the court secretary Shaphan, the son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, to the Temple with the order: 
2KI.22.4	“Go to the High Priest Hilkiah and get a report on the amount of money that the priests on duty at the entrance to the Temple have collected from the people. 
2KI.22.5	Tell him to give the money to the men who are in charge of the repairs in the Temple. They are to pay 
2KI.22.6	the carpenters, the builders, and the masons, and buy the timber and the stones used in the repairs. 
2KI.22.7	 The men in charge of the work are thoroughly honest, so there is no need to require them to account for the funds.”
2KI.22.8	Shaphan delivered the king's order to Hilkiah, and Hilkiah told him that he had found the book of the Law in the Temple. Hilkiah gave him the book, and Shaphan read it. 
2KI.22.9	Then he went back to the king and reported: “Your servants have taken the money that was in the Temple and have handed it over to the men in charge of the repairs.” 
2KI.22.10	And then he said, “I have here a book that Hilkiah gave me.” And he read it aloud to the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the book being read, he tore his clothes in dismay, 
2KI.22.12	and gave the following order to Hilkiah the priest, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, to Achbor son of Micaiah, to Shaphan, the court secretary, and to Asaiah, the king's attendant: 
2KI.22.13	“Go and consult the 
2KI.22.14	Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to consult a woman named Huldah, a prophet who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. (Her husband Shallum, the son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas, was in charge of the Temple robes.) They described to her what had happened, 
2KI.22.15	and she told them to go back to the king and give him 
2KI.22.16	the following message from the 
2KI.22.17	They have rejected me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and so have stirred up my anger by all they have done. My anger is aroused against Jerusalem, and it will not die down. 
2KI.22.18	As for the king himself, this is what I, the 
2KI.22.19	and you repented and humbled yourself before me, tearing your clothes and weeping, when you heard how I threatened to punish Jerusalem and its people. I will make it a terrifying sight, a place whose name people will use as a curse. But I have heard your prayer, 
2KI.22.20	and the punishment which I am going to bring on Jerusalem will not come until after your death. I will let you die in peace.”
2KI.22.20	The men returned to King Josiah with this message.
2KI.23.1	King Josiah summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, 
2KI.23.2	and together they went to the Temple, accompanied by the priests and the prophets and all the rest of the people, rich and poor alike. Before them all the king read aloud the whole book of the covenant which had been found in the Temple. 
2KI.23.3	He stood by the royal column and made a covenant with the 
2KI.23.5	He removed from office the priests that the kings of Judah had ordained to offer sacrifices
2KI.23.6	He removed from the Temple the symbol of the goddess Asherah, took it out of the city to Kidron Valley, burned it, pounded its ashes to dust, and scattered it over the public burying ground. 
2KI.23.7	He destroyed the living quarters in the Temple occupied by the temple prostitutes.
2KI.23.8	He brought to Jerusalem the priests who were in the cities of Judah, and throughout the whole country he desecrated the altars where they had offered sacrifices. He also tore down the altars dedicated to the goat demons near the gate built by Joshua, the city governor, which was to the left of the main gate as one enters the city. 
2KI.23.9	Those priests were not allowed to serve in the Temple, but they could eat the unleavened bread provided for their fellow priests.
2KI.23.11	He also removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the worship of the sun, and he burned the chariots used in this worship. (These were kept in the temple courtyard, near the gate and not far from the living quarters of Nathan Melech, a high official.) 
2KI.23.12	 The altars which the kings of Judah had built on the palace roof above King Ahaz' quarters, King Josiah tore down, along with the altars put up by King Manasseh in the two courtyards of the Temple; he smashed the altars to bits
2KI.23.13	 Josiah desecrated the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Olives,
2KI.23.14	King Josiah broke the stone pillars to pieces, cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and the ground where they had stood he covered with human bones.
2KI.23.16	 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill; he had the bones taken out of them and burned on the altar. In this way he desecrated the altar, doing what the prophet had predicted long before during the festival as King Jeroboam was standing by the altar. King Josiah looked around and saw the tomb of the prophet
2KI.23.17	 “Whose tomb is that?” he asked.
2KI.23.17	The people of Bethel answered, “It is the tomb of the prophet who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done to this altar.”
2KI.23.18	“Leave it as it is,” Josiah ordered. “His bones are not to be moved.”
2KI.23.18	So his bones were not moved, neither were those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2KI.23.19	In every city of Israel King Josiah tore down all the pagan places of worship which had been built by the kings of Israel, who thereby aroused the 
2KI.23.20	He killed all the pagan priests on the altars where they served, and he burned human bones on every altar. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	King Josiah ordered the people to celebrate the Passover in honor of the 
2KI.23.22	No Passover like this one had ever been celebrated by any of the kings of Israel or of Judah, since the time when judges ruled the nation. 
2KI.23.23	Now at last, in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the Passover was celebrated in Jerusalem.
2KI.23.24	In order to enforce the laws written in the book that the High Priest Hilkiah had found in the Temple, King Josiah removed from Jerusalem and the rest of Judah all the mediums and fortunetellers, and all the household gods, idols, and all other pagan objects of worship. 
2KI.23.25	There had never been a king like him before, who served the 
2KI.23.26	But the 
2KI.23.27	The 
2KI.23.28	Everything else that King Josiah did is recorded in 
2KI.23.29	While Josiah was king, King Neco of Egypt led an army to the Euphrates River to help the emperor of Assyria. King Josiah tried to stop the Egyptian army at Megiddo and was killed in battle. 
2KI.23.30	His officials placed his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where he was buried in the royal tombs.
2KI.23.30	The people of Judah chose Josiah's son Joahaz and anointed him king.
2KI.23.31	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from the city of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	Following the example of his ancestors, he sinned against the 
2KI.23.33	His reign ended when King Neco of Egypt took him prisoner in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and made Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold as tribute. 
2KI.23.34	 King Neco made Josiah's son Eliakim king of Judah as successor to Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Joahaz was taken to Egypt by King Neco, and there he died.
2KI.23.35	King Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people in proportion to their wealth, in order to raise the amount needed to pay the tribute demanded by the king of Egypt.
2KI.23.37	Following the example of his ancestors, Jehoiakim sinned against the 
2KI.24.2	The 
2KI.24.3	This happened at the 
2KI.24.4	and especially because of all the innocent people he had killed. The 
2KI.24.5	Everything that Jehoiakim did is recorded in 
2KI.24.6	Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king.
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt and his army never marched out of Egypt again, because the king of Babylonia now controlled all the territory that had belonged to Egypt, from the Euphrates River to the northern border of Egypt.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	Following the example of his father, Jehoiachin sinned against the 
2KI.24.10	It was during his reign that the Babylonian army, commanded by King Nebuchadnezzar's officers, marched against Jerusalem and besieged it. 
2KI.24.11	During the siege Nebuchadnezzar himself came to Jerusalem, 
2KI.24.12	 and King Jehoiachin, along with his mother, his sons, his officers, and the palace officials, surrendered to the Babylonians. In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign he took Jehoiachin prisoner 
2KI.24.13	and carried off to Babylon all the treasures in the Temple and the palace. As the 
2KI.24.14	Nebuchadnezzar carried away as prisoners the people of Jerusalem, all the royal princes, and all the leading men, ten thousand in all. He also deported all the skilled workers, including the blacksmiths, leaving only the poorest of the people behind in Judah.
2KI.24.16	Nebuchadnezzar deported all the important men to Babylonia, seven thousand in all, and one thousand skilled workers, including the blacksmiths, all of them able-bodied men fit for military duty.
2KI.24.19	King Zedekiah sinned against the 
2KI.24.20	 The 
2KI.25.2	and kept it under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the fourth month
2KI.25.4	 the city walls were broken through. Although the Babylonians were surrounding the city, all the soldiers escaped during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and fled in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
2KI.25.5	But the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah, captured him in the plains near Jericho, and all his soldiers deserted him. 
2KI.25.6	Zedekiah was taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
2KI.25.7	 While Zedekiah was looking on, his sons were put to death; then Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah's eyes put out, placed him in chains, and took him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	On the seventh day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, Nebuzaradan, adviser to the king and commander of his army, entered Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	 He burned down the Temple, the palace, and the houses of all the important people in Jerusalem, 
2KI.25.10	and his soldiers tore down the city walls. 
2KI.25.11	Then Nebuzaradan took away to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, the remaining skilled workers,
2KI.25.12	But he left in Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and put them to work in the vineyards and fields.
2KI.25.14	 They also took away the shovels and the ash containers used in cleaning the altar, the tools used in tending the lamps, the bowls used for catching the blood from the sacrifices, the bowls used for burning incense, and all the other bronze articles used in the Temple service. 
2KI.25.15	They took away everything that was made of gold or silver, including the small bowls and the pans used for carrying live coals. 
2KI.25.16	The bronze objects that King Solomon had made for the Temple—the two columns, the carts, and the large tank—were too heavy to weigh. 
2KI.25.17	The two columns were identical: each one was 27 feet high, with a bronze capital on top, 4½ feet high. All around each capital was a bronze grillwork decorated with pomegranates made of bronze.
2KI.25.18	In addition, Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners Seraiah the High Priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three other important Temple officials. 
2KI.25.19	From the city he took the officer who had been in command of the troops, five of the king's personal advisers who were still in the city, the commander's assistant, who was in charge of military records, and sixty other important men. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan took them to the king of Babylonia, who was in the city of Riblah 
2KI.25.21	in the territory of Hamath. There the king had them beaten and put to death.
2KI.25.21	So the people of Judah were carried away from their land into exile.
2KI.25.23	When the Judean officers and soldiers who had not surrendered heard about this, they joined Gedaliah at Mizpah. These officers were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth from the town of Netophah, and Jezaniah from Maacah. 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah said to them, “I give you my word that there is no need for you to be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Settle in this land, serve the king of Babylonia, and all will go well with you.”
2KI.25.26	 Then all the Israelites, rich and poor alike, together with the army officers, left and went to Egypt, because they were afraid of the Babylonians.
2KI.25.27	In the year that Evil-merodach became king of Babylonia, he showed kindness to King Jehoiachin of Judah by releasing him from prison. This happened on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin had been taken away as prisoner. 
2KI.25.28	Evil-merodach treated him kindly and gave him a position of greater honor than he gave the other kings who were exiles with him in Babylonia. 
2KI.25.29	So Jehoiachin was permitted to change from his prison clothes and to dine at the king's table for the rest of his life. 
2KI.25.30	Each day, for as long as he lived, he was given a regular allowance for his needs.

1CH.12.16	Once a group of men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah went out to the fort where David was. 
1CH.12.17	David went to meet them and said, “If you are coming as friends to help me, you are welcome here. Join us! But if you intend to betray me to my enemies, even though I have not tried to hurt you, the God of our ancestors will know it and punish you.”
1CH.12.18	God's spirit took control of one of them, Amasai, who later became the commander of “The Thirty,” and he called out,
1CH.12.18	“David son of Jesse, we are yours!
1CH.12.18	Success to you and those who help you!
1CH.12.18	God is on your side.”
1CH.12.18	David welcomed them and made them officers in his army.
1CH.12.19	Some soldiers from the tribe of Manasseh went over to David's side when he was marching out with the Philistines to fight King Saul. Actually he did not help the Philistines, for their kings were afraid that he would betray them to his former master Saul, so they sent him back to Ziklag. 
1CH.12.20	These are the soldiers from Manasseh who went over to David's side when he was returning: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. In Manasseh they had all commanded units of a thousand men. 
1CH.12.21	They served David as officers over his troops,
1CH.12.22	Almost every day new men joined David's forces, so that his army was soon enormous.

1CH.12.38	All these soldiers, ready for battle, went to Hebron, determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the people of Israel were united in the same purpose. 
1CH.12.39	They spent three days there with David, feasting on the food and drink which their relatives had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	From as far away as the northern tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, people came bringing donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen loaded with food—flour, figs, raisins, wine, and olive oil. They also brought cattle and sheep to kill and eat. All this was an expression of the joy that was felt throughout the whole country.
1CH.13.1	King David consulted with all the officers in command of units of a thousand men and units of a hundred men. 
1CH.13.2	Then he announced to all the people of Israel, “If you give your approval and if it is the will of the 
1CH.13.3	Then we will go and get God's Covenant Box, which was ignored while Saul was king.” 
1CH.13.4	The people were pleased with the suggestion and agreed to it.
1CH.13.6	 David and the people went to the city of Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, in the territory of Judah, to get the Covenant Box of God, which bears the name of the 
1CH.13.7	At Abinadab's house they brought out the Covenant Box and put it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio guided the cart, 
1CH.13.8	while David and all the people danced with all their might to honor God. They sang and played musical instruments—harps, drums, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	As they came to the threshing place of Chidon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Covenant Box. 
1CH.13.10	At once the 
1CH.13.11	and so that place has been called Perez Uzzah
1CH.13.13	So David did not take it with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he left it at the house of a man named Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath. 
1CH.13.14	 It stayed there three months, and the 
1CH.14.1	King Hiram of Tyre sent a trade mission to David; he provided him with cedar logs and with stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace. 
1CH.14.2	And so David realized that the 
1CH.14.3	There in Jerusalem, David married more wives and had more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	The following children were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada,
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had now been made king over the whole country of Israel, their army went out to capture him. So David marched out to meet them. 
1CH.14.9	The Philistines arrived at Rephaim Valley and began plundering. 
1CH.14.10	David asked God, “Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give me the victory?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So David attacked them at Baal Perazim and defeated them. He said, “God has used me to break through the enemy army like a flood.” So that place is called Baal Perazim.
1CH.14.12	When the Philistines fled, they left their idols behind, and David gave orders for them to be burned.
1CH.14.13	Soon the Philistines returned to the valley and started plundering it again. 
1CH.14.14	Once more David consulted God, who answered, “Don't attack them from here, but go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	When you hear the sound of marching in the treetops, then attack, because I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.” 
1CH.14.16	David did what God had commanded, and so he drove the Philistines back from Gibeon all the way to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	David's fame spread everywhere, and the 
1CH.15.1	For his own use, David built houses in David's City.
1CH.15.2	 Then he said, “Only Levites should carry the Covenant Box, because they are the ones the 
1CH.15.3	So David summoned all the people of Israel to Jerusalem in order to bring the Covenant Box to the place he had prepared for it. 
1CH.15.4	Next he sent for the descendants of Aaron and for the Levites. 
1CH.15.5	From the Levite clan of Kohath came Uriel, in charge of 120 members of his clan; 
1CH.15.6	from the clan of Merari came Asaiah, in charge of 220; 
1CH.15.7	from the clan of Gershon, Joel, in charge of 130; 
1CH.15.8	from the clan of Elizaphan, Shemaiah, in charge of 200; 
1CH.15.9	from the clan of Hebron, Eliel, in charge of 80; 
1CH.15.10	and from the clan of Uzziel, Amminadab, in charge of 112.
1CH.15.11	David called in the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the six Levites, Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	He said to the Levites, “You are the leaders of the Levite clans. Purify yourselves and your fellow Levites, so that you can bring the Covenant Box of the 
1CH.15.13	Because you were not there to carry it the first time, the 
1CH.15.14	Then the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to move the Covenant Box of the 
1CH.15.15	 The Levites carried it on poles on their shoulders, as the 
1CH.15.16	David commanded the leaders of the Levites to assign various Levites to sing and to play joyful music on harps and cymbals. 
1CH.15.17+1CH.15.18+1CH.15.19+1CH.15.20+1CH.15.21	From the clans of singers they chose the following men to play the brass cymbals: Heman son of Joel, his relative Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah, of the clan of Merari. To assist them they chose the following Levites to play the high-pitched harps: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah.
1CH.15.17+1CH.15.18+1CH.15.19+1CH.15.20+1CH.15.21	To play the low-pitched harps they chose the following Levites: Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Azaziah, and the Temple guards, Obed Edom and Jeiel.
1CH.15.22	Because of his skill in music Chenaniah was chosen to be in charge of the levitical musicians. 
1CH.15.23+1CH.15.24	Berechiah and Elkanah, along with Obed Edom and Jehiah, were chosen as guards for the Covenant Box. The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were chosen to blow trumpets in front of the Covenant Box.
1CH.15.25	So King David, the leaders of Israel, and the military commanders went to the house of Obed Edom to get the Covenant Box, and they had a great celebration. 
1CH.15.26	They sacrificed seven bulls and seven sheep, to make sure that God would help the Levites who were carrying the Covenant Box. 
1CH.15.27	David was wearing a robe made of the finest linen, and so were the musicians, Chenaniah their leader, and the Levites who carried the Box. David also wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	So all the Israelites accompanied the Covenant Box up to Jerusalem with shouts of joy, the sound of trumpets, horns, and cymbals, and the music of harps.
1CH.15.29	As the Box was being brought into the city, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and leaping for joy, and she was disgusted with him.
1CH.16.1	They took the Covenant Box to the tent which David had prepared for it and put it inside. Then they offered sacrifices and fellowship offerings to God. 
1CH.16.2	After David had finished offering the sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	and distributed food to them all. He gave each man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a piece of roasted meat,
1CH.16.4	David appointed some of the Levites to lead the worship of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was appointed leader, with Zechariah as his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel were to play harps. Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
1CH.16.6	and two priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, were to blow trumpets regularly in front of the Covenant Box. 
1CH.16.7	It was then that David first gave Asaph and the other Levites the responsibility for singing praises to the 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks to the 
1CH.16.8	tell the nations what he has done.
1CH.16.9	Sing praise to the 
1CH.16.9	tell the wonderful things he has done.
1CH.16.10	Be glad that we belong to him;
1CH.16.10	let all who worship him rejoice!
1CH.16.11	Go to the 
1CH.16.11	and worship him continually.
1CH.16.12+1CH.16.13	You descendants of Jacob, God's servant,
1CH.16.12+1CH.16.13	descendants of Israel, whom God chose,
1CH.16.12+1CH.16.13	remember the miracles that God performed
1CH.16.12+1CH.16.13	and the judgments that he gave.
1CH.16.14	The 
1CH.16.14	his commands are for all the world.
1CH.16.15	Never forget God's covenant,
1CH.16.15	which he made to last forever,
1CH.16.16	the promise he made to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	one that will last forever.
1CH.16.18	“I will give you the land of Canaan,” he said.
1CH.16.18	“It will be your own possession.”
1CH.16.19	God's people were few in number,
1CH.16.19	strangers in the land of Canaan.
1CH.16.20	They wandered from country to country,
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another.
1CH.16.21	to protect them, he warned the kings:
1CH.16.22	“Don't harm my chosen servants;
1CH.16.22	do not touch my prophets.”
1CH.16.23	Sing to the 
1CH.16.23	Proclaim every day the good news that he has saved us.
1CH.16.24	Proclaim his glory to the nations,
1CH.16.24	his mighty deeds to all peoples.
1CH.16.25	The 
1CH.16.25	he is to be honored more than all the gods.
1CH.16.26	The gods of all other nations are only idols,
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Glory and majesty surround him,
1CH.16.27	power and joy fill his Temple.
1CH.16.28	Praise the 
1CH.16.28	praise his glory and might.
1CH.16.29	Praise the 
1CH.16.29	bring an offering and come into his Temple.
1CH.16.29	Bow down before the Holy One when he appears;
1CH.16.30	tremble before him, all the earth!
1CH.16.30	The earth is set firmly in place and cannot be moved.
1CH.16.31	Be glad, earth and sky!
1CH.16.31	Tell the nations that the 
1CH.16.32	Roar, sea, and every creature in you;
1CH.16.32	be glad, fields, and everything in you!
1CH.16.33	The trees in the woods will shout for joy
1CH.16.33	when the 
1CH.16.34	his love is eternal.
1CH.16.35	Say to him, “Save us, O God our Savior;
1CH.16.35	gather us together; rescue us from the nations,
1CH.16.35	so that we may be thankful
1CH.16.35	and praise your holy name.”
1CH.16.36	Praise the 
1CH.16.36	Praise him now and forever!
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the 
1CH.16.37	King David put Asaph and the other Levites in permanent charge of the worship that was held at the place where the Covenant Box was kept. They were to perform their duties there day by day. 
1CH.16.38	Obed Edom son of Jeduthun and sixty-eight men of his clan were to assist them. Hosah and Obed Edom were in charge of guarding the gates.
1CH.16.39	Zadok the priest and his fellow priests, however, were in charge of the worship of the 
1CH.16.40	Every morning and evening they were to burn sacrifices whole on the altar in accordance with what was written in the Law which the 
1CH.16.41	There with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the others who were specifically chosen to sing praises to the 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun also had charge of the trumpets and cymbals and the other instruments which were played when the songs of praise were sung. The members of Jeduthun's clan were in charge of guarding the gates.
1CH.17.1	King David was now living in his palace. One day he sent for the prophet Nathan and said to him, “Here I am living in a house built of cedar, but the 
1CH.17.2	Nathan answered, “Do whatever you have in mind, because God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that night God said to Nathan, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell my servant David that I say to him, ‘You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in. 
1CH.17.5	From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now I have never lived in a temple; I have always lived in tents and moved from place to place. 
1CH.17.6	In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.’
1CH.17.7	“So tell my servant David that I, the 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have defeated all your enemies as you advanced. I will make you as famous as the greatest leaders in the world. 
1CH.17.9+1CH.17.10	I have chosen a place for my people Israel and have settled them there, where they will live without being oppressed any more. Ever since they entered this land they have been attacked by violent people, but this will not happen again. I promise to defeat all your enemies and to give you descendants. 
1CH.17.11	When you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will make one of your sons king and will keep his kingdom strong. 
1CH.17.12	He will be the one to build a temple for me, and I will make sure that his dynasty continues forever. 
1CH.17.13	 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not withdraw my support from him as I did from Saul, whom I removed so that you could be king. 
1CH.17.14	I will put him in charge of my people and my kingdom forever. His dynasty will never end.’”
1CH.17.15	Nathan told David everything that God had revealed to him.
1CH.17.16	Then King David went into the Tent of the 
1CH.17.17	Yet now you are doing even more; you have made promises about my descendants in the years to come, and you, 
1CH.17.18	What more can I say to you! You know me well, and yet you honor me, your servant. 
1CH.17.19	It was your will and purpose to do this for me and to show me my future greatness. 
1CH.17.20	, there is none like you; we have always known that you alone are God. 
1CH.17.21	There is no other nation on earth like Israel, whom you rescued from slavery to make them your own people. The great and wonderful things you did for them spread your fame throughout the world. You rescued your people from Egypt and drove out other nations as your people advanced. 
1CH.17.22	You have made Israel your own people forever, and you, 
1CH.17.23	“And now, O 
1CH.17.24	Your fame will be great, and people will forever say, ‘The 
1CH.17.25	I have the courage to pray this prayer to you, my God, because you have revealed all this to me, your servant, and have told me that you will make my descendants kings. 
1CH.17.26	You, 
1CH.17.27	I ask you to bless my descendants so that they will continue to enjoy your favor. You, 
1CH.18.1	Some time later King David attacked the Philistines again and defeated them. He took out of their control the city of Gath and its surrounding villages. 
1CH.18.2	He also defeated the Moabites, who became his subjects and paid taxes to him.
1CH.18.3	Next, David attacked King Hadadezer of the Syrian state of Zobah, near the territory of Hamath, because Hadadezer was trying to gain control of the territory by the upper Euphrates River. 
1CH.18.4	David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand cavalry troops, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled all the rest.
1CH.18.5	When the Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer, David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men. 
1CH.18.6	Then he set up military camps in their territory, and they became his subjects and paid taxes to him. The 
1CH.18.7	David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	 He also took a great quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Kun, cities ruled by Hadadezer. (Solomon later used this bronze to make the tank, the columns, and the bronze utensils for the Temple.)
1CH.18.9	King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezer's entire army. 
1CH.18.10	So he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for his victory over Hadadezer, against whom Toi had fought many times. Joram brought David presents made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
1CH.18.11	King David dedicated them for use in worship, along with the silver and gold he took from the nations he conquered—Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek.
1CH.18.13	He set up military camps throughout Edom, and the people there became King David's subjects. The 
1CH.18.14	David ruled over all Israel and made sure that his people were always treated fairly and justly. 
1CH.18.15	Abishai's brother Joab was commander of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; and King David's sons held high positions in his service.
1CH.19.1	Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
1CH.19.2	King David said, “I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy.
1CH.19.2	When they arrived in Ammon and called on King Hanun, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite leaders said to the king, “Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the land, so that he can conquer it!”
1CH.19.4	Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again.
1CH.19.6	King Hanun and the Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they paid nearly forty tons of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Upper Mesopotamia and from the Syrian states of Maacah and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	The thirty-two thousand chariots they hired and the army of the king of Maacah came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites too came out from all their cities and got ready to fight.
1CH.19.8	When David heard what was happening, he sent out Joab and the whole army. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, and the kings who had come to help took up their position in the open countryside.
1CH.19.10	Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians. 
1CH.19.11	He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	Joab said to him, “If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the 
1CH.19.14	Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab went back to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, so they brought troops from the Syrian states on the east side of the Euphrates River and placed them under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
1CH.19.17	When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and put them in position facing the Syrians. The fighting began, 
1CH.19.18	and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven thousand Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand foot soldiers. They also killed the Syrian commander, Shobach. 
1CH.19.19	When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Syrians were never again willing to help the Ammonites.
1CH.20.2	The Ammonite idol Molech
1CH.20.3	He took the people of the city and put them to work with saws, iron hoes, and axes. He did the same to the people of all the other towns of Ammon. Then he and his men returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	Later on, war broke out again with the Philistines at Gezer. This was when Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Sippai, and the Philistines were defeated.
1CH.20.6	Another battle took place at Gath, where there was a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was a descendant of the ancient giants. 
1CH.20.7	He defied the Israelites, and Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shammah, killed him.
1CH.20.8	These three, who were killed by David and his men, were descendants of the giants at Gath.
1CH.21.1	Satan wanted to bring trouble on the people of Israel, so he made David decide to take a census. 
1CH.21.2	David gave orders to Joab and the other officers, “Go through Israel, from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are.”
1CH.21.3	Joab answered, “May the 
1CH.21.4	But the king made Joab obey the order. Joab went out, traveled through the whole country of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	He reported to King David the total number of men capable of military service: 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah. 
1CH.21.6	Because Joab disapproved of the king's command, he did not take any census of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin.
1CH.21.7	God was displeased with what had been done, so he punished Israel. 
1CH.21.8	David said to God, “I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly.”
1CH.21.9	Then the 
1CH.21.10	“Go and tell David that I am giving him three choices. I will do whichever he chooses.”
1CH.21.11	Gad went to David, told him what the 
1CH.21.12	Three years of famine? Or three months of running away from the armies of your enemies? Or three days during which the 
1CH.21.13	David replied to Gad, “I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people. Let the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	Then he sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but he changed his mind and said to the angel, “Stop! That's enough!” The angel was standing by the threshing place of Araunah, a Jebusite.
1CH.21.16	David saw the angel standing in midair, holding his sword in his hand, ready to destroy Jerusalem. Then David and the leaders of the people—all of whom were wearing sackcloth—bowed low, with their faces touching the ground. 
1CH.21.17	David prayed, “O God, I am the one who did wrong. I am the one who ordered the census. What have these poor people done? 
1CH.21.18	The angel of the 
1CH.21.19	David obeyed the 
1CH.21.20	There at the threshing place Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat, and when they saw the angel, the sons ran and hid. 
1CH.21.21	As soon as Araunah saw King David approaching, he left the threshing place and bowed low, with his face touching the ground. 
1CH.21.22	David said to him, “Sell me your threshing place, so that I can build an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	“Take it, Your Majesty,” Araunah said, “and do whatever you wish. Here are these oxen to burn as an offering on the altar, and here are the threshing boards to use as fuel, and wheat to give as an offering. I give it all to you.”
1CH.21.24	But the king answered, “No, I will pay you the full price. I will not give as an offering to the 
1CH.21.25	And he paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for the threshing place. 
1CH.21.26	He built an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	The 
1CH.21.28	David saw by this that the 
1CH.21.29	The Tent of the 
1CH.21.30	but David was not able to go there to worship God, because he was afraid of the sword of the 
1CH.22.1	So David said, “This is where the Temple of the 
1CH.22.2	King David gave orders for all the foreigners living in the land of Israel to assemble, and he put them to work. Some of them prepared stone blocks for building the Temple. 
1CH.22.3	He supplied a large amount of iron for making nails and clamps for the wooden gates, and so much bronze that no one could weigh it. 
1CH.22.4	He had the people of Tyre and Sidon bring him a large number of cedar logs. 
1CH.22.5	David thought, “The Temple that my son Solomon is to build must be splendid and world-famous. But he is young and inexperienced, so I must make preparations for it.” So David got large amounts of the materials ready before he died.
1CH.22.6	He sent for his son Solomon and commanded him to build a temple for the 
1CH.22.7	 David said to him, “Son, I wanted to build a temple to honor the 
1CH.22.8	But the 
1CH.22.9	He did, however, make me a promise. He said, ‘You will have a son who will rule in peace, because I will give him peace from all his enemies. His name will be Solomon,
1CH.22.10	He will build a temple for me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. His dynasty will rule Israel forever.’”
1CH.22.11	David continued, “Now, son, may the 
1CH.22.12	And may the 
1CH.22.13	 If you obey all the laws which the 
1CH.22.14	As for the Temple, by my efforts I have accumulated almost four thousand tons of gold and nearly forty thousand tons of silver to be used in building it. Besides that, there is an unlimited supply of bronze and iron. I also have wood and stone ready, but you must get more. 
1CH.22.15	You have many workers. There are stonecutters to work in the quarries, and there are masons and carpenters, as well as a large number of skilled workers of every sort who can work 
1CH.22.16	with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and may the 
1CH.22.17	David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon. 
1CH.22.18	He said, “The 
1CH.22.19	Now serve the 
1CH.23.2	King David brought together all the Israelite leaders and all the priests and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	He took a census of all the male Levites aged thirty or older. The total was thirty-eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	The king assigned twenty-four thousand to administer the work of the Temple, six thousand to keep records and decide disputes, 
1CH.23.5	four thousand to do guard duty, and four thousand to praise the 
1CH.23.6	David divided the Levites into three groups, according to their clans: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	Ladan had three sons: Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel, 
1CH.23.9	who were the heads of the clans descended from Ladan. (Shimei had three sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.)
1CH.23.10+1CH.23.11	Shimei had four sons: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah, in order of age. Jeush and Beriah did not have many descendants, so they were counted as one clan.
1CH.23.12	Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
1CH.23.13	 His oldest son, Amram, was the father of Aaron and Moses. (Aaron and his descendants were set apart to be in charge of the sacred objects forever, to burn incense in the worship of the 
1CH.23.14	But the sons of Moses, the man of God, were included among the Levites.) 
1CH.23.15	Moses had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The leader among Gershom's sons was Shebuel. 
1CH.23.17	Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, but Rehabiah had many descendants.
1CH.23.18	Kohath's second son, Izhar, had a son, Shelomith, the head of the clan. 
1CH.23.19	Kohath's third son, Hebron, had four sons: Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam. 
1CH.23.20	Kohath's fourth son, Uzziel, had two sons, Micah and Isshiah.
1CH.23.21	Merari had two sons, Mahli and Mushi. Mahli also had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, 
1CH.23.22	but Eleazar died without having any sons, only daughters. His daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish. 
1CH.23.23	Merari's second son, Mushi, had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
1CH.23.24	These were the descendants of Levi, by clans and families, every one of them registered by name. Each of his descendants, twenty years of age or older, had a share in the work of the 
1CH.23.25	David said, “The 
1CH.23.26	 So there is no longer any need for the Levites to carry the Tent of the 
1CH.23.27	On the basis of David's final instructions all Levites were registered for service when they reached the age of twenty, 
1CH.23.28	 and were assigned the following duties: to help the priests descended from Aaron with the Temple worship, to take care of its courtyards and its rooms, and to keep undefiled everything that is sacred; 
1CH.23.29	to be responsible for the bread offered to God, the flour used in offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the baked offerings, and the flour mixed with olive oil; to weigh and measure the Temple offerings; 
1CH.23.30	and to praise and glorify the 
1CH.23.31	and whenever offerings to the 
1CH.23.32	They were given the responsibility of taking care of the Tent of the 
1CH.24.1	These are the groups to which the descendants of Aaron belong. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	 Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and left no descendants, so their brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became priests. 
1CH.24.3	King David organized the descendants of Aaron into groups according to their duties. He was assisted in this by Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and by Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.4	The descendants of Eleazar were organized into sixteen groups, while the descendants of Ithamar were organized into eight; this was done because there were more male heads of families among the descendants of Eleazar. 
1CH.24.5	Since there were Temple officials and spiritual leaders among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, assignments were made by drawing lots. 
1CH.24.6	The descendants of Eleazar and of Ithamar took turns drawing lots. Then they were registered by Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite secretary. The king, his officials, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the priestly families and of the Levite families, were all witnesses.
1CH.24.7+1CH.24.8+1CH.24.9+1CH.24.10+1CH.24.11+1CH.24.12+1CH.24.13+1CH.24.14+1CH.24.15+1CH.24.16+1CH.24.17+1CH.24.18	This is the order in which the twenty-four family groups were given their assignments: 1) Jehoiarib; 2) Jedaiah; 3) Harim; 4) Seorim; 5) Malchijah; 6) Mijamin; 7) Hakkoz; 8) Abijah; 9) Jeshua; 10) Shecaniah; 11) Eliashib; 12) Jakim; 13) Huppah; 14) Jeshebeab; 15) Bilgah; 16) Immer; 17) Hezir; 18) Happizzez; 19) Pethahiah; 20) Jehezkel; 21) Jachin; 22) Gamul; 23) Delaiah; 24) Maaziah.
1CH.24.19	These men were registered according to their assignments for going to the Temple and performing the duties established by their ancestor Aaron in obedience to the commands of the 
1CH.24.20	These are other heads of families descended from Levi:
1CH.24.20	Jehdeiah, a descendant of Amram through Shebuel;
1CH.24.21	Isshiah, a descendant of Rehabiah;
1CH.24.22	Jahath, a descendant of Izhar through Shelomith;
1CH.24.23	Jeriah, Amariah, Jehaziel, and Jekameam, sons of Hebron, in order of age;
1CH.24.24	Shamir, a descendant of Uzziel through Micah;
1CH.24.25	Zechariah, a descendant of Uzziel through Isshiah, Micah's brother;
1CH.24.26	Mahli, Mushi, and Jaaziah, descendants of Merari. 
1CH.24.27	Jaaziah had three sons: Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 
1CH.24.28+1CH.24.29	Mahli had two sons, Eleazar and Kish. Eleazar had no sons, but Kish had one son, Jerahmeel. 
1CH.24.30	Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
1CH.24.30	These are the families of the Levites.
1CH.24.31	The head of each family and one of his younger brothers drew lots for their assignments, just as their relatives, the priests descended from Aaron, had done. King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites were witnesses.
1CH.25.1	King David and the leaders of the Levites chose the following Levite clans to lead the worship services: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. They were to proclaim God's messages, accompanied by the music of harps and cymbals. This is the list of persons chosen to lead the worship, with the type of service that each group performed:
1CH.25.2	The four sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. They were under the direction of Asaph, who proclaimed God's messages whenever the king commanded.
1CH.25.3	The six sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Under the direction of their father they proclaimed God's message, accompanied by the music of harps, and sang praise and thanks to the 
1CH.25.4	The fourteen sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 
1CH.25.5	God gave to Heman, the king's prophet, these fourteen sons and also three daughters, as he had promised, in order to give power to Heman. 
1CH.25.6	All of his sons played cymbals and harps under their father's direction, to accompany the Temple worship. And Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under orders from the king.
1CH.25.7	All these twenty-four men were experts; and their fellow Levites were trained musicians. There were 288 men in all.
1CH.25.8	To determine the assignment of duties they all drew lots, whether they were young or old, experts or beginners.
1CH.25.9+1CH.25.10+1CH.25.11+1CH.25.12+1CH.25.13+1CH.25.14+1CH.25.15+1CH.25.16+1CH.25.17+1CH.25.18+1CH.25.19+1CH.25.20+1CH.25.21+1CH.25.22+1CH.25.23+1CH.25.24+1CH.25.25+1CH.25.26+1CH.25.27+1CH.25.28+1CH.25.29+1CH.25.30+1CH.25.31	These 288 men were divided according to families into twenty-four groups of twelve, with a leader in charge of each group. This is the order in which they were on duty: 1) Joseph of the family of Asaph; 2) Gedaliah; 3) Zaccur; 4) Zeri; 5) Nethaniah; 6) Bukkiah; 7) Asharelah; 8) Jeshaiah; 9) Mattaniah; 10) Shimei; 11) Uzziel; 12) Hashabiah; 13) Shebuel; 14) Mattithiah; 15) Jerimoth; 16) Hananiah; 17) Joshbekashah; 18) Hanani; 19) Mallothi; 20) Eliathah; 21) Hothir; 22) Giddalti; 23) Mahazioth; 24) Romamti Ezer.
1CH.26.1	These are the assignments of work for the Levites who served as Temple guards. From the clan of Korah there was Meshelemiah son of Kore, of the family of Asaph. 
1CH.26.2	He had seven sons, listed in order of age: Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel, 
1CH.26.3	Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai.
1CH.26.5	Ammiel, Issachar, and Peullethai.
1CH.26.6+1CH.26.7	Obed Edom's oldest son, Shemaiah, had six sons: Othni, Rephael, Obed, Elzabad, Elihu, and Semachiah. They were important men in their clan because of their great ability; the last two were especially talented.
1CH.26.8	Obed Edom's family furnished a total of sixty-two highly qualified men for this work.
1CH.26.9	Meshelemiah's family furnished eighteen qualified men.
1CH.26.10	From the clan of Merari there was Hosah, who had four sons: Shimri (his father made him the leader, even though he was not the oldest son), 
1CH.26.11	Hilkiah, Tebaliah, and Zechariah. In all there were thirteen members of Hosah's family who were Temple guards.
1CH.26.12	The Temple guards were divided into groups, according to families, and they were assigned duties in the Temple, just as the other Levites were. 
1CH.26.13	Each family, regardless of size, drew lots to see which gate it would be responsible for. 
1CH.26.14	Shelemiah drew the east gate, and his son Zechariah, a man who always gave good advice, drew the north gate. 
1CH.26.15	Obed Edom was allotted the south gate, and his sons were allotted to guard the storerooms. 
1CH.26.16	Shuppim and Hosah were allotted the west gate and the Shallecheth Gate on the upper road. Guard duty was divided into assigned periods, one after another. 
1CH.26.17	On the east, six guards were on duty each day, on the north, four, and on the south, four. Four guards were stationed at the storerooms daily, two at each storeroom. 
1CH.26.18	Near the western pavilion there were four guards by the road and two at the pavilion itself. 
1CH.26.19	This is the assignment of guard duty to the clan of Korah and the clan of Merari.
1CH.26.20	Others of their fellow Levites
1CH.26.21	Ladan, one of the sons of Gershon, was the ancestor of several family groups, including the family of his son Jehiel. 
1CH.26.22	Ladan's two other sons, Zetham and Joel, had charge of the Temple treasury and storerooms.
1CH.26.23	Duties were also assigned to the descendants of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
1CH.26.24	Shebuel, of the clan of Moses' son Gershom, was the chief official responsible for the Temple treasury. 
1CH.26.25	Through Gershom's brother Eliezer he was related to Shelomith. Eliezer was the father of Rehabiah, who was the father of Jeshaiah, the father of Joram, the father of Zichri, the father of Shelomith. 
1CH.26.26	Shelomith and the members of his family were in charge of all the gifts dedicated to God by King David, the heads of families, leaders of clan groups, and army officers. 
1CH.26.27	They took some of the loot they captured in battle and dedicated it for use in the Temple. 
1CH.26.28	Shelomith and his family were in charge of everything that had been dedicated for use in the Temple, including the gifts brought by the prophet Samuel, by King Saul, by Abner son of Ner, and by Joab son of Zeruiah.
1CH.26.29	Among the descendants of Izhar, Chenaniah and his sons were assigned administrative duties: keeping records and settling disputes for the people of Israel.
1CH.26.30	Among the descendants of Hebron, Hashabiah and seventeen hundred of his relatives, all outstanding men, were put in charge of the administration of all religious and civil matters in Israel west of the Jordan River. 
1CH.26.31	Jeriah was the leader of the descendants of Hebron. In the fortieth year that David was king, an investigation was made of the family line of Hebron's descendants, and outstanding soldiers belonging to this family were found living at Jazer in the territory of Gilead. 
1CH.26.32	King David chose twenty-seven hundred outstanding heads of families from Jeriah's relatives and put them in charge of administering all religious and civil matters in Israel east of the Jordan River—the territories of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh.
1CH.27.1	This is the list of the Israelite heads of families and clan leaders and their officials who administered the work of the kingdom. Each month of the year a different group of twenty-four thousand men was on duty under the commander for that month.

1CH.27.33	Ahithophel was adviser to the king, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend and counselor. 
1CH.27.34	After Ahithophel died, Abiathar and Jehoiada son of Benaiah became advisers. Joab was commander of the royal army.
1CH.28.1	King David commanded all the officials of Israel to assemble in Jerusalem. So all the officials of the tribes, the officials who administered the work of the kingdom, the leaders of the clans, the supervisors of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and his sons—indeed all the palace officials, leading soldiers, and important men—gathered in Jerusalem.
1CH.28.3	but he has forbidden me to do it, because I am a soldier and have shed too much blood. 
1CH.28.4	The 
1CH.28.5	He gave me many sons, and out of them all he chose Solomon to rule over Israel, the 
1CH.28.6	“The 
1CH.28.7	I will make his kingdom last forever if he continues to obey carefully all my laws and commands as he does now.’
1CH.28.8	“So now, my people, in the presence of our God and of this assembly of all Israel, the 
1CH.28.9	And to Solomon he said, “My son, I charge you to acknowledge your father's God and to serve him with an undivided heart and a willing mind. He knows all our thoughts and desires. If you go to him, he will accept you; but if you turn away from him, he will abandon you forever. 
1CH.28.10	You must realize that the 
1CH.28.11	David gave Solomon the plans for all the Temple buildings, for the storerooms and all the other rooms, and for the Most Holy Place, where sins are forgiven. 
1CH.28.12	He also gave him the plans for all he had in mind for the courtyards and the rooms around them, and for the storerooms for the Temple equipment and the gifts dedicated to the 
1CH.28.13	David also gave him the plans for organizing the priests and Levites to perform their duties, to do the work of the Temple, and to take care of all the Temple utensils. 
1CH.28.14	He gave instructions as to how much silver and gold was to be used for making the utensils, 
1CH.28.15	for each lamp and lampstand, 
1CH.28.16	for the silver tables, and for each gold table on which were placed the loaves of bread offered to God. 
1CH.28.17	He also gave instructions as to how much pure gold was to be used in making forks, bowls, and jars, how much silver and gold in making dishes, 
1CH.28.18	and how much pure gold in making the altar on which incense was burned and in making the chariot for the winged creatures that spread their wings over the 
1CH.28.19	King David said, “All this is contained in the plan written according to the instructions which the 
1CH.28.20	King David said to his son Solomon, “Be confident and determined. Start the work and don't let anything stop you. The 
1CH.28.21	The priests and the Levites have been assigned duties to perform in the Temple. Workers with every kind of skill are eager to help you, and all the people and their leaders are at your command.”
1CH.29.2	I have made every effort to prepare materials for the Temple—gold, silver, bronze, iron, timber, precious stones and gems, stones for mosaics, and quantities of marble. 
1CH.29.3	Over and above all this that I have provided, I have given silver and gold from my personal property because of my love for God's Temple. 
1CH.29.4	I have given 115 tons of the finest gold and 265 tons of pure silver for decorating the walls of the Temple 
1CH.29.5	and for all the objects which the skilled workers are to make. Now who else is willing to give a generous offering to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the heads of the clans, the officials of the tribes, the commanders of the army, and the administrators of the royal property volunteered to give 
1CH.29.7	the following for the work on the Temple: 190 tons of gold, 380 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 3,750 tons of iron. 
1CH.29.8	Those who had precious stones gave them to the Temple treasury, which was administered by Jehiel of the Levite clan of Gershon. 
1CH.29.9	The people had given willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	There in front of the whole assembly King David praised the 
1CH.29.11	 You are great and powerful, glorious, splendid, and majestic. Everything in heaven and earth is yours, and you are king, supreme ruler over all. 
1CH.29.12	All riches and wealth come from you; you rule everything by your strength and power; and you are able to make anyone great and strong. 
1CH.29.13	Now, our God, we give you thanks, and we praise your glorious name.
1CH.29.14	“Yet my people and I cannot really give you anything, because everything is a gift from you, and we have only given back what is yours already. 
1CH.29.15	You know, O 
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know that you test everyone's heart and are pleased with people of integrity. In honesty and sincerity I have willingly given all this to you, and I have seen how your people who are gathered here have been happy to bring offerings to you. 
1CH.29.18	 God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, keep such devotion forever strong in your people's hearts and keep them always faithful to you. 
1CH.29.19	Give my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to obey everything that you command and to build the Temple for which I have made these preparations.”
1CH.29.20	Then David commanded the people, “Praise the 
1CH.29.21	The following day they killed animals as sacrifices, dedicating them to the 
1CH.29.22	So that day they were very happy as they ate and drank in the presence of the 
1CH.29.22	For a second time they proclaimed Solomon king. In the name of the 
1CH.29.23	 So Solomon succeeded his father David on the throne which the 
1CH.29.24	All the officials and soldiers, and even all of David's other sons, promised to be loyal to Solomon as king. 
1CH.29.25	The 
1CH.29.26	David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel 
1CH.29.27	 for forty years. He ruled in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three. 
1CH.29.28	He died at a ripe old age, wealthy and respected, and his son Solomon succeeded him as king. 
1CH.29.29	The history of King David from beginning to end is recorded in the records of the three prophets, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. 
1CH.29.30	The records tell how he ruled, how powerful he was, and all the things that happened to him, to Israel, and to the surrounding kingdoms.
2CH.1.1	Solomon, the son of King David, took firm control of the kingdom of Israel, and the 
2CH.1.2	King Solomon gave an order to all the officers in charge of units of a thousand men and of a hundred men, all the government officials, all the heads of families, and all the rest of the people, 
2CH.1.3	commanding them to go with him to the place of worship at Gibeon. They went there because that was where the Tent of the 
2CH.1.4	 The Covenant Box, however, was in Jerusalem, kept in a tent which King David had set up when he brought the Box from Kiriath Jearim.) 
2CH.1.5	 The bronze altar which had been made by Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, was also in Gibeon in front of the Tent of the 
2CH.1.6	In front of the Tent the king worshiped the 
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and asked, “What would you like me to give you?”
2CH.1.8	Solomon answered, “You always showed great love for my father David, and now you have let me succeed him as king. 
2CH.1.9	 O 
2CH.1.10	so give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?”
2CH.1.11	God replied to Solomon, “You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth or treasure or fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king. 
2CH.1.12	I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again.”
2CH.1.13	So Solomon left
2CH.1.14	 He built up a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem, and the rest he stationed in various other cities. 
2CH.1.15	During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
2CH.1.16	 The king's agents controlled the export of horses from Musri
2CH.1.17	and the export of chariots from Egypt. They supplied the Hittite and Syrian kings with horses and chariots, selling chariots for 600 pieces of silver each and horses for 150 each.
2CH.2.1	King Solomon decided to build a temple where the 
2CH.2.2	He put 70,000 men to work transporting materials, and 80,000 to work cutting stone in the hill country. There were 3,600 others responsible for supervising the work.
2CH.2.3	Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre: “Do business with me as you did with my father, King David, when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace. 
2CH.2.4	I am building a temple to honor the 
2CH.2.5	I intend to build a great temple, because our God is greater than any other god. 
2CH.2.6	 Yet no one can really build a temple for God, because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him. How then can I build a temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God? 
2CH.2.7	Now send me a man with skill in engraving, in working gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in making blue, purple, and red cloth. He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected. 
2CH.2.8	I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours 
2CH.2.9	in preparing large quantities of timber, because this temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent. 
2CH.2.10	As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you 100,000 bushels of wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil.”
2CH.2.11	King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply. He wrote, “Because the 
2CH.2.12	Praise the 
2CH.2.13	I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram. 
2CH.2.14	His mother was a member of the tribe of Dan and his father was a native of Tyre. He knows how to make things out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood. He can work with blue, purple, and red cloth, and with linen. He can do all sorts of engraving and can follow any design suggested to him. Let him work with your skilled workers and with those who worked for your father, King David. 
2CH.2.15	So now send us the wheat, barley, wine, and olive oil that you promised. 
2CH.2.16	In the mountains of Lebanon we will cut down all the cedars you need, tie them together in rafts, and float them by sea as far as Joppa. From there you can take them to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	King Solomon took a census of all the foreigners living in the land of Israel, similar to the census his father David had taken. There were 153,600 resident foreigners. 
2CH.2.18	He assigned 70,000 of them to transport materials and 80,000 to cut stones in the mountains, and appointed 3,600 supervisors to make sure the work was done.
2CH.3.2	in the second month of the fourth year that he was king. 
2CH.3.3	The Temple which King Solomon built was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. 
2CH.3.4	The entrance room was the full width of the Temple, 30 feet, and was 180 feet high. The inside of the room was overlaid with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	The main room was paneled with cedar and overlaid with fine gold, in which were worked designs of palm trees and chain patterns. 
2CH.3.6	The king decorated the Temple with beautiful precious stones and with gold imported from the land of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He used the gold to overlay the Temple walls, the rafters, the entryways, and the doors. On the walls the workers carved designs of winged creatures.
2CH.3.8	 The inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was 30 feet long and 30 feet wide, which was the full width of the Temple. Twenty-five tons of gold were used to cover the walls of the Most Holy Place; 
2CH.3.9	twenty ounces of gold were used for making nails, and the walls of the upper rooms were also covered with gold.
2CH.3.11+2CH.3.12+2CH.3.13	where they stood side by side facing the entrance. Each had two wings, each wing 7½ feet long, which were spread out so that they touched each other in the center of the room and reached to the wall on either side of the room, stretching across the full width of 30 feet. 
2CH.3.14	 A curtain for the Most Holy Place was made of linen and of other material, which was dyed blue, purple, and red, with designs of the winged creatures worked into it.
2CH.3.15	The king had two columns made, each one 52 feet tall, and placed them in front of the Temple. Each one had a capital 7½ feet tall. 
2CH.3.16	The tops of the columns were decorated with a design of interwoven chains and one hundred bronze pomegranates.
2CH.3.17	The columns were set at the sides of the Temple entrance: the one on the south side was named Jachin
2CH.4.2	He also made a round tank of bronze, 7½ feet deep, 15 feet in diameter, and 45 feet in circumference. 
2CH.4.3	All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank
2CH.4.4	The tank rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward, three facing in each direction. 
2CH.4.5	The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about 15,000 gallons. 
2CH.4.6	 They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing.
2CH.4.9	They made an inner courtyard for the priests, and also an outer courtyard. The doors in the gates between the courtyards were covered with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	The tank was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	Huram also made pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed all the objects that he had promised King Solomon he would make for the Temple:
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The two columns
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the columns
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The design of interwoven chains on each capital
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The 400 bronze pomegranates arranged in two rows around the design of each capital
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The ten
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The ten basins
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The tank
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The twelve bulls supporting the tank
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	The pots, shovels, and forks
2CH.4.11+2CH.4.12+2CH.4.13+2CH.4.14+2CH.4.15+2CH.4.16	Huram the master metalworker made all these objects
2CH.4.17	The king had them all made in the foundry between Sukkoth and Zeredah
2CH.4.18	So many objects were made that no one determined the total weight of the bronze used.
2CH.4.19	King Solomon also had gold furnishings made for the Temple: the altar and the tables for the bread offered to God; 
2CH.4.20	the lampstands and the lamps of fine gold that were to burn in front of the Most Holy Place, according to plan; 
2CH.4.21	the flower decorations, the lamps, and the tongs; 
2CH.4.22	the lamp snuffers, the bowls, the dishes for incense, and the pans used for carrying live coals. All these objects were made of pure gold. The outer doors of the Temple and the doors to the Most Holy Place were overlaid with gold.
2CH.5.3	They all assembled at the time of the Festival of Shelters. 
2CH.5.4	When all the leaders had gathered, then the Levites lifted the Covenant Box 
2CH.5.5	and carried it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites also moved the Tent of the 
2CH.5.6	King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle—too many to count. 
2CH.5.7	Then the priests carried the Covenant Box of the 
2CH.5.8	Their outstretched wings covered the Box and the poles it was carried by. 
2CH.5.9	The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.) 
2CH.5.10	 There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the 
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13+2CH.5.14	“Praise the 
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13+2CH.5.14	And his love is eternal.”
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13+2CH.5.14	As the priests were leaving the Temple, it was suddenly filled with a cloud shining with the dazzling light of the 
2CH.6.1	Then King Solomon prayed,
2CH.6.1	“
2CH.6.2	Now I have built a majestic temple for you,
2CH.6.2	a place for you to live in forever.”
2CH.6.3	All the people of Israel were standing there. The king turned to face them and asked God's blessing on them. 
2CH.6.4	 He said, “Praise the 
2CH.6.5	‘From the time I brought my people out of Egypt until now, I did not choose any city in the land of Israel as the place to build a temple where I would be worshiped, and I did not choose anyone to lead my people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place where I will be worshiped, and you, David, to rule my people.’”
2CH.6.7	And Solomon continued, “My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of the 
2CH.6.8	but the 
2CH.6.9	but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.’
2CH.6.10	“Now the 
2CH.6.11	I have placed in the Temple the Covenant Box, which contains the stone tablets of the covenant which the 
2CH.6.12	Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar and raised his arms in prayer. ( 
2CH.6.13	Solomon had made a bronze platform and put it in the middle of the courtyard. It was eight feet square and five feet high. He mounted this platform, knelt down where everyone could see him, and raised his hands toward heaven.) 
2CH.6.14	He prayed, “
2CH.6.15	You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled. 
2CH.6.16	 Now, 
2CH.6.17	So now, 
2CH.6.19	 my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer and grant the requests I make to you. 
2CH.6.20	 Watch over this Temple day and night. You have promised that this is where you will be worshiped, so hear me when I face this Temple and pray. 
2CH.6.21	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us.
2CH.6.22	“When people are accused of wronging others and are brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that they are innocent, 
2CH.6.23	O 
2CH.6.24	“When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness, 
2CH.6.25	listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to them and to their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	“When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you, 
2CH.6.27	O 
2CH.6.28	“When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them, 
2CH.6.29	listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
2CH.6.30	hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each of us as we deserve, 
2CH.6.31	so that your people may honor you and obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	“When foreigners who live in a distant land hear how great and powerful you are and how you are always ready to act, and then they come to pray at this Temple, 
2CH.6.33	listen to their prayers. In heaven, where you live, hear them and do what they ask you to do, so that all the peoples of the world may know you and obey you, as your people Israel do. Then they will know that this Temple I have built is where you are to be worshiped.
2CH.6.34	“When you command your people to go into battle against their enemies and they pray to you, wherever they are, facing this city which you have chosen and this Temple which I have built for you, 
2CH.6.35	listen to their prayers. Hear them in heaven and give them victory.
2CH.6.36	“When your people sin against you—and there is no one who does not sin—and in your anger you let their enemies defeat them and take them as prisoners to some other land, even if that land is far away, 
2CH.6.37	listen to your people's prayers. If there in that land they repent and pray to you, confessing how sinful and wicked they have been, hear their prayers, O 
2CH.6.38	If in that land they truly and sincerely repent and pray to you as they face toward this land which you gave to our ancestors, this city which you have chosen, and this Temple which I have built for you, 
2CH.6.39	then listen to their prayers. In your home in heaven hear them and be merciful to them and forgive all the sins of your people.
2CH.6.40	“Now, O my God, look on us and listen to the prayers offered in this place. 
2CH.6.41	 Rise up now, 
2CH.6.42	 God, do not reject the king you have chosen. Remember the love you had for your servant David.”
2CH.7.2	Because the Temple was full of the dazzling light, the priests could not enter it. 
2CH.7.3	 When the people of Israel saw the fire fall from heaven and the light fill the Temple, they fell face downward on the pavement, worshiping God and praising him for his goodness and his eternal love. 
2CH.7.4	Then Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the 
2CH.7.5	He sacrificed 22,000 head of cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings. And so he and all the people dedicated the Temple. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood in the places that were assigned to them, and facing them stood the Levites, praising the 
2CH.7.7	Solomon consecrated the central part of the courtyard, the area in front of the Temple, and then offered there the sacrifices burned whole, the grain offerings, and the fat from the fellowship offerings. He did this because the bronze altar which he had made was too small for all these offerings.
2CH.7.8	Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven days. There was a huge crowd of people from as far away as Hamath Pass in the north and the Egyptian border in the south. 
2CH.7.9	They had spent seven days for the dedication of the altar and then seven more days for the festival. On the last day they had a closing celebration, 
2CH.7.10	and on the following day, the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home. They were happy about all the blessings that the 
2CH.7.11	After King Solomon had finished the Temple and the palace, successfully completing all his plans for them, 
2CH.7.12	the 
2CH.7.13	Whenever I hold back the rain or send locusts to eat up the crops or send an epidemic on my people, 
2CH.7.14	if they pray to me and repent and turn away from the evil they have been doing, then I will hear them in heaven, forgive their sins, and make their land prosperous again. 
2CH.7.15	I will watch over this Temple and be ready to hear all the prayers that are offered here, 
2CH.7.16	because I have chosen it and consecrated it as the place where I will be worshiped forever. I will watch over it and protect it for all time. 
2CH.7.17	If you serve me faithfully as your father David did, obeying my laws and doing everything I have commanded you, 
2CH.7.18	 I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants. 
2CH.7.19	But if you and your people ever disobey the laws and commands I have given you and worship other gods, 
2CH.7.20	then I will remove you from the land that I gave you, and I will abandon this Temple that I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule it and treat it with contempt.
2CH.7.21	“The Temple is now greatly honored, but then everyone who passes by it will be amazed and will ask, ‘Why did the 
2CH.7.22	People will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the 
2CH.8.1	It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace. 
2CH.8.2	He also rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given him, and sent Israelites to settle in them. 
2CH.8.3	He captured the territory of Hamath and Zobah 
2CH.8.4	and fortified the city of Palmyra in the desert. He rebuilt all the cities in Hamath that were centers for storing supplies. 
2CH.8.5	Solomon also rebuilt the following cities: Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon (fortified cities with gates that could be barred), 
2CH.8.6	the city of Baalath, all the cities where he stored supplies, and the cities where his horses and chariots were stationed. He carried out all his plans for building in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout the territory that he ruled over. 
2CH.8.7+2CH.8.8	Solomon employed at forced labor all the descendants of the people of Canaan whom the Israelites had not killed when they took possession of the land. These included Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, whose descendants continue to be slaves down to the present time. 
2CH.8.9	Israelites were not used at forced labor, but served as soldiers, officers, chariot commanders, and cavalry troops. 
2CH.8.10	There were 250 officials in charge of the forced labor working on the various building projects.
2CH.8.11	Solomon moved his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, from David's City to a house he built for her. He said, “She must not live in the palace of King David of Israel, because any place where the Covenant Box has been is holy.”
2CH.8.12	Solomon offered sacrifices to the 
2CH.8.13	 He offered burnt offerings according to the requirements of the Law of Moses for each holy day: Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters. 
2CH.8.14	Following the rules laid down by his father David, he organized the daily work of the priests and of the Levites who assisted the priests in singing hymns and in doing their work. He also organized the Temple guards in sections for performing their daily duties at each gate, in accordance with the commands of David, the man of God. 
2CH.8.15	The instructions which David had given the priests and the Levites concerning the storehouses and other matters were carried out in detail.
2CH.8.16	By this time all of Solomon's projects had been completed. From the laying of the foundation of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and Elath, ports on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	King Hiram sent him ships under the command of his own officers and with experienced sailors. They sailed with Solomon's officers to the land of Ophir and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold.
2CH.9.2	He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain. 
2CH.9.3	The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built. 
2CH.9.4	She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the clothing of the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered
2CH.9.5	She said to the king, “What I heard in my own country about you
2CH.9.6	I did not believe what they told me until I came and saw for myself. I had not heard of even half your wisdom. You are even wiser than people say. 
2CH.9.7	How fortunate are those who serve you, who are always in your presence and are privileged to hear your wise sayings! 
2CH.9.8	Praise the 
2CH.9.9	She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought: almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. There have never been any other spices as fine as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2CH.9.9	( 
2CH.9.10	The sailors of King Hiram and of King Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought juniper wood and jewels. 
2CH.9.11	Solomon used the wood to make stairs for the Temple and for his palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like that had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.)
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for. This was in addition to what he gave her in exchange for the gifts
2CH.9.13	Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold, 
2CH.9.14	in addition to the taxes paid by the traders and merchants. The kings of Arabia and the governors of the Israelite districts also brought him silver and gold. 
2CH.9.15	Solomon made two hundred large shields, each of which was covered with about fifteen pounds of beaten gold, 
2CH.9.16	and three hundred smaller shields, each covered with about eight pounds of beaten gold. He had them all placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	The king also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	Six steps led up to the throne, and there was a footstool attached to it, covered with gold. There were arms on each side of the throne, and the figure of a lion stood at each side. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve figures of lions were on the steps, one at either end of each step. No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom.
2CH.9.20	All of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's day. 
2CH.9.21	He had a fleet of ocean-going ships sailing with King Hiram's fleet. Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.
2CH.9.22	King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king in the world. 
2CH.9.23	They all consulted him, to hear the wisdom that God had given him. 
2CH.9.24	Each of them brought Solomon gifts—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year.
2CH.9.26	 He was supreme ruler of all the kings in the territory from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border. 
2CH.9.27	During his reign silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
2CH.9.28	 Solomon imported horses from Musri
2CH.9.29	The rest of the history of Solomon from beginning to end is recorded in 
2CH.9.30	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
2CH.9.31	He died and was buried in David's City, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned home. 
2CH.10.3	The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam replied, “Give me three days to consider the matter. Then come back.” So the people left.
2CH.10.6	King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. “What answer do you advise me to give these people?” he asked.
2CH.10.7	They replied, “If you are kind to these people and try to please them by giving a considerate answer, they will always serve you loyally.”
2CH.10.8	But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers. 
2CH.10.9	“What do you advise me to do?” he asked. “What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?”
2CH.10.10	They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.’ 
2CH.10.11	Tell them, ‘My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!’”
2CH.10.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them. 
2CH.10.13	The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people, 
2CH.10.14	as the younger men had advised. He said, “My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!” 
2CH.10.15	It was the will of the 
2CH.10.16	So the people of Israel rebelled, 
2CH.10.17	leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah.
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David.
2CH.11.1	When King Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel. 
2CH.11.2	But the 
2CH.11.3	to give this message to King Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin: 
2CH.11.4	“Do not attack your own relatives. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will.” They obeyed the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and had fortifications built for the following cities of Judah and Benjamin: 
2CH.11.6	Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Bethzur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. 
2CH.11.11	He had them strongly fortified and appointed a commander for each of them, and in each one he placed supplies of food, olive oil, and wine, 
2CH.11.12	and also shields and spears. In this way he kept Judah and Benjamin under his control.
2CH.11.13	From all the territory of Israel priests and Levites came south to Judah. 
2CH.11.14	The Levites abandoned their pastures and other land and moved to Judah and Jerusalem, because King Jeroboam of Israel and his successors would not let them serve as priests of the 
2CH.11.15	 Jeroboam appointed priests of his own to serve at the pagan places of worship and to worship demons and the idols he made in the form of bull-calves. 
2CH.11.16	From all the tribes of Israel people who sincerely wanted to worship the 
2CH.11.17	This strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon and lived as they had under the rule of King David and King Solomon.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David and whose mother was Abihail, the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	They had three sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	Later he married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and they had four sons: Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	In all, Rehoboam had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Of all his wives and concubines he loved Maacah best, 
2CH.11.22	and he favored her son Abijah over all his other children, choosing him as the one to succeed him as king. 
2CH.11.23	Rehoboam wisely assigned responsibilities to his sons and stationed them throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified cities. He provided generously for them and also secured many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	As soon as Rehoboam had established his authority as king, he and all his people abandoned the Law of the 
2CH.12.2	In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign their disloyalty to the 
2CH.12.3	with an army of twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand cavalry, and more soldiers than could be counted, including Libyan, Sukkite, and Ethiopian
2CH.12.4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and advanced as far as Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Shemaiah the prophet went to King Rehoboam and the Judean leaders who had gathered in Jerusalem to escape Shishak. He said to them, “This is the 
2CH.12.6	The king and the leaders admitted that they had sinned, and they said, “What the 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	but Shishak will conquer them, and they will learn the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers.”
2CH.12.10	To replace them, Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates. 
2CH.12.11	Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom. 
2CH.12.12	Because he submitted to the 
2CH.12.13	Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem and increased his power as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	He did what was evil, because he did not try to find the 
2CH.12.15	Rehoboam's acts from beginning to end and his family records are found in 
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah, 
2CH.13.2	and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah daughter of Uriel, from the city of Gibeah.
2CH.13.2	War broke out between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah raised an army of 400,000 soldiers, and Jeroboam opposed him with an army of 800,000.
2CH.13.4	The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim. King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites: “Listen to me!” he said. 
2CH.13.5	“Don't you know that the 
2CH.13.6	Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon, his king. 
2CH.13.7	Later he gathered together a group of worthless scoundrels, and they forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon, who was too young and inexperienced to resist them. 
2CH.13.8	Now you propose to fight against the royal authority that the 
2CH.13.9	You drove out the 
2CH.13.10	“But we still serve the 
2CH.13.11	Every morning and every evening they offer him incense and animal sacrifices burned whole. They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean, and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lampstand. We do what the 
2CH.13.12	God himself is our leader and his priests are here with trumpets, ready to blow them and call us to battle against you. People of Israel, don't fight against the 
2CH.13.13	Meanwhile Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to ambush the Judean army from the rear, while the rest faced them from the front. 
2CH.13.14	The Judeans looked around and saw that they were surrounded. They cried to the 
2CH.13.15	The Judeans gave a loud shout, and led by Abijah, they attacked; God defeated Jeroboam and the Israelite army. 
2CH.13.16	The Israelites fled from the Judeans, and God let the Judeans overpower them. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his army dealt the Israelites a crushing defeat—half a million of Israel's best soldiers were killed. 
2CH.13.18	And so the people of Judah were victorious over Israel, because they relied on the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam's army and occupied some of his cities: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the villages near each of these cities. 
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam never regained his power during Abijah's reign. Finally the 
2CH.13.21	Abijah, however, grew more powerful. He had fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	The rest of the history of Abijah, what he said and what he did, is written in 
2CH.14.1	King Abijah died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Asa succeeded him as king, and under Asa the land enjoyed peace for ten years. 
2CH.14.2	Asa pleased the 
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and the pagan places of worship, broke down the sacred stone columns, and cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah. 
2CH.14.4	He commanded the people of Judah to do the will of the 
2CH.14.5	Because he abolished the pagan places of worship and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, the kingdom was at peace under his rule. 
2CH.14.6	He built fortifications for the cities of Judah during this time, and for several years there was no war, because the 
2CH.14.7	He told the people of Judah, “Let us fortify the cities by building walls and towers, and gates that can be shut and barred. We have control of the land because we have done the will of the 
2CH.14.8	King Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, armed with shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin, armed with shields and bows. All of them were brave, well-trained men.
2CH.14.9	An Ethiopian
2CH.14.10	Asa went out to fight him, and both sides took up their positions at Zephathah Valley near Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	Asa prayed to the 
2CH.14.12	The 
2CH.14.13	and Asa and his troops pursued them as far as Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians
2CH.14.14	Then they were able to destroy the cities in the area around Gerar, because the people there were terrified of the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the camps of some shepherds, capturing large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded, 
2CH.15.2	and he went to meet King Asa. He called out, “Listen to me, King Asa, and all you people of Judah and Benjamin! The 
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel lived without the true God, without priests to teach them, and without a law. 
2CH.15.4	But when trouble came, they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	In those days no one could come and go in safety, because there was trouble and disorder in every land. 
2CH.15.6	One nation oppressed another nation, and one city oppressed another city, because God was bringing trouble and distress on them. 
2CH.15.7	But you must be strong and not be discouraged. The work that you do will be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard the prophecy that Azariah son of
2CH.15.9	Many people had come over to Asa's side from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, and were living in his kingdom, because they had seen that the 
2CH.15.10	They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year that Asa was king. 
2CH.15.11	On that day they offered sacrifices to the 
2CH.15.12	They made a covenant in which they agreed to worship the 
2CH.15.13	Anyone, young or old, male or female, who did not worship him was to be put to death. 
2CH.15.14	In a loud voice they took an oath in the 
2CH.15.15	All the people of Judah were happy because they had made this covenant with all their heart. They took delight in worshiping the 
2CH.15.16	King Asa removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol, chopped it up, and burned the pieces in Kidron Valley. 
2CH.15.17	Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship in the land, he remained faithful to the 
2CH.15.18	He placed in the Temple all the objects his father Abijah had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated. 
2CH.15.19	There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of his reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	So Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple and the palace and sent it to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, with this message: 
2CH.16.3	“Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory.”
2CH.16.4	Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all the cities of Naphtali where supplies were stored. 
2CH.16.5	When King Baasha heard what was happening, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah, and they used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time the prophet Hanani went to King Asa and said, “Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on the 
2CH.16.8	Didn't the Ethiopians
2CH.16.9	The 
2CH.16.10	This made Asa so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains. It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly.
2CH.16.11	All the events of Asa's reign from beginning to end are recorded in 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king, he was crippled by a severe foot disease; but even then he did not turn to the 
2CH.16.13	Two years later he died 
2CH.16.14	and was buried in the rock tomb which he had carved out for himself in David's City. They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial, and they built a huge bonfire to mourn his death.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa as king and strengthened his position against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He stationed troops in the fortified cities of Judah, in the Judean countryside, and in the cities which Asa had captured in the territory of Ephraim. 
2CH.17.3	The 
2CH.17.4	He served his father's God, obeyed God's commands, and did not act the way the kings of Israel did. 
2CH.17.5	The 
2CH.17.6	He took pride in serving the 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah: Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah. 
2CH.17.8	They were accompanied by nine Levites and two priests. The Levites were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and the priests were Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	They took the book of the Law of the 
2CH.17.10	The 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat a large amount of silver and other gifts, and some Arabs brought him 7,700 sheep and 7,700 goats. 
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat continued to grow more and more powerful. Throughout Judah he built fortifications and cities, 
2CH.17.13	where supplies were stored in huge amounts.
2CH.17.13	In Jerusalem he stationed outstanding officers, 
2CH.17.14	according to their clans. Adnah was the commander of the troops from the clans of Judah, and he had 300,000 soldiers under him. 
2CH.17.15	Second in rank was Jehohanan, with 280,000 soldiers, 
2CH.17.16	and third was Amasiah son of Zichri, with 200,000. (Amasiah had volunteered to serve the 
2CH.17.17	The commander of the troops from the clans of Benjamin was Eliada, an outstanding soldier, in command of 200,000 men armed with shields and bows. 
2CH.17.18	His second in command was Jehozabad with 180,000 men, well-equipped for battle. 
2CH.17.19	These soldiers served the king in Jerusalem, and in addition he stationed others in the other fortified cities of Judah.
2CH.18.1	When King Jehoshaphat of Judah became rich and famous, he arranged a marriage between a member of his family and the family of King Ahab of Israel. 
2CH.18.2	A number of years later Jehoshaphat went to the city of Samaria to visit Ahab. To honor Jehoshaphat and those with him, Ahab had a large number of sheep and cattle slaughtered for a feast. He tried to persuade Jehoshaphat to join him in attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.3	He asked, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?”
2CH.18.3	Jehoshaphat replied, “I am ready when you are, and so is my army. We will join you.” 
2CH.18.4	Then he added, “But first let's consult the 
2CH.18.5	So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, “Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?”
2CH.18.5	“Attack it,” they answered. “God will give you victory.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the 
2CH.18.7	Ahab answered, “There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad.”
2CH.18.7	“You shouldn't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
2CH.18.8	So King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.
2CH.18.9	The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
2CH.18.10	One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, “This is what the 
2CH.18.11	All the other prophets said the same thing. “March against Ramoth and you will win,” they said. “The 
2CH.18.12	Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same.”
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah answered, “By the living 
2CH.18.14	When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?”
2CH.18.14	“Attack!” Micaiah answered. “Of course you'll win. The 
2CH.18.15	But Ahab replied, “When you speak to me in the name of the 
2CH.18.17	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad!”
2CH.18.18	Micaiah went on: “Now listen to what the 
2CH.18.19	The 
2CH.18.20	until a spirit stepped forward, approached the 
2CH.18.21	The spirit replied, ‘I will go and make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.’ The 
2CH.18.22	And Micaiah concluded: “This is what has happened. The 
2CH.18.23	Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, “Since when did the 
2CH.18.24	“You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,” Micaiah replied.
2CH.18.25	Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, “Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash. 
2CH.18.26	Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely.”
2CH.18.27	“If you return safely,” Micaiah exclaimed, “then the 
2CH.18.28	Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments.” So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise.
2CH.18.30	The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel. 
2CH.18.31	So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat gave a shout, and the 
2CH.18.32	The chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, so they stopped pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. “I'm wounded!” he cried out to his chariot driver. “Turn around and pull out of the battle!” 
2CH.18.34	While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. At sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	A prophet, Jehu son of Hanani, went to meet the king and said to him, “Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate the 
2CH.19.3	But even so, there is some good in you. You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah which people worshiped, and you have tried to follow God's will.”
2CH.19.4	Even though King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, he traveled regularly among the people, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north, in order to call the people back to the 
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in each of the fortified cities of Judah 
2CH.19.6	and instructed them: “Be careful in pronouncing judgment; you are not acting on human authority, but on the authority of the 
2CH.19.7	Honor the 
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and some of the leading citizens as judges in cases involving a violation of the Law of the 
2CH.19.9	He gave them the following instructions: “You must perform your duties in reverence for the 
2CH.19.10	Whenever your fellow citizens from any of the cities bring before you a case of homicide or any other violation of a law or commandment, you must instruct them carefully how to conduct themselves during the trial, so that they do not become guilty of sinning against the 
2CH.19.11	Amariah the High Priest will have final authority in all religious cases, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, governor of Judah, will have final authority in all civil cases. The Levites have the responsibility of seeing that the decisions of the courts are carried out. Be courageous and carry out these instructions, and may the 
2CH.20.1	Some time later the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with their allies, the Meunites,
2CH.20.2	Some messengers came and announced to King Jehoshaphat: “A large army from Edom has come from the other side of the Dead Sea to attack you. They have already captured Hazazon Tamar.” (This is another name for Engedi.) 
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was frightened and prayed to the 
2CH.20.4	From every city of Judah people hurried to Jerusalem to ask the 
2CH.20.5	and they and the people of Jerusalem gathered in the new courtyard of the Temple. King Jehoshaphat went and stood before them 
2CH.20.6	and prayed aloud, “O 
2CH.20.7	 You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs forever. 
2CH.20.8	They have lived here and have built a temple to honor you, knowing 
2CH.20.9	that if any disaster struck them to punish them—a war,
2CH.20.11	This is how they repay us—they come to drive us out of the land that you gave us. 
2CH.20.12	You are our God! Punish them, for we are helpless in the face of this large army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but we look to you for help.”
2CH.20.13	All the men of Judah, with their wives and children, were standing there at the Temple. 
2CH.20.14	The spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	 Jahaziel said, “Your Majesty and all you people of Judah and Jerusalem, the 
2CH.20.16	Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz. You will meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	 You will not have to fight this battle. Just take up your positions and wait; you will see the 
2CH.20.18	Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low, with his face touching the ground, and all the people bowed with him and worshiped the 
2CH.20.19	The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised the 
2CH.20.20	Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa. As they were starting out, Jehoshaphat addressed them with these words: “People of Judah and Jerusalem! Put your trust in the 
2CH.20.21	After consulting with the people, the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army, singing: “Praise the 
2CH.20.22	When they began to sing, the 
2CH.20.23	The Ammonites and the Moabites attacked the Edomite army and completely destroyed it, and then they turned on each other in savage fighting. 
2CH.20.24	When the Judean army reached a tower that was in the desert, they looked toward the enemy and saw that they were all lying on the ground dead. Not one had escaped.
2CH.20.25	Jehoshaphat and his troops moved in to take the loot, and they found many cattle,
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they assembled in Beracah Valley and praised the 
2CH.20.27	Jehoshaphat led his troops back to Jerusalem in triumph, because the 
2CH.20.28	When they reached the city, they marched to the Temple to the music of harps and trumpets. 
2CH.20.29	Every nation that heard how the 
2CH.20.30	so Jehoshaphat ruled in peace, and God gave him security on every side.
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat had become king of Judah at the age of thirty-five and had ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of the 
2CH.20.33	but the pagan places of worship were not destroyed. The people still did not turn wholeheartedly to the worship of the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, from the beginning of his reign to its end, is recorded in 
2CH.20.35	At one time King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who did many wicked things. 
2CH.20.36	At the port of Eziongeber they built ocean-going ships. 
2CH.20.37	But Eliezer son of Dodavahu, from the town of Mareshah, warned Jehoshaphat, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king.
2CH.21.2	Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah had six brothers: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them large amounts of gold, silver, and other valuable possessions, and placed each one in charge of one of the fortified cities of Judah. But because Jehoram was the oldest, Jehoshaphat made him his successor. 
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom, he had all his brothers killed, and also some Israelite officials.
2CH.21.5	Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. 
2CH.21.6	He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel, because he had married one of Ahab's daughters. He sinned against the 
2CH.21.7	 but the 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram and his officers set out with chariots and invaded Edom. There the Edomite army surrounded them, but during the night they managed to break out and escape. 
2CH.21.10	Edom has been independent of
2CH.21.11	He even built pagan places of worship in the Judean highlands and led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to sin against the 
2CH.21.12	The prophet Elijah sent Jehoram a letter, which read as follows: “The 
2CH.21.13	Instead, you have followed the example of the kings of Israel and have led the people of Judah and Jerusalem into being unfaithful to God, just as Ahab and his successors led Israel into unfaithfulness. You even murdered your brothers, who were better men than you are. 
2CH.21.14	As a result, the 
2CH.21.15	You yourself will suffer a painful intestinal disease that will grow worse day by day.”
2CH.21.16	Some Philistines and Arabs lived near where some Ethiopians
2CH.21.17	They invaded Judah, looted the royal palace, and carried off as prisoners all the king's wives and sons except Ahaziah, his youngest son.
2CH.21.18	Then after all this, the 
2CH.21.19	For almost two years it grew steadily worse until finally the king died in agony. His subjects did not light a bonfire in mourning for him as had been done for his ancestors.
2CH.21.20	Jehoram had become king at the age of thirty-two and had ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. Nobody was sorry when he died. They buried him in David's City, but not in the royal tombs.
2CH.22.1	Some Arabs had led a raid and killed all of King Jehoram's sons except Ahaziah, the youngest. So now the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah king as his father's successor. 
2CH.22.2+2CH.22.3	Ahaziah became king at the age of twenty-two,
2CH.22.4	He sinned against the 
2CH.22.5	Following their advice, he joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle. 
2CH.22.6	He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds, and Ahaziah went there to visit him.
2CH.22.7	God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziah's downfall. While Ahaziah was there, he and Joram were confronted by a man named Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	As Jehu was carrying out God's sentence on the dynasty, he came across a group made up of Judean leaders and of Ahaziah's nephews that had accompanied Ahaziah on his visit. Jehu killed them all. 
2CH.22.9	A search was made for Ahaziah, and he was found hiding in Samaria. They took him to Jehu and put him to death. But they did bury his body out of respect for his grandfather King Jehoshaphat, who had done all he could to serve the 
2CH.22.9	No member of Ahaziah's family was left who could rule the kingdom.
2CH.22.10	As soon as King Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned of her son's murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family of Judah to be killed. 
2CH.22.11	Ahaziah had a half sister, Jehosheba, who was married to a priest named Jehoiada. She secretly rescued one of Ahaziah's sons, Joash, took him away from the other princes who were about to be murdered and hid him and a nurse in a bedroom at the Temple. By keeping him hidden, she saved him from death at the hands of Athaliah. 
2CH.22.12	For six years he remained there in hiding, while Athaliah ruled as queen.
2CH.23.1	After waiting six years Jehoiada the priest decided that it was time to take action. He made a pact with five army officers: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. 
2CH.23.2	They traveled to all the cities of Judah and brought back with them to Jerusalem the Levites and all the heads of the clans.
2CH.23.4	This is what we will do. When the priests and Levites come on duty on the Sabbath, one third of them will guard the Temple gates, 
2CH.23.5	another third will guard the royal palace, and the rest will be stationed at the Foundation Gate. All the people will assemble in the Temple courtyard. 
2CH.23.6	No one is to enter the Temple buildings except the priests and the Levites who are on duty. They may enter, because they are consecrated, but the rest of the people must obey the 
2CH.23.7	The Levites are to stand guard around the king, with their swords drawn, and are to stay with the king wherever he goes. Anyone who tries to enter the Temple is to be killed.”
2CH.23.8	The Levites and the people of Judah carried out Jehoiada's instructions. The men were not dismissed when they went off duty on the Sabbath, so the commanders had available both those coming on duty and those going off. 
2CH.23.9	Jehoiada gave the officers the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and had been kept in the Temple. 
2CH.23.10	He stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple, to protect the king. 
2CH.23.11	Then Jehoiada led Joash out, placed the crown on his head, and gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship. And so he was made king. Jehoiada the priest and his sons anointed Joash, and everyone shouted, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	Athaliah heard the people cheering for the king, so she hurried to the Temple, where the crowd had gathered. 
2CH.23.13	There she saw the new king at the Temple entrance, standing by the column reserved for kings and surrounded by the army officers and the trumpeters. All the people were shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets, and the Temple musicians with their instruments were leading the celebration. She tore her clothes in distress and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area, so he called out the army officers and said, “Take her out between the rows of guards, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her.”
2CH.23.15	They seized her, took her to the palace, and there at the Horse Gate they killed her.
2CH.23.16	The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people join him in making a covenant that they would be the 
2CH.23.17	Then they all went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols there and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple. They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David and to burn the sacrifices offered to the 
2CH.23.19	Jehoiada also put guards on duty at the Temple gates to keep out anyone who was ritually unclean.
2CH.23.20	The army officers, the leading citizens, the officials, and all the rest of the people joined Jehoiada in a procession that brought the king from the Temple to the palace. They entered by the main gate, and the king took his place on the throne. 
2CH.23.21	All the people were filled with happiness, and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been killed.
2CH.24.1	Joash became king of Judah at the age of seven, and he ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother was Zibiah from the city of Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	He did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada chose two wives for King Joash, and they bore him sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	After he had been king for a while, Joash decided to have the Temple repaired. 
2CH.24.5	He ordered the priests and the Levites to go to the cities of Judah and collect from all the people enough money to make the annual repairs on the Temple. He told them to act promptly, but the Levites delayed, 
2CH.24.6	 so he called in Jehoiada, their leader, and demanded, “Why haven't you seen to it that the Levites collect from Judah and Jerusalem the tax which Moses, the servant of the 
2CH.24.6	( 
2CH.24.7	The followers of Athaliah, that corrupt woman,
2CH.24.8	The king ordered the Levites to make a box for contributions and to place it at the Temple gate. 
2CH.24.9	They sent word throughout Jerusalem and Judah for everyone to bring to the 
2CH.24.10	This pleased the people and their leaders, and they brought their tax money and filled the box with it. 
2CH.24.11	Every day the Levites would take the box to the royal official who was in charge of it. Whenever it was full, the royal secretary and the High Priest's representative would take the money out and return the box to its place. And so they collected a large sum of money.
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada would give the money to those who were in charge of repairing the Temple, and they hired stonemasons, carpenters, and metalworkers to make the repairs. 
2CH.24.13	All of them worked hard, and they restored the Temple to its original condition, as solid as ever. 
2CH.24.14	When the repairs were finished, the remaining gold and silver was given to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to have bowls and other utensils made for the Temple.
2CH.24.14	As long as Jehoiada was alive, sacrifices were offered regularly at the Temple. 
2CH.24.15	After reaching the very old age of a hundred and thirty, he died. 
2CH.24.16	They buried him in the royal tombs in David's City in recognition of the service he had done for the people of Israel, for God, and for the Temple.
2CH.24.17	But once Jehoiada was dead, the leaders of Judah persuaded King Joash to listen to them instead. 
2CH.24.18	And so the people stopped worshiping in the Temple of the 
2CH.24.19	The 
2CH.24.20	 Then the spirit of God took control of Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood where the people could see him and called out, “The 
2CH.24.21	King Joash joined in a conspiracy against Zechariah, and on the king's orders the people stoned Zechariah in the Temple courtyard. 
2CH.24.22	The king forgot about the loyal service that Zechariah's father Jehoiada had given him, and he had Zechariah killed. As Zechariah was dying, he called out, “May the 
2CH.24.23	When autumn came that year, the Syrian army attacked Judah and Jerusalem, killed all the leaders, and took large amounts of loot back to Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	The Syrian army was small, but the 
2CH.24.25	He was severely wounded, and when the enemy withdrew, two of his officials plotted against him and killed him in his bed to avenge the murder of the son
2CH.24.26	Those who plotted against him were Zabad, the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith.) 
2CH.24.27	The 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah became king at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.25.3	As soon as he was firmly in power, he executed the officials who had murdered his father. 
2CH.25.4	 He did not, however, execute their children, but followed what the 
2CH.25.5	King Amaziah organized all the men of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin into army units, according to the clans they belonged to, and placed officers in command of units of a thousand and units of a hundred. This included all men twenty years of age or older, 300,000 in all. They were picked troops, ready for battle, skilled in using spears and shields. 
2CH.25.6	In addition, he hired 100,000 soldiers from Israel at a cost of about four tons of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a prophet went to the king and said to him, “Don't take these Israelite soldiers with you. The 
2CH.25.8	You may think that they will make you stronger
2CH.25.9	Amaziah asked the prophet, “But what about all that silver I have already paid for them?”
2CH.25.9	The prophet replied, “The 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah sent the hired troops away and told them to go home. At this they went home, bitterly angry with the people of Judah.
2CH.25.11	Amaziah summoned up his courage and led his army to Salt Valley. There they fought and killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers 
2CH.25.12	and captured another ten thousand. They took the prisoners to the top of the cliff at the city of Sela and threw them off, so that they were killed on the rocks below.
2CH.25.13	Meanwhile the Israelite soldiers that Amaziah had not allowed to go into battle with him attacked the Judean cities between Samaria and Beth Horon, killed three thousand men, and captured quantities of loot.
2CH.25.14	When Amaziah returned from defeating the Edomites, he brought their idols back with him, set them up, worshiped them, and burned incense to them. 
2CH.25.15	This made the 
2CH.25.16	“Since when,” Amaziah interrupted, “have we made you adviser to the king? Stop talking, or I'll have you killed!”
2CH.25.16	The prophet stopped, but not before saying, “Now I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done all this and have ignored my advice.”
2CH.25.17	King Amaziah of Judah and his advisers plotted against Israel. He then sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel, who was the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu, challenging him to fight.
2CH.25.18	Jehoash sent this answer to Amaziah: “Once a thorn bush in the Lebanon Mountains sent a message to a cedar: ‘Give your daughter in marriage to my son.’ A wild animal passed by and trampled the bush down. 
2CH.25.19	Now Amaziah, you boast that you have defeated the Edomites, but I advise you to stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and your people?”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah refused to listen. It was God's will for Amaziah to be defeated, because he had worshiped the Edomite idols. 
2CH.25.21	So King Jehoash of Israel went into battle against King Amaziah of Judah. They met at Beth Shemesh in Judah, 
2CH.25.22	the Judean army was defeated, and the soldiers fled to their homes. 
2CH.25.23	Jehoash captured Amaziah and took him to Jerusalem. There he tore down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of two hundred yards. 
2CH.25.24	He took back to Samaria as loot all the gold and silver in the Temple, the Temple equipment guarded by the descendants of Obed Edom, and the palace treasures. He also took hostages with him.
2CH.25.25	King Amaziah of Judah outlived King Jehoash of Israel by fifteen years. 
2CH.25.26	All the other things that Amaziah did from the beginning to the end of his reign are recorded in 
2CH.25.27	Ever since the time when he rebelled against the 
2CH.25.28	His body was carried to Jerusalem on a horse, and he was buried in the royal tombs in David's City.
2CH.26.1	All the people of Judah chose Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son Uzziah to succeed his father as king. ( 
2CH.26.2	It was after the death of Amaziah that Uzziah recaptured Elath and rebuilt the city.)
2CH.26.3	Uzziah became king at the age of sixteen, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	Following the example of his father, he did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.26.5	As long as Zechariah, his religious adviser, was living, he served the 
2CH.26.6	Uzziah went to war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls of the cities of Gath, Jamnia, and Ashdod, and built fortified cities near Ashdod and in the rest of Philistia. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him defeat the Philistines, the Arabs living at Gurbaal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and he became so powerful that his fame spread even to Egypt.
2CH.26.9	Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem by building towers at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and where the wall turned. 
2CH.26.10	He also built fortified towers in the open country and dug many cisterns, because he had large herds of livestock in the western foothills and plains. Because he loved farming, he encouraged the people to plant vineyards in the hill country and to farm the fertile land.
2CH.26.11	He had a large army ready for battle. Its records were kept by his secretaries Jeiel and Maaseiah under the supervision of Hananiah, a member of the king's staff. 
2CH.26.12	The army was commanded by 2,600 officers. 
2CH.26.13	Under them were 307,500 soldiers able to fight effectively for the king against his enemies. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah supplied the army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and arrows, and stones for slinging. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem his inventors made equipment for shooting arrows and for throwing large stones from the towers and corners of the city wall. His fame spread everywhere, and he became very powerful because of the help he received from God.
2CH.26.16	But when King Uzziah became strong, he grew arrogant, and that led to his downfall. He defied the 
2CH.26.17	Azariah the priest, accompanied by eighty strong and courageous priests, followed the king 
2CH.26.18	 to resist him. They said, “Uzziah! You have no right to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Uzziah was standing there in the Temple beside the incense altar and was holding an incense burner. He became angry with the priests, and immediately a dreaded skin disease broke out on his forehead. 
2CH.26.20	Azariah and the other priests stared at the king's forehead in horror and then forced him to leave the Temple. He hurried to get out, because the 
2CH.26.21	For the rest of his life King Uzziah was ritually unclean because of his disease. Unable to enter the Temple again, he lived in his own house, relieved of all duties, while his son Jotham governed the country.
2CH.26.22	The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz recorded all the other things that King Uzziah did during his reign. 
2CH.26.23	 Uzziah died and was buried in the royal burial ground, but because of his disease he was not buried in the royal tombs. His son Jotham succeeded him as king.
2CH.27.1	Jotham became king at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. His mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.27.3	It was Jotham who built the North Gate of the Temple and did extensive work on the city wall in the area of Jerusalem called Ophel. 
2CH.27.4	In the mountains of Judah he built cities, and in the forests he built forts and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He fought against the king of Ammon and his army and defeated them. Then he forced the Ammonites to pay him the following tribute each year for three years: four tons of silver, fifty thousand bushels of wheat, and fifty thousand bushels of barley. 
2CH.27.6	Jotham grew powerful because he faithfully obeyed the 
2CH.27.7	The other events of Jotham's reign, his wars, and his policies, are all recorded in 
2CH.27.8	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. 
2CH.27.9	He died and was buried in David's City and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz became king at the age of twenty, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not follow the good example of his ancestor King David; instead, he did what was not pleasing to the 
2CH.28.2	and followed the example of the kings of Israel. He had metal images of Baal made, 
2CH.28.3	burned incense in Hinnom Valley, and even sacrificed his own sons as burnt offerings to idols, imitating the disgusting practice of the people whom the 
2CH.28.4	At the pagan places of worship, on the hills, and under every shady tree Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense.
2CH.28.7	An Israelite soldier named Zichri killed King Ahaz' son Maaseiah, the palace administrator Azrikam, and Elkanah, who was second in command to the king. 
2CH.28.8	Even though the Judeans were their own relatives, the Israelite army captured 200,000 women and children as prisoners and took them back to Samaria, along with large amounts of loot.
2CH.28.9	A man named Oded, a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now you intend to make the men and women of Jerusalem and Judah your slaves. Don't you know that you also have committed sins against the 
2CH.28.11	Listen to me! These prisoners are your brothers and sisters. Let them go, or the 
2CH.28.12	Four of the leading men of the Northern Kingdom, Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai also opposed the actions of the army. 
2CH.28.13	They said, “Don't bring those prisoners here! We have already sinned against the 
2CH.28.14	So then the army handed the prisoners and the loot over to the people and their leaders, 
2CH.28.15	and the four men were appointed to provide the prisoners with clothing from the captured loot. They gave them clothes and sandals to wear, gave them enough to eat and drink, and put olive oil on their wounds. Those who were too weak to walk were put on donkeys, and all the prisoners were taken back to Judean territory at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then the Israelites returned home to Samaria.
2CH.28.16+2CH.28.17	The Edomites began to raid Judah again and captured many prisoners, so King Ahaz asked Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, to send help. 
2CH.28.18	At this same time the Philistines were raiding the towns in the western foothills and in southern Judah. They captured the cities of Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, and the cities of Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages, and settled there permanently. 
2CH.28.19	Because King Ahaz of Judah had violated the rights of his people and had defied the 
2CH.28.20	The Assyrian emperor, instead of helping Ahaz, opposed him and caused him trouble. 
2CH.28.21	So Ahaz took the gold from the Temple, the palace, and the homes of the leaders of the people, and gave it to the emperor, but even this did not help.
2CH.28.22	When his troubles were at their worst, that man Ahaz sinned against the 
2CH.28.23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of the Syrians, who had defeated him. He said, “The Syrian gods helped the kings of Syria, so if I sacrifice to them, they may help me too.” This brought disaster on him and on his nation. 
2CH.28.24	In addition, he took all the Temple equipment and broke it in pieces. He closed the Temple and set up altars in every part of Jerusalem. 
2CH.28.25	In every city and town in Judah he built pagan places of worship, where incense was to be burned to foreign gods. In this way he brought on himself the anger of the 
2CH.28.26	All the other events of his reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.28.27	 King Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah became king of Judah at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	Following the example of his ancestor King David, he did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.29.3	In the first month of the year after Hezekiah became king, he reopened the gates of the Temple and had them repaired. 
2CH.29.4	He assembled a group of priests and Levites in the east courtyard of the Temple 
2CH.29.5	and spoke to them there. He said, “You Levites are to consecrate yourselves and purify the Temple of the 
2CH.29.6	Our ancestors were unfaithful to the 
2CH.29.7	They closed the doors of the Temple, let the lamps go out, and failed to burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the Temple of the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Because of this the 
2CH.29.9	Our fathers were killed in battle, and our wives and children have been taken away as prisoners.
2CH.29.10	“I have now decided to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not lose any time. You are the ones that the 
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	The following Levites were there:
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Kohath, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Merari, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Gershon, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	From the clan of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel
2CH.29.15	These men assembled their fellow Levites, and they all made themselves ritually clean. Then, as the king had commanded them to do, they began to make the Temple ritually clean, according to the Law of the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went inside the Temple to purify it, and they carried out into the Temple courtyard everything that was ritually unclean. From there the Levites took it all outside the city to Kidron Valley.
2CH.29.17	The work was begun on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day they had finished it all, including the entrance room to the Temple. Then they worked for the next eight days, until the sixteenth of the month, preparing the Temple for worship.
2CH.29.18	The Levites made the following report to King Hezekiah: “We have completed the ritual purification of the whole Temple, including the altar for burnt offerings, the table for the sacred bread, and all their equipment. 
2CH.29.19	We have also brought back all the equipment which King Ahaz took away during those years he was unfaithful to God, and we have rededicated it. It is all in front of the 
2CH.29.20	Without delay King Hezekiah assembled the leading men of the city, and together they went to the Temple. 
2CH.29.21	As an offering to take away the sins of the royal family and of the people of Judah and to purify the Temple, they took seven bulls, seven sheep, seven lambs, and seven goats. The king told the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to offer the animals as sacrifices on the altar. 
2CH.29.22	The priests killed the bulls first, then the sheep, and then the lambs, and sprinkled the blood of each sacrifice on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Finally they took the goats to the king and to the other worshipers, who laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	Then the priests killed the goats and poured their blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sin of all the people, for the king had commanded that burnt offerings and sin offerings be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	The king followed the instructions that the 
2CH.29.26	instruments like those that King David had used. The priests also stood there with trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	Hezekiah gave the order for the burnt offering to be presented; and as the offering began, the people sang praise to the 
2CH.29.28	Everyone who was there joined in worship, and the singing and the rest of the music continued until all the sacrifices had been burned. 
2CH.29.29	Then King Hezekiah and all the people knelt down and worshiped God. 
2CH.29.30	The king and the leaders of the nation told the Levites to sing to the 
2CH.29.31	Hezekiah said to the people, “Now that you are ritually clean, bring sacrifices as offerings of thanksgiving to the 
2CH.29.32	They brought 70 bulls, 100 sheep, and 200 lambs as burnt offerings for the 
2CH.29.33	they also brought 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep as sacrifices for the people to eat. 
2CH.29.34	Since there were not enough priests to kill all these animals, the Levites helped them until the work was finished. By then more priests had made themselves ritually clean. (The Levites were more faithful in keeping ritually clean than the priests were.) 
2CH.29.35	In addition to offering the sacrifices that were burned whole, the priests were responsible for burning the fat that was offered from the sacrifices which the people ate, and for pouring out the wine that was presented with the burnt offerings.
2CH.29.35	And so worship in the Temple was begun again. 
2CH.29.36	King Hezekiah and the people were happy, because God had helped them to do all this so quickly.
2CH.30.4	The king and the people were pleased with their plan, 
2CH.30.5	so they invited all the Israelites, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, to come together in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover according to the Law, in larger numbers than ever before. 
2CH.30.6	Messengers went out at the command of the king and his officials through all Judah and Israel with the following invitation:
2CH.30.6	“People of Israel, you have survived the Assyrian conquest of the land. Now return to the 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your ancestors and your Israelite relatives who were unfaithful to the 
2CH.30.8	Do not be stubborn as they were, but obey the 
2CH.30.9	If you return to the 
2CH.30.10	The messengers went to every city in the territory of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far north as the tribe of Zebulun, but people laughed at them and made fun of them. 
2CH.30.11	Still, there were some from the tribes of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun who were willing to come to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	God was also at work in Judah and united the people in their determination to obey his will by following the commands of the king and his officials.
2CH.30.13	A great number of people gathered in Jerusalem in the second month to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
2CH.30.14	They took all the altars that had been used in Jerusalem for offering sacrifices and burning incense and threw them into Kidron Valley. 
2CH.30.15	And on the fourteenth day of the month they killed the lambs for the Passover sacrifice. The priests and Levites who were not ritually clean became so ashamed that they dedicated themselves to the 
2CH.30.16	They took their places in the Temple according to the instructions in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The Levites gave the blood of the sacrifices to the priests, who sprinkled it on the altar. 
2CH.30.17	Because many of the people were not ritually clean, they could not kill the Passover lambs, so the Levites did it for them and dedicated the lambs to the 
2CH.30.18	In addition, many of those who had come from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not performed the ritual of purification, and so they were observing Passover improperly. King Hezekiah offered this prayer for them: 
2CH.30.19	“O 
2CH.30.20	The 
2CH.30.21	For seven days the people who had gathered in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread with great joy, and day after day the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah praised the Levites for their skill in conducting the worship of the 
2CH.30.22	After the seven days during which they offered sacrifices in praise of the 
2CH.30.23	they all decided to celebrate for another seven days. So they celebrated with joy. 
2CH.30.24	King Hezekiah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for the people to kill and eat, and the officials gave them another 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. A large number of priests went through the ritual of purification. 
2CH.30.25	So everyone was happy—the people of Judah, the priests, the Levites, the people who had come from the north, and the foreigners who had settled permanently in Israel and Judah. 
2CH.30.26	The city of Jerusalem was filled with joy, because nothing like this had happened since the days of King Solomon, the son of David. 
2CH.30.27	The priests and the Levites asked the 
2CH.31.1	After the festival ended, all the people of Israel went to every city in Judah and broke the stone pillars, cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and destroyed the altars and the pagan places of worship. They did the same thing throughout the rest of Judah, and the territories of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh; then they all returned home.
2CH.31.2	King Hezekiah reestablished the organization of the priests and Levites, under which they each had specific duties. These included offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, taking part in the Temple worship, and giving praise and thanks in the various parts of the Temple. 
2CH.31.3	 From his own flocks and herds he provided animals for the burnt offerings each morning and evening, and for those offered on the Sabbath, at the New Moon Festival, and at the other festivals which are required by the Law of the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the order was given, the people of Israel brought gifts of their finest grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other farm produce, and they also brought the tithes
2CH.31.6	All the people who lived in the cities of Judah brought tithes of their cattle and sheep, and they also brought large quantities of gifts which they dedicated to the 
2CH.31.7	The gifts started arriving in the third month and continued to pile up for the next four months. 
2CH.31.8	When King Hezekiah and his officials saw how much had been given, they praised the 
2CH.31.9	The king spoke to the priests and the Levites about these gifts, 
2CH.31.10	and Azariah the High Priest, a descendant of Zadok, said to him, “Since the people started bringing their gifts to the Temple, there has been enough to eat and a large surplus besides. We have all this because the 
2CH.31.11	On the king's orders they prepared storerooms in the Temple area 
2CH.31.12	and put all the gifts and tithes in them for safekeeping. They placed a Levite named Conaniah in charge and made his brother Shimei his assistant. 
2CH.31.13	Ten Levites were assigned to work under them: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. All this was done under the authority of King Hezekiah and Azariah the High Priest. 
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah, a Levite who was chief guard at the East Gate of the Temple, was in charge of receiving the gifts offered to the 
2CH.31.15	In the other cities where priests lived, he was faithfully assisted in this by other Levites: Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the food equally to their fellow Levites according to what their duties were, 
2CH.31.16	and not by clans. They gave a share to all males thirty
2CH.31.17	The priests were assigned their duties by clans, and the Levites twenty years of age or older were assigned theirs by work groups. 
2CH.31.18	They were all registered together with their wives, children, and other dependents, because they were required to be ready to perform their sacred duties at any time. 
2CH.31.19	Among the priests who lived in the cities assigned to Aaron's descendants or in the pasture lands belonging to these cities, there were responsible men who distributed the food to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone who was on the rolls of the Levite clans.
2CH.31.20	Throughout all Judah, King Hezekiah did what was right and what was pleasing to the 
2CH.31.21	He was successful, because everything he did for the Temple or in observance of the Law, he did in a spirit of complete loyalty and devotion to his God.
2CH.32.1	After these events, in which King Hezekiah served the 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib intended to attack Jerusalem also, 
2CH.32.3+2CH.32.4	he and his officials decided to cut off the supply of water outside the city in order to keep the Assyrians from having any water when they got near Jerusalem. The officials led a large number of people out and stopped up all the springs, so that no more water flowed out of them. 
2CH.32.5	The king strengthened the city's defenses by repairing the wall, building towers on it,
2CH.32.6	He placed all the men in the city under the command of army officers and had them assemble in the open square at the city gate. He said to them, 
2CH.32.7	“Be determined and confident, and don't be afraid of the Assyrian emperor or of the army he is leading. We have more power on our side than he has on his. 
2CH.32.8	He has human power, but we have the 
2CH.32.9	Some time later, while Sennacherib and his army were still at Lachish, he sent the following message to Hezekiah and the people of Judah who were with him in Jerusalem: 
2CH.32.10	“I, Sennacherib, Emperor of Assyria, ask what gives you people the confidence to remain in Jerusalem under siege. 
2CH.32.11	Hezekiah tells you that the 
2CH.32.12	He is the one who destroyed the 
2CH.32.13	Don't you know what my ancestors and I have done to the people of other nations? Did the gods of any other nation save their people from the emperor of Assyria? 
2CH.32.14	When did any of the gods of all those countries ever save their country from us? Then what makes you think that your god can save you? 
2CH.32.15	Now don't let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like that. Don't believe him! No god of any nation has ever been able to save his people from any Assyrian emperor. So certainly this god of yours can't save you!”
2CH.32.16	The Assyrian officials said even worse things about the 
2CH.32.17	The letter that the emperor wrote defied the 
2CH.32.18	The officials shouted this in Hebrew in order to frighten and discourage the people of Jerusalem who were on the city wall, so that it would be easier to capture the city. 
2CH.32.19	They talked about the God of Jerusalem in the same way that they talked about the gods of the other peoples, idols made by human hands.
2CH.32.20	Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed to God and cried out to him for help. 
2CH.32.21	The 
2CH.32.22	In this way the 
2CH.32.23	Many people came to Jerusalem, bringing offerings to the 
2CH.32.24	About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. He prayed, and the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah was too proud to show gratitude for what the 
2CH.32.26	Finally, however, Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem humbled themselves, and so the 
2CH.32.27	King Hezekiah became very wealthy, and everyone held him in honor. He had storerooms built for his gold, silver, precious stones, spices, shields, and other valuable objects. 
2CH.32.28	In addition, he had storehouses built for his grain, wine, and olive oil; barns for his cattle; and pens for his sheep. 
2CH.32.29	Besides all this, God gave him sheep and cattle and so much other wealth that he built many cities. 
2CH.32.30	It was King Hezekiah who blocked the outlet for Gihon Spring and channeled the water to flow through a tunnel to a point inside the walls of Jerusalem. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did, 
2CH.32.31	and even when the Babylonian ambassadors came to inquire about the unusual event that had happened in the land, God let Hezekiah go his own way only in order to test his character.
2CH.32.32	Everything else that King Hezekiah did and his devotion to the 
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah died and was buried in the upper section of the royal tombs. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem paid him great honor at his death. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. 
2CH.33.2	 Following the disgusting practices of the nations whom the 
2CH.33.3	He rebuilt the pagan places of worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He built altars for the worship of Baal, made images of the goddess Asherah, and worshiped the stars. 
2CH.33.4	 He built pagan altars in the Temple, the place that the 
2CH.33.5	In the two courtyards of the Temple he built altars for the worship of the stars. 
2CH.33.6	He sacrificed his sons in Hinnom Valley as burnt offerings. He practiced divination and magic and consulted fortunetellers and mediums. He sinned greatly against the 
2CH.33.7	 He placed an image in the Temple, the place about which God had said to David and his son Solomon: “Here in Jerusalem, in this Temple, is the place that I have chosen out of all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel as the place where I am to be worshiped. 
2CH.33.8	And if the people of Israel will obey all my commands and keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them, then I will not allow them to be driven out of the land that I gave to their ancestors.” 
2CH.33.9	Manasseh led the people of Judah to commit even greater sins than those committed by the nations whom the 
2CH.33.10	Although the 
2CH.33.11	So the 
2CH.33.12	In his suffering he became humble, turned to the 
2CH.33.13	God accepted Manasseh's prayer and answered it by letting him go back to Jerusalem and rule again. This convinced Manasseh that the 
2CH.33.14	After this, Manasseh increased the height of the outer wall on the east side of David's City, from a point in the valley near Gihon Spring north to the Fish Gate and the area of the city called Ophel. He also stationed an army officer in command of a unit of troops in each of the fortified cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	He removed from the Temple the foreign gods and the image that he had placed there, and the pagan altars that were on the hill where the Temple stood and in other places in Jerusalem; he took all these things outside the city and threw them away. 
2CH.33.16	He also repaired the altar where the 
2CH.33.17	Although the people continued to offer sacrifices at other places of worship, they offered them only to the 
2CH.33.18	Everything else that Manasseh did, the prayer he made to his God, and the messages of the prophets who spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	The king's prayer and God's answer to it, and an account of the sins he committed before he repented—the evil he did, the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah that he made and the idols that he worshiped—are all recorded in 
2CH.33.20	Manasseh died and was buried at the palace, and his son Amon succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for two years. 
2CH.33.22	Like his father Manasseh, he sinned against the 
2CH.33.23	But unlike his father, he did not become humble and turn to the 
2CH.33.24	Amon's officials plotted against him and assassinated him in the palace. 
2CH.33.25	The people of Judah killed Amon's assassins and made his son Josiah king.
2CH.34.2	He did what was pleasing to the 
2CH.34.3	In the eighth year that Josiah was king, while he was still very young, he began to worship the God of his ancestor King David. Four years later he began to destroy the pagan places of worship, the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and all the other idols. 
2CH.34.4	 Under his direction the altars where Baal was worshiped were smashed, and the incense altars near them were torn down. They ground to dust the images of Asherah and all the other idols and then scattered the dust on the graves of the people who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	 He burned the bones of the pagan priests on the altars where they had worshiped. By doing all this, he made Judah and Jerusalem ritually clean again. 
2CH.34.6	He did the same thing in the cities and the devastated areas of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far north as Naphtali. 
2CH.34.7	Throughout the territory of the Northern Kingdom he smashed the altars and the symbols of Asherah, ground the idols to dust, and broke into bits all the incense altars. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple by ending pagan worship, King Josiah sent three men to repair the Temple of the 
2CH.34.9	The money that the Levite guards had collected in the Temple was turned over to Hilkiah the High Priest. (It had been collected from the people of Ephraim and Manasseh and the rest of the Northern Kingdom, and from the people of Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem.) 
2CH.34.10	This money was then handed over to the three men in charge of the Temple repairs, and they gave it to 
2CH.34.11	the carpenters and the builders to buy the stones and the timber used to repair the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to decay. 
2CH.34.12	The men who did the work were thoroughly honest. They were supervised by four Levites: Jahath and Obadiah of the clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam of the clan of Kohath. (The Levites were all skillful musicians.) 
2CH.34.13	Other Levites were in charge of transporting materials and supervising the workers on various jobs, and others kept records or served as guards.
2CH.34.14	While the money was being taken out of the storeroom, Hilkiah found the book of the Law of the 
2CH.34.15	He said to Shaphan, “I have found the book of the Law here in the Temple.” He gave Shaphan the book, 
2CH.34.16	and Shaphan took it to the king. He reported, “We have done everything that you commanded. 
2CH.34.17	We have taken the money that was kept in the Temple and handed it over to the workers and their supervisors.” 
2CH.34.18	Then he added, “I have here a book that Hilkiah gave me.” And he read it aloud to the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the book being read, he tore his clothes in dismay 
2CH.34.20	and gave the following order to Hilkiah, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, to Abdon
2CH.34.21	“Go and consult the 
2CH.34.22	At the king's command, Hilkiah and the others went to consult a woman named Huldah, a prophet who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. (Her husband Shallum, the son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas, was in charge of the Temple robes.) They described to her what had happened, 
2CH.34.23	and she told them to go back to the king and give him 
2CH.34.24	the following message from the 
2CH.34.25	They have rejected me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and so have stirred up my anger by all they have done. My anger is aroused against Jerusalem, and it will not die down. 
2CH.34.26	As for the king himself, this is what I, the 
2CH.34.27	and you repented and humbled yourself before me, tearing your clothes and weeping, when you heard how I threatened to punish Jerusalem and its people. I have heard your prayer, 
2CH.34.28	and the punishment which I am going to bring on Jerusalem will not come until after your death. I will let you die in peace.”
2CH.34.28	The men returned to King Josiah with this message.
2CH.34.29	King Josiah summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, 
2CH.34.30	and together they went to the Temple, accompanied by the priests and the Levites and all the rest of the people, rich and poor alike. Before them all the king read aloud the whole book of the covenant, which had been found in the Temple. 
2CH.34.31	He stood by the royal column
2CH.34.32	He made the people of Benjamin and everyone else present in Jerusalem promise to keep the covenant. And so the people of Jerusalem obeyed the requirements of the covenant they had made with the God of their ancestors. 
2CH.34.33	King Josiah destroyed all the disgusting idols that were in the territory belonging to the people of Israel, and as long as he lived, he required the people to serve the 
2CH.35.1	King Josiah celebrated the Passover at Jerusalem in honor of the 
2CH.35.2	He assigned to the priests the duties they were to perform in the Temple and encouraged them to do them well. 
2CH.35.3	He also gave these instructions to the Levites, the teachers of Israel, who were dedicated to the 
2CH.35.4	 Take your places in the Temple by clans, according to the responsibilities assigned to you by King David and his son King Solomon, 
2CH.35.5	and arrange yourselves so that some of you will be available to help each family of the people of Israel. 
2CH.35.6	You are to kill the Passover lambs and goats. Now make yourselves ritually clean and prepare the sacrifices in order that your fellow Israelites may follow the instructions which the 
2CH.35.7	For the use of the people at the Passover, King Josiah contributed from his own herds and flocks 30,000 sheep, lambs, and young goats, and 3,000 bulls. 
2CH.35.8	His officials also made contributions for the people, the priests, and the Levites to use. And the officials in charge of the Temple—Hilkiah, the High Priest, Zechariah, and Jehiel—gave the priests 2,600 lambs and young goats and 300 bulls for sacrifices during the festival. 
2CH.35.9	The leaders of the Levites—Conaniah, Shemaiah and his brother Nethanel, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad—contributed 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls for the Levites to offer as sacrifices.
2CH.35.10	When everything was arranged for the Passover, the priests and the Levites took their posts, as commanded by the king. 
2CH.35.11	After the lambs and goats had been killed, the Levites skinned them, and the priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2CH.35.12	Then they divided among the people, by family groups, the animals for burnt offerings, so that they could offer them according to the instructions in the Law of Moses. 
2CH.35.13	 The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire, according to the regulations, and boiled the sacred offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and quickly distributed the meat to the people. 
2CH.35.14	After this was done, the Levites provided meat for themselves and for the priests descended from Aaron, for the priests were kept busy until night, burning the animals that were burned whole and the fat of the sacrifices. 
2CH.35.15	 The following musicians of the Levite clan of Asaph were in the places assigned to them by King David's instructions: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's prophet. The guards at the Temple gates did not need to leave their posts, because the other Levites prepared the Passover for them. 
2CH.35.16	So, as King Josiah had commanded, everything was done that day for the worship of the 
2CH.35.17	 For seven days all the people of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
2CH.35.18	Since the days of the prophet Samuel, the Passover had never been celebrated like this. None of the former kings had ever celebrated a Passover like this one celebrated by King Josiah, the priests, the Levites, and the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem 
2CH.35.19	in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
2CH.35.20	After King Josiah had done all this for the Temple, King Neco of Egypt led an army to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates River. Josiah tried to stop him, 
2CH.35.21	but Neco sent Josiah this message: “This war I am fighting does not concern you, King of Judah. I have not come to fight you, but to fight my enemies, and God has told me to hurry. God is on my side, so don't oppose me, or he will destroy you.” 
2CH.35.22	But Josiah was determined to fight. He refused to listen to what God was saying through King Neco, so he disguised himself and went into battle on the plain of Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	During the battle King Josiah was struck by Egyptian arrows. He ordered his servants, “Take me away; I'm badly hurt!” 
2CH.35.24	They lifted him out of his chariot, placed him in a second chariot which he had there, and took him to Jerusalem. There he died and was buried in the royal tombs. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned his death.
2CH.35.25	The prophet Jeremiah composed a lament for King Josiah. It has become a custom in Israel for the singers, both men and women, to use this song when they mourn for him. The song is found in the collection of laments.
2CH.35.26	Everything that Josiah did—his devotion to the 
2CH.35.27	and his history from beginning to end—is all recorded in 
2CH.36.1	The people of Judah chose Josiah's son Joahaz and anointed him king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. 
2CH.36.3	King Neco of Egypt took him prisoner and made Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold as tribute. 
2CH.36.4	 Neco made Joahaz' brother Eliakim king of Judah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Joahaz was taken to Egypt by Neco.
2CH.36.6	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded Judah, captured Jehoiakim, and took him to Babylonia in chains. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar carried off some of the treasures of the Temple and put them in his palace in Babylon. 
2CH.36.8	Everything that Jehoiakim did, including his disgusting practices and the evil he committed, is recorded in 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eighteen
2CH.36.10	 When spring came, King Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylonia as a prisoner and carried off the treasures of the Temple. Then Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin's uncle
2CH.36.12	He sinned against the 
2CH.36.14	In addition, the leaders of Judah, the priests, and the people followed the sinful example of the nations around them in worshiping idols, and so they defiled the Temple, which the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	But they made fun of God's messengers, ignoring his words and laughing at his prophets, until at last the 
2CH.36.18	The king of Babylonia looted the Temple, the Temple treasury, and the wealth of the king and his officials, and took everything back to Babylon. 
2CH.36.19	 He burned down the Temple and the city, with all its palaces and its wealth, and broke down the city wall. 
2CH.36.20	He took all the survivors to Babylonia, where they served him and his descendants as slaves until the rise of the Persian Empire. 
2CH.36.21	 And so what the 
2CH.36.22	In the first year that Cyrus of Persia was emperor,
EZR.1.3	May God be with all of you who are his people. You are to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of the 
EZR.1.4	If any of his people in exile need help to return, their neighbors are to give them this help. They are to provide them with silver and gold, supplies and pack animals, as well as offerings to present in the Temple of God in Jerusalem.”
EZR.1.5	Then the heads of the clans of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the priests and Levites, and everyone else whose heart God had moved got ready to go and rebuild the 
EZR.1.6	All their neighbors helped them by giving them many things: silver utensils, gold, supplies, pack animals, other valuables, and offerings for the Temple.
EZR.1.7	Emperor Cyrus gave them back the bowls and cups that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had put in the temple of his gods. 
EZR.1.8	He handed them over to Mithredath, chief of the royal treasury, who made an inventory of them for Sheshbazzar, the governor of Judah, 
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	as follows:
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	gold bowls for offerings
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	30
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	silver bowls for offerings
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	1,000

EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	410
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	other utensils
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	1,000
EZR.1.11	In all there were 5,400 gold and silver bowls and other articles which Sheshbazzar took with him when he and the other exiles went from Babylon to Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Many of the exiles left the province of Babylon and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, all to their own hometowns. Their families had been living in exile in Babylonia ever since King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them there as prisoners. 
EZR.2.2	Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.

EZR.2.69	They gave as much as they could for this work, and the total came to 1,030 pounds of gold, 5,740 pounds of silver, and 100 robes for priests.
EZR.3.1	By the seventh month the people of Israel were all settled in their towns. Then they all assembled in Jerusalem, 
EZR.3.2	 and Joshua son of Jehozadak, his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, together with his relatives, rebuilt the altar of the God of Israel, so that they could burn sacrifices on it according to the instructions written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	 Even though
EZR.3.4	 They celebrated the Festival of Shelters according to the regulations; each day they offered the sacrifices required for that day; 
EZR.3.5	 and in addition they offered the regular sacrifices to be burned whole and those to be offered at the New Moon Festival and at all the other regular assemblies at which the 
EZR.3.6	Although the people had not yet started to rebuild the Temple, they began on the first day of the seventh month to burn sacrifices to the 
EZR.3.7	The people gave money to pay the stonemasons and the carpenters and gave food, drink, and olive oil to be sent to the cities of Tyre and Sidon in exchange for cedar trees from Lebanon, which were to be brought by sea to Joppa. All this was done with the permission of Emperor Cyrus of Persia. 
EZR.3.8	So in the second month of the year after they came back to the site of the Temple in Jerusalem, they began work. Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the rest of their people, the priests, and the Levites, in fact all the exiles who had come back to Jerusalem, joined in the work. All the Levites twenty years of age or older were put in charge of the work of rebuilding the Temple. 
EZR.3.9	The Levite Jeshua and his sons and relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons (the clan of Hodaviah

EZR.3.11	Everyone shouted with all their might, praising the 
EZR.3.12	 Many of the older priests, Levites, and heads of clans had seen the first Temple, and as they watched the foundation of this Temple being laid, they cried and wailed. But the others who were there shouted for joy. 
EZR.3.13	No one could distinguish between the joyful shouts and the crying, because the noise they made was so loud that it could be heard for miles.
EZR.4.1	The enemies of the people of Judah and Benjamin heard that those who had returned from exile were rebuilding the Temple of the 
EZR.4.2	 So they went to see Zerubbabel and the heads of the clans and said, “Let us join you in building the Temple. We worship the same God you worship, and we have been offering sacrifices to him ever since Emperor Esarhaddon of Assyria sent us here to live.”
EZR.4.3	Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the heads of the clans told them, “We don't need your help to build a temple for the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people who had been living in the land tried to discourage and frighten the Jews and keep them from building. 
EZR.4.5	They also bribed Persian government officials to work against them. They kept on doing this throughout the reign of Emperor Cyrus and into the reign of Emperor Darius.
EZR.4.7	Again in the reign of Emperor Artaxerxes of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote a letter to the emperor. The letter was written in Aramaic
EZR.4.8	Also Rehum, the governor, and Shimshai, the secretary of the province, wrote the following letter to Emperor Artaxerxes about Jerusalem:
EZR.4.9	“From Rehum, the governor, from Shimshai, secretary of the province, from their associates, the judges, and from all the other officials, who are originally from Erech, Babylon, and Susa in the land of Elam, 
EZR.4.10	together with the other peoples whom the great and powerful Ashurbanipal moved from their homes and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in West-of-Euphrates Province.”
EZR.4.11	This is the text of the letter:
EZR.4.11	“To Emperor Artaxerxes from his servants who live in West-of-Euphrates.
EZR.4.12	“We want Your Majesty to know that the Jews who came here from your other territories have settled in Jerusalem and are rebuilding that evil and rebellious city. They have begun to rebuild the walls and will soon finish them. 
EZR.4.13	Your Majesty, if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the people will stop paying taxes, and your royal revenues will decrease. 
EZR.4.14	Now, because we are under obligation to Your Majesty, we do not want to see this happen, and so we suggest 
EZR.4.15	that you order a search to be made in the records your ancestors kept. If you do, you will discover that this city has always been rebellious and that from ancient times it has given trouble to kings and to rulers of provinces. Its people have always been hard to govern. This is why the city was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	We therefore are convinced that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, Your Majesty will no longer be able to control West-of-Euphrates Province.”
EZR.4.17	The emperor sent this answer:
EZR.4.17	“To Rehum, the governor, to Shimshai, secretary of the province, and to their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of West-of-Euphrates, greetings.
EZR.4.18	“The letter which you sent has been translated and read to me. 
EZR.4.19	I gave orders for an investigation to be made, and it has indeed been found that from ancient times Jerusalem has revolted against royal authority and that it has been full of rebels and troublemakers. 
EZR.4.20	Powerful kings have reigned there and have ruled over the entire province of West-of-Euphrates, collecting taxes and revenue. 
EZR.4.21	Therefore you are to issue orders that those men are to stop rebuilding the city until I give further commands. 
EZR.4.22	Do this at once, so that no more harm may be done to my interests.”
EZR.4.23	As soon as this letter from Emperor Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates, they hurried to Jerusalem and forced the Jews to stop rebuilding the city.
EZR.5.2	 When Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak heard their messages, they began to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, and the two prophets helped them.
EZR.5.3	Almost at once Governor Tattenai of West-of-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and their fellow officials came to Jerusalem and demanded: “Who gave you orders to build this Temple and equip it?” 
EZR.5.4	They
EZR.5.5	But God was watching over the Jewish leaders, and the Persian officials decided to take no action until they could write to Emperor Darius and receive a reply. 
EZR.5.6	This is the report that they sent to the emperor:
EZR.5.7	“To Emperor Darius, may you rule in peace.
EZR.5.8	“Your Majesty should know that we went to the province of Judah and found that the Temple of the great God is being rebuilt with large stone blocks and with wooden beams set in the wall. The work is being done with great care and is moving ahead steadily.
EZR.5.9	“We then asked the leaders of the people to tell us who had given them authority to rebuild the Temple and to equip it. 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names so that we could inform you who the leaders of this work are.
EZR.5.11	“They answered, ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple which was originally built and equipped many years ago by a powerful king of Israel. 
EZR.5.12	 But because our ancestors made the God of Heaven angry, he let them be conquered by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, a king of the Chaldean dynasty. The Temple was destroyed, and the people were taken into exile in Babylonia. 
EZR.5.13	 Then in the first year of the reign of King Cyrus as emperor of Babylonia, Cyrus issued orders for the Temple to be rebuilt. 
EZR.5.14	He restored the gold and silver Temple utensils which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple in Babylon. Emperor Cyrus turned these utensils over to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor of Judah. 
EZR.5.15	The emperor told him to take them and return them to the Temple in Jerusalem, and to rebuild the Temple where it had stood before. 
EZR.5.16	So Sheshbazzar came and laid its foundation; construction has continued from then until the present, but it is still not finished.’
EZR.5.17	“Now, if it please Your Majesty, have a search made in the royal records in Babylon to find whether or not Emperor Cyrus gave orders for this Temple in Jerusalem to be rebuilt, and then inform us what your will is in this matter.”
EZR.6.1	So Emperor Darius issued orders for a search to be made in the royal records that were kept in Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	But it was in the city of Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found, containing the following record:
EZR.6.3	“In the first year of his reign Emperor Cyrus commanded that the Temple in Jerusalem be rebuilt as a place where sacrifices are made and offerings are burned. The Temple is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide. 
EZR.6.4	The walls are to be built with one layer of wood on top of each three layers of stone. All expenses are to be paid by the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	Also the gold and silver utensils which King Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon from the Temple in Jerusalem are to be returned to their proper place in the Jerusalem Temple.”
EZR.6.6	Then Emperor Darius sent the following reply:
EZR.6.6	“To Tattenai, governor of West-of-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and your fellow officials in West-of-Euphrates.
EZR.6.6	“Stay away from the Temple 
EZR.6.7	and do not interfere with its construction. Let the governor of Judah and the Jewish leaders rebuild the Temple of God where it stood before. 
EZR.6.8	I hereby command you to help them rebuild it. Their expenses are to be paid promptly out of the royal funds received from taxes in West-of-Euphrates, so that the work is not interrupted. 
EZR.6.9	Day by day, without fail, you are to give the priests in Jerusalem whatever they tell you they need: young bulls, sheep, or lambs to be burned as offerings to the God of Heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, or olive oil. 
EZR.6.10	This is to be done so that they can offer sacrifices that are acceptable to the God of Heaven and pray for his blessing on me and my sons. 
EZR.6.11	I further command that if any disobey this order, a wooden beam is to be torn out of their houses, sharpened on one end, and then driven through their bodies. And their houses are to be made a rubbish heap. 
EZR.6.12	May the God who chose Jerusalem as the place where he is to be worshiped overthrow any king or nation that defies this command and tries to destroy the Temple there. I, Darius, have commanded. My command is to be fully obeyed.”
EZR.6.13	Then Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their fellow officials did exactly as the emperor had commanded. 
EZR.6.14	 The Jewish leaders made good progress with the building of the Temple, encouraged by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. They completed the Temple as they had been commanded by the God of Israel and by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, emperors of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	They finished the Temple on the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Darius. 
EZR.6.16	Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites, and all the others who had returned from exile—joyfully dedicated the Temple. 
EZR.6.17	For the dedication they offered 100 bulls, 200 sheep, and 400 lambs as sacrifices, and 12 goats as offerings for sin, one for each tribe of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	They also organized the priests and the Levites for the Temple services in Jerusalem, according to the instructions contained in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.20	All the priests and the Levites had purified themselves and were ritually clean. The Levites killed the animals for the Passover sacrifices for all the people who had returned, for the priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	The sacrifices were eaten by all the Israelites who had returned from exile and by all those who had given up the pagan ways of the other people who were living in the land and who had come to worship the 
EZR.6.22	For seven days they joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread. They were full of joy because the 
EZR.7.1	Many years later, when Artaxerxes was emperor of Persia, there was a man named Ezra. He traced his ancestors back to Aaron, the High Priest, as follows: Ezra was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron.
EZR.7.6+EZR.7.7	Ezra was a scholar with a thorough knowledge of the Law which the 
EZR.7.8+EZR.7.9	They left Babylonia on the first day of the first month, and with God's help they arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. 
EZR.7.10	Ezra had devoted his life to studying the Law of the 
EZR.7.11	Emperor Artaxerxes gave the following document to Ezra, the priest and scholar, who had a thorough knowledge of the laws and commands which the 
EZR.7.12	“From Emperor Artaxerxes
EZR.7.13	“I command that throughout my empire all the Israelite people, priests, and Levites that so desire be permitted to go with you to Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.14	I, together with my seven counselors, send you to investigate the conditions in Jerusalem and Judah in order to see how well the Law of your God, which has been entrusted to you, is being obeyed. 
EZR.7.15	You are to take with you the gold and silver offerings which I and my counselors desire to give to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.16	You are also to take all the silver and gold which you collect throughout the province of Babylon and the offerings which the Israelite people and their priests give for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.17	“You are to spend this money carefully and buy bulls, rams, lambs, grain, and wine and offer them on the altar of the Temple in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	You may use the silver and gold that is left over for whatever you and your people desire, in accordance with the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	You are to present to God in Jerusalem all the utensils that have been given to you for use in the Temple services. 
EZR.7.20	And anything else which you need for the Temple, you may get from the royal treasury.
EZR.7.21	“I command all the treasury officials in West-of-Euphrates Province to provide promptly for Ezra, the priest and scholar in the Law of the God of Heaven, everything he asks you for, 
EZR.7.22	up to a limit of 7,500 pounds of silver, 500 bushels of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, 550 gallons of olive oil, and as much salt as needed. 
EZR.7.23	You must be careful to provide everything which the God of Heaven requires for his Temple, and so make sure that he is never angry with me or with those who reign after me. 
EZR.7.24	You are forbidden to collect any taxes from the priests, Levites, musicians, guards, workers, or anyone else connected with this Temple.
EZR.7.25	“You, Ezra, using the wisdom which your God has given you, are to appoint administrators and judges to govern all the people in West-of-Euphrates who live by the Law of your God. You must teach that Law to anyone who does not know it. 
EZR.7.26	If any disobey the laws of your God or the laws of the empire, they are to be punished promptly: by death or by exile or by confiscation of their property or by imprisonment.”
EZR.7.27	Ezra said, “Praise the 
EZR.7.28	By God's grace I have won the favor of the emperor, of his counselors, and of all his powerful officials; the

EZR.8.15	I assembled the entire group by the canal that runs to the town of Ahava, and we camped there three days. I found that there were priests in the group, but no Levites. 
EZR.8.16	I sent for nine of the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, and for two teachers, Joiarib and Elnathan. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo, head of the community at Casiphia, to ask him and his associates, the Temple workers, to send us people to serve God in the Temple. 
EZR.8.18	Through God's grace they sent us Sherebiah, an able man, a Levite from the clan of Mahli; and eighteen of his sons and brothers came with him. 
EZR.8.19	They also sent Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the clan of Merari, with twenty of their relatives. 
EZR.8.20	In addition there were 220 Temple workers whose ancestors had been designated by King David and his officials to assist the Levites. They were all listed by name.
EZR.8.21	There by the Ahava Canal I gave orders for us all to fast and humble ourselves before our God and to ask him to lead us on our journey and protect us and our children and all our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	I would have been ashamed to ask the emperor for a troop of cavalry to guard us from any enemies during our journey, because I had told him that our God blesses everyone who trusts him, but that he is displeased with and punishes anyone who turns away from him. 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and prayed for God to protect us, and he answered our prayers.
EZR.8.24	From among the leading priests I chose Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten others. 
EZR.8.25	Then I weighed out the silver, the gold, and the utensils which the emperor, his advisers and officials, and the people of Israel had given to be used in the Temple, and I gave it to the priests. 
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	This is what I gave them:
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	silver - 25 tons
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	100 silver utensils - 150 pounds
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	gold - 7,500 pounds
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	20 gold bowls - 270 ounces
EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	2 fine bronze bowls, equal in value to gold bowls
EZR.8.28	I said to them, “You are sacred to the 
EZR.8.29	Guard them carefully until you reach the Temple. There in the priests' rooms weigh them and turn them over to the leaders of the priests and of the Levites, and to the leaders of the people of Israel in Jerusalem.” 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the utensils, to take them to the Temple in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	It was on the twelfth day of the first month that we left the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. Our God was with us and protected us from enemy attacks and from ambush as we traveled. 
EZR.8.32	When we reached Jerusalem, we rested three days. 
EZR.8.33	Then on the fourth day we went to the Temple, weighed the silver, the gold, and the utensils, and turned them over to Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah. With him were Eleazar son of Phinehas and two Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	Everything was counted and weighed, and a complete record was made at the same time.
EZR.8.35	All those who had returned from exile then brought offerings to be burned as sacrifices to the God of Israel. They offered 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs; they also offered 12 goats to purify themselves from sin. All these animals were burned as sacrifices to the 
EZR.8.36	They also took the document the emperor had given them and gave it to the governors and officials of West-of-Euphrates Province, who then gave their support to the people and the Temple worship.
EZR.9.1	After all this had been done, some of the leaders of the people of Israel came and told me that the people, the priests, and the Levites had not kept themselves separate from the people in the neighboring countries of Ammon, Moab, and Egypt or from the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Amorites. They were doing the same disgusting things which these people did. 
EZR.9.2	Jewish men were marrying foreign women, and so God's holy people had become contaminated. The leaders and officials were the chief offenders. 
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I tore my clothes in despair, tore my hair and my beard, and sat down crushed with grief. 
EZR.9.4	I sat there grieving until the time for the evening sacrifice to be offered, and people began to gather around me—all those who were frightened because of what the God of Israel had said about the sins of those who had returned from exile.
EZR.9.5	When the time came for the evening sacrifice, I got up from where I had been grieving, and still wearing my torn clothes, I knelt in prayer and stretched out my hands to the 
EZR.9.6	I said, “O God, I am too ashamed to raise my head in your presence. Our sins pile up higher than our heads; they reach as high as the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our ancestors until now, we, your people, have sinned greatly. Because of our sins we, our kings, and our priests have fallen into the hands of foreign kings, and we have been slaughtered, robbed, and carried away as prisoners. We have been totally disgraced, as we still are today. 
EZR.9.8	Now for a short time, O 
EZR.9.9	We were slaves, but you did not leave us in slavery. You made the emperors of Persia favor us and permit us to go on living and to rebuild your Temple, which was in ruins, and to find safety here in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“But now, O God, what can we say after all that has happened? We have again disobeyed the commands 
EZR.9.11	that you gave us through your servants, the prophets. They told us that the land we were going to occupy was an impure land because the people who lived in it filled it from one end to the other with disgusting, filthy actions. 
EZR.9.12	 They told us that we were never to intermarry with those people and never to help them prosper or succeed if we wanted to enjoy the land and pass it on to our descendants forever. 
EZR.9.13	Even after everything that has happened to us in punishment for our sins and wrongs, we know that you, our God, have punished us less than we deserve and have allowed us to survive. 
EZR.9.14	Then how can we ignore your commandments again and intermarry with these wicked people? If we do, you will be so angry that you will destroy us completely and let no one survive. 
EZR.9.15	 God of Israel, you are just, but you have let us survive. We confess our guilt to you; we have no right to come into your presence.”
EZR.10.1	While Ezra was bowing in prayer in front of the Temple, weeping and confessing these sins, a large group of Israelites—men, women, and children—gathered around him, weeping bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the clan of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have broken faith with God by marrying foreign women, but even so there is still hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	Now we must make a solemn promise to our God that we will send these women and their children away. We will do what you and the others who honor God's commands advise us to do. We will do what God's Law demands. 
EZR.10.4	It is your responsibility to act. We are behind you, so go ahead and get it done.”
EZR.10.5	So Ezra began by making the leaders of the priests, of the Levites, and of the rest of the people take an oath that they would do what Shecaniah had proposed. 
EZR.10.6	Then he went from in front of the Temple into the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, and spent the night
EZR.10.7	A message was sent throughout Jerusalem and Judah that all those who had returned from exile were to meet in Jerusalem 
EZR.10.8	by order of the leaders of the people. If any failed to come within three days, all their property would be confiscated, and they would lose their right to be members of the community. 
EZR.10.9	Within the three days, on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the men living in the territory of Judah and Benjamin came to Jerusalem and assembled in the Temple square. It was raining hard, and because of the weather and the importance of the meeting everyone was trembling.
EZR.10.10	Ezra the priest stood up and spoke to them. He said, “You have been faithless and have brought guilt on Israel by marrying foreign women. 
EZR.10.11	Now then, confess your sins to the 
EZR.10.12	The people shouted in answer, “We will do whatever you say.” 
EZR.10.13	But they added, “The crowd is too big, and it's raining hard. We can't stand here in the open like this. This isn't something that can be done in one or two days, because so many of us are involved in this sin. 
EZR.10.14	Let our officials stay in Jerusalem and take charge of the matter. Then let anyone who has a foreign wife come at a set time, together with the leaders and the judges of his city. In this way God's anger over this situation will be turned away.” 
EZR.10.15	No one was opposed to the plan except Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, who had the support of Meshullam and of Shabbethai, a Levite.
EZR.10.16	The returned exiles accepted the plan, so Ezra the priest appointed
EZR.10.17	and within the next three months they investigated all the cases of men with foreign wives.
EZR.10.18	This is the list of the men who had foreign wives:
EZR.10.18	Clan of Joshua and his brothers, sons of Jehozadak: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	They promised to divorce their wives, and they offered a ram as a sacrifice for their sins.
EZR.10.20	Clan of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah
EZR.10.21	Clan of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah
EZR.10.22	Clan of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah
EZR.10.23	Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also called Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer
EZR.10.24	Eliashib
EZR.10.24	Shallum, Telem, and Uri
EZR.10.25	Clan of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah
EZR.10.26	Clan of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah
EZR.10.27	Clan of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza
EZR.10.28	Clan of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai
EZR.10.29	Clan of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth
EZR.10.30	Clan of Pahath Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh
EZR.10.31+EZR.10.32	Clan of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah
EZR.10.33	Clan of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei
EZR.10.34+EZR.10.35+EZR.10.36+EZR.10.37	Clan of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu
EZR.10.38+EZR.10.39+EZR.10.40+EZR.10.41+EZR.10.42	Clan of Binnui: Shimei, Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph
EZR.10.43	Clan of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah
EZR.10.44	All these men had foreign wives. They divorced them and sent them and their children away.
NEH.1.1	This is the account of what Nehemiah son of Hacaliah accomplished.
NEH.1.1	In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor of Persia, I, Nehemiah, was in Susa, the capital city. 
NEH.1.2	Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived from Judah with another group, and I asked them about Jerusalem and about the other Jews who had returned from exile in
NEH.1.3	They told me that those who had survived and were back in the homeland
NEH.1.4	When I heard all this, I sat down and wept.
NEH.1.4	For several days I mourned and did not eat. I prayed to God, 
NEH.1.5	“
NEH.1.6	Look at me, 
NEH.1.7	We have acted wickedly against you and have not done what you commanded. We have not kept the laws which you gave us through Moses, your servant. 
NEH.1.8	 Remember now what you told Moses: ‘If you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you among the other nations. 
NEH.1.9	 But then if you turn back to me and do what I have commanded you, I will bring you back to the place where I have chosen to be worshiped, even though you are scattered to the ends of the earth.’
NEH.1.10	“Lord, these are your servants, your own people. You rescued them by your great power and strength. 
NEH.1.11	Listen now to my prayer and to the prayers of all your other servants who want to honor you. Give me success today and make the emperor merciful to me.”
NEH.1.11	In those days I was the emperor's wine steward.
NEH.2.1	One day four months later, when Emperor Artaxerxes was dining, I took the wine to him. He had never seen me look sad before, 
NEH.2.2	so he asked, “Why are you looking so sad? You aren't sick, so it must be that you're unhappy.”
NEH.2.2	I was startled 
NEH.2.3	 and answered, “May Your Majesty live forever! How can I keep from looking sad when the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
NEH.2.4	The emperor asked, “What is it that you want?”
NEH.2.4	I prayed to the God of Heaven, 
NEH.2.5	and then I said to the emperor, “If Your Majesty is pleased with me and is willing to grant my request, let me go to the land of Judah, to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I can rebuild the city.”
NEH.2.6	The emperor, with the empress sitting at his side, approved my request. He asked me how long I would be gone and when I would return, and I told him.
NEH.2.7	Then I asked him to grant me the favor of giving me letters to the governors of West-of-Euphrates Province,
NEH.2.8	I asked also for a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, instructing him to supply me with timber for the gates of the fort that guards the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house I was to live in. The emperor gave me all I asked for, because God was with me.
NEH.2.9	The emperor sent some army officers and a troop of cavalry with me, and I made the journey to West-of-Euphrates. There I gave the emperor's letters to the governors. 
NEH.2.10	But Sanballat, from the town of Beth Horon, and Tobiah, an official in the province of Ammon, heard that someone had come to work for the good of the people of Israel, and they were highly indignant.
NEH.2.11	I went on to Jerusalem, and for three days 
NEH.2.12	I did not tell anyone what God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. Then in the middle of the night I got up and went out, taking a few of my companions with me. The only animal we took was the donkey that I rode on. 
NEH.2.13	It was still night as I left the city through the Valley Gate on the west and went south past Dragon's Fountain to the Rubbish Gate. As I went, I inspected the broken walls of the city and the gates that had been destroyed by fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then on the east side of the city I went north to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool. The donkey I was riding could not find any path through the rubble, 
NEH.2.15	so I went down into Kidron Valley and rode along, looking at the wall. Then I returned the way I had come and went back into the city through the Valley Gate.
NEH.2.16	None of the local officials knew where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had not said anything to any of the other Jews—the priests, the leaders, the officials, or anyone else who would be taking part in the work. 
NEH.2.17	But now I said to them, “See what trouble we are in because Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates are destroyed! Let's rebuild the city walls and put an end to our disgrace.” 
NEH.2.18	And I told them how God had been with me and helped me, and what the emperor had said to me.
NEH.2.18	They responded, “Let's start rebuilding!” And they got ready to start the work.
NEH.2.19	When Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arab named Geshem heard what we were planning to do, they laughed at us and said, “What do you think you're doing? Are you going to rebel against the emperor?”
NEH.2.20	I answered, “The God of Heaven will give us success. We are his servants, and we are going to start building. But you have no right to any property in Jerusalem, and you have no share in its traditions.”
NEH.3.1	This is how the city wall was rebuilt.
NEH.3.2	The men of Jericho built the next section.
NEH.3.2	Zaccur son of Imri built the next section.
NEH.3.3	The clan of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They put the beams and the gates in place, and put in the bolts and bars for locking the gate.

NEH.3.6	Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah rebuilt Jeshanah Gate.
NEH.3.7	Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah built the next section, as far as the residence of the governor of West-of-Euphrates.

NEH.3.12	Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of the other half of the Jerusalem District, built the next section. (His daughters helped with the work.)
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of the city of Zanoah rebuilt the Valley Gate. They put the gates in place, put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate, and repaired the wall for fifteen hundred feet, as far as the Rubbish Gate.
NEH.3.14	Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the Beth Haccherem District, rebuilt the Rubbish Gate. He put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate.
NEH.3.15	Shallum son of Colhozeh, ruler of the Mizpah District, rebuilt the Fountain Gate. He covered the gateway, put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars. At the Pool of Shelah he built the wall next to the royal garden, as far as the stairs leading down from David's City.
NEH.3.16	Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half of the Bethzur District, built the next section, as far as David's tomb, the pool, and the barracks.
NEH.3.17	The following Levites rebuilt the next several sections of the wall:
NEH.3.17	Rehum son of Bani built the next section;
NEH.3.17	Hashabiah, ruler of half of the Keilah District, built the next section on behalf of his district;
NEH.3.18	Bavvai son of Henadad, ruler of the other half of the Keilah District, built the next section;
NEH.3.19	Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, built the next section in front of the armory, as far as the place where the wall turns;
NEH.3.20	Baruch son of Zabbai built the next section, as far as the entrance to the house of the High Priest Eliashib;
NEH.3.21	Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built the next section, up to the far end of Eliashib's house.
NEH.3.22	The following priests rebuilt the next several sections of the wall:
NEH.3.22	Priests from the area around Jerusalem built the next section;
NEH.3.23	Benjamin and Hasshub built the next section, which was in front of their houses;
NEH.3.23	Azariah, the son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah, built the next section, which was in front of his house;
NEH.3.24	Binnui son of Henadad built the next section, from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall;
NEH.3.25+NEH.3.26	Palal son of Uzai built the next section, beginning at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard;
NEH.3.25+NEH.3.26	Pedaiah son of Parosh built the next section, to a point on the east near the Water Gate and the tower guarding the Temple. (This was near that part of the city called Ophel, where the Temple workers lived.)
NEH.3.27	The men of Tekoa built the next section, their second one, from a point opposite the large tower guarding the Temple as far as the wall near Ophel.
NEH.3.28	A group of priests built the next section, going north from the Horse Gate, each one building in front of his own house.
NEH.3.29	Zadok son of Immer built the next section, which was in front of his house.
NEH.3.29	Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, keeper of the East Gate, built the next section.
NEH.3.30	Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, built the next section, their second one.
NEH.3.30	Meshullam son of Berechiah built the next section, which was in front of his house.
NEH.3.31	Malchijah, a goldsmith, built the next section, as far as the building used by the Temple workers and the merchants, which was by the Miphkad
NEH.3.32	The goldsmiths and the merchants built the last section, from the room at the corner as far as the Sheep Gate.
NEH.4.1	When Sanballat heard that we Jews had begun rebuilding the wall, he became furious and began to ridicule us. 
NEH.4.2	In front of his companions and the Samaritan troops he said, “What do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Do they intend to rebuild the city? Do they think that by offering sacrifices they can finish the work in one day? Can they make building stones out of heaps of burnt rubble?”
NEH.4.3	Tobiah was standing there beside him, and he added, “What kind of wall could they ever build? Even a fox could knock it down!”
NEH.4.4	I prayed, “Hear how they make fun of us, O God! Let their ridicule fall on their own heads. Let them be robbed of everything they have, and let them be taken as prisoners to a foreign land. 
NEH.4.5	Don't forgive the evil they do and don't forget their sins, for they have insulted us who are building.”
NEH.4.6	So we went on rebuilding the wall, and soon it was half its full height, because the people were eager to work.
NEH.4.7	Sanballat, Tobiah, and the people of Arabia, Ammon, and Ashdod heard that we were making progress in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem and that the gaps in the wall were being closed, and they became very angry. 
NEH.4.8	So they all plotted together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion, 
NEH.4.9	but we prayed to our God and kept men on guard against them day and night.
NEH.4.10	The people of Judah had a song they sang:
NEH.4.10	“We grow weak carrying burdens;
NEH.4.10	There's so much rubble to take away.
NEH.4.10	How can we build the wall today?”
NEH.4.11	Our enemies thought we would not see them or know what was happening until they were already upon us, killing us and putting an end to our work. 
NEH.4.12	But time after time Jews who were living among our enemies came to warn us of the plans our enemies were making against us.
NEH.4.13	So I armed the people with swords, spears, and bows, and stationed them by clans behind the wall, wherever it was still unfinished.
NEH.4.14	I saw that the people were worried, so I said to them and to their leaders and officials, “Don't be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and terrifying the Lord is, and fight for your relatives, your children, your wives, and your homes.” 
NEH.4.15	Our enemies heard that we had found out what they were plotting, and they realized that God had defeated their plans. Then all of us went back to rebuilding the wall.
NEH.4.16	From then on half of my men worked and half stood guard, wearing coats of armor and armed with spears, shields, and bows. And our leaders gave their full support to the people 
NEH.4.17	who were rebuilding the wall. Even those who carried building materials worked with one hand and kept a weapon in the other, 
NEH.4.18	and everyone who was building kept a sword strapped to their waist. The man who was to sound the alarm on the bugle stayed with me. 
NEH.4.19	I told the people and their officials and leaders, “The work is spread out over such a distance that we are widely separated from one another on the wall. 
NEH.4.20	If you hear the bugle, gather around me. Our God will fight for us.” 
NEH.4.21	So every day, from dawn until the stars came out at night, half of us worked on the wall, while the other half stood guard with spears.
NEH.4.22	During this time I told the men in charge that they and all their helpers had to stay in Jerusalem at night, so that we could guard the city at night as well as work in the daytime. 
NEH.4.23	I didn't take off my clothes even at night, neither did any of my companions nor my servants nor my bodyguards. And we all kept our weapons at hand.
NEH.5.1	Some time later many of the people, both men and women, began to complain against the other Jews. 
NEH.5.2	Some said, “We have large families, we need grain to keep us alive.”
NEH.5.3	Others said, “We have had to mortgage our fields and vineyards and houses to get enough grain to keep us from starving.”
NEH.5.4	Still others said, “We had to borrow money to pay the royal tax on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	We are of the same race as the other Jews. Aren't our children just as good as theirs? But we have to make slaves of our children. Some of our daughters have already been sold as slaves. We are helpless because our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us.”
NEH.5.6	When I heard their complaints, I grew angry 
NEH.5.7	 and decided to act. I denounced the leaders and officials of the people and told them, “You are oppressing your own relatives!”
NEH.5.7	I called a public assembly to deal with the problem 
NEH.5.8	and said, “As far as we have been able, we have been buying back our Jewish relatives who had to sell themselves to foreigners. Now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their own people!” The leaders were silent and could find nothing to say.
NEH.5.9	Then I said, “What you are doing is wrong! You ought to obey God and do what's right. Then you would not give our enemies, the Gentiles, any reason to ridicule us. 
NEH.5.10	I have let the people borrow money and grain from me, and so have my companions and those who work for me. Now let's give up all our claims to repayment. 
NEH.5.11	Cancel all the debts
NEH.5.12	The leaders replied, “We'll do as you say. We'll give the property back and not try to collect the debts.”
NEH.5.12	I called in the priests and made the leaders swear in front of them to keep the promise they had just made. 
NEH.5.13	Then I took off the sash
NEH.5.13	Everyone who was present said, “Amen!” and praised the 
NEH.5.14	During all the twelve years that I was governor of the land of Judah, from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor until his thirty-second year, neither my relatives nor I ate the food I was entitled to have as governor. 
NEH.5.15	Every governor who had been in office before me had been a burden to the people and had demanded forty silver coins a day
NEH.5.16	I put all my energy into rebuilding the wall and did not acquire any property. Everyone who worked for me joined in the rebuilding. 
NEH.5.17	I regularly fed at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jewish people and their leaders, besides all the people who came to me from the surrounding nations. 
NEH.5.18	Every day I served one beef, six of the best sheep, and many chickens, and every ten days I provided a fresh supply of wine. But I knew what heavy burdens the people had to bear, and so I did not claim the allowance that the governor is entitled to.
NEH.5.19	I pray you, O God, remember to my credit everything that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and the rest of our enemies heard that we had finished building the wall and that there were no gaps left in it, although we still had not set up the gates in the gateways. 
NEH.6.2	So Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, suggesting that I meet with them in one of the villages in the Plain of Ono. This was a trick of theirs to try to harm me. 
NEH.6.3	I sent messengers to say to them, “I am doing important work and can't go down there. I am not going to let the work stop just to go and see you.”
NEH.6.4	They sent me the same message four times, and each time I sent them the same reply.
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent one of his servants to me with a fifth message, this one in the form of an unsealed letter.
NEH.6.6	It read:
NEH.6.6	“Geshem tells me that a rumor is going around among the neighboring peoples that you and the Jewish people intend to revolt and that this is why you are rebuilding the wall. He also says you plan to make yourself king 
NEH.6.7	and that you have arranged for some prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that you are the king of Judah. His Majesty is certain to hear about this, so I suggest that you and I meet to talk the situation over.”
NEH.6.8	I sent a reply to him: “Nothing of what you are saying is true. You have made it all up yourself.”
NEH.6.9	They were trying to frighten us into stopping work. I prayed, “But now, God, make me strong!”
NEH.6.10	About this time I went to visit Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was unable to leave his house. He said to me, “You and I must go and hide together in the Holy Place of the Temple and lock the doors, because they are coming to kill you. Any night now they will come to kill you.”
NEH.6.11	I answered, “I'm not the kind of person that runs and hides. Do you think I would try to save my life by hiding in the Temple? I won't do it.”
NEH.6.12	When I thought it over, I realized that God had not spoken to Shemaiah, but that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him to give me this warning. 
NEH.6.13	They hired him to frighten me into sinning, so that they could ruin my reputation and humiliate me.
NEH.6.14	I prayed, “God, remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done and punish them. Remember that woman Noadiah and all the other prophets who tried to frighten me.”
NEH.6.15	After fifty-two days of work the entire wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul. 
NEH.6.16	When our enemies in the surrounding nations heard this, they realized that they had lost face, since everyone knew that the work had been done with God's help.
NEH.6.17	During all this time the Jewish leaders had been in correspondence with Tobiah. 
NEH.6.18	Many people in Judah were on his side because of his Jewish father-in-law, Shecaniah son of Arah. In addition, his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 
NEH.6.19	People would talk in front of me about all the good deeds Tobiah had done and would tell him everything I said. And he kept sending me letters to try to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	And now the wall had been rebuilt, the gates had all been put in place, and the Temple guards, the members of the sacred choir, and the other Levites had been assigned their work. 
NEH.7.2	I put two men in charge of governing the city of Jerusalem: my brother Hanani and Hananiah, commanding officer of the fortress. Hananiah was a reliable and God-fearing man without equal. 
NEH.7.3	I told them not to have the gates of Jerusalem opened in the morning until well after sunrise and to have them closed and barred before the guards went off duty at sunset. I also told them to appoint guards from among the people who lived in Jerusalem and to assign some of them to specific posts and others to patrol the area around their own houses.
NEH.7.4	Jerusalem was a large city, but not many people were living in it, and not many houses had been built yet. 
NEH.7.5	God inspired me to assemble the people and their leaders and officials and to check their family records. I located the records of those who had first returned from captivity, and this is the information I found:
NEH.7.6	Many of the exiles left the province of Babylon and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own hometown. Their families had been living in exile in Babylonia ever since King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them there as prisoners. 
NEH.7.7	Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.
NEH.7.8+NEH.7.9+NEH.7.10+NEH.7.11+NEH.7.12+NEH.7.13+NEH.7.14+NEH.7.15+NEH.7.16+NEH.7.17+NEH.7.18+NEH.7.19+NEH.7.20+NEH.7.21+NEH.7.22+NEH.7.23+NEH.7.24+NEH.7.25	This is the list of the clans of Israel, with the number of those from each clan who returned from exile:

NEH.8.1	By the seventh month the people of Israel were all settled in their towns. On the first day of that month they all assembled in Jerusalem, in the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law which the 
NEH.8.2	So Ezra brought it to the place where the people had gathered—men, women, and the children who were old enough to understand. 
NEH.8.3	There in the square by the gate he read the Law to them from dawn until noon, and they all listened attentively.
NEH.8.4	Ezra was standing on a wooden platform that had been built for the occasion. The following men stood at his right: Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and the following stood at his left: Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
NEH.8.5	As Ezra stood there on the platform high above the people, they all kept their eyes fixed on him. As soon as he opened the book, they all stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra said, “Praise the 
NEH.8.6	All the people raised their arms in the air and answered, “Amen! Amen!” They knelt in worship, with their faces to the ground.
NEH.8.7	Then they rose and stood in their places, and the following Levites explained the Law to them: Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah. 
NEH.8.8	They gave an oral translation
NEH.8.9	When the people heard what the Law required, they were so moved that they began to cry. So Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law, and the Levites who were explaining the Law told all the people, “This day is holy to the

NEH.8.11	The Levites went around calming the people and telling them not to be sad on such a holy day. 
NEH.8.12	So all the people went home and ate and drank joyfully and shared what they had with others, because they understood what had been read to them.
NEH.8.13	The next day the heads of the clans, together with the priests and the Levites, went to Ezra to study the teachings of the Law. 
NEH.8.14	 They discovered that the Law, which the

NEH.8.16	So the people got branches and built shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their yards, in the Temple courtyard, and in the public squares by the Water Gate and by the Ephraim Gate. 
NEH.8.17	All the people who had come back from captivity built shelters and lived in them. This was the first time it had been done since the days of Joshua son of Nun, and everybody was excited and happy. 
NEH.8.18	From the first day of the festival to the last they read a part of God's Law every day. They celebrated for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a closing ceremony, as required in the Law.
NEH.9.1+NEH.9.2	On the twenty-fourth day of the same month the people of Israel gathered to fast in order to show sorrow for their sins. They had already separated themselves from all foreigners. They wore sackcloth and put dust on their heads as signs of grief. Then they stood and began to confess the sins that they and their ancestors had committed. 
NEH.9.3	For about three hours the Law of the 
NEH.9.4	There was a platform for the Levites, and on it stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani. They prayed aloud to the 
NEH.9.5	The following Levites gave a call to worship: Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah. They said:
NEH.9.5	“Stand up and praise the 
NEH.9.5	praise him forever and ever!
NEH.9.5	Let everyone praise his glorious name,
NEH.9.5	although no human praise is great enough.”
NEH.9.6	And then the people of Israel prayed this prayer:
NEH.9.6	“You, 
NEH.9.6	you made the heavens and the stars of the sky.
NEH.9.6	You made land and sea and everything in them;
NEH.9.6	you gave life to all.
NEH.9.6	The heavenly powers bow down and worship you.
NEH.9.7	and led him out of Ur in Babylonia;
NEH.9.7	you changed his name to Abraham.
NEH.9.8	and you made a covenant with him.
NEH.9.8	You promised to give him the land of the Canaanites,
NEH.9.8	the land of the Hittites and the Amorites,
NEH.9.8	the land of the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Girgashites,
NEH.9.8	to be a land where his descendants would live.
NEH.9.8	You kept your promise, because you are faithful.
NEH.9.9	you heard their call for help at the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	against his officials and the people of his land,
NEH.9.10	because you knew how they oppressed your people.
NEH.9.10	You won then the fame you still have today.
NEH.9.11	and led them through on dry ground.
NEH.9.11	Those who pursued them drowned in deep water,
NEH.9.11	as a stone sinks in the raging sea.
NEH.9.12	and at night you lighted their way with fire.
NEH.9.13	you spoke to your people
NEH.9.13	and gave them good laws and sound teachings.
NEH.9.14	You taught them to keep your Sabbaths holy,
NEH.9.14	and through your servant Moses you gave them your laws.
NEH.9.15	and water from a rock when they were thirsty.
NEH.9.15	You told them to take control of the land
NEH.9.15	which you had promised to give them.
NEH.9.16	and refused to obey your commands.
NEH.9.17	they forgot the miracles you had performed.
NEH.9.17	In their pride they chose a leader
NEH.9.17	to take them back to slavery in Egypt.
NEH.9.17	But you are a God who forgives;
NEH.9.17	you are gracious and loving, slow to be angry.
NEH.9.17	Your mercy is great; you did not forsake them.
NEH.9.18	and said it was the god who led them from Egypt!
NEH.9.18	How much they insulted you, 
NEH.9.19	for your mercy is great.
NEH.9.19	You did not take away the cloud or the fire
NEH.9.19	that showed them the path by day and night.
NEH.9.20	In your goodness you told them what they should do;
NEH.9.20	you fed them manna and gave them water to drink.
NEH.9.21	Through forty years in the desert
NEH.9.21	you provided all that they needed;
NEH.9.21	their clothing never wore out,
NEH.9.21	and their feet were not swollen with pain.
NEH.9.22	lands that bordered their own.
NEH.9.22	They conquered the land of Heshbon, where Sihon ruled,
NEH.9.22	and the land of Bashan, where Og was king.
NEH.9.23	and let them conquer and live in the land
NEH.9.23	that you had promised their ancestors to give them.
NEH.9.24	you overcame the people living there.
NEH.9.24	You gave your people the power to do as they pleased
NEH.9.24	with the people and kings of Canaan.
NEH.9.25	fertile land, houses full of wealth,
NEH.9.25	cisterns already dug,
NEH.9.25	olive trees, fruit trees, and vineyards.
NEH.9.25	They ate all they wanted and grew fat;
NEH.9.25	they enjoyed all the good things you gave them.
NEH.9.26	they turned their backs on your Law.
NEH.9.26	They killed the prophets who warned them,
NEH.9.26	who told them to turn back to you.
NEH.9.26	They insulted you time after time,
NEH.9.27	so you let their enemies conquer and rule them.
NEH.9.27	In their trouble they called to you for help,
NEH.9.27	and you answered them from heaven.
NEH.9.27	In your great mercy you sent them leaders
NEH.9.27	who rescued them from their foes.
NEH.9.28	When peace returned, they sinned again,
NEH.9.28	and again you let their enemies conquer them.
NEH.9.28	Yet when they repented and asked you to save them,
NEH.9.28	in heaven you heard, and time after time
NEH.9.28	you rescued them in your great mercy.
NEH.9.29	but in pride they rejected your laws,
NEH.9.29	although keeping your Law is the way to life.
NEH.9.29	Hard-headed and stubborn, they refused to obey.
NEH.9.30	You inspired your prophets to speak,
NEH.9.30	but your people were deaf,
NEH.9.30	so you let them be conquered by other nations.
NEH.9.31	And yet, because your mercy is great,
NEH.9.31	you did not forsake or destroy them.
NEH.9.31	You are a gracious and merciful God!
NEH.9.32	How terrifying, how powerful!
NEH.9.32	You faithfully keep your covenant promises.
NEH.9.32	From the time when Assyrian kings oppressed us,
NEH.9.32	even till now, how much we have suffered!
NEH.9.32	Our kings, our leaders, our priests and prophets,
NEH.9.32	our ancestors, and all our people have suffered.
NEH.9.32	Remember how much we have suffered!
NEH.9.33	You have done right to punish us;
NEH.9.33	you have been faithful, even though we have sinned.
NEH.9.34	Our ancestors, our kings, leaders, and priests
NEH.9.34	have not kept your Law.
NEH.9.34	They did not listen to your commands and warnings.
NEH.9.35	With your blessing, kings ruled your people
NEH.9.35	when they lived in the broad, fertile land you gave them;
NEH.9.35	but they failed to turn from sin and serve you.
NEH.9.36	And now we are slaves in the land that you gave us,
NEH.9.36	this fertile land which gives us food.
NEH.9.37	What the land produces goes to the kings

NEH.12.22	A record was kept of the heads of the Levite families and of the priestly families during the lifetimes of the following High Priests: Eliashib, Joiada, Jonathan, and Jaddua. This record was finished when Darius was emperor of Persia.
NEH.12.23	The heads of the Levite families, however, were recorded in the official records only until the time of Jonathan, the grandson of Eliashib.
NEH.12.24	Under the direction of Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui,
NEH.12.25	The following Temple guards were in charge of guarding the storerooms by the gates to the Temple: Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub.
NEH.12.26	These people lived during the time of Joiakim, the son of Joshua and grandson of Jehozadak, and the time of Nehemiah the governor, and the time of Ezra, the priest who was a scholar of the Law.
NEH.12.27	When the city wall of Jerusalem was dedicated, the Levites were brought in from wherever they were living, so that they could join in celebrating the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals and harps. 
NEH.12.28	The Levite families of singers gathered from the area where they had settled around Jerusalem and from the towns around Netophah, 
NEH.12.29	and from Bethgilgal, Geba, and Azmaveth. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and the Levites performed ritual purification for themselves, the people, the gates, and the city wall.
NEH.12.31	I assembled the leaders of Judah on top of the wall and put them in charge of two large groups to march around the city, giving thanks to God.
NEH.12.31	The first group went to the right on top of the wall toward the Rubbish Gate.
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah marched behind the singers, followed by half the leaders of Judah. 
NEH.12.33+NEH.12.34+NEH.12.35	The following priests, blowing trumpets, marched next: Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. Next came Zechariah, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Shemaiah. (His ancestors also included Mattaniah, Micaiah, and Zaccur, of the clan of Asaph.) 
NEH.12.36	He was followed by other members of his clan—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani—all of whom carried musical instruments of the kind played by King David, the man of God. Ezra the scholar led this group in the procession. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they went up the steps that led to David's City, past David's palace, and back to the wall at the Water Gate, on the east side of the city.
NEH.12.38	The other group of those who gave thanks went to the left along the top of the wall, and I followed with half of the people. We marched past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	and from there we went past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate,
NEH.12.40	So both the groups that were giving thanks to God reached the Temple area.
NEH.12.40	In addition to the leaders who were with me, 
NEH.12.41	my group included the following priests, blowing trumpets: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah; 
NEH.12.42	and they were followed by Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers, led by Jezrahiah, sang at the top of their voices.
NEH.12.43	That day many sacrifices were offered, and the people were full of joy because God had made them very happy. The women and the children joined in the celebration, and the noise they all made could be heard for miles.
NEH.12.44	At that time men were put in charge of the storerooms where contributions for the Temple were kept, including the tithes and the first grain and fruit that ripened each year. These men were responsible for collecting from the farms near the various cities the contributions for the priests and the Levites which the Law required. All the people of Judah were pleased with the priests and the Levites, 
NEH.12.45	 because they performed the ceremonies of purification and the other rituals that God had commanded. The Temple musicians and the Temple guards also performed their duties in accordance with the regulations made by King David and his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	From the time of King David and the musician Asaph long ago, the musicians have led songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	In the time of Zerubbabel and also in the time of Nehemiah, all the people of Israel gave daily gifts for the support of the Temple musicians and the Temple guards. The people gave a sacred offering to the Levites, and the Levites gave the required portion to the priests.
NEH.13.2	 This was because the people of Ammon and Moab did not give food and water to the Israelites on their way out of Egypt. Instead, they paid money to Balaam to curse Israel, but our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	When the people of Israel heard this law read, they excluded all foreigners from the community.
NEH.13.4	The priest Eliashib, who was in charge of the Temple storerooms, had for a long time been on good terms with Tobiah. 
NEH.13.5	He allowed Tobiah to use a large room that was intended only for storing offerings of grain and incense, the equipment used in the Temple, the offerings for the priests, and the tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil given to the Levites, to the Temple musicians, and to the Temple guards. 
NEH.13.6	While this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes
NEH.13.7	and returned to Jerusalem. There I was shocked to find that Eliashib had allowed Tobiah to use a room in the Temple. 
NEH.13.8	I was furious and threw out all of Tobiah's belongings. 
NEH.13.9	I gave orders for the rooms to be ritually purified and for the Temple equipment, grain offerings, and incense to be put back.
NEH.13.11	I reprimanded the officials for letting the Temple be neglected. And I brought the Levites and musicians back to the Temple and put them to work again. 
NEH.13.12	 Then all the people of Israel again started bringing to the Temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil. 
NEH.13.13	I put the following men in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, a priest; Zadok, a scholar of the Law; and Pedaiah, a Levite. Hanan, the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, was to be their assistant. I knew I could trust these men to be honest in distributing the supplies to the other workers.
NEH.13.14	Remember, my God, all these things that I have done for your Temple and its worship.
NEH.13.16	Some people from the city of Tyre were living in Jerusalem, and they brought fish and all kinds of goods into the city to sell to our people on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.17	I reprimanded the Jewish leaders and told them, “Look at the evil you're doing! You're making the Sabbath unholy. 
NEH.13.18	This is exactly why God punished your ancestors when he brought destruction on this city. And yet you insist on bringing more of God's anger down on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	So I gave orders for the city gates to be shut at the beginning of every Sabbath, as soon as evening
NEH.13.20	Once or twice merchants who sold all kinds of goods spent Friday night outside the city walls. 
NEH.13.21	I warned them, “It's no use waiting out there for morning to come. If you try this again, I'll use force on you.” From then on they did not come back on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to go and guard the gates to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy.
NEH.13.22	Remember me, O God, for this also, and spare me because of your great love.
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or some other language and didn't know how to speak our language. 
NEH.13.25	I reprimanded the men, called down curses on them, beat them, and pulled out their hair. Then I made them take an oath in God's name that never again would they or their children intermarry with foreigners. 
NEH.13.26	 I told them, “It was foreign women that made King Solomon sin. Here was a man who was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him and made him king over all of Israel, and yet he fell into this sin. 
NEH.13.27	Are we then to follow your example and disobey our God by marrying foreign women?”
NEH.13.29	Remember, God, how those people defiled both the office of priest and the covenant you made with the priests and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	I purified the people from everything foreign; I prepared regulations for the priests and the Levites so that all of them would know their duties; 
NEH.13.31	I arranged for the wood used for burning the offerings to be brought at the proper times, and for the people to bring their offerings of the first grain and the first fruits that ripened.
NEH.13.31	Remember all this, O God, and give me credit for it.
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his officials and administrators. The armies of Persia and Media were present, as well as the governors and noblemen of the provinces. 
EST.1.4	For six whole months he made a show of the riches of the imperial court with all its splendor and majesty.
EST.1.5	After that, the king gave a banquet for all the people in the capital city of Susa, rich and poor alike. It lasted a whole week and was held in the gardens of the royal palace. 
EST.1.6	The courtyard there was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains, tied by cords of fine purple linen to silver rings on marble columns. Couches made of gold and silver had been placed in the courtyard, which was paved with white marble, red feldspar, shining mother-of-pearl, and blue turquoise. 
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in gold cups, no two of them alike, and the king was generous with the royal wine. 
EST.1.8	There were no limits on the drinks; the king had given orders to the palace servants that everyone could have as much as they wanted.
EST.1.9	Meanwhile, inside the royal palace Queen Vashti was giving a banquet for the women.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day of his banquet the king was drinking and feeling happy, so he called in the seven eunuchs who were his personal servants, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas. 
EST.1.11	He ordered them to bring in Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown. The queen was a beautiful woman, and the king wanted to show off her beauty to the officials and all his guests. 
EST.1.12	But when the servants told Queen Vashti of the king's command, she refused to come. This made the king furious.
EST.1.13	Now it was the king's custom to ask for expert opinion on questions of law and order, so he called for his advisers, who would know what should be done. 
EST.1.14	Those he most often turned to for advice were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—seven officials of Persia and Media who held the highest offices in the kingdom. 
EST.1.15	He said to these men, “I, King Xerxes, sent my servants to Queen Vashti with a command, and she refused to obey it! What does the law say that we should do with her?”
EST.1.16	Then Memucan declared to the king and his officials: “Queen Vashti has insulted not only the king but also his officials—in fact, every man in the empire! 
EST.1.17	Every woman in the empire will start looking down on her husband as soon as she hears what the queen has done. They'll say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to come to him, and she refused.’ 
EST.1.18	When the wives of the royal officials of Persia and Media hear about the queen's behavior, they will be telling their husbands about it before the day is out. Wives everywhere will have no respect for their husbands, and husbands will be angry with their wives. 
EST.1.19	If it please Your Majesty, issue a royal proclamation that Vashti may never again appear before the king. Have it written into the laws of Persia and Media, so that it can never be changed. Then give her place as queen to some better woman. 
EST.1.20	When your proclamation is made known all over this huge empire, every woman will treat her husband with proper respect, whether he's rich or poor.”
EST.1.21	The king and his officials liked this idea, and the king did what Memucan suggested. 
EST.1.22	To each of the royal provinces he sent a message in the language and the system of writing of that province, saying
EST.2.1	Later, even after the king's anger had cooled down, he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and about his proclamation against her. 
EST.2.2	So some of the king's advisers who were close to him suggested, “Why don't you make a search to find some beautiful young virgins? 
EST.2.3	You can appoint officials in every province of the empire and have them bring all these beautiful young women to your harem here in Susa, the capital city. Put them in the care of Hegai, the eunuch who is in charge of your women, and let them be given a beauty treatment. 
EST.2.4	Then take the young woman you like best and make her queen in Vashti's place.”
EST.2.4	The king thought this was good advice, so he followed it.
EST.2.5	There in Susa lived a Jew named Mordecai son of Jair; he was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei. 
EST.2.6	 When King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took King Jehoiachin of Judah into exile from Jerusalem, along with a group of captives, Mordecai was among them. 
EST.2.7	He had a cousin, Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah; she was a beautiful young woman, and had a good figure. At the death of her parents, Mordecai had adopted her and brought her up as his own daughter.
EST.2.8	When the king had issued his new proclamation and many young women were being brought to Susa, Esther was among them. She too was put in the royal palace in the care of Hegai, who had charge of the harem. 
EST.2.9	Hegai liked Esther, and she won his favor. He lost no time in beginning her beauty treatment of massage and special diet. He gave her the best place in the harem and assigned seven young women specially chosen from the royal palace to serve her.
EST.2.10	Now, on the advice of Mordecai, Esther had kept it secret that she was Jewish. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard of the harem, in order to find out how she was getting along and what was going to happen to her.
EST.2.12	The regular beauty treatment for the women lasted a year—massages with oil of myrrh for six months and with oil of balsam for six more. After that, each woman would be taken in turn to King Xerxes. 
EST.2.13	When she went from the harem to the palace, she could wear whatever she wanted. 
EST.2.14	She would go there in the evening, and the next morning she would be taken to another harem and put in the care of Shaashgaz, the eunuch in charge of the king's concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he liked her enough to ask for her by name.
EST.2.15	The time came for Esther to go to the king. Esther—the daughter of Abihail and the cousin of Mordecai, who had adopted her as his daughter; Esther—admired by everyone who saw her. When her turn came, she wore just what Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem, advised her to wear. 
EST.2.16	So in Xerxes' seventh year as king, in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, Esther was brought to King Xerxes in the royal palace. 
EST.2.17	The king liked her more than any of the other women, and more than any of the others she won his favor and affection. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king gave a great banquet in Esther's honor and invited all his officials and administrators. He proclaimed a holiday
EST.2.19	Meanwhile Mordecai had been appointed by the king to an administrative position. 
EST.2.20	As for Esther, she had still not let it be known that she was Jewish. Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone, and she obeyed him in this, just as she had obeyed him when she was a little girl under his care.
EST.2.21	During the time that Mordecai held office in the palace, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the palace eunuchs who guarded the entrance to the king's rooms, became hostile to King Xerxes and plotted to assassinate him. 
EST.2.22	Mordecai learned about it and told Queen Esther, who then told the king what Mordecai had found out. 
EST.2.23	There was an investigation, and it was discovered that the report was true, so both men were hanged on the gallows. The king ordered an account of this to be written down in the official records of the empire.
EST.3.1	Some time later King Xerxes promoted a man named Haman to the position of prime minister. Haman was the son of Hammedatha, a descendant of Agag.
EST.3.2	The king ordered all the officials in his service to show their respect for Haman by kneeling and bowing to him. They all did so, except for Mordecai, who refused to do it. 
EST.3.3	The other officials in the royal service asked him why he was disobeying the king's command; 
EST.3.4	day after day they urged him to give in, but he would not listen to them. “I am a Jew,” he explained, “and I cannot bow to Haman.” So they told Haman about this, wondering if he would tolerate Mordecai's conduct. 
EST.3.5	Haman was furious when he realized that Mordecai was not going to kneel and bow to him, 
EST.3.6	and when he learned that Mordecai was a Jew, he decided to do more than punish Mordecai alone. He made plans to kill every Jew in the whole Persian Empire.
EST.3.7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes' rule, in the first month, the month of Nisan, Haman ordered the lots to be cast (“purim,” they were called) to find out the right day and month to carry out his plot. The thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, was decided on.
EST.3.9	If it please Your Majesty, issue a decree that they are to be put to death. If you do, I guarantee that I will be able to put 375 tons of silver into the royal treasury for the administration of the empire.”
EST.3.10	The king took off his ring, which was used to stamp proclamations and make them official, and gave it to the enemy of the Jewish people, Haman son of Hammedatha, the descendant of Agag. 
EST.3.11	The king told him, “The people and their money are yours; do as you like with them.”
EST.3.12	So on the thirteenth day of the first month Haman called the king's secretaries and dictated a proclamation to be translated into every language and system of writing used in the empire and to be sent to all the rulers, governors, and officials. It was issued in the name of King Xerxes and stamped with his ring. 
EST.3.13	Runners took this proclamation to every province of the empire. It contained the instructions that on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, all Jews—young and old, women and children—were to be killed. They were to be slaughtered without mercy and their belongings were to be taken. 
EST.3.14	The contents of the proclamation were to be made public in every province, so that everyone would be prepared when that day came.
EST.3.15	At the king's command the decree was made public in the capital city of Susa, and runners carried the news to the provinces. The king and Haman sat down and had a drink while the city of Susa was being thrown into confusion.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes in anguish. Then he dressed in sackcloth, covered his head with ashes, and walked through the city, wailing loudly and bitterly, 
EST.4.2	until he came to the entrance of the palace. He did not go in because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside. 
EST.4.3	Throughout all the provinces, wherever the king's proclamation was made known, there was loud mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, wailed, and most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes.
EST.4.4	When Esther's servant women and eunuchs told her what Mordecai was doing, she was deeply disturbed. She sent Mordecai some clothes to put on instead of the sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
EST.4.5	Then she called Hathach, one of the palace eunuchs appointed as her servant by the king, and told him to go to Mordecai and find out what was happening and why. 
EST.4.6	Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square at the entrance of the palace. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him and just how much money Haman had promised to put into the royal treasury if all the Jews were killed. 
EST.4.8	He gave Hathach a copy of the proclamation that had been issued in Susa, ordering the destruction of the Jews. Mordecai asked him to take it to Esther, explain the situation to her, and have her go and plead with the king and beg him to have mercy on her people. 
EST.4.9	Hathach did this, 
EST.4.10	and Esther gave him this message to take back to Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	“If anyone, man or woman, goes to the inner courtyard and sees the king without being summoned, that person must die. That is the law; everyone, from the king's advisers to the people in the provinces, knows that. There is only one way to get around this law: if the king holds out his gold scepter to someone, then that person's life is spared. But it has been a month since the king sent for me.”
EST.4.12	When Mordecai received Esther's message, 
EST.4.13	he sent her this warning: “Don't imagine that you are safer than any other Jew just because you are in the royal palace. 
EST.4.14	If you keep quiet at a time like this, help will come from heaven to the Jews, and they will be saved, but you will die and your father's family will come to an end. Yet who knows—maybe it was for a time like this that you were made queen!”
EST.4.15	Esther sent Mordecai this reply: 
EST.4.16	“Go and get all the Jews in Susa together; hold a fast and pray for me. Don't eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My servant women and I will be doing the same. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. If I must die for doing it, I will die.”
EST.4.17	Mordecai then left and did everything that Esther had told him to do.
EST.5.1	On the third day of her fast Esther put on her royal robes and went and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace, facing the throne room. The king was inside, seated on the royal throne, facing the entrance. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing outside, she won his favor, and he held out to her the gold scepter. She then came up and touched the tip of it. 
EST.5.3	“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king asked. “Tell me what you want, and you shall have it—even if it is half my empire.”
EST.5.4	Esther replied, “If it please Your Majesty, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tonight at a banquet I am preparing for you.”
EST.5.5	The king then ordered Haman to come quickly, so that they could be Esther's guests. So the king and Haman went to Esther's banquet. 
EST.5.6	Over the wine the king asked her, “Tell me what you want, and you shall have it. I will grant your request, even if you ask for half my empire.”
EST.5.7	Esther replied, 
EST.5.8	“If Your Majesty is kind enough to grant my request, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tomorrow at another banquet that I will prepare for you. At that time I will tell you what I want.”
EST.5.9	When Haman left the banquet he was happy and in a good mood. But then he saw Mordecai at the entrance of the palace, and when Mordecai did not rise or show any sign of respect as he passed, Haman was furious with him. 
EST.5.10	But he controlled himself and went on home. Then he invited his friends to his house and asked his wife Zeresh to join them. 
EST.5.11	He boasted to them about how rich he was, how many sons he had, how the king had promoted him to high office, and how much more important he was than any of the king's other officials. 
EST.5.12	“What is more,” Haman went on, “Queen Esther gave a banquet for no one but the king and me, and we are invited back tomorrow. 
EST.5.13	But none of this means a thing to me as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the entrance of the palace.”
EST.5.14	So his wife and all his friends suggested, “Why don't you have a gallows built, seventy-five feet tall? Tomorrow morning you can ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it, and then you can go to the banquet happy.”
EST.5.14	Haman thought this was a good idea, so he had the gallows built.
EST.6.1	That same night the king could not get to sleep, so he had the official records of the empire brought and read to him. 
EST.6.2	 The part they read included the account of how Mordecai had uncovered a plot to assassinate the king—the plot made by Bigthana and Teresh, the two palace eunuchs who had guarded the king's rooms. 
EST.6.3	The king asked, “How have we honored and rewarded Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	His servants answered, “Nothing has been done for him.”
EST.6.4	“Are any of my officials in the palace?” the king asked.
EST.6.4	Now Haman had just entered the courtyard; he had come to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows that was now ready. 
EST.6.5	So the servants answered, “Haman is here, waiting to see you.”
EST.6.5	“Show him in,” said the king.
EST.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “There is someone I wish very much to honor. What should I do for this man?”
EST.6.6	Haman thought to himself, “Now who could the king want to honor so much? Me, of course.”
EST.6.7+EST.6.8	So he answered the king, “Have royal robes brought for this man—robes that you yourself wear. Have a royal ornament
EST.6.9	Then have one of your highest noblemen dress the man in these robes and lead him, mounted on the horse, through the city square. Have the nobleman announce as they go: ‘See how the king rewards someone he wishes to honor!’”
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and get the robes and the horse, and provide these honors for Mordecai the Jew. Do everything for him that you have suggested. You will find him sitting at the entrance of the palace.”
EST.6.11	So Haman got the robes and the horse, and he put the robes on Mordecai. Mordecai got on the horse, and Haman led him through the city square, announcing to the people as they went: “See how the king rewards a man he wishes to honor!”
EST.6.12	Mordecai then went back to the palace entrance while Haman hurried home, covering his face in embarrassment. 
EST.6.13	He told his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then she and those wise friends of his told him, “You are beginning to lose power to Mordecai. He is a Jew, and you cannot overcome him. He will certainly defeat you.”
EST.6.14	While they were still talking, the palace eunuchs arrived in a hurry to take Haman to Esther's banquet.
EST.7.1	And so the king and Haman went to eat with Esther 
EST.7.2	for a second time. Over the wine the king asked her again, “Now, Queen Esther, what do you want? Tell me and you shall have it. I'll even give you half the empire.”
EST.7.3	Queen Esther answered, “If it please Your Majesty to grant my humble request, my wish is that I may live and that my people may live. 
EST.7.4	My people and I have been sold for slaughter. If it were nothing more serious than being sold into slavery, I would have kept quiet and not bothered you about it;
EST.7.5	Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who dares to do such a thing? Where is this man?”
EST.7.6	Esther answered, “Our enemy, our persecutor, is this evil man Haman!”
EST.7.6	Haman faced the king and queen with terror. 
EST.7.7	The king got up in a fury, left the room, and went outside to the palace gardens. Haman could see that the king was determined to punish him for this, so he stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 
EST.7.8	He had just thrown himself down on Esther's couch to beg for mercy, when the king came back into the room from the gardens. Seeing this, the king cried out, “Is this man going to rape the queen right here in front of me, in my own palace?”
EST.7.8	The king had no sooner said this than the eunuchs covered Haman's head. 
EST.7.9	Then one of them, who was named Harbonah, said, “Haman even went so far as to build a gallows at his house so that he could hang Mordecai, who saved Your Majesty's life. And it's seventy-five feet tall!”
EST.7.9	“Hang Haman on it!” the king commanded.
EST.7.10	So Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had built for Mordecai. Then the king's anger cooled down.
EST.8.1	That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther all the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was related to her, and from then on Mordecai was allowed to enter the king's presence. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his ring with his seal on it (which he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
EST.8.3	Then Esther spoke to the king again, throwing herself at his feet and crying. She begged him to do something to stop the evil plot that Haman, the descendant of Agag,
EST.8.4	The king held out the gold scepter to her, so she stood up and said, 
EST.8.5	“If it please Your Majesty, and if you care about me and if it seems right to you, please issue a proclamation to keep Haman's orders from being carried out—those orders that the son of Hammedatha the descendant of Agag gave for the destruction of all the Jews in the empire. 
EST.8.6	How can I endure it if this disaster comes on my people, and my own relatives are killed?”
EST.8.7	King Xerxes then said to Queen Esther and Mordecai, the Jew, “Look, I have hanged Haman for his plot against the Jews, and I have given Esther his property. 
EST.8.8	But a proclamation issued in the king's name and stamped with the royal seal cannot be revoked. You may, however, write to the Jews whatever you like; and you may write it in my name and stamp it with the royal seal.”
EST.8.9	This happened on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. Mordecai called the king's secretaries and dictated letters to the Jews and to the governors, administrators, and officials of all the 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia.
EST.8.10	Mordecai had the letters written in the name of King Xerxes, and he stamped them with the royal seal. They were delivered by riders mounted on fast horses from the royal stables.
EST.8.11	These letters explained that the king would allow the Jews in every city to organize for self-defense. If armed men of any nationality in any province attacked the Jewish men, their children, or their women, the Jews could fight back and destroy the attackers; they could slaughter them to the last man and take their possessions. 
EST.8.12	This decree was to take effect throughout the Persian Empire on the day set for the slaughter of the Jews, the thirteenth of Adar, the twelfth month. 
EST.8.13	It was to be proclaimed as law and made known to everyone in every province, so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies when that day came. 
EST.8.14	At the king's command the riders mounted royal horses and rode off at top speed. The decree was also made public in Susa, the capital city.
EST.8.15	Mordecai left the palace, wearing royal robes of blue and white, a cloak of fine purple linen, and a magnificent gold crown. Then the streets of Susa rang with cheers and joyful shouts. 
EST.8.16	For the Jews there was joy and relief, happiness and a sense of victory. 
EST.8.17	In every city and province, wherever the king's proclamation was read, the Jews held a joyful holiday with feasting and happiness. In fact, many other people became Jews, because they were afraid of them now.
EST.9.1	The thirteenth day of Adar came, the day on which the royal proclamation was to take effect, the day when the enemies of the Jews were hoping to get them in their power. But instead, the Jews triumphed over them. 
EST.9.2	In the Jewish quarter of every city
EST.9.3	In fact, all the provincial officials—governors, administrators, and royal representatives—helped the Jews because they were all afraid of Mordecai. 
EST.9.4	It was well-known throughout the empire that Mordecai was now a powerful man in the palace and was growing more powerful. 
EST.9.5	So the Jews could do what they wanted with their enemies. They attacked them with swords and slaughtered them.
EST.9.6	In Susa, the capital city itself, the Jews killed five hundred people. 
EST.9.7+EST.9.8+EST.9.9+EST.9.10	Among them were the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews: Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. However, there was no looting.
EST.9.11	That same day the number of people killed in Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	He then said to Queen Esther, “In Susa alone the Jews have killed five hundred people, including Haman's ten sons. What must they have done out in the provinces! What do you want now? You shall have it. Tell me what else you want, and you shall have it.”
EST.9.13	Esther answered, “If it please Your Majesty, let the Jews in Susa do again tomorrow what they were allowed to do today. And have the bodies of Haman's ten sons hung from the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	The king ordered this to be done, and the proclamation was issued in Susa. The bodies of Haman's ten sons were publicly displayed. 
EST.9.15	On the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of Susa got together again and killed three hundred more people in the city. But again, they did no looting.
EST.9.16	The Jews in the provinces also organized and defended themselves. They rid themselves of their enemies by killing seventy-five thousand people who hated them. But they did no looting. 
EST.9.17	This was on the thirteenth day of Adar. On the next day, the fourteenth, there was no more killing, and they made it a joyful day of feasting. 
EST.9.18	The Jews of Susa, however, made the fifteenth a holiday, since they had slaughtered their enemies on the thirteenth and fourteenth and then stopped on the fifteenth. 
EST.9.19	This is why Jews who live in small towns observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a joyous holiday, a time for feasting and giving gifts of food to one another.
EST.9.20	Mordecai had these events written down and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, throughout the Persian Empire, 
EST.9.21	telling them to observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar as holidays every year. 
EST.9.22	These were the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies; this was a month that had been turned from a time of grief and despair into a time of joy and happiness. They were told to observe these days with feasts and parties, giving gifts of food to one another and to the poor. 
EST.9.23	So the Jews followed Mordecai's instructions, and the celebration became an annual custom.
EST.9.25	But Esther went to the king, and the king issued written orders with the result that Haman suffered the fate he had planned for the Jews—he and his sons were hanged from the gallows. 
EST.9.26	That is why the holidays are called Purim. Because of Mordecai's letter and because of all that had happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews made it a rule for themselves, their descendants, and anyone who might become a Jew, that at the proper time each year these two days would be regularly observed according to Mordecai's instructions. 
EST.9.28	It was resolved that every Jewish family of every future generation in every province and every city should remember and observe the days of Purim for all time to come.
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai, also wrote a letter, putting her full authority behind the letter about Purim, which Mordecai had written earlier. 
EST.9.30	The letter was addressed to all the Jews, and copies were sent to all the 127 provinces of the Persian Empire. It wished the Jews peace and security 
EST.9.31	and directed them and their descendants to observe the days of Purim at the proper time, just as they had adopted rules for the observance of fasts and times of mourning. This was commanded by both Mordecai and Queen Esther. 
EST.9.32	Esther's command, confirming the rules for Purim, was written down on a scroll.
EST.10.1	King Xerxes imposed forced labor on the people of the coastal regions of his empire as well as on those of the interior. 
EST.10.2	All the great and wonderful things he did, as well as the whole story of how he promoted Mordecai to high office, are recorded in the official records of the kings of Persia and Media. 
EST.10.3	Mordecai the Jew was second in rank only to King Xerxes himself. He was honored and well-liked by his fellow Jews. He worked for the good of his people and for the security of all their descendants.
JOB.1.1	There was a man named Job, living in the land of Uz,
JOB.1.2	He had seven sons and three daughters, 
JOB.1.3	and owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, one thousand head of cattle, and five hundred donkeys. He also had a large number of servants and was the richest man in the East.
JOB.1.4	Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast, to which all the others would come, and they always invited their three sisters to join them. 
JOB.1.5	The morning after each feast, Job would get up early and offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them. He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally.
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.7	Satan answered, “I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth.”
JOB.1.8	“Did you notice my servant Job?” the 
JOB.1.10	You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does, and you have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country. 
JOB.1.11	But now suppose you take away everything he has—he will curse you to your face!”
JOB.1.12	“All right,” the 
JOB.1.13	One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger came running to Job. “We were plowing the fields with the oxen,” he said, “and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture. 
JOB.1.15	Suddenly the Sabeans
JOB.1.16	Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.17	Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Three bands of Chaldean
JOB.1.18	Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son, 
JOB.1.19	when a storm swept in from the desert. It blew the house down and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief. He shaved his head and threw himself face downward on the ground. 
JOB.1.21	 He said, “I was born with nothing, and I will die with nothing. The 
JOB.1.22	In spite of everything that had happened, Job did not sin by blaming God.
JOB.2.1	When the day came for the heavenly beings to appear before the 
JOB.2.2	The 
JOB.2.2	Satan answered, “I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth.”
JOB.2.3	“Did you notice my servant Job?” the 
JOB.2.4	Satan replied, “A person will give up everything in order to stay alive. 
JOB.2.5	But now suppose you hurt his body—he will curse you to your face!”
JOB.2.6	So the 
JOB.2.7	Then Satan left the 
JOB.2.8	Job went and sat by the garbage dump and took a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores. 
JOB.2.9	His wife said to him, “You are still as faithful as ever, aren't you? Why don't you curse God and die?”
JOB.2.10	Job answered, “You are talking nonsense! When God sends us something good, we welcome it. How can we complain when he sends us trouble?” Even in all this suffering Job said nothing against God.
JOB.2.11	Three of Job's friends were Eliphaz, from the city of Teman, Bildad, from the land of Shuah, and Zophar, from the land of Naamah. When they heard how much Job had been suffering, they decided to go and comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	While they were still a long way off they saw Job, but did not recognize him. When they did, they began to weep and wail, tearing their clothes in grief and throwing dust into the air and on their heads. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat there on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw how much he was suffering.
JOB.3.2+JOB.3.3	put a curse on the night when I was conceived!
JOB.3.4	Turn that day into darkness, God.
JOB.3.4	Never again remember that day;
JOB.3.4	never again let light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Make it a day of gloom and thick darkness;
JOB.3.5	cover it with clouds, and blot out the sun.
JOB.3.6	Blot that night out of the year,
JOB.3.6	and never let it be counted again;
JOB.3.7	make it a barren, joyless night.
JOB.3.8	Tell the sorcerers to curse that day,
JOB.3.8	those who know how to control Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Keep the morning star from shining;
JOB.3.9	give that night no hope of dawn.
JOB.3.10	Curse that night for letting me be born,
JOB.3.10	for exposing me to trouble and grief.
JOB.3.11	I wish I had died in my mother's womb
JOB.3.11	or died the moment I was born.
JOB.3.12	Why did my mother hold me on her knees?
JOB.3.12	Why did she feed me at her breast?
JOB.3.13	If I had died then, I would be at rest now,
JOB.3.14	sleeping like the kings and rulers
JOB.3.14	who rebuilt ancient palaces.
JOB.3.15	Then I would be sleeping like princes
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with gold and silver,
JOB.3.16	or sleeping like a stillborn child.
JOB.3.17	In the grave wicked people stop their evil,
JOB.3.17	and tired workers find rest at last.
JOB.3.18	Even prisoners enjoy peace,
JOB.3.18	free from shouts and harsh commands.
JOB.3.19	Everyone is there, the famous and the unknown,
JOB.3.19	and slaves at last are free.
JOB.3.20	Why let people go on living in misery?
JOB.3.20	Why give light to those in grief
JOB.3.21	they prefer a grave to any treasure.
JOB.3.22	They are not happy till they are dead and buried;
JOB.3.23	God keeps their future hidden
JOB.3.23	and hems them in on every side.
JOB.3.24	Instead of eating, I mourn,
JOB.3.24	and I can never stop groaning.
JOB.3.25	Everything I fear and dread comes true.
JOB.3.26	I have no peace, no rest,
JOB.3.26	and my troubles never end.
JOB.4.1+JOB.4.2	Job, will you be annoyed if I speak?
JOB.4.1+JOB.4.2	I can't keep quiet any longer.
JOB.4.3	You have taught many people
JOB.4.3	and given strength to feeble hands.
JOB.4.4	When someone stumbled, weak and tired,
JOB.4.4	your words encouraged him to stand.
JOB.4.5	Now it's your turn to be in trouble,
JOB.4.5	and you are too stunned to face it.
JOB.4.6	You worshiped God, and your life was blameless;
JOB.4.6	and so you should have confidence and hope.
JOB.4.7	Think back now. Name a single case
JOB.4.7	where someone righteous met with disaster.
JOB.4.8	I have seen people plow fields of evil
JOB.4.8	and plant wickedness like seed;
JOB.4.8	now they harvest wickedness and evil.
JOB.4.9	Like a storm, God destroys them in his anger.
JOB.4.10	The wicked roar and growl like lions,
JOB.4.10	but God silences them and breaks their teeth.
JOB.4.11	Like lions with nothing to kill and eat,
JOB.4.11	they die, and all their children are scattered.
JOB.4.12	Once a message came quietly,
JOB.4.12	so quietly I could hardly hear it.
JOB.4.14	I trembled and shuddered;
JOB.4.14	my whole body shook with fear.
JOB.4.15	A light breeze touched my face,
JOB.4.15	and my skin crawled with fright.
JOB.4.16	I could see something standing there;
JOB.4.16	I stared, but couldn't tell what it was.
JOB.4.16	Then I heard a voice out of the silence:
JOB.4.17	“Can anyone be righteous in the sight of
JOB.4.17	or be pure before
JOB.4.18	God does not trust his heavenly servants;
JOB.4.18	he finds fault even with his angels.
JOB.4.19	Do you think he will trust a creature of clay,
JOB.4.19	a thing of dust that can be crushed like a moth?
JOB.4.20	We may be alive in the morning,
JOB.4.20	but die unnoticed before evening comes.
JOB.4.21	All that we have is taken away;
JOB.4.21	we die, still lacking wisdom.”
JOB.5.1	Call out, Job. See if anyone answers.
JOB.5.1	Is there any angel to whom you can turn?
JOB.5.2	To worry yourself to death with resentment
JOB.5.2	would be a foolish, senseless thing to do.
JOB.5.3	I have seen fools who looked secure,
JOB.5.3	but I called down a sudden curse on their homes.
JOB.5.4	Their children can never find safety;
JOB.5.4	no one stands up to defend them in court.
JOB.5.5	Hungry people will eat the fool's crops—
JOB.5.5	even the grain growing among thorns
JOB.5.5	and thirsty people will envy his wealth.
JOB.5.6	Evil does not grow in the soil,
JOB.5.6	nor does trouble grow out of the ground.
JOB.5.7	No indeed! We bring trouble on ourselves,
JOB.5.7	as surely as sparks fly up from a fire.
JOB.5.8	If I were you, I would turn to God
JOB.5.8	and present my case to him.
JOB.5.9	and to his miracles there is no end.
JOB.5.10	He sends rain on the land
JOB.5.10	and he waters the fields.
JOB.5.11	Yes, it is God who raises the humble
JOB.5.11	and gives joy to all who mourn.
JOB.5.12+JOB.5.13	and traps the wise in their own schemes,
JOB.5.12+JOB.5.13	so that nothing they do succeeds;
JOB.5.14	even at noon they grope in darkness.
JOB.5.15	But God saves the poor
JOB.5.15	he saves the needy from oppression.
JOB.5.16	He gives hope to the poor and silences the wicked.
JOB.5.17	Do not resent it when he rebukes you.
JOB.5.18	his hand hurts you, and his hand heals.
JOB.5.19	Time after time he will save you from harm;
JOB.5.20	when famine comes, he will keep you alive,
JOB.5.20	and in war protect you from death.
JOB.5.21	God will rescue you from slander;
JOB.5.21	he will save you when destruction comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at violence and hunger
JOB.5.22	and not be afraid of wild animals.
JOB.5.23	The fields you plow will be free of rocks;
JOB.5.23	wild animals will never attack you.
JOB.5.24	Then you will live at peace in your tent;
JOB.5.24	when you look at your sheep, you will find them safe.
JOB.5.25	You will have as many children
JOB.5.25	as there are blades of grass in a pasture.
JOB.5.26	Like wheat that ripens till harvest time,
JOB.5.26	you will live to a ripe old age.
JOB.5.27	Job, we have learned this by long study.
JOB.5.27	It is true, so now accept it.
JOB.6.1+JOB.6.2	If my troubles and griefs were weighed on scales,
JOB.6.3	they would weigh more than the sands of the sea,
JOB.6.3	so my wild words should not surprise you.
JOB.6.4	Almighty God has shot me with arrows,
JOB.6.4	and their poison spreads through my body.
JOB.6.4	God has lined up his terrors against me.
JOB.6.5	A donkey is content when eating grass,
JOB.6.5	and a cow is quiet when eating hay.
JOB.6.6	But who can eat flat, unsalted food?
JOB.6.6	What taste is there in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	I have no appetite for food like that,
JOB.6.7	and everything I eat makes me sick.
JOB.6.8	Why won't God give me what I ask?
JOB.6.8	Why won't he answer my prayer?
JOB.6.9	If only he would go ahead and kill me!
JOB.6.10	If I knew he would, I would leap for joy,
JOB.6.10	no matter how great my pain.
JOB.6.10	I know that God is holy;
JOB.6.10	I have never opposed what he commands.
JOB.6.11	What strength do I have to keep on living?
JOB.6.11	Why go on living when I have no hope?
JOB.6.12	Am I made of stone? Is my body bronze?
JOB.6.13	I have no strength left to save myself;
JOB.6.13	there is nowhere I can turn for help.
JOB.6.14	In trouble
JOB.6.14	whether I've forsaken God or not.
JOB.6.15	But you, my friends, you deceive me like streams
JOB.6.15	that go dry when no rain comes.
JOB.6.16	The streams are choked with snow and ice,
JOB.6.17	but in the heat they disappear,
JOB.6.17	and the stream beds lie bare and dry.
JOB.6.18	Caravans get lost looking for water;
JOB.6.18	they wander and die in the desert.
JOB.6.19	Caravans from Sheba and Tema search,
JOB.6.20	but their hope dies beside dry streams.
JOB.6.21	You are like
JOB.6.21	you see my fate and draw back in fear.
JOB.6.22	Have I asked you to give me a gift
JOB.6.22	or to bribe someone on my behalf
JOB.6.23	or to save me from some enemy or tyrant?
JOB.6.24	All right, teach me; tell me my faults.
JOB.6.24	I will be quiet and listen to you.
JOB.6.25	Honest words are convincing,
JOB.6.25	but you are talking nonsense.
JOB.6.26	You think I am talking nothing but wind;
JOB.6.26	then why do you answer my words of despair?
JOB.6.27	You would even roll dice for orphan slaves
JOB.6.27	and make yourselves rich off your closest friends!
JOB.6.28	Look me in the face. I won't lie.
JOB.6.29	You have gone far enough. Stop being unjust.
JOB.6.29	Don't condemn me. I'm in the right.
JOB.6.30	But you think I am lying—
JOB.6.30	you think I can't tell right from wrong.
JOB.7.1	Human life is like forced army service,
JOB.7.1	like a life of hard manual labor,
JOB.7.2	like a slave longing for cool shade;
JOB.7.2	like a worker waiting to be paid.
JOB.7.3	Month after month I have nothing to live for;
JOB.7.3	night after night brings me grief.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down to sleep, the hours drag;
JOB.7.4	I toss all night and long for dawn.
JOB.7.5	My body is full of worms;
JOB.7.5	it is covered with scabs;
JOB.7.5	pus runs out of my sores.
JOB.7.6	My days pass by without hope,
JOB.7.6	pass faster than a weaver's shuttle.
JOB.7.7	Remember, O God, my life is only a breath;
JOB.7.7	my happiness has already ended.
JOB.7.8	You see me now, but never again.
JOB.7.8	If you look for me, I'll be gone.
JOB.7.9+JOB.7.10	we humans die and never return;
JOB.7.9+JOB.7.10	we are forgotten by all who knew us.
JOB.7.11	No! I can't be quiet!
JOB.7.11	I am angry and bitter.
JOB.7.11	I have to speak.
JOB.7.12	Why do you keep me under guard?
JOB.7.12	Do you think I am a sea monster?
JOB.7.13	I lie down and try to rest;
JOB.7.13	I look for relief from my pain.
JOB.7.14	But you—you terrify me with dreams;
JOB.7.14	you send me visions and nightmares
JOB.7.15	until I would rather be strangled
JOB.7.15	than live in this miserable body.
JOB.7.16	I give up; I am tired of living.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone. My life makes no sense.
JOB.7.17	Why pay attention to what they do?
JOB.7.18	You inspect them every morning
JOB.7.18	and test them every minute.
JOB.7.19	Won't you look away long enough
JOB.7.19	for me to swallow my spit?
JOB.7.20	Are you harmed by my sin, you jailer?
JOB.7.20	Why use me for your target practice?
JOB.7.20	Am I so great a burden to you?
JOB.7.21	Can't you ever forgive my sin?
JOB.7.21	Can't you pardon the wrong I do?
JOB.7.21	Soon I will be in my grave,
JOB.7.21	and I'll be gone when you look for me.
JOB.8.1+JOB.8.2	Are you finally through with your windy speech?
JOB.8.3	God never twists justice;
JOB.8.3	he never fails to do what is right.
JOB.8.4	Your children must have sinned against God,
JOB.8.4	and so he punished them as they deserved.
JOB.8.5	But turn now and plead with Almighty God;
JOB.8.6	if you are so honest and pure,
JOB.8.6	then God will come and help you
JOB.8.6	and restore your household as your reward.
JOB.8.7	All the wealth you lost will be nothing
JOB.8.7	compared with what God will give you then.
JOB.8.8	consider the truths our ancestors learned.
JOB.8.9	Our life is short, we know nothing at all;
JOB.8.9	we pass like shadows across the earth.
JOB.8.10	But let the ancient wise people teach you;
JOB.8.10	listen to what they had to say:
JOB.8.11	“Reeds can't grow where there is no water;
JOB.8.11	they are never found outside a swamp.
JOB.8.12	If the water dries up, they are the first to wither,
JOB.8.12	while still too small to be cut and used.
JOB.8.13	Godless people are like those reeds;
JOB.8.13	their hope is gone, once God is forgotten.
JOB.8.14	They trust a thread—a spider's web.
JOB.8.15	If they lean on a web, will it hold them up?
JOB.8.15	If they grab for a thread, will it help them stand?”
JOB.8.16	Evil people sprout like weeds in the sun,
JOB.8.16	like weeds that spread all through the garden.
JOB.8.17	Their roots wrap around the stones
JOB.8.17	and hold fast to
JOB.8.18	But then pull them up—
JOB.8.18	no one will ever know they were there.
JOB.8.19	Yes, that's all the joy evil people have;
JOB.8.19	others now come and take their places.
JOB.8.20	But God will never abandon the faithful
JOB.8.20	or ever give help to evil people.
JOB.8.21	He will let you laugh and shout again,
JOB.8.22	but he will bring disgrace on those who hate you,
JOB.8.22	and the homes of the wicked will vanish.
JOB.9.1+JOB.9.2	But how can a human being win a case against God?
JOB.9.3	How can anyone argue with him?
JOB.9.3	He can ask a thousand questions
JOB.9.3	that no one could ever answer.
JOB.9.4	God is so wise and powerful;
JOB.9.4	no one can stand up against him.
JOB.9.5	Without warning he moves mountains
JOB.9.5	and in anger he destroys them.
JOB.9.6	God sends earthquakes and shakes the ground;
JOB.9.6	he rocks the pillars that support the earth.
JOB.9.7	and the stars from shining at night.
JOB.9.8	No one helped God spread out the heavens
JOB.9.8	or trample the sea monster's back.
JOB.9.9	Orion, the Pleiades, and the stars of the south.
JOB.9.10	We cannot understand the great things he does,
JOB.9.10	and to his miracles there is no end.
JOB.9.11	God passes by, but I cannot see him.
JOB.9.12	He takes what he wants, and no one can stop him;
JOB.9.12	no one dares ask him, “What are you doing?”
JOB.9.13	God's anger is constant. He crushed his enemies
JOB.9.13	who helped Rahab,
JOB.9.14	So how can I find words to answer God?
JOB.9.15	Though I am innocent, all I can do
JOB.9.15	is beg for mercy from God my judge.
JOB.9.16	Yet even then, if he lets me speak,
JOB.9.16	I can't believe he would listen to me.
JOB.9.17	He sends storms to batter and bruise me
JOB.9.17	without any reason at all.
JOB.9.18	He won't let me catch my breath;
JOB.9.18	he has filled my life with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	Should I try force? Try force on God?
JOB.9.19	Should I take him to court? Could anyone make him go?
JOB.9.20	I am innocent and faithful, but my words sound guilty,
JOB.9.20	and everything I say seems to condemn me.
JOB.9.21+JOB.9.22	I am innocent, but I no longer care.
JOB.9.21+JOB.9.22	I am sick of living. Nothing matters;
JOB.9.21+JOB.9.22	innocent or guilty, God will destroy us.
JOB.9.23	When an innocent person suddenly dies,
JOB.9.23	God laughs.
JOB.9.24	God gave the world to the wicked.
JOB.9.24	He made all the judges blind.
JOB.9.24	And if God didn't do it, who did?
JOB.9.25	My days race by, not one of them good.
JOB.9.26	My life passes like the swiftest boat,
JOB.9.26	as fast as an eagle swooping down on a rabbit.
JOB.9.27+JOB.9.28	If I smile and try to forget my pain,
JOB.9.27+JOB.9.28	all my suffering comes back to haunt me;
JOB.9.27+JOB.9.28	I know that God does hold me guilty.
JOB.9.29	Since I am held guilty, why should I bother?
JOB.9.30	No soap can wash away my sins.
JOB.9.31	God throws me into a pit with filth,
JOB.9.31	and even my clothes are ashamed of me.
JOB.9.32	If God were human, I could answer him;
JOB.9.32	we could go to court to decide our quarrel.
JOB.9.33	But there is no one to step between us—
JOB.9.33	no one to judge both God and me.
JOB.9.34	Stop punishing me, God!
JOB.9.34	Keep your terrors away!
JOB.9.35	I am not afraid. I am going to talk
JOB.9.35	because I know my own heart.
JOB.10.1	I am tired of living.
JOB.10.1	Listen to my bitter complaint.
JOB.10.2	Don't condemn me, God.
JOB.10.2	Tell me! What is the charge against me?
JOB.10.3	Is it right for you to be so cruel?
JOB.10.3	To despise what you yourself have made?
JOB.10.3	And then to smile on the schemes of wicked people?
JOB.10.4	Do you see things as we do?
JOB.10.5	Is your life as short as ours?
JOB.10.6	Then why do you track down all my sins
JOB.10.6	and hunt down every fault I have?
JOB.10.7	that no one can save me from you.
JOB.10.8	Your hands formed and shaped me,
JOB.10.8	and now
JOB.10.9	Remember that you made me from clay;
JOB.10.9	are you going to crush me back to dust?
JOB.10.10	you made me grow in my mother's womb.
JOB.10.11	You formed my body with bones and sinews
JOB.10.11	and covered the bones with muscles and skin.
JOB.10.12	You have given me life and constant love,
JOB.10.12	and your care has kept me alive.
JOB.10.13	But now I know that all that time
JOB.10.13	you were secretly planning to harm me.
JOB.10.14	You were watching to see if I would sin,
JOB.10.14	so that you could refuse to forgive me.
JOB.10.15	As soon as I sin, I'm in trouble with you,
JOB.10.15	but when I do right, I get no credit.
JOB.10.15	I am miserable and covered with shame.
JOB.10.16	If I have any success at all,
JOB.10.16	you hunt me down like a lion;
JOB.10.16	to hurt me you even work miracles.
JOB.10.17	You always have some witness against me;
JOB.10.17	your anger toward me grows and grows;
JOB.10.17	you always plan some new attack.
JOB.10.18	Why, God, did you let me be born?
JOB.10.18	I should have died before anyone saw me.
JOB.10.19	To go from the womb straight to the grave
JOB.10.19	would have been as good as never existing.
JOB.10.20	Isn't my life almost over? Leave me alone!
JOB.10.20	Let me enjoy the time I have left.
JOB.10.21	I am going soon and will never come back—
JOB.10.21	going to a land that is dark and gloomy,
JOB.10.22	a land of darkness, shadows, and confusion,
JOB.10.22	where the light itself is darkness.
JOB.11.1+JOB.11.2	Will no one answer all this nonsense?
JOB.11.1+JOB.11.2	Does talking so much put you in the right?
JOB.11.3	Job, do you think we can't answer you?
JOB.11.3	That your mocking words will leave us speechless?
JOB.11.4	You claim that what you say is true;
JOB.11.4	you claim you are pure in the sight of God.
JOB.11.5	How I wish God would answer you!
JOB.11.6	He would tell you there are many sides to wisdom;
JOB.11.6	there are things too deep for human knowledge.
JOB.11.6	God is punishing you less than you deserve.
JOB.11.7	Can you discover the limits and bounds
JOB.11.7	of the greatness and power of God?
JOB.11.8	The sky is no limit for God,
JOB.11.8	but it lies beyond your reach.
JOB.11.8	God knows the world of the dead,
JOB.11.8	but you do not know it.
JOB.11.9	God's greatness is broader than the earth,
JOB.11.9	wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If God arrests you and brings you to trial,
JOB.11.10	who is there to stop him?
JOB.11.11	God knows which people are worthless;
JOB.11.11	he sees all their evil deeds.
JOB.11.12	Stupid people will start being wise
JOB.11.12	when wild donkeys are born tame.
JOB.11.13	Put your heart right, Job. Reach out to God.
JOB.11.14	Put away evil and wrong from your home.
JOB.11.15	Then face the world again, firm and courageous.
JOB.11.16	Then all your troubles will fade from your memory,
JOB.11.16	like floods that are past and remembered no more.
JOB.11.17	Your life will be brighter than sunshine at noon,
JOB.11.17	and life's darkest hours will shine like the dawn.
JOB.11.18	You will live secure and full of hope;
JOB.11.18	God will protect you and give you rest.
JOB.11.19	You won't be afraid of your enemies;
JOB.11.19	many people will ask you for help.
JOB.11.20	But the wicked will look around in despair
JOB.11.20	and find that there is no way to escape.
JOB.11.20	Their one hope is that death will come.
JOB.12.1+JOB.12.2	Yes, you are the voice of the people.
JOB.12.1+JOB.12.2	When you die, wisdom will die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have as much sense as you have;
JOB.12.3	I am in no way inferior to you;
JOB.12.3	everyone knows all that you have said.
JOB.12.4	Even my friends laugh at me now;
JOB.12.4	they laugh, although I am righteous and blameless;
JOB.12.4	but there was a time when God answered my prayers.
JOB.12.5	You have no troubles, and yet you make fun of me;
JOB.12.5	you hit someone who is about to fall.
JOB.12.6	But thieves and godless people live in peace,
JOB.12.6	though their only god is their own strength.
JOB.12.7	Even birds and animals have much they could teach you;
JOB.12.8	ask the creatures of earth and sea for their wisdom.
JOB.12.9	All of them know that the 
JOB.12.10	It is God who directs the lives of his creatures;
JOB.12.10	everyone's life is in his power.
JOB.12.11	But just as your tongue enjoys tasting food,
JOB.12.11	your ears enjoy hearing words.
JOB.12.12+JOB.12.13	Old people have wisdom,
JOB.12.12+JOB.12.13	but God has wisdom and power.
JOB.12.12+JOB.12.13	Old people have insight;
JOB.12.12+JOB.12.13	God has insight and power to act.
JOB.12.14	When God tears down, who can rebuild,
JOB.12.14	and who can free those God imprisons?
JOB.12.15	Drought comes when God withholds rain;
JOB.12.15	floods come when he turns water loose.
JOB.12.16	God is strong and always victorious;
JOB.12.16	both deceived and deceiver are in his power.
JOB.12.17	He takes away the wisdom of rulers
JOB.12.17	and makes leaders act like fools.
JOB.12.18	He dethrones kings and makes them prisoners;
JOB.12.19	he humbles priests and men of power.
JOB.12.20	He silences those who are trusted,
JOB.12.20	and takes the wisdom of old people away.
JOB.12.21	He disgraces those in power
JOB.12.21	and puts an end to the strength of rulers.
JOB.12.22	He sends light to places dark as death.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations strong and great,
JOB.12.23	but then he defeats and destroys them.
JOB.12.24	He makes their leaders foolish
JOB.12.24	and lets them wander confused and lost;
JOB.12.25	they grope in the dark and stagger like drunkards.
JOB.13.1+JOB.13.2	Everything you say, I have heard before.
JOB.13.1+JOB.13.2	I understand it all; I know as much as you do.
JOB.13.1+JOB.13.2	I'm not your inferior.
JOB.13.3	But my dispute is with God, not you;
JOB.13.3	I want to argue my case with him.
JOB.13.4	You cover up your ignorance with lies;
JOB.13.4	you are like doctors who can't heal anyone.
JOB.13.5	Say nothing, and someone may think you are wise!
JOB.13.6	Listen while I state my case.
JOB.13.7	Why are you lying?
JOB.13.7	Do you think your lies will benefit God?
JOB.13.8	Are you trying to defend him?
JOB.13.8	Are you going to argue his case in court?
JOB.13.9	If God looks at you closely, will he find anything good?
JOB.13.9	Do you think you can fool God the way you fool others?
JOB.13.10	Even though your prejudice is hidden,
JOB.13.10	he will reprimand you,
JOB.13.11	and his power will fill you with terror.
JOB.13.12	Your proverbs are as useless as ashes;
JOB.13.12	your arguments are as weak as clay.
JOB.13.13	Be quiet and give me a chance to speak,
JOB.13.13	and let the results be what they will.
JOB.13.14	I am
JOB.13.15	I've lost all hope, so what if God kills me?
JOB.13.15	I am going to state my case to him.
JOB.13.16	It may even be that my boldness will save me,
JOB.13.16	since no wicked person would dare to face God.
JOB.13.17	Now listen to my words of explanation.
JOB.13.18	I am ready to state my case,
JOB.13.18	because I know I am in the right.
JOB.13.19	Are you coming to accuse me, God?
JOB.13.19	If you do, I am ready to be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	Let me ask for two things; agree to them,
JOB.13.20	and I will not try to hide from you:
JOB.13.21	stop punishing me, and don't crush me with terror.
JOB.13.22	Speak first, O God, and I will answer.
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, and you answer me.
JOB.13.23	What are my sins? What wrongs have I done?
JOB.13.23	What crimes am I charged with?
JOB.13.24	Why do you avoid me?
JOB.13.24	Why do you treat me like an enemy?
JOB.13.25	Are you trying to frighten me? I'm nothing but a leaf;
JOB.13.25	you are attacking a piece of dry straw.
JOB.13.26	You bring bitter charges against me,
JOB.13.26	even for what I did when I was young.
JOB.13.27	you watch every step I take,
JOB.13.27	and even examine my footprints.
JOB.13.28	As a result, I crumble like rotten wood,
JOB.13.28	like a moth-eaten coat.
JOB.14.1	All lead the same short, troubled life.
JOB.14.2	We grow and wither as quickly as flowers;
JOB.14.2	we disappear like shadows.
JOB.14.3	Will you even look at me, God,
JOB.14.3	or put me on trial and judge me?
JOB.14.4	Nothing clean can ever come
JOB.14.4	from anything as unclean as human beings.
JOB.14.5	The length of our lives is decided beforehand—
JOB.14.5	the number of months we will live.
JOB.14.5	You have settled it, and it can't be changed.
JOB.14.6	Look away from us and leave us alone;
JOB.14.6	let us enjoy our hard life—if we can.
JOB.14.7	There is hope for a tree that has been cut down;
JOB.14.7	it can come back to life and sprout.
JOB.14.8	Even though its roots grow old,
JOB.14.8	and its stump dies in the ground,
JOB.14.9	with water it will sprout like a young plant.
JOB.14.10	But we die, and that is the end of us;
JOB.14.10	we die, and where are we then?
JOB.14.11	Like rivers that stop running,
JOB.14.11	and lakes that go dry,
JOB.14.12	people die, never to rise.
JOB.14.12	They will never wake up while the sky endures;
JOB.14.12	they will never stir from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	I wish you would hide me in the world of the dead;
JOB.14.13	let me be hidden until your anger is over,
JOB.14.13	and then set a time to remember me.
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, can he come back to life?
JOB.14.14	But I will wait for better times,
JOB.14.14	wait till this time of trouble is ended.
JOB.14.15	Then you will call, and I will answer,
JOB.14.15	and you will be pleased with me, your creature.
JOB.14.16	Then you will watch every step I take,
JOB.14.16	but you will not keep track of my sins.
JOB.14.17	You will forgive them and put them away;
JOB.14.17	you will wipe out all the wrongs I have done.
JOB.14.18	There comes a time when mountains fall
JOB.14.18	and solid cliffs are moved away.
JOB.14.19	Water will wear down rocks,
JOB.14.19	and heavy rain will wash away the soil;
JOB.14.19	so you destroy our hope for life.
JOB.14.20	You overpower us and send us away forever;
JOB.14.20	our faces are twisted in death.
JOB.14.21	Our children win honor, but we never know it,
JOB.14.21	nor are we told when they are disgraced.
JOB.14.22	We feel only the pain of our own bodies
JOB.14.22	and the grief of our own minds.
JOB.15.1+JOB.15.2	Empty words, Job! Empty words!
JOB.15.3	No one who is wise would talk the way you do
JOB.15.3	or defend himself with such meaningless words.
JOB.15.4	If you had your way, no one would fear God;
JOB.15.4	no one would pray to him.
JOB.15.5	Your wickedness is evident by what you say;
JOB.15.5	you are trying to hide behind clever words.
JOB.15.6	There is no need for me to condemn you;
JOB.15.6	you are condemned by every word you speak.
JOB.15.7	Do you think you were the first person born?
JOB.15.7	Were you there when God made the mountains?
JOB.15.8	Did you overhear the plans God made?
JOB.15.8	Does human wisdom belong to you alone?
JOB.15.9	There is nothing you know that we don't know.
JOB.15.10	We learned our wisdom from gray-haired people—
JOB.15.10	those born before your father.
JOB.15.11	God offers you comfort; why still reject it?
JOB.15.11	We have spoken for him with calm, even words.
JOB.15.12	But you are excited and glare at us in anger.
JOB.15.13	You are angry with God and denounce him.
JOB.15.14	Can anyone be right with God?
JOB.15.15	Why, God does not trust even his angels;
JOB.15.15	even they are not pure in his sight.
JOB.15.16	And we drink evil as if it were water;
JOB.15.16	yes, we are corrupt; we are worthless.
JOB.15.17	Now listen, Job, to what I know.
JOB.15.18	Those who are wise have taught me truths
JOB.15.18	which they learned from their ancestors,
JOB.15.18	and they kept no secrets hidden.
JOB.15.19	Their land was free from foreigners;
JOB.15.19	there was no one to lead them away from God.
JOB.15.20	The wicked who oppress others
JOB.15.20	will be in torment as long as they live.
JOB.15.21	Voices of terror will scream in their ears,
JOB.15.21	and robbers attack when they think they are safe.
JOB.15.22	They have no hope of escaping from darkness,
JOB.15.22	for somewhere a sword is waiting to kill them,
JOB.15.23	and vultures
JOB.15.23	They know their future is dark;
JOB.15.24	disaster, like a powerful king,
JOB.15.24	is waiting to attack them.
JOB.15.25	That is the fate of those
JOB.15.25	who shake their fists at God
JOB.15.25	and defy the Almighty.
JOB.15.26+JOB.15.27	They are proud and rebellious;
JOB.15.26+JOB.15.27	they stubbornly hold up their shields
JOB.15.26+JOB.15.27	and rush to fight against God.
JOB.15.28	They are the ones who captured cities
JOB.15.28	and seized houses whose owners had fled,
JOB.15.28	but war will destroy those cities and houses.
JOB.15.29	They will not remain rich for long;
JOB.15.29	nothing they own will last.
JOB.15.29	Even their shadows
JOB.15.30	and they will not escape from darkness.
JOB.15.30	They will be like trees
JOB.15.30	whose branches are burned by fire,
JOB.15.30	whose blossoms
JOB.15.31	If they are foolish enough to trust in evil,
JOB.15.31	then evil will be their reward.
JOB.15.32	Before their time is up they will wither,
JOB.15.32	wither like a branch and never be green again.
JOB.15.33	They will be like vines that lose their unripe grapes;
JOB.15.33	like olive trees that drop their blossoms.
JOB.15.34	There will be no descendants for godless people,
JOB.15.34	and fire will destroy the homes built by bribery.
JOB.15.35	These are the ones who plan trouble and do evil;
JOB.15.35	their hearts are always full of deceit.
JOB.16.1+JOB.16.2	I have heard words like that before;
JOB.16.1+JOB.16.2	the comfort you give is only torment.
JOB.16.3	Are you going to keep on talking forever?
JOB.16.3	Do you always have to have the last word?
JOB.16.4	If you were in my place and I in yours,
JOB.16.4	I could say everything you are saying.
JOB.16.4	I could shake my head wisely
JOB.16.4	and drown you with a flood of words.
JOB.16.5	I could strengthen you with advice
JOB.16.5	and keep talking to comfort you.
JOB.16.6	But nothing I say helps,
JOB.16.6	and being silent does not calm my pain.
JOB.16.7	You have worn me out, God;
JOB.16.7	you have let my family be killed.
JOB.16.8	You have seized me; you are my enemy.
JOB.16.8	I am skin and bones,
JOB.16.8	and people take that as proof of my guilt.
JOB.16.9	In anger God tears me limb from limb;
JOB.16.9	he glares at me with hate.
JOB.16.10	People sneer at me;
JOB.16.10	they crowd around me and slap my face.
JOB.16.11	God has handed me over to evil people.
JOB.16.12	I was living in peace,
JOB.16.12	but God took me by the throat
JOB.16.12	and battered me and crushed me.
JOB.16.12	God uses me for target practice
JOB.16.13	and shoots arrows at me from every side—
JOB.16.13	arrows that pierce and wound me;
JOB.16.13	and even then he shows no pity.
JOB.16.14	He wounds me again and again;
JOB.16.14	he attacks like a soldier gone mad with hate.
JOB.16.15	I mourn and wear clothes made of sackcloth,
JOB.16.15	and I sit here in the dust defeated.
JOB.16.16	I have cried until my face is red,
JOB.16.16	and my eyes are swollen and circled with shadows,
JOB.16.17	but I am not guilty of any violence,
JOB.16.17	and my prayer to God is sincere.
JOB.16.18	O Earth, don't hide the wrongs done to me!
JOB.16.18	Don't let my call for justice be silenced!
JOB.16.19	to stand up for me and take my side.
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me;
JOB.16.20	my eyes pour out tears to God.
JOB.16.21	I want someone to plead with God for me,
JOB.16.21	as one pleads for a friend.
JOB.16.22	My years are passing now,
JOB.16.22	and I walk the road of no return.
JOB.17.1	The end of my life is near. I can hardly breathe;
JOB.17.1	there is nothing left for me but the grave.
JOB.17.2	I watch how bitterly everyone mocks me.
JOB.17.3	I am being honest, God. Accept my word.
JOB.17.3	There is no one else to support what I say.
JOB.17.4	You have closed their minds to reason;
JOB.17.4	don't let them triumph over me now.
JOB.17.5	In the old proverb someone betrays his friends for money,
JOB.17.5	and his children suffer for it.
JOB.17.6	And now people use this proverb against me;
JOB.17.6	they come and spit in my face.
JOB.17.7	My grief has almost made me blind;
JOB.17.7	my arms and legs are as thin as shadows.
JOB.17.8	Those who claim to be honest are shocked,
JOB.17.8	and they all condemn me as godless.
JOB.17.9	Those who claim to be respectable
JOB.17.9	are more and more convinced they are right.
JOB.17.10	But if all of them came and stood before me,
JOB.17.10	I would not find even one of them wise.
JOB.17.11	My days have passed; my plans have failed;
JOB.17.11	my hope is gone.
JOB.17.12	But my friends say night is daylight;
JOB.17.12	they say that light is near,
JOB.17.12	but I know I remain in darkness.
JOB.17.13	My only hope is the world of the dead,
JOB.17.13	where I will lie down to sleep in the dark.
JOB.17.14	I will call the grave my father,
JOB.17.14	and the worms that eat me
JOB.17.14	I will call my mother and my sisters.
JOB.17.15	Where is there any hope for me?
JOB.17.15	Who sees any?
JOB.17.16	Hope will not go with me
JOB.17.16	when I go down to the world of the dead.
JOB.18.1+JOB.18.2	Job, can't people like you ever be quiet?
JOB.18.1+JOB.18.2	If you stopped to listen, we could talk to you.
JOB.18.3	What makes you think we are as stupid as cattle?
JOB.18.4	You are only hurting yourself with your anger.
JOB.18.4	Will the earth be deserted because you are angry?
JOB.18.4	Will God move mountains to satisfy you?
JOB.18.5	its flame will never burn again.
JOB.18.6	The lamp in their tents will be darkened.
JOB.18.7	Their steps were firm, but now they stumble;
JOB.18.7	they fall—victims of their own advice.
JOB.18.8	They walk into a net, and their feet are caught;
JOB.18.9	a trap catches their heels and holds them.
JOB.18.10	On the ground a snare is hidden;
JOB.18.10	a trap has been set in their path.
JOB.18.11	All around them terror is waiting;
JOB.18.11	it follows them at every step.
JOB.18.12	They used to be rich, but now they go hungry;
JOB.18.12	disaster stands and waits at their side.
JOB.18.13	A deadly disease spreads over their bodies
JOB.18.13	and causes their arms and legs to rot.
JOB.18.14	They are torn from the tents where they lived secure,
JOB.18.14	and are dragged off to face King Death.
JOB.18.15	Now anyone may live in their tents—
JOB.18.15	after sulfur is sprinkled to disinfect them!
JOB.18.16	Their roots and branches are withered and dry.
JOB.18.17	Their fame is ended at home and abroad;
JOB.18.17	no one remembers them any more.
JOB.18.18	They will be driven out of the land of the living,
JOB.18.18	driven from light into darkness.
JOB.18.19	They have no descendants, no survivors.
JOB.18.20	From east to west, all who hear of their fate
JOB.18.20	shudder and tremble with fear.
JOB.18.21	That is the fate of evil people,
JOB.18.21	the fate of those who care nothing for God.
JOB.19.1+JOB.19.2	Why do you keep tormenting me with words?
JOB.19.3	Time after time you insult me
JOB.19.3	and show no shame for the way you abuse me.
JOB.19.4	Even if I have done wrong,
JOB.19.4	how does that hurt you?
JOB.19.5	You think you are better than I am,
JOB.19.5	and regard my troubles as proof of my guilt.
JOB.19.6	Can't you see it is God who has done this?
JOB.19.6	He has set a trap to catch me.
JOB.19.7	I protest his violence,
JOB.19.7	but no one is listening;
JOB.19.7	no one hears my cry for justice.
JOB.19.8	God has blocked the way, and I can't get through;
JOB.19.8	he has hidden my path in darkness.
JOB.19.9	He has taken away all my wealth
JOB.19.9	and destroyed my reputation.
JOB.19.10	He batters me from every side.
JOB.19.10	He uproots my hope
JOB.19.10	and leaves me to wither and die.
JOB.19.11	God is angry and rages against me;
JOB.19.11	he treats me like his worst enemy.
JOB.19.12	He sends his army to attack me;
JOB.19.12	they dig trenches and lay siege to my tent.
JOB.19.13	God has made my own family forsake me;
JOB.19.13	I am a stranger to those who knew me;
JOB.19.14	my relatives and friends are gone.
JOB.19.15	Those who were guests in my house have forgotten me;
JOB.19.15	my servant women treat me like a stranger and a foreigner.
JOB.19.16	When I call a servant, he doesn't answer—
JOB.19.16	even when I beg him to help me.
JOB.19.17	My wife can't stand the smell of my breath,
JOB.19.17	and my own brothers won't come near me.
JOB.19.18	Children despise me and laugh when they see me.
JOB.19.19	those I loved most have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My skin hangs loose on my bones;
JOB.19.20	I have barely escaped with my life.
JOB.19.21	You are my friends! Take pity on me!
JOB.19.21	The hand of God has struck me down.
JOB.19.22	Why must you persecute me the way God does?
JOB.19.22	Haven't you tormented me enough?
JOB.19.23	How I wish that someone would remember my words
JOB.19.23	and record them in a book!
JOB.19.24	Or with a chisel carve my words in stone
JOB.19.24	and write them so that they would last forever.
JOB.19.25	But I know there is someone in heaven
JOB.19.25	who will come at last to my defense.
JOB.19.26	Even after my skin is eaten by disease,
JOB.19.26	while still in this body
JOB.19.27	I will see him with my own eyes,
JOB.19.27	and he will not be a stranger.
JOB.19.27	My courage failed because you said,
JOB.19.28	“How can we torment him?”
JOB.19.28	You looked for some excuse to attack me.
JOB.19.29	But now, be afraid of the sword—
JOB.19.29	the sword that brings God's wrath on sin,
JOB.19.29	so that you will know there is one who judges.
JOB.20.1+JOB.20.2	Job, you upset me. Now I'm impatient to answer.
JOB.20.3	What you have said is an insult,
JOB.20.3	but I know how to reply to you.
JOB.20.4	Surely you know that from ancient times,
JOB.20.4	when we humans were first placed on earth,
JOB.20.5	no wicked people have been happy for long.
JOB.20.6	They may grow great, towering to the sky,
JOB.20.6	so great that their heads reach the clouds,
JOB.20.7	but they will be blown away like dust.
JOB.20.7	Those who used to know them
JOB.20.7	will wonder where they have gone.
JOB.20.8	and never be seen again.
JOB.20.9	The wicked will disappear from the place where they used to live;
JOB.20.10	and their children will make good what they stole from the poor.
JOB.20.11	Their bodies used to be young and vigorous,
JOB.20.11	but soon they will turn to dust.
JOB.20.12+JOB.20.13	Evil tastes so good to them
JOB.20.12+JOB.20.13	that they keep some in their mouths to enjoy its flavor.
JOB.20.14	But in their stomachs the food turns bitter,
JOB.20.14	as bitter as any poison could be.
JOB.20.15	The wicked vomit up the wealth they stole;
JOB.20.15	God takes it back, even out of their stomachs.
JOB.20.16	What the evil people swallow is like poison;
JOB.20.16	it kills them like the bite of a deadly snake.
JOB.20.17	They will not live to see rivers of olive oil
JOB.20.17	or streams that flow with milk and honey.
JOB.20.18	They will have to give up all they have worked for;
JOB.20.18	they will have no chance to enjoy their wealth,
JOB.20.19	because they oppressed and neglected the poor
JOB.20.19	and seized houses someone else had built.
JOB.20.20	Their greed is never satisfied.
JOB.20.21	When they eat, there is nothing left over,
JOB.20.21	but now their prosperity comes to an end.
JOB.20.22	At the height of their success
JOB.20.22	all the weight of misery will crush them.
JOB.20.23	Let them eat all they want!
JOB.20.23	God will punish them in fury and anger.
JOB.20.24	a bronze bow will shoot them down.
JOB.20.25	Arrows stick through their bodies;
JOB.20.25	the shiny points drip with their blood,
JOB.20.25	and terror grips their hearts.
JOB.20.26	Everything they have saved is destroyed;
JOB.20.26	a fire not lit by human hands
JOB.20.26	burns them and all their family.
JOB.20.27	Heaven reveals their sin,
JOB.20.27	and the earth gives testimony against them.
JOB.20.28	All their wealth will be destroyed
JOB.20.28	in the flood of God's anger.
JOB.20.29	This is the fate of wicked people,
JOB.20.29	the fate that God assigns to them.
JOB.21.1+JOB.21.2	Listen to what I am saying;
JOB.21.1+JOB.21.2	that is all the comfort I ask from you.
JOB.21.3	Give me a chance to speak and then,
JOB.21.3	when I am through, sneer if you like.
JOB.21.4	My quarrel is not with mortals;
JOB.21.4	I have good reason to be impatient.
JOB.21.5	Look at me. Isn't that enough
JOB.21.5	to make you stare in shocked silence?
JOB.21.6	When I think of what has happened to me,
JOB.21.6	I am stunned, and I tremble and shake.
JOB.21.7	Why does God let evil people live,
JOB.21.7	let them grow old and prosper?
JOB.21.8	They have children and grandchildren,
JOB.21.8	and live to watch them all grow up.
JOB.21.9	God does not bring disaster on their homes;
JOB.21.9	they never have to live in terror.
JOB.21.10	Yes, all their cattle breed
JOB.21.10	and give birth without trouble.
JOB.21.11	Their children run and play like lambs
JOB.21.12	and dance to the music of harps and flutes.
JOB.21.13	They live out their lives in peace
JOB.21.13	and quietly die without suffering.
JOB.21.14	The wicked tell God to leave them alone;
JOB.21.14	they don't want to know his will for their lives.
JOB.21.15	They think there is no need to serve God
JOB.21.15	nor any advantage in praying to him.
JOB.21.16	They claim they succeed by their own strength,
JOB.21.16	but their way of thinking I can't accept.
JOB.21.17	Was a wicked person's light ever put out?
JOB.21.17	Did one of them ever meet with disaster?
JOB.21.17	Did God ever punish the wicked in anger
JOB.21.18	and blow them away like straw in the wind,
JOB.21.18	or like dust carried away in a storm?
JOB.21.19	You claim God punishes a child for the sins of his father.
JOB.21.19	No! Let God punish the sinners themselves;
JOB.21.19	let him show that he does it because of 
JOB.21.20	Let sinners bear their own punishment;
JOB.21.20	let them feel the wrath of Almighty God.
JOB.21.21	When our lives are over,
JOB.21.21	do we really care whether our children are happy?
JOB.21.22	Can anyone teach God,
JOB.21.22	who judges even those in high places?
JOB.21.23+JOB.21.24	Some people stay healthy till the day they die;
JOB.21.23+JOB.21.24	they die happy and at ease,
JOB.21.23+JOB.21.24	their bodies well-nourished.
JOB.21.25	Others have no happiness at all;
JOB.21.25	they live and die with bitter hearts.
JOB.21.26	But all alike die and are buried;
JOB.21.26	they all are covered with worms.
JOB.21.27	I know what spiteful thoughts you have.
JOB.21.28	You ask, “Where are the homes of great people now,
JOB.21.28	those who practiced evil?”
JOB.21.29	Haven't you talked with people who travel?
JOB.21.29	Don't you know the reports they bring back?
JOB.21.30	On the day God is angry and punishes,
JOB.21.30	it is the wicked who are always spared.
JOB.21.31	There is no one to accuse the wicked
JOB.21.31	or pay them back for all they have done.
JOB.21.32	When they are carried to the graveyard,
JOB.21.32	to their well-guarded tombs,
JOB.21.33	thousands join the funeral procession,
JOB.21.33	and even the earth lies gently on their bodies.
JOB.21.34	And you! You try to comfort me with nonsense!
JOB.21.34	Every answer you give is a lie!
JOB.22.1+JOB.22.2	who could ever be of use to God?
JOB.22.3	Does your doing right benefit God,
JOB.22.3	or does your being good help him at all?
JOB.22.4	It is not because you stand in awe of God
JOB.22.4	that he reprimands you and brings you to trial.
JOB.22.5	No, it's because you have sinned so much;
JOB.22.5	it's because of all the evil you do.
JOB.22.6	To make a brother repay you the money he owed,
JOB.22.6	you took away his clothes and left him nothing to wear.
JOB.22.7	You refused water to those who were tired,
JOB.22.7	and refused to feed those who were hungry.
JOB.22.8	You used your power and your position
JOB.22.8	to take over the whole land.
JOB.22.9	You not only refused to help widows,
JOB.22.9	but you also robbed and mistreated orphans.
JOB.22.10	So now there are pitfalls all around you,
JOB.22.10	and suddenly you are full of fear.
JOB.22.11	It has grown so dark that you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	and a flood overwhelms you.
JOB.22.12	Doesn't God live in the highest heavens
JOB.22.12	and look down on the stars, even though they are high?
JOB.22.13	And yet you ask, “What does God know?
JOB.22.13	He is hidden by clouds—how can he judge us?”
JOB.22.14	You think the thick clouds keep him from seeing,
JOB.22.14	as he walks on the dome of the sky.
JOB.22.15	Are you determined to walk in the paths
JOB.22.15	that evil people have always followed?
JOB.22.16	Even before their time had come,
JOB.22.16	they were washed away by a flood.
JOB.22.17	These are the ones who rejected God
JOB.22.17	and believed that he could do nothing to them.
JOB.22.18	And yet it was God who made them prosperous—
JOB.22.18	I can't understand the thoughts of the wicked.
JOB.22.19	Good people are glad and the innocent laugh
JOB.22.19	when they see the wicked punished.
JOB.22.20	All that the wicked own is destroyed,
JOB.22.20	and fire burns up anything that is left.
JOB.22.21	Now, Job, make peace with God
JOB.22.21	and stop treating him like an enemy;
JOB.22.21	if you do, then he will bless you.
JOB.22.22	Accept the teaching he gives;
JOB.22.22	keep his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	Yes, you must humbly
JOB.22.23	and put an end to all the evil
JOB.22.23	that is done in your house.
JOB.22.24	Throw away your gold;
JOB.22.24	dump your finest gold in the dry stream bed.
JOB.22.25	Let Almighty God be your gold,
JOB.22.25	and let him be silver, piled high for you.
JOB.22.26	Then you will always trust in God
JOB.22.26	and find that he is the source of your joy.
JOB.22.27	When you pray, he will answer you,
JOB.22.27	and you will keep the vows you made.
JOB.22.28	You will succeed in all you do,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your path.
JOB.22.29	God brings down the proud
JOB.22.29	and saves the humble.
JOB.22.30	He will rescue you if you are innocent,
JOB.22.30	if what you do is right.
JOB.23.1+JOB.23.2	I still rebel and complain against God;
JOB.23.1+JOB.23.2	I cannot keep from groaning.
JOB.23.3	How I wish I knew where to find him,
JOB.23.3	and knew how to go where he is.
JOB.23.4	I would state my case before him
JOB.23.4	and present all the arguments in my favor.
JOB.23.5	I want to know what he would say
JOB.23.5	and how he would answer me.
JOB.23.6	Would God use all his strength against me?
JOB.23.6	No, he would listen as I spoke.
JOB.23.7	I am honest; I could reason with God;
JOB.23.7	he would declare me innocent
JOB.23.8	I have searched in the East, but God is not there;
JOB.23.8	I have not found him when I searched in the West.
JOB.23.9	God has been at work in the North and the South,
JOB.23.9	but still I have not seen him.
JOB.23.10	Yet God knows every step I take;
JOB.23.10	if he tests me, he will find me pure.
JOB.23.11	I follow faithfully the road he chooses,
JOB.23.11	and never wander to either side.
JOB.23.12	I always do what God commands;
JOB.23.12	I follow his will, not my own desires.
JOB.23.13	He never changes. No one can oppose him
JOB.23.13	or stop him from doing what he wants to do.
JOB.23.14	He will fulfill what he has planned for me;
JOB.23.14	that plan is just one of the many he has;
JOB.23.15	I tremble with fear before him.
JOB.23.16+JOB.23.17	Almighty God has destroyed my courage.
JOB.23.16+JOB.23.17	It is God, not the dark, that makes me afraid—
JOB.23.16+JOB.23.17	even though the darkness has made me blind.
JOB.24.1	Why doesn't God set a time for judging,
JOB.24.1	a day of justice for those who serve him?
JOB.24.2	People move property lines to get more land;
JOB.24.2	they steal sheep and put them with their own flocks.
JOB.24.3	They take donkeys that belong to orphans,
JOB.24.3	and keep a widow's ox till she pays her debts.
JOB.24.4	They prevent the poor from getting their rights
JOB.24.4	and force the needy to run and hide.
JOB.24.5	So the poor, like wild donkeys,
JOB.24.5	search for food in the dry wilderness;
JOB.24.5	nowhere else can they find food for their children.
JOB.24.6	They have to harvest fields they don't own,
JOB.24.6	and gather grapes in vineyards of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	At night they sleep with nothing to cover them,
JOB.24.7	nothing to keep them from the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are drenched by the rain that falls on the mountains,
JOB.24.8	and they huddle beside the rocks for shelter.
JOB.24.9	Evil people make slaves of fatherless infants
JOB.24.9	and take the children of the poor in payment for debts.
JOB.24.10	But the poor must go out with no clothes to protect them;
JOB.24.10	they must go hungry while harvesting wheat.
JOB.24.11	They press olives for oil, and grapes for wine,
JOB.24.11	but they themselves are thirsty.
JOB.24.12	In the cities the wounded and dying cry out,
JOB.24.12	but God ignores their prayers.
JOB.24.13	There are those who reject the light;
JOB.24.13	they don't understand it or go where it leads.
JOB.24.14	At dawn the murderer gets up
JOB.24.14	and goes out to kill the poor,
JOB.24.14	and at night he steals.
JOB.24.15	The adulterer waits for twilight to come;
JOB.24.15	he covers his face so that no one can see him.
JOB.24.16	At night thieves break into houses,
JOB.24.16	but by day they hide and avoid the light.
JOB.24.17	They fear the light of day,
JOB.24.17	but darkness holds no terror for them.
JOB.24.18	The wicked are swept away by floods,
JOB.24.18	and the land they own is under God's curse;
JOB.24.18	they no longer go to work in their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	As snow vanishes in heat and drought,
JOB.24.19	so sinners vanish from the land of the living.
JOB.24.20	Not even their mothers remember them now;
JOB.24.20	they are eaten by worms and destroyed like fallen trees.
JOB.24.21	That happens because they mistreated widows
JOB.24.21	and showed no kindness to childless women.
JOB.24.22	God, in his strength, destroys the mighty;
JOB.24.22	God acts—and the wicked die.
JOB.24.23	God may let them live secure,
JOB.24.23	but keeps an eye on them all the time.
JOB.24.24	For a while the wicked prosper,
JOB.24.24	but then they wither like weeds,
JOB.24.24	like stalks of grain that have been cut down.
JOB.24.25	Can anyone deny that this is so?
JOB.24.25	Can anyone prove that my words are not true?
JOB.25.1+JOB.25.2	God is powerful; all must stand in awe of him;
JOB.25.1+JOB.25.2	he keeps his heavenly kingdom in peace.
JOB.25.3	Can anyone count the angels who serve him?
JOB.25.3	Is there any place where God's light does not shine?
JOB.25.4	Can anyone be righteous or pure in God's sight?
JOB.25.5	In his eyes even the moon is not bright,
JOB.25.5	or the stars pure.
JOB.25.6	Then what about a human being, that worm, that insect?
JOB.25.6	What is a human life worth in God's eyes?
JOB.26.1+JOB.26.2	What a big help you are to me—
JOB.26.1+JOB.26.2	poor, weak man that I am!
JOB.26.3	You give such good advice
JOB.26.3	and share your knowledge with a fool like me!
JOB.26.4	Who do you think will hear all your words?
JOB.26.4	Who inspired you to speak like this?
JOB.26.5	The spirits of the dead tremble
JOB.26.5	in the waters under the earth.
JOB.26.6	The world of the dead lies open to God;
JOB.26.6	no covering shields it from his sight.
JOB.26.7	God stretched out the northern sky
JOB.26.7	and hung the earth in empty space.
JOB.26.8	It is God who fills the clouds with water
JOB.26.8	and keeps them from bursting with the weight.
JOB.26.9	He hides the full moon behind a cloud.
JOB.26.10	He divided light from darkness
JOB.26.10	by a circle drawn on the face of the sea.
JOB.26.11	When he threatens the pillars that hold up the sky,
JOB.26.11	they shake and tremble with fear.
JOB.26.12	It is his strength that conquered the sea;
JOB.26.12	by his skill he destroyed the monster Rahab.
JOB.26.13	It is his breath that made the sky clear,
JOB.26.13	and his hand that killed the escaping monster.
JOB.26.14	But these are only hints of his power,
JOB.26.14	only the whispers that we have heard.
JOB.26.14	Who can know how truly great God is?
JOB.27.1+JOB.27.2	I swear by the living Almighty God,
JOB.27.1+JOB.27.2	who refuses me justice and makes my life bitter—
JOB.27.3	as long as God gives me breath,
JOB.27.4	my lips will never say anything evil,
JOB.27.4	my tongue will never tell a lie.
JOB.27.5	I will never say that you men are right;
JOB.27.5	I will insist on my innocence to my dying day.
JOB.27.6	I will never give up my claim to be right;
JOB.27.6	my conscience is clear.
JOB.27.7	May all who oppose me and fight against me
JOB.27.7	be punished like the wicked and the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	What hope is there for the godless
JOB.27.8	in the hour when God demands their life?
JOB.27.9	When trouble comes, will God hear their cries?
JOB.27.10	They should have desired the joy he gives;
JOB.27.10	they should have constantly prayed to him.
JOB.27.11	Let me teach you how great is God's power,
JOB.27.11	and explain what Almighty God has planned.
JOB.27.12	But no, after all, you have seen for yourselves;
JOB.27.12	so why do you talk such nonsense?
JOB.27.13	This is how Almighty God
JOB.27.13	punishes wicked, violent people.
JOB.27.14	They may have many sons,
JOB.27.14	but all will be killed in war;
JOB.27.14	their children never have enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive will die from disease,
JOB.27.15	and even their widows will not mourn their death.
JOB.27.16	The wicked may have too much silver to count
JOB.27.16	and more clothes than anyone needs;
JOB.27.17	but some good person will wear the clothes,
JOB.27.17	and someone honest will get the silver.
JOB.27.18	The wicked build houses like a spider's web
JOB.27.18	or like the hut of a slave guarding the fields.
JOB.27.19	One last time
JOB.27.19	and when they wake up, they will find their wealth gone.
JOB.27.20	Terror will strike like a sudden flood;
JOB.27.20	a wind in the night will blow them away;
JOB.27.21	the east wind will sweep them from their homes;
JOB.27.22	it will blow down on them without pity
JOB.27.22	while they try their best to escape.
JOB.27.23	The wind howls at them as they run,
JOB.27.23	frightening them with destructive power.
JOB.28.1	There are mines where silver is dug;
JOB.28.1	There are places where gold is refined.
JOB.28.2	We dig iron out of the ground
JOB.28.2	And melt copper out of the stones.
JOB.28.3	Miners explore the deepest darkness.
JOB.28.3	They search the depths of the earth
JOB.28.3	And dig for rocks in the darkness.
JOB.28.4	Far from where anyone lives
JOB.28.4	Or human feet ever travel,
JOB.28.4	They dig the shafts of mines.
JOB.28.4	There they work in loneliness,
JOB.28.4	Clinging to ropes in the pits.
JOB.28.5	Food grows out of the earth,
JOB.28.5	But underneath the same earth
JOB.28.5	All is torn up and crushed.
JOB.28.6	The stones of the earth contain sapphires,
JOB.28.6	And its dust contains gold.
JOB.28.7	No hawk sees the roads to the mines,
JOB.28.7	And no vulture ever flies over them.
JOB.28.8	No lion or other fierce beast
JOB.28.8	Ever travels those lonely roads.
JOB.28.9	Miners dig the hardest rocks,
JOB.28.9	Dig mountains away at their base.
JOB.28.10	As they tunnel through the rocks,
JOB.28.10	They discover precious stones.
JOB.28.11	They dig to the sources of
JOB.28.11	And bring to light what is hidden.
JOB.28.12	Where can we learn to understand?
JOB.28.13	No one knows its true value.
JOB.28.14	The depths of the oceans and seas
JOB.28.14	Say that wisdom is not found there.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be bought with silver or gold.
JOB.28.16	The finest gold and jewels
JOB.28.16	Cannot equal its value.
JOB.28.17	It is worth more than gold,
JOB.28.17	Than a gold vase or finest glass.
JOB.28.18	The value of wisdom is more
JOB.28.18	Than coral or crystal or rubies.
JOB.28.19	The finest topaz and the purest gold
JOB.28.19	Cannot compare with the value of wisdom.
JOB.28.20	Where, then, is the source of wisdom?
JOB.28.20	Where can we learn to understand?
JOB.28.21	No living creature can see it,
JOB.28.21	Not even a bird in flight.
JOB.28.22	Even death and destruction
JOB.28.22	Admit they have heard only rumors.
JOB.28.23	Knows the place where wisdom is found,
JOB.28.24	Because he sees the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.24	Sees everything under the sky.
JOB.28.25	When God gave the wind its power
JOB.28.25	And determined the size of the sea;
JOB.28.26	When God decided where the rain would fall,
JOB.28.26	And the path that the thunderclouds travel;
JOB.28.27	He gave it his approval.
JOB.28.28	“To be wise, you must have reverence for the Lord.
JOB.28.28	To understand, you must turn from evil.”
JOB.29.1	Job began speaking again.
JOB.29.2	If only my life could once again
JOB.29.2	be as it was when God watched over me.
JOB.29.3	God was always with me then
JOB.29.3	and gave me light as I walked through the darkness.
JOB.29.4	Those were the days when I was prosperous,
JOB.29.4	and the friendship of God protected my home.
JOB.29.5	Almighty God was with me then,
JOB.29.5	and I was surrounded by all my children.
JOB.29.6	My cows and goats gave plenty of milk,
JOB.29.6	and my olive trees grew in the rockiest soil.
JOB.29.7	Whenever the city elders met
JOB.29.7	and I took my place among them,
JOB.29.8	young men stepped aside as soon as they saw me,
JOB.29.8	and old men stood up to show me respect.
JOB.29.9	The leaders of the people would stop talking;
JOB.29.10	even the most important men kept silent.
JOB.29.11	Everyone who saw me or heard of me
JOB.29.11	had good things to say about what I had done.
JOB.29.12	When the poor cried out, I helped them;
JOB.29.12	I gave help to orphans who had nowhere to turn.
JOB.29.13	People who were in deepest misery praised me,
JOB.29.13	and I helped widows find security.
JOB.29.14	I have always acted justly and fairly.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes for the blind,
JOB.29.15	and feet for the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was like a father to the poor
JOB.29.16	and took the side of strangers in trouble.
JOB.29.17	I destroyed the power of cruel men
JOB.29.17	and rescued their victims.
JOB.29.18	I always expected to live a long life
JOB.29.18	and to die at home in comfort.
JOB.29.19	I was like a tree whose roots always have water
JOB.29.19	and whose branches are wet with dew.
JOB.29.20	Everyone was always praising me,
JOB.29.20	and my strength never failed me.
JOB.29.21	When I gave advice, people were silent
JOB.29.21	and listened carefully to what I said;
JOB.29.22	they had nothing to add when I had finished.
JOB.29.22	My words sank in like drops of rain;
JOB.29.23	everyone welcomed them
JOB.29.23	just as farmers welcome rain in spring.
JOB.29.24	I smiled on them when they had lost confidence;
JOB.29.24	my cheerful face encouraged them.
JOB.29.25	I took charge and made the decisions;
JOB.29.25	I led them as a king leads his troops,
JOB.29.25	and gave them comfort in their despair.
JOB.30.1	But men younger than I am make fun of me now!
JOB.30.1	Their fathers have always been so worthless
JOB.30.1	that I wouldn't let them help my dogs guard sheep.
JOB.30.2	They were a bunch of worn-out men,
JOB.30.2	too weak to do any work for me.
JOB.30.3	They were so poor and hungry
JOB.30.3	that they would gnaw dry roots—
JOB.30.3	at night, in wild, desolate places.
JOB.30.4	They pulled up the plants of the desert and ate them,
JOB.30.4	even the tasteless roots of the broom tree!
JOB.30.5	Everyone drove them away with shouts,
JOB.30.5	as if they were shouting at thieves.
JOB.30.6	They had to live in caves,
JOB.30.6	in holes dug in the sides of cliffs.
JOB.30.7	Out in the wilds they howled like animals
JOB.30.7	and huddled together under the bushes.
JOB.30.8	A worthless bunch of nameless nobodies!
JOB.30.8	They were driven out of the land.
JOB.30.9	Now they come and laugh at me;
JOB.30.9	I am nothing but a joke to them.
JOB.30.10	They treat me with disgust;
JOB.30.10	they think they are too good for me,
JOB.30.10	and even come and spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Because God has made me weak and helpless,
JOB.30.11	they turn against me with all their fury.
JOB.30.12	This mob attacks me head-on;
JOB.30.12	they send me running; they prepare their final assault.
JOB.30.13	They cut off my escape and try to destroy me;
JOB.30.13	and there is no one to stop
JOB.30.14	They pour through the holes in my defenses
JOB.30.14	and come crashing down on top of me;
JOB.30.15	I am overcome with terror;
JOB.30.15	my dignity is gone like a puff of wind,
JOB.30.15	and my prosperity like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	Now I am about to die;
JOB.30.16	there is no relief for my suffering.
JOB.30.17	At night my bones all ache;
JOB.30.17	the pain that gnaws me never stops.
JOB.30.18	God seizes me by my collar
JOB.30.18	and twists my clothes out of shape.
JOB.30.19	He throws me down in the mud;
JOB.30.19	I am no better than dirt.
JOB.30.20	I call to you, O God, but you never answer;
JOB.30.20	and when I pray, you pay no attention.
JOB.30.21	You are treating me cruelly;
JOB.30.21	you persecute me with all your power.
JOB.30.22	You let the wind blow me away;
JOB.30.22	you toss me about in a raging storm.
JOB.30.23	I know you are taking me off to my death,
JOB.30.23	to the fate in store for everyone.
JOB.30.24	Why do you attack a ruined man,
JOB.30.24	one who can do nothing but beg for pity?
JOB.30.25	Didn't I weep with people in trouble
JOB.30.25	and feel sorry for those in need?
JOB.30.26	I hoped for happiness and light,
JOB.30.26	but trouble and darkness came instead.
JOB.30.27	I am torn apart by worry and pain;
JOB.30.27	I have had day after day of suffering.
JOB.30.28	I go about in gloom, without any sunshine;
JOB.30.28	I stand up in public and plead for help.
JOB.30.29	My voice is as sad and lonely
JOB.30.29	as the cries of a jackal or an ostrich.
JOB.30.30	My skin has turned dark; I am burning with fever.
JOB.30.31	Where once I heard joyful music,
JOB.30.31	now I hear only mourning and weeping.
JOB.31.1	I have made a solemn promise
JOB.31.1	never to look with lust at a woman.
JOB.31.2	What does Almighty God do to us?
JOB.31.2	How does he repay human deeds?
JOB.31.3	He sends disaster and ruin
JOB.31.3	to those who do wrong.
JOB.31.4	God knows everything I do;
JOB.31.4	he sees every step I take.
JOB.31.5	I swear I have never acted wickedly
JOB.31.5	and never tried to deceive others.
JOB.31.6	Let God weigh me on honest scales,
JOB.31.6	and he will see how innocent I am.
JOB.31.7	If I have turned from the right path
JOB.31.7	or let myself be attracted to evil,
JOB.31.7	if my hands are stained with sin,
JOB.31.8	then let my crops be destroyed,
JOB.31.8	or let others eat the food I grow.
JOB.31.9	If I have been attracted to my neighbor's wife,
JOB.31.9	and waited, hidden, outside her door,
JOB.31.10	then let my wife cook another man's food
JOB.31.10	and sleep in another man's bed.
JOB.31.11	Such wickedness should be punished by death.
JOB.31.12	It would be like a destructive, hellish fire,
JOB.31.12	consuming everything I have.
JOB.31.13	When any of my servants complained against me,
JOB.31.13	I would listen and treat them fairly.
JOB.31.14	If I did not, how could I then face God?
JOB.31.14	What could I say when God came to judge me?
JOB.31.15	The same God who created me
JOB.31.15	created my servants also.
JOB.31.16	never have I let widows live in despair
JOB.31.17	or let orphans go hungry while I ate.
JOB.31.18	All my life I have taken care of them.
JOB.31.19	When I found someone in need,
JOB.31.19	too poor to buy clothes,
JOB.31.20	I would give him clothing made of wool
JOB.31.20	that had come from my own flock of sheep.
JOB.31.20	Then he would praise me with all his heart.
JOB.31.21	If I have ever cheated an orphan,
JOB.31.21	knowing I could win in court,
JOB.31.22	then may my arms be broken;
JOB.31.22	may they be torn from my shoulders.
JOB.31.23	Because I fear God's punishment,
JOB.31.23	I could never do such a thing.
JOB.31.25	or taken pride in my wealth.
JOB.31.26	I have never worshiped the sun in its brightness
JOB.31.26	or the moon in all its beauty.
JOB.31.27	I have not been led astray to honor them
JOB.31.27	by kissing my hand in reverence to them.
JOB.31.28	Such a sin should be punished by death;
JOB.31.28	it denies Almighty God.
JOB.31.29	I have never been glad when my enemies suffered,
JOB.31.29	or pleased when they met with disaster;
JOB.31.30	I never sinned by praying for their death.
JOB.31.31	All those who work for me know
JOB.31.31	that I have always welcomed strangers.
JOB.31.32	I invited travelers into my home
JOB.31.32	and never let them sleep in the streets.
JOB.31.33	Others try to hide their sins,
JOB.31.33	but I have never concealed mine.
JOB.31.34	I have never feared what people would say;
JOB.31.34	I have never kept quiet or stayed indoors
JOB.31.34	because I feared their scorn.
JOB.31.35	Will no one listen to what I am saying?
JOB.31.35	I swear that every word is true.
JOB.31.35	Let Almighty God answer me.
JOB.31.35	If the charges my opponent brings against me
JOB.31.35	were written down so that I could see them,
JOB.31.36	I would wear them proudly on my shoulder
JOB.31.36	and place them on my head like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would tell God everything I have done,
JOB.31.37	and hold my head high in his presence.
JOB.31.38	If I have stolen the land I farm
JOB.31.38	and taken it from its rightful owners—
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten the food that grew there
JOB.31.39	but let the farmers that grew it starve—
JOB.31.40	then instead of wheat and barley,
JOB.31.40	may weeds and thistles grow.
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	Because Job was convinced of his own innocence, the three men gave up trying to answer him. 
JOB.32.2	But a bystander named Elihu could not control his anger any longer, because Job was justifying himself and blaming God. (Elihu was the son of Barakel, a descendant of Buz, and belonged to the clan of Ram.) 
JOB.32.3	He was also angry with Job's three friends. They could not find any way to answer Job, and this made it appear that God was in the wrong. 
JOB.32.4	Because Elihu was the youngest one there, he had waited until everyone finished speaking. 
JOB.32.5	When he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he was angry 
JOB.32.6	and began to speak.
JOB.32.6	I am young, and you are old,
JOB.32.6	so I was afraid to tell you what I think.
JOB.32.7	I told myself that you ought to speak,
JOB.32.7	that you older men should share your wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But it is the spirit of Almighty God
JOB.32.8	that comes to us and gives us wisdom.
JOB.32.9	It is not growing old that makes us wise
JOB.32.9	or helps us to know what is right.
JOB.32.10	So now I want you to listen to me;
JOB.32.10	let me tell you what I think.
JOB.32.11	I listened patiently while you were speaking
JOB.32.11	and waited while you searched for wise phrases.
JOB.32.12	I paid close attention and heard you fail;
JOB.32.12	you have not disproved what Job has said.
JOB.32.13	How can you claim you have discovered wisdom?
JOB.32.13	God must answer Job, for you have failed.
JOB.32.14	Job was speaking to you, not to me,
JOB.32.14	but I would never answer the way you did.
JOB.32.15	Words have failed them, Job;
JOB.32.15	they have no answer for you.
JOB.32.16	Shall I go on waiting when they are silent?
JOB.32.16	They stand there with nothing more to say.
JOB.32.17	No, I will give my own answer now
JOB.32.17	and tell you what I think.
JOB.32.18	I can hardly wait to speak.
JOB.32.18	I can't hold back the words.
JOB.32.19	If I don't get a chance to speak,
JOB.32.19	I will burst like a wineskin full of new wine.
JOB.32.20	I can't stand it; I have to speak.
JOB.32.21	I will not take sides in this debate;
JOB.32.21	I am not going to flatter anyone.
JOB.32.22	I don't know how to flatter,
JOB.32.22	and God would quickly punish me if I did.
JOB.33.1	And now, Job, listen carefully
JOB.33.1	to all that I have to say.
JOB.33.2	I am ready to say what's on my mind.
JOB.33.3	All my words are sincere,
JOB.33.3	and I am speaking the truth.
JOB.33.4	God's spirit made me and gave me life.
JOB.33.5	Answer me if you can. Prepare your arguments.
JOB.33.6	You and I are the same in God's sight,
JOB.33.6	both of us were formed from clay.
JOB.33.7	So you have no reason to fear me;
JOB.33.7	I will not overpower you.
JOB.33.8	Now this is what I heard you say:
JOB.33.9	“I am not guilty; I have done nothing wrong.
JOB.33.9	I am innocent and free from sin.
JOB.33.10	But God finds excuses for attacking me
JOB.33.10	and treats me like an enemy.
JOB.33.11	he watches every move I make.”
JOB.33.12	But I tell you, Job, you are wrong.
JOB.33.12	God is greater than any human being.
JOB.33.13	Why do you accuse God
JOB.33.13	of never answering our complaints?
JOB.33.14	Although God speaks again and again,
JOB.33.14	no one pays attention to what he says.
JOB.33.15	God speaks in dreams and visions.
JOB.33.16	He makes them listen to what he says,
JOB.33.16	and they are frightened at his warnings.
JOB.33.17	God speaks to make them stop their sinning
JOB.33.17	and to save them from becoming proud.
JOB.33.18	He will not let them be destroyed;
JOB.33.18	he saves them from death itself.
JOB.33.19	God corrects us by sending sickness
JOB.33.19	and filling our bodies with pain.
JOB.33.20	Those who are sick lose their appetites,
JOB.33.20	and even the finest food looks revolting.
JOB.33.21	Their bodies waste away to nothing;
JOB.33.21	you can see all their bones;
JOB.33.22	they are about to go to the world of the dead.
JOB.33.23	Perhaps an angel may come to their aid—
JOB.33.23	one of God's thousands of angels,
JOB.33.23	who remind us of our duty.
JOB.33.24	In mercy the angel will say, “Release them!
JOB.33.24	They are not to go down to the world of the dead.
JOB.33.24	Here is the ransom to set them free.”
JOB.33.25	Their bodies will grow young and strong again;
JOB.33.26	when they pray, God will answer;
JOB.33.26	they will worship God with joy;
JOB.33.26	God will set things right for them again.
JOB.33.27	Each one will say in public, “I have sinned.
JOB.33.27	I have not done right, but God spared me.
JOB.33.28	He kept me from going to the world of the dead,
JOB.33.28	and I am still alive.”
JOB.33.29	God does all this again and again;
JOB.33.30	each one saves a person's life,
JOB.33.30	and gives him the joy of living.
JOB.33.31	Now, Job, listen to what I am saying;
JOB.33.31	be quiet and let me speak.
JOB.33.32	But if you have something to say, let me hear it;
JOB.33.32	I would gladly admit you are in the right.
JOB.33.33	But if not, be quiet and listen to me,
JOB.33.33	and I will teach you how to be wise.
JOB.34.1+JOB.34.2	You men are so wise, so clever;
JOB.34.1+JOB.34.2	listen now to what I am saying.
JOB.34.3	You know good food when you taste it,
JOB.34.3	but not wise words when you hear them.
JOB.34.4	It is up to us to decide the case.
JOB.34.5	Job claims that he is innocent,
JOB.34.5	that God refuses to give him justice.
JOB.34.6	He asks, “How could I lie and say I am wrong?
JOB.34.6	I am fatally wounded, but I am sinless.”
JOB.34.7	Have you ever seen anyone like this man Job?
JOB.34.7	He never shows respect for God.
JOB.34.8	He likes the company of evil people
JOB.34.8	and goes around with sinners.
JOB.34.9	He says that it never does any good
JOB.34.9	to try to follow God's will.
JOB.34.10	Listen to me, you men who understand!
JOB.34.10	Will Almighty God do what is wrong?
JOB.34.11	and treats them as they deserve.
JOB.34.12	Almighty God does not do evil;
JOB.34.12	he is never unjust to anyone.
JOB.34.13	Did God get his power from someone else?
JOB.34.13	Did someone put him in charge of the world?
JOB.34.14	If God took back the breath of life,
JOB.34.15	then everyone living would die
JOB.34.15	and turn into dust again.
JOB.34.16	Now listen to me, if you are wise.
JOB.34.17	Are you condemning the righteous God?
JOB.34.17	Do you think that 
JOB.34.18	God condemns kings and rulers
JOB.34.18	when they are worthless or wicked.
JOB.34.19	He does not take the side of rulers
JOB.34.19	nor favor the rich over the poor,
JOB.34.19	for he created everyone.
JOB.34.20	We may suddenly die at night.
JOB.34.20	God strikes us down and we perish;
JOB.34.20	he kills the mighty with no effort at all.
JOB.34.21	He watches every step we take.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness dark enough
JOB.34.22	to hide a sinner from God.
JOB.34.23	God does not need to set a time
JOB.34.23	for us to go and be judged by him.
JOB.34.24	He does not need an investigation
JOB.34.24	to remove leaders and replace them with others.
JOB.34.25	Because he knows what they do;
JOB.34.25	he overthrows them and crushes them by night.
JOB.34.26	He punishes sinners where all can see it,
JOB.34.27	because they have stopped following him
JOB.34.27	and ignored all his commands.
JOB.34.28	They forced the poor to cry out to God,
JOB.34.28	and he heard their calls for help.
JOB.34.29	If God decided to do nothing at all,
JOB.34.29	no one could criticize him.
JOB.34.29	If he hid his face, we would be helpless.
JOB.34.30	There would be nothing that nations could do
JOB.34.30	to keep godless oppressors from ruling them.
JOB.34.31	Job, have you confessed your sins to God
JOB.34.31	and promised not to sin again?
JOB.34.32	Have you asked God to show you your faults,
JOB.34.32	and have you agreed to stop doing evil?
JOB.34.33	Since you object to what God does,
JOB.34.33	can you expect him to do what you want?
JOB.34.33	The decision is yours, not mine;
JOB.34.33	tell us now what you think.
JOB.34.34	Any sensible person will surely agree;
JOB.34.34	and the wise who hear me will say
JOB.34.35	that Job is speaking from ignorance
JOB.34.35	and that nothing he says makes sense.
JOB.34.36	Think through everything that Job says;
JOB.34.36	you will see that he talks like an evil man.
JOB.34.37	To his sins he adds rebellion;
JOB.34.37	in front of us all he mocks God.
JOB.35.1+JOB.35.2	It is not right, Job, for you to say
JOB.35.1+JOB.35.2	that you are innocent in God's sight,
JOB.35.3	or to ask God, “How does my sin affect you?
JOB.35.3	What have I gained by not sinning?”
JOB.35.4	I am going to answer you and your friends too.
JOB.35.5	Look at the sky! See how high the clouds are!
JOB.35.6	If you do wrong many times, does that affect him?
JOB.35.7	Do you help God by being so righteous?
JOB.35.7	There is nothing God needs from you.
JOB.35.8	Others suffer from your sins,
JOB.35.8	and the good you do helps them.
JOB.35.9	When people are oppressed, they groan;
JOB.35.9	they cry for someone to save them.
JOB.35.10	But they don't turn to God, their Creator,
JOB.35.10	who gives them hope in their darkest hours.
JOB.35.11	They don't turn to God, who makes us wise,
JOB.35.11	wiser than any animal or bird.
JOB.35.12	They cry for help, but God doesn't answer,
JOB.35.12	for they are proud and evil.
JOB.35.13	It is useless for them to cry out;
JOB.35.13	Almighty God does not see or hear them.
JOB.35.14	Job, you say you can't see God;
JOB.35.14	but wait patiently—your case is before him.
JOB.35.15	You think that God does not punish,
JOB.35.15	that he pays little attention to sin.
JOB.35.16	It is useless for you to go on talking;
JOB.35.16	it is clear you don't know what you are saying.
JOB.36.1+JOB.36.2	Be patient and listen a little longer
JOB.36.1+JOB.36.2	to what I am saying on God's behalf.
JOB.36.3	My knowledge is wide; I will use what I know
JOB.36.3	to show that God, my Creator, is just.
JOB.36.4	Nothing I say to you is false;
JOB.36.4	you see before you a truly wise man.
JOB.36.5	How strong God is! He despises no one;
JOB.36.5	there is nothing he doesn't understand.
JOB.36.6	He does not let sinners live on,
JOB.36.6	and he always treats the poor with justice.
JOB.36.7	He protects those who are righteous;
JOB.36.7	he allows them to rule like kings
JOB.36.7	and lets them be honored forever.
JOB.36.8	But if people are bound in chains,
JOB.36.8	suffering for what they have done,
JOB.36.9	God shows them their sins and their pride.
JOB.36.10	He makes them listen to his warning
JOB.36.10	to turn away from evil.
JOB.36.11	If they obey God and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they live out their lives in peace and prosperity.
JOB.36.12	But if not, they will die in ignorance
JOB.36.12	and cross the stream into the world of the dead.
JOB.36.13	Those who are godless keep on being angry,
JOB.36.13	and even when punished, they don't pray for help.
JOB.36.14	They die while they are still young,
JOB.36.14	worn out by a life of disgrace.
JOB.36.15	But God teaches people through suffering
JOB.36.15	and uses distress to open their eyes.
JOB.36.16	God brought you out of trouble,
JOB.36.16	and let you enjoy security;
JOB.36.16	your table was piled high with food.
JOB.36.17	But now you are being punished as you deserve.
JOB.36.18	Be careful not to let bribes deceive you,
JOB.36.18	or riches lead you astray.
JOB.36.19	It will do you no good to cry out for help;
JOB.36.19	all your strength can't help you now.
JOB.36.20	Don't wish for night to come,
JOB.36.20	the time when nations will perish.
JOB.36.21	Be careful not to turn to evil;
JOB.36.21	your suffering was sent to keep you from it.
JOB.36.22	Remember how great is God's power;
JOB.36.22	he is the greatest teacher of all.
JOB.36.23	No one can tell God what to do
JOB.36.23	or accuse him of doing evil.
JOB.36.24	He has always been praised for what he does;
JOB.36.24	you also must praise him.
JOB.36.25	Everyone has seen what he has done;
JOB.36.25	but we can only watch from a distance.
JOB.36.26	We cannot fully know his greatness
JOB.36.26	or count the number of his years.
JOB.36.27	It is God who takes water from the earth
JOB.36.27	and turns it into drops of rain.
JOB.36.28	He lets the rain pour from the clouds
JOB.36.28	in showers for all human beings.
JOB.36.29	No one knows how the clouds move
JOB.36.29	or how the thunder roars
JOB.36.29	through the sky, where God dwells.
JOB.36.30	He sends lightning through all the sky,
JOB.36.30	but the depths of the sea remain dark.
JOB.36.31	This is how he feeds
JOB.36.31	and provides an abundance of food.
JOB.36.32	He seizes the lightning with his hands
JOB.36.32	and commands it to hit the mark.
JOB.36.33	Thunder announces the approaching storm,
JOB.36.33	and the cattle know it is coming.
JOB.37.1	The storm makes my heart beat wildly.
JOB.37.2	Listen, all of you, to the voice of God,
JOB.37.2	to the thunder that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He sends the lightning across the sky,
JOB.37.3	from one end of the earth to the other.
JOB.37.4	Then the roar of his voice is heard,
JOB.37.4	the majestic sound of thunder,
JOB.37.4	and all the while the lightning flashes.
JOB.37.5	At God's command amazing things happen,
JOB.37.5	wonderful things that we can't understand.
JOB.37.6	He commands snow to fall on the earth,
JOB.37.6	and sends torrents of drenching rain.
JOB.37.7	He brings our work to a stop;
JOB.37.7	he shows us what he can do.
JOB.37.8	The wild animals go to their dens.
JOB.37.9	The storm winds come from the south,
JOB.37.9	and the biting cold from the north.
JOB.37.10	The breath of God freezes the waters,
JOB.37.10	and turns them to solid ice.
JOB.37.11	Lightning flashes from the clouds,
JOB.37.12	as they move at God's will.
JOB.37.12	They do all that God commands,
JOB.37.12	everywhere throughout the world.
JOB.37.13	God sends rain to water the earth;
JOB.37.13	he may send it to punish us,
JOB.37.13	or to show us his favor.
JOB.37.14	Pause a moment, Job, and listen;
JOB.37.14	consider the wonderful things God does.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God gives the command
JOB.37.15	and makes lightning flash from the clouds?
JOB.37.16	Do you know how clouds float in the sky,
JOB.37.16	the work of God's amazing skill?
JOB.37.17	No, you can only suffer in the heat
JOB.37.17	when the south wind oppresses the land.
JOB.37.18	Can you help God stretch out the sky
JOB.37.18	and make it as hard as polished metal?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what to say to God;
JOB.37.19	our minds are blank; we have nothing to say.
JOB.37.20	I won't ask to speak with God;
JOB.37.20	why should I give him a chance to destroy me?
JOB.37.21	And now the light in the sky is dazzling,
JOB.37.21	too bright for us to look at it;
JOB.37.21	and the sky has been swept clean by the wind.
JOB.37.22	A golden glow is seen in the north,
JOB.37.22	and the glory of God fills us with awe.
JOB.37.23	God's power is so great that we cannot come near him;
JOB.37.23	he is righteous and just in his dealings with us.
JOB.37.24	No wonder, then, that everyone is awed by him,
JOB.37.24	and that he ignores those who claim to be wise.
JOB.38.1	Then out of the storm the 
JOB.38.2	Who are you to question my wisdom
JOB.38.2	with your ignorant, empty words?
JOB.38.3	Now stand up straight
JOB.38.3	and answer the questions I ask you.
JOB.38.4	Were you there when I made the world?
JOB.38.4	If you know so much, tell me about it.
JOB.38.5	Who decided how large it would be?
JOB.38.5	Who stretched the measuring line over it?
JOB.38.5	Do you know all the answers?
JOB.38.6	What holds up the pillars that support the earth?
JOB.38.6	Who laid the cornerstone of the world?
JOB.38.7	and the heavenly beings
JOB.38.8	when it burst from the womb of the earth?
JOB.38.9	It was I who covered the sea with clouds
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in darkness.
JOB.38.10	I marked a boundary for the sea
JOB.38.10	and kept it behind bolted gates.
JOB.38.11	I told it, “So far and no farther!
JOB.38.11	Here your powerful waves must stop.”
JOB.38.12	Job, have you ever in all your life
JOB.38.12	commanded a day to dawn?
JOB.38.13	Have you ordered the dawn to seize the earth
JOB.38.13	and shake the wicked from their hiding places?
JOB.38.14	Daylight makes the hills and valleys stand out
JOB.38.14	like the folds of a garment,
JOB.38.14	clear as the imprint of a seal on clay.
JOB.38.15	The light of day is too bright for the wicked
JOB.38.15	and restrains them from doing violence.
JOB.38.16	Have you been to the springs in the depths of the sea?
JOB.38.16	Have you walked on the floor of the ocean?
JOB.38.17	Has anyone ever shown you the gates
JOB.38.17	that guard the dark world of the dead?
JOB.38.18	Have you any idea how big the world is?
JOB.38.18	Answer me if you know.
JOB.38.19	Do you know where the light comes from
JOB.38.19	or what the source of darkness is?
JOB.38.20	Can you show them how far to go,
JOB.38.20	or send them back again?
JOB.38.21	I am sure you can, because you're so old
JOB.38.21	and were there when the world was made!
JOB.38.22	Have you ever visited the storerooms,
JOB.38.22	where I keep the snow and the hail?
JOB.38.23	I keep them ready for times of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for days of battle and war.
JOB.38.24	Have you been to the place where the sun comes up,
JOB.38.24	or the place from which the east wind blows?
JOB.38.25	Who dug a channel for the pouring rain
JOB.38.25	and cleared the way for the thunderstorm?
JOB.38.26	Who makes rain fall where no one lives?
JOB.38.27	Who waters the dry and thirsty land,
JOB.38.27	so that grass springs up?
JOB.38.28	Does either the rain or the dew have a father?
JOB.38.29	Who is the mother of the ice and the frost,
JOB.38.30	which turn the waters to stone
JOB.38.30	and freeze the face of the sea?
JOB.38.31	or loosen the bonds that hold Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you guide the stars season by season
JOB.38.32	and direct the Big and the Little Dipper?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws that govern the skies,
JOB.38.33	and can you make them apply to the earth?
JOB.38.34	Can you shout orders to the clouds
JOB.38.34	and make them drench you with rain?
JOB.38.35	And if you command the lightning to flash,
JOB.38.35	will it come to you and say, “At your service”?
JOB.38.36	Who tells the ibis
JOB.38.36	or who tells the rooster that rain will fall?
JOB.38.37	Who is wise enough to count the clouds
JOB.38.37	and tilt them over to pour out the rain,
JOB.38.38	rain that hardens the dust into lumps?
JOB.38.39	Do you find food for lions to eat,
JOB.38.39	and satisfy hungry young lions
JOB.38.40	when they hide in their caves,
JOB.38.40	or lie in wait in their dens?
JOB.38.41	Who is it that feeds the ravens
JOB.38.41	when they wander about hungry,
JOB.38.41	when their young cry to me for food?
JOB.39.1	Do you know when mountain goats are born?
JOB.39.1	Have you watched wild deer give birth?
JOB.39.2	Do you know how long they carry their young?
JOB.39.2	Do you know the time for their birth?
JOB.39.3	Do you know when they will crouch down
JOB.39.3	and bring their young into the world?
JOB.39.4	In the wilds their young grow strong;
JOB.39.4	they go away and don't come back.
JOB.39.5	Who gave the wild donkeys their freedom?
JOB.39.5	Who turned them loose and let them roam?
JOB.39.6	I gave them the desert to be their home,
JOB.39.6	and let them live on the salt plains.
JOB.39.7	They keep far away from the noisy cities,
JOB.39.7	and no one can tame them and make them work.
JOB.39.8	The mountains are the pastures where they feed,
JOB.39.8	where they search for anything green to eat.
JOB.39.9	Will a wild ox work for you?
JOB.39.9	Is he willing to spend the night in your stable?
JOB.39.10	Can you hold one with a rope and make him plow?
JOB.39.10	Or make him pull a harrow in your fields?
JOB.39.11	Can you rely on his great strength
JOB.39.11	and expect him to do your heavy work?
JOB.39.12	Do you expect him to bring in your harvest
JOB.39.12	and gather the grain from your threshing place?
JOB.39.13	How fast the wings of an ostrich beat!
JOB.39.13	But no ostrich can fly like a stork.
JOB.39.14	The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground
JOB.39.14	for the heat in the soil to warm them.
JOB.39.15	She is unaware that a foot may crush them
JOB.39.15	or a wild animal break them.
JOB.39.16	She acts as if the eggs were not hers,
JOB.39.16	and is unconcerned that her efforts were wasted.
JOB.39.17	It was I who made her foolish
JOB.39.17	and did not give her wisdom.
JOB.39.18	But when she begins to run,
JOB.39.18	she can laugh at any horse and rider.
JOB.39.19	Was it you, Job, who made horses so strong
JOB.39.19	and gave them their flowing manes?
JOB.39.20	Did you make them leap like locusts
JOB.39.20	and frighten people with their snorting?
JOB.39.21	They eagerly paw the ground in the valley;
JOB.39.21	they rush into battle with all their strength.
JOB.39.22	They do not know the meaning of fear,
JOB.39.22	and no sword can turn them back.
JOB.39.23	The weapons which their riders carry
JOB.39.23	rattle and flash in the sun.
JOB.39.24	Trembling with excitement, the horses race ahead;
JOB.39.24	when the trumpet blows, they can't stand still.
JOB.39.25	At each blast of the trumpet they snort;
JOB.39.25	they can smell a battle before they get near,
JOB.39.25	and they hear the officers shouting commands.
JOB.39.26	Does a hawk learn from you how to fly
JOB.39.26	when it spreads its wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Does an eagle wait for your command
JOB.39.27	to build its nest high in the mountains?
JOB.39.28	It makes its home on the highest rocks
JOB.39.28	and makes the sharp peaks its fortress.
JOB.39.29	From there it watches near and far
JOB.39.29	for something to kill and eat.
JOB.39.30	and the young eagles drink the blood.
JOB.40.1+JOB.40.2	Job, you challenged Almighty God;
JOB.40.1+JOB.40.2	will you give up now, or will you answer?
JOB.40.3+JOB.40.4	I spoke foolishly, 
JOB.40.3+JOB.40.4	I will not try to say anything else.
JOB.40.5	I have already said more than I should.
JOB.40.6	Then out of the storm the 
JOB.40.7	Now stand up straight
JOB.40.7	and answer my questions.
JOB.40.8	Are you trying to prove that I am unjust—
JOB.40.8	to put me in the wrong and yourself in the right?
JOB.40.9	Are you as strong as I am?
JOB.40.9	Can your voice thunder as loud as mine?
JOB.40.10	If so, stand up in your honor and pride;
JOB.40.10	clothe yourself with majesty and glory.
JOB.40.11	Look at those who are proud;
JOB.40.11	pour out your anger and humble them.
JOB.40.12	Yes, look at them and bring them down;
JOB.40.12	crush the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Bury them all in the ground;
JOB.40.13	bind them in the world of the dead.
JOB.40.14	Then I will be the first to praise you
JOB.40.14	and admit that you won the victory yourself.
JOB.40.15	Look at the monster Behemoth;
JOB.40.15	I created him and I created you.
JOB.40.15	He eats grass like a cow,
JOB.40.16	but what strength there is in his body,
JOB.40.16	and what power there is in his muscles!
JOB.40.17	His tail stands up like a cedar,
JOB.40.17	and the muscles in his legs are strong.
JOB.40.18	His bones are as strong as bronze,
JOB.40.18	and his legs are like iron bars.
JOB.40.19	The most amazing of all my creatures!
JOB.40.19	Only his Creator can defeat him.
JOB.40.20	Grass to feed him grows
JOB.40.20	on the hills where wild beasts play.
JOB.40.21	He lies down under the thorn bushes,
JOB.40.21	and hides among the reeds in the swamp.
JOB.40.22	The thorn bushes and the willows by the stream
JOB.40.22	give him shelter in their shade.
JOB.40.23	He is not afraid of a rushing river;
JOB.40.23	he is calm when the Jordan dashes in his face.
JOB.40.24	Who can blind his eyes and capture him?
JOB.40.24	Or who can catch his snout in a trap?
JOB.41.1	or tie his tongue down with a rope?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope through his snout
JOB.41.2	or put a hook through his jaws?
JOB.41.3	Will he beg you to let him go?
JOB.41.3	Will he plead with you for mercy?
JOB.41.4	Will he make an agreement with you
JOB.41.4	and promise to serve you forever?
JOB.41.5	Will you tie him like a pet bird,
JOB.41.5	like something to amuse your servant women?
JOB.41.6	Will fishermen bargain over him?
JOB.41.6	Will merchants cut him up to sell?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his hide with fishing spears
JOB.41.7	or pierce his head with a harpoon?
JOB.41.8	Touch him once and you'll never try it again;
JOB.41.8	you'll never forget the fight!
JOB.41.9	Anyone who sees Leviathan
JOB.41.9	loses courage and falls to the ground.
JOB.41.10	When he is aroused, he is fierce;
JOB.41.10	no one would dare to stand before him.
JOB.41.11	Who can attack him and still be safe?
JOB.41.11	No one in all the world can do it.
JOB.41.12	Let me tell you about Leviathan's legs
JOB.41.12	and describe how great and strong he is.
JOB.41.13	No one can tear off his outer coat
JOB.41.13	or pierce the armor
JOB.41.14	Who can make him open his jaws,
JOB.41.14	ringed with those terrifying teeth?
JOB.41.15	His back
JOB.41.15	fastened together and hard as stone.
JOB.41.16	Each one is joined so tight to the next,
JOB.41.16	not even a breath can come between.
JOB.41.17	They all are fastened so firmly together
JOB.41.17	that nothing can ever pull them apart.
JOB.41.18	Light flashes when he sneezes,
JOB.41.18	and his eyes glow like the rising sun.
JOB.41.19	Flames blaze from his mouth,
JOB.41.19	and streams of sparks fly out.
JOB.41.20	Smoke comes pouring out of his nose,
JOB.41.20	like smoke from weeds burning under a pot.
JOB.41.21	His breath starts fires burning;
JOB.41.21	flames leap out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	His neck is so powerful
JOB.41.22	that all who meet him are terrified.
JOB.41.23	There is not a weak spot in his skin;
JOB.41.23	it is as hard and unyielding as iron.
JOB.41.24	His stony heart is without fear,
JOB.41.24	as unyielding and hard as a millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he rises up, even the strongest
JOB.41.25	they are helpless with fear.
JOB.41.26	There is no sword that can wound him;
JOB.41.26	no spear or arrow or lance that can harm him.
JOB.41.27	For him iron is as flimsy as straw,
JOB.41.27	and bronze as soft as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	There is no arrow that can make him run;
JOB.41.28	rocks thrown at him are like bits of straw.
JOB.41.29	To him a club is a piece of straw,
JOB.41.29	and he laughs when men throw spears.
JOB.41.30	The scales on his belly are like jagged pieces of pottery;
JOB.41.30	they tear up the muddy ground like a threshing sledge.
JOB.41.31	He churns up the sea like boiling water
JOB.41.31	and makes it bubble like a pot of oil.
JOB.41.32	He leaves a shining path behind him
JOB.41.32	and turns the sea to white foam.
JOB.41.33	There is nothing on earth to compare with him;
JOB.41.33	he is a creature that has no fear.
JOB.41.34	He looks down on even the proudest animals;
JOB.41.34	he is king of all wild beasts.
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	I know, 
JOB.42.2	that you can do everything you want.
JOB.42.3	when I am so very ignorant.
JOB.42.3	I talked about things I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	about marvels too great for me to know.
JOB.42.4	and to try to answer your questions.
JOB.42.5	In the past I knew only what others had told me,
JOB.42.5	but now I have seen you with my own eyes.
JOB.42.6	So I am ashamed of all I have said
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	After the 
JOB.42.8	Now take seven bulls and seven rams to Job and offer them as a sacrifice for yourselves. Job will pray for you, and I will answer his prayer and not disgrace you the way you deserve. You did not speak the truth about me as he did.”
JOB.42.9	Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what the 
JOB.42.11	All Job's brothers and sisters and former friends came to visit him and feasted with him in his house. They expressed their sympathy and comforted him for all the troubles the 
JOB.42.12	The 
JOB.42.13	He was the father of seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He called the oldest daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the youngest Keren Happuch.
JOB.42.15	There were no other women in the whole world as beautiful as Job's daughters. Their father gave them a share of the inheritance along with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	Job lived a hundred and forty years after this, long enough to see his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
JOB.42.17	And then he died at a very great age.
PSA.1.1	Happy are those
PSA.1.1	who reject the advice of evil people,
PSA.1.1	who do not follow the example of sinners
PSA.1.1	or join those who have no use for God.
PSA.1.2	Instead, they find joy in obeying the Law of the 
PSA.1.2	and they study it day and night.
PSA.1.3	that bear fruit at the right time,
PSA.1.3	and whose leaves do not dry up.
PSA.1.3	They succeed in everything they do.
PSA.1.4	But evil people are not like this at all;
PSA.1.4	they are like straw that the wind blows away.
PSA.1.5	Sinners will be condemned by God
PSA.1.5	and kept apart from God's own people.
PSA.1.6	The righteous are guided and protected by the 
PSA.1.6	but the evil are on the way to their doom.
PSA.2.1	Why do people make their useless plots?
PSA.2.2	Their kings revolt,
PSA.2.2	their rulers plot together against the 
PSA.2.2	and against the king he chose.
PSA.2.3	“Let us free ourselves from their rule,” they say;
PSA.2.3	“let us throw off their control.”
PSA.2.4	From his throne in heaven the Lord laughs
PSA.2.4	and mocks their feeble plans.
PSA.2.5	Then he warns them in anger
PSA.2.5	and terrifies them with his fury.
PSA.2.6	“On Zion,
PSA.2.6	“I have installed my king.”
PSA.2.7	He said to me: ‘You are my son;
PSA.2.7	today I have become your father.
PSA.2.8	Ask, and I will give you all the nations;
PSA.2.8	the whole earth will be yours.
PSA.2.9	you will shatter them in pieces like a clay pot.’”
PSA.2.10	Now listen to this warning, you kings;
PSA.2.10	learn this lesson, you rulers of the world:
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	tremble 
PSA.2.12	and bow down to him;
PSA.2.12	or else his anger will be quickly aroused,
PSA.2.12	and you will suddenly die.
PSA.2.12	Happy are all who go to him for protection.
PSA.3.1	I have so many enemies, 
PSA.3.1	so many who turn against me!
PSA.3.2	They talk about me and say,
PSA.3.2	“God will not help him.”
PSA.3.3	But you, O 
PSA.3.3	you give me victory
PSA.3.3	and restore my courage.
PSA.3.4	I call to the 
PSA.3.4	and from his sacred hill
PSA.3.5	I lie down and sleep,
PSA.3.5	and all night long the 
PSA.3.6	I am not afraid of the thousands of enemies
PSA.3.6	who surround me on every side.
PSA.3.7	Come, 
PSA.3.7	You punish all my enemies
PSA.3.7	and leave them powerless to harm me.
PSA.3.8	Victory comes from the 
PSA.3.8	may he bless his people.
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I pray,
PSA.4.1	O God, my defender!
PSA.4.1	When I was in trouble, you helped me.
PSA.4.1	Be kind to me now and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	How long will you people insult me?
PSA.4.2	How long will you love what is worthless
PSA.4.2	and go after what is false?
PSA.4.3	Remember that the 
PSA.4.3	and he hears me when I call to him.
PSA.4.4	think deeply about this,
PSA.4.4	when you lie in silence on your beds.
PSA.4.5	Offer the right sacrifices to the 
PSA.4.5	and put your trust in him.
PSA.4.6	There are many who pray:
PSA.4.6	“Give us more blessings, O 
PSA.4.6	Look on us with kindness!”
PSA.4.7	But the joy that you have given me
PSA.4.7	is more than they will ever have
PSA.4.7	with all their grain and wine.
PSA.4.8	When I lie down, I go to sleep in peace;
PSA.4.8	you alone, O 
PSA.5.1	Listen to my words, O 
PSA.5.1	and hear my sighs.
PSA.5.2	Listen to my cry for help,
PSA.5.2	my God and king!
PSA.5.2	I pray to you, O 
PSA.5.3	you hear my voice in the morning;
PSA.5.3	at sunrise I offer my prayer
PSA.5.3	and wait for your answer.
PSA.5.4	You are not a God who is pleased with wrongdoing;
PSA.5.4	you allow no evil in your presence.
PSA.5.5	You cannot stand the sight of the proud;
PSA.5.5	you hate all wicked people.
PSA.5.6	You destroy all liars
PSA.5.6	and despise violent, deceitful people.
PSA.5.7	But because of your great love
PSA.5.7	I can come into your house;
PSA.5.7	I can worship in your holy Temple
PSA.5.7	and bow down to you in reverence.
PSA.5.8	Lead me to do your will;
PSA.5.8	make your way plain for me to follow.
PSA.5.9	they only want to destroy.
PSA.5.9	Their words are flattering and smooth,
PSA.5.9	but full of deadly deceit.
PSA.5.10	Condemn and punish them, O God;
PSA.5.10	may their own plots cause their ruin.
PSA.5.10	Drive them out of your presence
PSA.5.10	because of their many sins
PSA.5.10	and their rebellion against you.
PSA.5.11	But all who find safety in you will rejoice;
PSA.5.11	they can always sing for joy.
PSA.5.11	Protect those who love you;
PSA.5.11	because of you they are truly happy.
PSA.5.12	You bless those who obey you, 
PSA.5.12	your love protects them like a shield.
PSA.6.1	Don't punish me in your anger!
PSA.6.2	I am worn out, O 
PSA.6.2	Give me strength; I am completely exhausted
PSA.6.3	and my whole being is deeply troubled.
PSA.6.3	How long, O 
PSA.6.4	Come and save me, 
PSA.6.4	in your mercy rescue me from death.
PSA.6.5	In the world of the dead you are not remembered;
PSA.6.5	no one can praise you there.
PSA.6.6	I am worn out with grief;
PSA.6.6	every night my bed is damp from my weeping;
PSA.6.6	my pillow is soaked with tears.
PSA.6.7	I can hardly see;
PSA.6.7	my eyes are so swollen
PSA.6.7	from the weeping caused by my enemies.
PSA.6.8	The 
PSA.6.9	he listens to my cry for help
PSA.6.9	and will answer my prayer.
PSA.6.10	My enemies will know the bitter shame of defeat;
PSA.6.10	in sudden confusion they will be driven away.
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.1	rescue me and save me from all who pursue me,
PSA.7.2	or else like a lion they will carry me off
PSA.7.2	where no one can save me,
PSA.7.2	and there they will tear me to pieces.
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	O 
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	if I have betrayed a friend
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	or without cause done violence to my enemy
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	if I have done any of these things—
PSA.7.5	then let my enemies pursue me and catch me,
PSA.7.5	let them cut me down and kill me
PSA.7.5	and leave me lifeless on the ground!
PSA.7.6	Rise in your anger, O 
PSA.7.6	Stand up against the fury of my enemies;
PSA.7.6	rouse yourself and help me!
PSA.7.6	Justice is what you demand,
PSA.7.7	so bring together all the peoples around you,
PSA.7.7	and rule over them from above.
PSA.7.8	You are the judge of all people.
PSA.7.8	Judge in my favor, O 
PSA.7.8	you know that I am innocent.
PSA.7.9	and judge our thoughts and desires.
PSA.7.9	Stop the wickedness of evildoers
PSA.7.9	and reward those who are good.
PSA.7.10	God is my protector;
PSA.7.10	he saves those who obey him.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge
PSA.7.11	and always condemns the wicked.
PSA.7.12	If they do not change their ways,
PSA.7.12	God will sharpen his sword.
PSA.7.12	He bends his bow and makes it ready;
PSA.7.13	he takes up his deadly weapons
PSA.7.13	and aims his burning arrows.
PSA.7.14	See how wicked people think up evil;
PSA.7.14	they plan trouble and practice deception.
PSA.7.15	But in the traps they set for others,
PSA.7.15	they themselves get caught.
PSA.7.16	So they are punished by their own evil
PSA.7.16	and are hurt by their own violence.
PSA.7.17	I thank the 
PSA.7.17	I sing praises to the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.1	your greatness is seen in all the world!
PSA.8.1	Your praise reaches up to the heavens;
PSA.8.2	You are safe and secure from all your enemies;
PSA.8.2	you stop anyone who opposes you.
PSA.8.3	When I look at the sky, which you have made,
PSA.8.3	at the moon and the stars, which you set in their places—
PSA.8.4	mere mortals, that you care for them?
PSA.8.5	you crowned them with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	you placed them over all creation:
PSA.8.7	sheep and cattle, and the wild animals too;
PSA.8.8	the birds and the fish
PSA.8.8	and the creatures in the seas.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.8.9	your greatness is seen in all the world!
PSA.9.1	I will praise you, 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all the wonderful things you have done.
PSA.9.2	I will sing with joy because of you.
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to you, Almighty God.
PSA.9.3	My enemies turn back when you appear;
PSA.9.3	they fall down and die.
PSA.9.4	You are fair and honest in your judgments,
PSA.9.4	and you have judged in my favor.
PSA.9.5	You have condemned the heathen
PSA.9.5	and destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	they will be remembered no more.
PSA.9.6	Our enemies are finished forever;
PSA.9.6	you have destroyed their cities,
PSA.9.6	and they are completely forgotten.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	he has set up his throne for judgment.
PSA.9.8	He rules the world with righteousness;
PSA.9.8	he judges the nations with justice.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a place of safety in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	Those who know you, 
PSA.9.10	you do not abandon anyone who comes to you.
PSA.9.11	Sing praise to the 
PSA.9.11	Tell every nation what he has done!
PSA.9.12	God remembers those who suffer;
PSA.9.12	he does not forget their cry,
PSA.9.12	and he punishes those who wrong them.
PSA.9.13	See the sufferings my enemies cause me!
PSA.9.13	Rescue me from death, O 
PSA.9.14	that I may stand before the people of Jerusalem
PSA.9.14	and tell them all the things for which I praise you.
PSA.9.14	I will rejoice because you saved me.
PSA.9.15	The heathen have dug a pit and fallen in;
PSA.9.15	they have been caught in their own trap.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	and the wicked are trapped by their own deeds.
PSA.9.17	Death is the destiny of all the wicked,
PSA.9.17	of all those who reject God.
PSA.9.18	The needy will not always be neglected;
PSA.9.18	the hope of the poor will not be crushed forever.
PSA.9.19	Come, 
PSA.9.19	Bring the heathen before you
PSA.9.19	and pronounce judgment on them.
PSA.9.20	Make them afraid, O 
PSA.9.20	make them know that they are only mortal beings.
PSA.10.1	Why are you so far away, O 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide yourself when we are in trouble?
PSA.10.2	The wicked are proud and persecute the poor;
PSA.10.2	catch them in the traps they have made.
PSA.10.3	The wicked are proud of their evil desires;
PSA.10.3	the greedy curse and reject the 
PSA.10.4	The wicked do not care about the 
PSA.10.4	in their pride they think that God doesn't matter.
PSA.10.5	The wicked succeed in everything.
PSA.10.5	They cannot understand God's judgments;
PSA.10.5	they sneer at their enemies.
PSA.10.6	They say to themselves, “We will never fail;
PSA.10.6	we will never be in trouble.”
PSA.10.7	they are quick to speak hateful, evil words.
PSA.10.8	They hide themselves in the villages,
PSA.10.8	waiting to murder innocent people.
PSA.10.8	They spy on their helpless victims;
PSA.10.9	they wait in their hiding place like lions.
PSA.10.9	They lie in wait for the poor;
PSA.10.9	they catch them in their traps and drag them away.
PSA.10.10	The helpless victims lie crushed;
PSA.10.10	brute strength has defeated them.
PSA.10.11	The wicked say to themselves, “God doesn't care!
PSA.10.11	He has closed his eyes and will never see me!”
PSA.10.12	O 
PSA.10.12	Remember those who are suffering!
PSA.10.13	How can the wicked despise God
PSA.10.13	and say to themselves, “He will not punish me”?
PSA.10.14	But you do see; you take notice of trouble and suffering
PSA.10.14	and are always ready to help.
PSA.10.14	The helpless commit themselves to you;
PSA.10.14	you have always helped the needy.
PSA.10.15	Break the power of wicked and evil people;
PSA.10.15	punish them for the wrong they have done
PSA.10.15	until they do it no more.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	Those who worship other gods
PSA.10.16	will vanish from his land.
PSA.10.17	You will listen, O 
PSA.10.17	you will give them courage.
PSA.10.18	You will hear the cries of the oppressed and the orphans;
PSA.10.18	you will judge in their favor,
PSA.10.18	so that mortal men may cause terror no more.
PSA.11.1	I trust in the 
PSA.11.1	How foolish of you to say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Fly away like a bird to the mountains,
PSA.11.2	because the wicked have drawn their bows and aimed their arrows
PSA.11.2	to shoot from the shadows at good people.
PSA.11.3	There is nothing a good person can do
PSA.11.3	when everything falls apart.”
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	he has his throne in heaven.
PSA.11.4	He watches people everywhere
PSA.11.4	and knows what they are doing.
PSA.11.5	He examines the good and the wicked alike;
PSA.11.5	the lawless he hates with all his heart.
PSA.11.6	He sends down flaming coals
PSA.11.6	he punishes them with scorching winds.
PSA.11.7	The 
PSA.11.7	those who do them will live in his presence.
PSA.12.1	Help us, 
PSA.12.1	There is not a good person left;
PSA.12.1	honest people can no longer be found.
PSA.12.2	All of them lie to one another;
PSA.12.2	they deceive each other with flattery.
PSA.12.3	Silence those flattering tongues, O 
PSA.12.3	Close those boastful mouths that say,
PSA.12.4	“With our words we get what we want.
PSA.12.4	We will say what we wish,
PSA.12.4	and no one can stop us.”
PSA.12.5	“But now I will come,” says the 
PSA.12.5	“because the needy are oppressed
PSA.12.5	and the persecuted groan in pain.
PSA.12.5	I will give them the security they long for.”
PSA.12.6	The promises of the 
PSA.12.6	they are as genuine as silver
PSA.12.6	refined seven times in the furnace.
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	The wicked are everywhere,
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	and everyone praises what is evil.
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	Keep us always safe, O 
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	and preserve us from such people.
PSA.13.1	How much longer will you forget me, 
PSA.13.1	How much longer will you hide yourself from me?
PSA.13.2	How long must I endure trouble?
PSA.13.2	How long will sorrow fill my heart day and night?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemies triumph over me?
PSA.13.3	Look at me, O 
PSA.13.3	Restore my strength; don't let me die.
PSA.13.4	Don't let my enemies say, “We have defeated him.”
PSA.13.4	Don't let them gloat over my downfall.
PSA.13.5	I rely on your constant love;
PSA.13.5	I will be glad, because you will rescue me.
PSA.13.6	I will sing to you, O 
PSA.13.6	because you have been good to me.
PSA.14.1	“There is no God!”
PSA.14.1	They are all corrupt,
PSA.14.1	and they have done terrible things;
PSA.14.1	there is no one who does what is right.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there are any who are wise,
PSA.14.2	any who worship him.
PSA.14.3	But they have all gone wrong;
PSA.14.3	they are all equally bad.
PSA.14.3	Not one of them does what is right,
PSA.14.3	not a single one.
PSA.14.4	“Don't they know?” asks the 
PSA.14.4	“Are all these evildoers ignorant?
PSA.14.4	They live by robbing my people,
PSA.14.4	and they never pray to me.”
PSA.14.5	But then they will be terrified,
PSA.14.5	for God is with those who obey him.
PSA.14.6	Evildoers frustrate the plans of the humble,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	How I pray that victory
PSA.14.7	will come to Israel from Zion.
PSA.14.7	How happy the people of Israel will be
PSA.14.7	when the 
PSA.15.1	Who may worship on Zion, your sacred hill?
PSA.15.2	Those who obey God in everything
PSA.15.2	and always do what is right,
PSA.15.2	whose words are true and sincere,
PSA.15.3	and who do not slander others.
PSA.15.3	They do no wrong to their friends
PSA.15.3	nor spread rumors about their neighbors.
PSA.15.4	They despise those whom God rejects,
PSA.15.4	but honor those who obey the 
PSA.15.4	They always do what they promise,
PSA.15.4	no matter how much it may cost.
PSA.15.5	They make loans without charging interest
PSA.15.5	and cannot be bribed to testify against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	Whoever does these things will always be secure.
PSA.16.1	Protect me, O God; I trust in you for safety.
PSA.16.2	I say to the 
PSA.16.2	all the good things I have come from you.”
PSA.16.3	How excellent are the 
PSA.16.3	My greatest pleasure is to be with them.
PSA.16.4	Those who rush to other gods
PSA.16.4	bring many troubles on themselves.
PSA.16.4	I will not take part in their sacrifices;
PSA.16.4	I will not worship their gods.
PSA.16.5	You, 
PSA.16.5	and you give me all I need;
PSA.16.5	my future is in your hands.
PSA.16.6	How wonderful are your gifts to me;
PSA.16.6	how good they are!
PSA.16.7	I praise the 
PSA.16.7	and in the night my conscience warns me.
PSA.16.8	he is near, and nothing can shake me.
PSA.16.9	And so I am thankful and glad,
PSA.16.9	and I feel completely secure,
PSA.16.10	I have served you faithfully,
PSA.16.10	and you will not abandon me to the world of the dead.
PSA.16.11	You will show me the path that leads to life;
PSA.16.11	your presence fills me with joy
PSA.16.11	and brings me pleasure forever.
PSA.17.1	Listen, O 
PSA.17.1	pay attention to my cry for help!
PSA.17.1	Listen to my honest prayer.
PSA.17.2	You will judge in my favor,
PSA.17.2	because you know what is right.
PSA.17.3	You know my heart.
PSA.17.3	You have come to me at night;
PSA.17.3	you have examined me completely
PSA.17.3	and found no evil desire in me.
PSA.17.3	I speak no evil, 
PSA.17.4	as others do;
PSA.17.4	I have obeyed your command
PSA.17.4	and have not followed paths of violence.
PSA.17.5	I have always walked in your way
PSA.17.5	and have never strayed from it.
PSA.17.6	I pray to you, O God, because you answer me;
PSA.17.6	so turn to me and listen to my words.
PSA.17.7	Reveal your wonderful love and save me;
PSA.17.7	at your side I am safe from my enemies.
PSA.17.8	Protect me as you would your very eyes;
PSA.17.8	hide me in the shadow of your wings
PSA.17.9	from the attacks of the wicked.
PSA.17.9	Deadly enemies surround me;
PSA.17.10	they have no pity and speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They are around me now, wherever I turn,
PSA.17.11	watching for a chance to pull me down.
PSA.17.12	They are like lions, waiting for me,
PSA.17.12	wanting to tear me to pieces.
PSA.17.13	Come, 
PSA.17.13	Save me from the wicked by your sword;
PSA.17.14	save me from those who in this life have all they want.
PSA.17.14	Punish them with the sufferings you have stored up for them;
PSA.17.14	may there be enough for their children
PSA.17.14	and some left over for their children's children!
PSA.17.15	But I will see you, because I have done no wrong;
PSA.17.15	and when I awake, your presence will fill me with joy.
PSA.18.1	How I love you, 
PSA.18.1	You are my defender.
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	he is my strong fortress.
PSA.18.2	My God is my protection,
PSA.18.2	and with him I am safe.
PSA.18.2	He protects me like a shield;
PSA.18.2	he defends me and keeps me safe.
PSA.18.3	I call to the 
PSA.18.3	and he saves me from my enemies.
PSA.18.3	Praise the 
PSA.18.4	The danger of death was all around me;
PSA.18.4	the waves of destruction rolled over me.
PSA.18.5	The danger of death was around me,
PSA.18.5	and the grave set its trap for me.
PSA.18.6	In my trouble I called to the 
PSA.18.6	I called to my God for help.
PSA.18.6	In his temple he heard my voice;
PSA.18.6	he listened to my cry for help.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth trembled and shook;
PSA.18.7	the foundations of the mountains rocked and quivered,
PSA.18.7	because God was angry.
PSA.18.8	Smoke poured out of his nostrils,
PSA.18.8	a consuming flame and burning coals from his mouth.
PSA.18.9	He tore the sky open and came down
PSA.18.9	with a dark cloud under his feet.
PSA.18.10	He flew swiftly on his winged creature;
PSA.18.10	he traveled on the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He covered himself with darkness;
PSA.18.11	thick clouds, full of water, surrounded him.
PSA.18.12	Hailstones and flashes of fire
PSA.18.12	came from the lightning before him
PSA.18.12	and broke through the dark clouds.
PSA.18.13	Then the 
PSA.18.13	and the voice of the Most High was heard.
PSA.18.14	He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies;
PSA.18.14	with flashes of lightning he sent them running.
PSA.18.15	The floor of the ocean was laid bare,
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the earth were uncovered,
PSA.18.15	when you rebuked your enemies, 
PSA.18.15	and roared at them in anger.
PSA.18.16	The 
PSA.18.16	he pulled me out of the deep waters.
PSA.18.17	He rescued me from my powerful enemies
PSA.18.17	and from all those who hate me—
PSA.18.17	they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	When I was in trouble, they attacked me,
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He helped me out of danger;
PSA.18.19	he saved me because he was pleased with me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	he blesses me because I am innocent.
PSA.18.21	I have obeyed the law of the 
PSA.18.21	I have not turned away from my God.
PSA.18.22	I have observed all his laws;
PSA.18.22	I have not disobeyed his commands.
PSA.18.23	He knows that I am faultless,
PSA.18.23	that I have kept myself from doing wrong.
PSA.18.24	And so he rewards me because I do what is right,
PSA.18.24	because he knows that I am innocent.
PSA.18.25	O 
PSA.18.25	completely good to those who are perfect.
PSA.18.26	You are pure to those who are pure,
PSA.18.26	but hostile to those who are wicked.
PSA.18.27	You save those who are humble,
PSA.18.27	but you humble those who are proud.
PSA.18.28	O 
PSA.18.28	you dispel my darkness.
PSA.18.29	You give me strength to attack my enemies
PSA.18.29	and power to overcome their defenses.
PSA.18.30	This God—how perfect are his deeds!
PSA.18.30	How dependable his words!
PSA.18.30	He is like a shield
PSA.18.30	for all who seek his protection.
PSA.18.31	The 
PSA.18.31	God alone is our defense.
PSA.18.32	He is the God who makes me strong,
PSA.18.32	who makes my pathway safe.
PSA.18.33	he keeps me safe on the mountains.
PSA.18.34	He trains me for battle,
PSA.18.34	so that I can use the strongest bow.
PSA.18.35	O 
PSA.18.35	your care has made me great,
PSA.18.35	and your power has kept me safe.
PSA.18.36	You have kept me from being captured,
PSA.18.36	and I have never fallen.
PSA.18.37	I pursue my enemies and catch them;
PSA.18.37	I do not stop until I destroy them.
PSA.18.38	I strike them down, and they cannot rise;
PSA.18.38	they lie defeated before me.
PSA.18.39	You give me strength for the battle
PSA.18.39	and victory over my enemies.
PSA.18.40	You make my enemies run from me;
PSA.18.40	I destroy those who hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cry for help, but no one saves them;
PSA.18.41	they call to the 
PSA.18.42	I crush them, so that they become like dust

PSA.32.3	When I did not confess my sins,
PSA.32.3	I was worn out from crying all day long.
PSA.32.4	Day and night you punished me, 
PSA.32.4	my strength was completely drained,
PSA.32.4	as moisture is dried up by the summer heat.
PSA.32.5	Then I confessed my sins to you;
PSA.32.5	I did not conceal my wrongdoings.
PSA.32.5	I decided to confess them to you,
PSA.32.5	and you forgave all my sins.
PSA.32.6	So all your loyal people should pray to you in times of need;
PSA.32.6	when a great flood of trouble comes rushing in,
PSA.32.6	it will not reach them.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place;
PSA.32.7	you will save me from trouble.
PSA.32.7	I sing aloud of your salvation,
PSA.32.7	because you protect me.
PSA.32.8	The 
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and advise you.
PSA.32.9	Don't be stupid like a horse or a mule,
PSA.32.9	which must be controlled with a bit and bridle
PSA.32.9	to make it submit.”
PSA.32.10	The wicked will have to suffer,
PSA.32.10	but those who trust in the 
PSA.32.10	are protected by his constant love.
PSA.32.11	You that are righteous, be glad and rejoice
PSA.32.11	because of what the 
PSA.32.11	You that obey him, shout for joy!
PSA.33.1	All you that are righteous,
PSA.33.1	shout for joy for what the 
PSA.33.1	praise him, all you that obey him.
PSA.33.2	Give thanks to the 
PSA.33.2	sing to him with stringed instruments.
PSA.33.3	Sing a new song to him,
PSA.33.3	play the harp with skill, and shout for joy!
PSA.33.4	The words of the 
PSA.33.4	and all his works are dependable.
PSA.33.5	The 
PSA.33.5	his constant love fills the earth.
PSA.33.6	The 
PSA.33.6	the sun, moon, and stars by his spoken word.
PSA.33.7	He gathered all the seas into one place;
PSA.33.7	he shut up the ocean depths in storerooms.
PSA.33.8	Worship the 
PSA.33.8	Honor him, all peoples of the world!
PSA.33.9	When he spoke, the world was created;
PSA.33.9	at his command everything appeared.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	he keeps them from carrying out their plans.
PSA.33.11	But his plans endure forever;
PSA.33.11	his purposes last eternally.
PSA.33.12	Happy is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	happy are the people he has chosen for his own!
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	and sees all of us humans.
PSA.33.14	From where he rules, he looks down
PSA.33.14	on all who live on earth.
PSA.33.15	He forms all their thoughts
PSA.33.15	and knows everything they do.
PSA.33.16	a soldier does not triumph because of his strength.
PSA.33.17	War horses are useless for victory;
PSA.33.17	their great strength cannot save.
PSA.33.18	The 
PSA.33.18	those who trust in his constant love.
PSA.33.19	He saves them from death;
PSA.33.19	he keeps them alive in times of famine.
PSA.33.20	We put our hope in the 
PSA.33.20	he is our protector and our help.
PSA.33.21	We are glad because of him;
PSA.33.21	we trust in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	May your constant love be with us, 
PSA.33.22	as we put our hope in you.
PSA.34.1	I will always thank the 
PSA.34.1	I will never stop praising him.
PSA.34.2	I will praise him for what he has done;
PSA.34.2	may all who are oppressed listen and be glad!
PSA.34.3	Proclaim with me the 
PSA.34.3	let us praise his name together!
PSA.34.4	I prayed to the 
PSA.34.4	he freed me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	The oppressed look to him and are glad;
PSA.34.5	they will never be disappointed.
PSA.34.6	The helpless call to him, and he answers;
PSA.34.6	he saves them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.7	His angel guards those who honor the 
PSA.34.7	and rescues them from danger.
PSA.34.8	Happy are those who find safety with him.
PSA.34.9	Honor the 
PSA.34.9	those who obey him have all they need.
PSA.34.10	Even lions go hungry for lack of food,
PSA.34.10	but those who obey the 
PSA.34.11	Come, my young friends, and listen to me,
PSA.34.11	and I will teach you to honor the 
PSA.34.12	Do you want long life and happiness?
PSA.34.13	Then keep from speaking evil
PSA.34.13	and from telling lies.
PSA.34.14	Turn away from evil and do good;
PSA.34.14	strive for peace with all your heart.
PSA.34.15	The 
PSA.34.15	and listens to their cries;
PSA.34.16	but he opposes those who do evil,
PSA.34.16	so that when they die, they are soon forgotten.
PSA.34.17	The righteous call to the 
PSA.34.17	he rescues them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	he saves those who have lost all hope.
PSA.34.19	Good people suffer many troubles,
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	not one of their bones is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil will kill the wicked;
PSA.34.21	those who hate the righteous will be punished.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	those who go to him for protection will be spared.
PSA.35.1	Oppose those who oppose me, 
PSA.35.1	and fight those who fight against me!
PSA.35.2	Take your shield and armor
PSA.35.2	and come to my rescue.
PSA.35.3	Lift up your spear and war ax
PSA.35.3	against those who pursue me.
PSA.35.3	Promise that you will save me.
PSA.35.4	May those who try to kill me
PSA.35.4	be defeated and disgraced!
PSA.35.4	May those who plot against me
PSA.35.4	be turned back and confused!
PSA.35.5	May they be like straw blown by the wind
PSA.35.5	as the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	May their path be dark and slippery
PSA.35.6	while the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	Without any reason they laid a trap for me
PSA.35.7	and dug a deep hole to catch me.
PSA.35.8	But destruction will catch them before they know it;
PSA.35.8	they will be caught in their own trap
PSA.35.8	and fall to their destruction!
PSA.35.9	Then I will be glad because of the 
PSA.35.9	I will be happy because he saved me.
PSA.35.10	With all my heart I will say to the 
PSA.35.10	“There is no one like you.
PSA.35.10	You protect the weak from the strong,
PSA.35.10	the poor from the oppressor.”
PSA.35.11	Evil people testify against me
PSA.35.11	and accuse me of crimes I know nothing about.
PSA.35.12	They pay me back evil for good,
PSA.35.12	and I sink in despair.
PSA.35.13	But when they were sick, I dressed in mourning;
PSA.35.13	I deprived myself of food;
PSA.35.13	I prayed with my head bowed low,
PSA.35.14	as I would pray for a friend or a brother.
PSA.35.14	I went around bent over in mourning,
PSA.35.14	as one who mourns for his mother.
PSA.35.15	But when I was in trouble, they were all glad
PSA.35.15	and gathered around to make fun of me;
PSA.35.15	strangers beat me
PSA.35.15	and kept striking me.
PSA.35.16	Like those who would mock a cripple,
PSA.35.16	they glared at me with hate.
PSA.35.17	How much longer, Lord, will you just look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their attacks;
PSA.35.17	save my life from these lions!
PSA.35.18	Then I will thank you in the assembly of your people;
PSA.35.18	I will praise you before them all.
PSA.35.19	gloat over my defeat.
PSA.35.19	Don't let those who hate me for no reason
PSA.35.19	smirk with delight over my sorrow.
PSA.35.20	They do not speak in a friendly way;
PSA.35.20	instead they invent all kinds of lies about peace-loving people.
PSA.35.21	They accuse me, shouting,
PSA.35.21	“We saw what you did!”
PSA.35.22	But you, O 
PSA.35.22	So don't be silent, Lord;
PSA.35.22	don't keep yourself far away!
PSA.35.23	Rouse yourself, O Lord, and defend me;
PSA.35.23	rise up, my God, and plead my cause.
PSA.35.24	You are righteous, O 
PSA.35.24	don't let my enemies gloat over me.
PSA.35.25	Don't let them say to themselves,
PSA.35.25	“We are rid of him!
PSA.35.25	That's just what we wanted!”
PSA.35.26	May those who gloat over my suffering
PSA.35.26	be completely defeated and confused;
PSA.35.26	may those who claim to be better than I am
PSA.35.26	be covered with shame and disgrace.
PSA.35.27	May those who want to see me acquitted
PSA.35.27	shout for joy and say again and again,
PSA.35.27	“How great is the 
PSA.35.27	He is pleased with the success of his servant.”
PSA.35.28	Then I will proclaim your righteousness,
PSA.35.28	and I will praise you all day long.
PSA.36.1	they reject God and do not have reverence for him.
PSA.36.2	Because they think so highly of themselves,
PSA.36.2	they think that God will not discover their sin and condemn it.
PSA.36.3	Their speech is wicked and full of lies;
PSA.36.3	they no longer do what is wise and good.
PSA.36.4	They make evil plans as they lie in bed;
PSA.36.4	nothing they do is good,
PSA.36.4	and they never reject anything evil.
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness extends to the skies.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is towering like the mountains;
PSA.36.6	your justice is like the depths of the sea.
PSA.36.6	People and animals are in your care.
PSA.36.7	How precious, O God, is your constant love!
PSA.36.7	We find
PSA.36.8	We feast on the abundant food you provide;
PSA.36.8	you let us drink from the river of your goodness.
PSA.36.9	You are the source of all life,
PSA.36.9	and because of your light we see the light.
PSA.36.10	Continue to love those who know you
PSA.36.10	and to do good to those who are righteous.
PSA.36.11	Do not let proud people attack me
PSA.36.11	or the wicked make me run away.
PSA.36.12	See where evil people have fallen.
PSA.36.12	There they lie, unable to rise.
PSA.37.1	Don't be worried on account of the wicked;
PSA.37.1	don't be jealous of those who do wrong.
PSA.37.2	They will soon disappear like grass that dries up;
PSA.37.2	they will die like plants that wither.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	live in the land and be safe.
PSA.37.4	Seek your happiness in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you your heart's desire.
PSA.37.5	Give yourself to the 
PSA.37.5	trust in him, and he will help you;
PSA.37.6	he will make your righteousness shine like the noonday sun.
PSA.37.7	Be patient and wait for the 
PSA.37.7	don't be worried about those who prosper
PSA.37.7	or those who succeed in their evil plans.
PSA.37.8	Don't give in to worry or anger;
PSA.37.8	it only leads to trouble.
PSA.37.9	Those who trust in the 
PSA.37.9	but the wicked will be driven out.
PSA.37.10	Soon the wicked will disappear;
PSA.37.10	you may look for them, but you won't find them;
PSA.37.11	and enjoy prosperity and peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plot against good people
PSA.37.12	and glare at them with hate.
PSA.37.13	But the Lord laughs at wicked people,
PSA.37.13	because he knows they will soon be destroyed.
PSA.37.14	The wicked draw their swords and bend their bows
PSA.37.14	to kill the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	to slaughter those who do what is right;
PSA.37.15	but they will be killed by their own swords,
PSA.37.15	and their bows will be smashed.
PSA.37.16	The little that a good person owns
PSA.37.16	is worth more than the wealth of all the wicked,
PSA.37.17	because the 
PSA.37.17	but protect those who are good.
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	and the land will be theirs forever.
PSA.37.19	They will not suffer when times are bad;
PSA.37.19	they will have enough in time of famine.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will die;
PSA.37.20	the enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	they will disappear like smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrow and never pay back,
PSA.37.21	but good people are generous with their gifts.
PSA.37.22	Those who are blessed by the 
PSA.37.22	but those who are cursed by him will be driven out.
PSA.37.23	The 
PSA.37.23	and protects those who please him.
PSA.37.24	If they fall, they will not stay down,
PSA.37.24	because the 
PSA.37.25	I am old now; I have lived a long time,
PSA.37.25	but I have never seen good people abandoned by the 
PSA.37.25	or their children begging for food.
PSA.37.26	At all times they give freely and lend to others,
PSA.37.26	and their children are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Turn away from evil and do good,
PSA.37.27	and your descendants will always live in the land;
PSA.37.28	for the 
PSA.37.28	and does not abandon his faithful people.
PSA.37.28	He protects them forever,
PSA.37.28	but the descendants of the wicked will be driven out.
PSA.37.29	The righteous will possess the land
PSA.37.29	and live in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The words of good people are wise,
PSA.37.30	and they are always fair.
PSA.37.31	They keep the law of their God in their hearts
PSA.37.31	and never depart from it.
PSA.37.32	Wicked people watch good people
PSA.37.32	and try to kill them;
PSA.37.33	but the 
PSA.37.33	or let them be condemned when they are on trial.
PSA.37.34	Put your hope in the 
PSA.37.34	he will honor you by giving you the land,
PSA.37.34	and you will see the wicked driven out.
PSA.37.35	I once knew someone wicked who was a tyrant;
PSA.37.35	he towered over everyone like a cedar of Lebanon;
PSA.37.36	but later I
PSA.37.36	I looked for him, but couldn't find him.
PSA.37.37	Notice good people, observe the righteous;
PSA.37.37	peaceful people have descendants,
PSA.37.38	but sinners are completely destroyed,
PSA.37.38	and their descendants are wiped out.
PSA.37.39	The 
PSA.37.39	and protects them in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	He helps them and rescues them;
PSA.37.40	he saves them from the wicked,
PSA.37.40	because they go to him for protection.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.2	You have wounded me with your arrows;
PSA.38.2	you have struck me down.
PSA.38.3	Because of your anger, I am in great pain;
PSA.38.3	my whole body is diseased because of my sins.
PSA.38.4	I am drowning in the flood of my sins;
PSA.38.4	they are a burden too heavy to bear.
PSA.38.5	Because I have been foolish,
PSA.38.5	my sores stink and rot.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over, I am crushed;
PSA.38.6	I mourn all day long.
PSA.38.7	I am burning with fever
PSA.38.7	and I am near death.
PSA.38.8	I am worn out and utterly crushed;
PSA.38.8	my heart is troubled, and I groan with pain.
PSA.38.9	O Lord, you know what I long for;
PSA.38.9	you hear all my groans.
PSA.38.10	My heart is pounding, my strength is gone,
PSA.38.10	and my eyes have lost their brightness.
PSA.38.11	My friends and neighbors will not come near me,
PSA.38.11	because of my sores;
PSA.38.11	even my family keeps away from me.
PSA.38.12	Those who want to kill me lay traps for me,
PSA.38.12	and those who want to hurt me threaten to ruin me;
PSA.38.12	they never stop plotting against me.
PSA.38.13	I am like the deaf and cannot hear,
PSA.38.13	like the dumb and cannot speak.
PSA.38.14	I am like those who do not answer,
PSA.38.14	because they cannot hear.
PSA.38.15	But I trust in you, O 
PSA.38.15	and you, O Lord my God, will answer me.
PSA.38.16	Don't let my enemies gloat over my distress;
PSA.38.16	don't let them boast about my downfall!
PSA.38.17	I am about to fall
PSA.38.17	and am in constant pain.
PSA.38.18	I confess my sins;
PSA.38.18	they fill me with anxiety.
PSA.38.19	My enemies are healthy and strong;
PSA.38.19	there are many who hate me for no reason.
PSA.38.20	Those who pay back evil for good
PSA.38.20	are against me because I try to do right.
PSA.38.21	Do not abandon me, O 
PSA.38.21	do not stay away, my God!
PSA.38.22	Help me now, O Lord my savior!
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will be careful about what I do
PSA.39.1	and will not let my tongue make me sin;
PSA.39.1	I will not say anything
PSA.39.1	while evil people are near.”
PSA.39.2	I kept quiet, not saying a word,
PSA.39.2	not even about anything good!
PSA.39.2	But my suffering only grew worse,
PSA.39.3	and I was overcome with anxiety.
PSA.39.3	The more I thought, the more troubled I became;
PSA.39.3	I could not keep from asking:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	When will I die?
PSA.39.4	Tell me how soon my life will end.”
PSA.39.5	How short you have made my life!
PSA.39.5	In your sight my lifetime seems nothing.
PSA.39.5	Indeed every living being is no more than a puff of wind,
PSA.39.6	no more than a shadow.
PSA.39.6	All we do is for nothing;
PSA.39.6	we gather wealth, but don't know who will get it.
PSA.39.7	What, then, can I hope for, Lord?
PSA.39.7	I put my hope in you.
PSA.39.8	Save me from all my sins,
PSA.39.8	and don't let fools make fun of me.
PSA.39.9	I will keep quiet, I will not say a word,
PSA.39.9	for you are the one who made me suffer like this.
PSA.39.10	Don't punish me any more!
PSA.39.10	I am about to die from your blows.
PSA.39.11	You punish our sins by your rebukes,
PSA.39.11	and like a moth you destroy what we love.
PSA.39.11	Indeed we are no more than a puff of wind!
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.39.12	and listen to my cry;
PSA.39.12	come to my aid when I weep.
PSA.39.12	Like all my ancestors
PSA.39.12	I am only your guest for a little while.
PSA.39.13	Leave me alone so that I may have some happiness
PSA.39.13	before I go away and am no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	then he listened to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He pulled me out of a dangerous pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the deadly quicksand.
PSA.40.2	He set me safely on a rock
PSA.40.2	and made me secure.
PSA.40.3	He taught me to sing a new song,
PSA.40.3	a song of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many who see this will take warning
PSA.40.3	and will put their trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Happy are those who trust the 
PSA.40.4	who do not turn to idols
PSA.40.4	or join those who worship false gods.
PSA.40.5	You have done many things for us, O 
PSA.40.5	there is no one like you!
PSA.40.5	You have made many wonderful plans for us.
PSA.40.5	I could never speak of them all—
PSA.40.5	their number is so great!
PSA.40.6	you do not ask for animals burned whole on the altar
PSA.40.6	or for sacrifices to take away sins.
PSA.40.6	Instead, you have given me ears to hear you,
PSA.40.7	and so I answered, “Here I am;
PSA.40.7	your instructions for me are in the book of the Law.
PSA.40.8	How I love to do your will, my God!
PSA.40.8	I keep your teaching in my heart.”
PSA.40.9	In the assembly of all your people, 
PSA.40.9	I told the good news that you save us.
PSA.40.9	You know that I will never stop telling it.
PSA.40.10	I have not kept the news of salvation to myself;
PSA.40.10	I have always spoken of your faithfulness and help.
PSA.40.10	In the assembly of all your people I have not been silent
PSA.40.10	about your loyalty and constant love.
PSA.40.11	Your love and loyalty will always keep me safe.
PSA.40.12	I am surrounded by many troubles—
PSA.40.12	too many to count!
PSA.40.12	My sins have caught up with me,
PSA.40.12	and I can no longer see;
PSA.40.12	they are more than the hairs of my head,
PSA.40.12	and I have lost my courage.
PSA.40.13	Save me, 
PSA.40.14	May those who try to kill me
PSA.40.14	be completely defeated and confused.
PSA.40.14	May those who are happy because of my troubles
PSA.40.14	be turned back and disgraced.
PSA.40.15	May those who make fun of me
PSA.40.15	be dismayed by their defeat.
PSA.40.16	May all who come to you
PSA.40.16	be glad and joyful.
PSA.40.16	May all who are thankful for your salvation
PSA.40.16	always say, “How great is the 
PSA.40.17	I am weak and poor, O Lord,
PSA.40.17	but you have not forgotten me.
PSA.40.17	You are my savior and my God—
PSA.40.17	hurry to my aid!
PSA.41.1	Happy are those who are concerned for the poor;
PSA.41.1	the 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	he will make them happy in the land;
PSA.41.2	he will not abandon them to the power of their enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	and will restore them to health.
PSA.41.4	I said, “I have sinned against you, 
PSA.41.4	be merciful to me and heal me.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies say cruel things about me.
PSA.41.5	They want me to die and be forgotten.
PSA.41.6	Those who come to see me are not sincere;
PSA.41.6	they gather bad news about me
PSA.41.6	and then go out and tell it everywhere.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper to each other about me,
PSA.41.7	they imagine the worst about
PSA.41.8	They say, “He is fatally ill;
PSA.41.8	he will never leave his bed again.”
PSA.41.9	the one who shared my food,
PSA.41.9	has turned against me.
PSA.41.10	Be merciful to me, 
PSA.41.10	and I will pay my enemies back.
PSA.41.11	They will not triumph over me,
PSA.41.11	and I will know that you are pleased with me.
PSA.41.12	You will help me, because I do what is right;
PSA.41.12	you will keep me in your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Praise him now and forever!
PSA.41.13	Amen! Amen!
PSA.42.1	As a deer longs for a stream of cool water,
PSA.42.1	so I long for you, O God.
PSA.42.2	I thirst for you, the living God.
PSA.42.2	When can I go and worship in your presence?
PSA.42.3	Day and night I cry,
PSA.42.3	and tears are my only food;
PSA.42.3	all the time my enemies ask me,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	My heart breaks when I remember the past,
PSA.42.4	when I went with the crowds to the house of God
PSA.42.4	and led them as they walked along,
PSA.42.4	a happy crowd, singing and shouting praise to God.
PSA.42.5	Why am I so sad?
PSA.42.5	Why am I so troubled?
PSA.42.5	I will put my hope in God,
PSA.42.5	and once again I will praise him,
PSA.42.5	my savior and my God.
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	Here in exile my heart is breaking,
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	and so I turn my thoughts to him.
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	He has sent waves of sorrow over my soul;
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	chaos roars at me like a flood,
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	like waterfalls thundering down to the Jordan
PSA.42.6+PSA.42.7	from Mount Hermon and Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.8	May the 
PSA.42.8	so that I may have a song at night,
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	To God, my defender, I say,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I go on suffering
PSA.42.9	from the cruelty of my enemies?”
PSA.42.10	I am crushed by their insults,
PSA.42.10	as they keep on asking me,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why am I so sad?
PSA.42.11	Why am I so troubled?
PSA.42.11	I will put my hope in God,
PSA.42.11	and once again I will praise him,
PSA.42.11	my savior and my God.
PSA.43.1	O God, declare me innocent,
PSA.43.1	and defend my cause against the ungodly;
PSA.43.1	deliver me from lying and evil people!
PSA.43.2	You are my protector;
PSA.43.2	why have you abandoned me?
PSA.43.2	Why must I go on suffering
PSA.43.2	from the cruelty of my enemies?
PSA.43.3	Send your light and your truth;
PSA.43.3	may they lead me
PSA.43.3	and bring me back to Zion, your sacred hill,
PSA.43.3	and to your Temple, where you live.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to your altar, O God;
PSA.43.4	you are the source of my happiness.
PSA.43.4	I will play my harp and sing praise to you,
PSA.43.4	O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why am I so sad?
PSA.43.5	Why am I so troubled?
PSA.43.5	I will put my hope in God,
PSA.43.5	and once again I will praise him,
PSA.43.5	my savior and my God.
PSA.44.1	With our own ears we have heard it, O God—
PSA.44.1	our ancestors have told us about it,
PSA.44.1	about the great things you did in their time,
PSA.44.1	in the days of long ago:
PSA.44.2	how you yourself drove out the heathen
PSA.44.2	and established your people in their land;
PSA.44.2	how you punished the other nations
PSA.44.2	and caused your own to prosper.
PSA.44.3	Your people did not conquer the land with their swords;
PSA.44.3	they did not win it by their own power;
PSA.44.3	it was by your power and your strength,
PSA.44.3	by the assurance of your presence,
PSA.44.3	which showed that you loved them.
PSA.44.4	You are my king and my God;
PSA.44.4	you give
PSA.44.5	and by your power we defeat our enemies.
PSA.44.6	I do not trust in my bow
PSA.44.6	or in my sword to save me;
PSA.44.7	but you have saved us from our enemies
PSA.44.7	and defeated those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	We will always praise you
PSA.44.8	and give thanks to you forever.
PSA.44.9	But now you have rejected us and let us be defeated;
PSA.44.9	you no longer march out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You made us run from our enemies,
PSA.44.10	and they took for themselves what was ours.
PSA.44.11	You allowed us to be slaughtered like sheep;
PSA.44.11	you scattered us in foreign countries.
PSA.44.12	You sold your own people for a small price
PSA.44.12	as though they had little value.
PSA.44.13	Our neighbors see what you did to us,
PSA.44.13	and they mock us and laugh at us.
PSA.44.14	You have made us a joke among the nations;
PSA.44.14	they shake their heads at us in scorn.
PSA.44.15	I am always in disgrace;
PSA.44.15	I am covered with shame
PSA.44.16	from hearing the sneers and insults
PSA.44.16	of my enemies and those who hate me.
PSA.44.17	All this has happened to us,
PSA.44.17	even though we have not forgotten you
PSA.44.17	or broken the covenant you made with us.
PSA.44.18	We have not been disloyal to you;
PSA.44.18	we have not disobeyed your commands.
PSA.44.19	Yet you left us helpless among wild animals;
PSA.44.19	you abandoned us in deepest darkness.
PSA.44.20	If we had stopped worshiping our God
PSA.44.20	and prayed to a foreign god,
PSA.44.21	you would surely have discovered it,
PSA.44.21	because you know our secret thoughts.
PSA.44.22	that we are treated like sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Wake up, Lord! Why are you asleep?
PSA.44.23	Rouse yourself! Don't reject us forever!
PSA.44.24	Why are you hiding from us?
PSA.44.24	Don't forget our suffering and trouble!
PSA.44.25	We fall crushed to the ground;
PSA.44.25	we lie defeated in the dust.
PSA.44.26	Come to our aid!
PSA.44.26	Because of your constant love save us!
PSA.45.1	Beautiful words fill my mind,
PSA.45.1	as I compose this song for the king.
PSA.45.1	Like the pen of a good writer
PSA.45.1	my tongue is ready with a poem.
PSA.45.2	You are the most handsome of men;
PSA.45.2	you are an eloquent speaker.
PSA.45.2	God has always blessed you.
PSA.45.3	Buckle on your sword, mighty king;
PSA.45.3	you are glorious and majestic.
PSA.45.4	Ride on in majesty to victory
PSA.45.4	for the defense of truth and justice!
PSA.45.4	Your strength will win you great victories!
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp,
PSA.45.5	they pierce the hearts of your enemies;
PSA.45.5	nations fall down at your feet.
PSA.45.6	will last forever and ever.
PSA.45.6	You rule over your people with justice;
PSA.45.7	you love what is right and hate what is evil.
PSA.45.7	That is why God, your God, has chosen you
PSA.45.7	and has poured out more happiness on you
PSA.45.7	than on any other king.
PSA.45.8	The perfume of myrrh and aloes is on your clothes;
PSA.45.8	musicians entertain you in palaces decorated with ivory.
PSA.45.9	Among the women of your court are daughters of kings,
PSA.45.9	and at the right of your throne stands the queen,
PSA.45.9	wearing ornaments of finest gold.
PSA.45.10	Bride of the king, listen to what I say—
PSA.45.10	forget your people and your relatives.
PSA.45.11	Your beauty will make the king desire you;
PSA.45.11	he is your master, so you must obey him.
PSA.45.12	The people of Tyre will bring you gifts;
PSA.45.12	rich people will try to win your favor.
PSA.45.13	The princess is in the palace—how beautiful she is!
PSA.45.13	Her gown is made of gold thread.
PSA.45.14	In her colorful gown she is led to the king,
PSA.45.14	followed by her bridesmaids,
PSA.45.14	and they also are brought to him.
PSA.45.15	With joy and gladness they come
PSA.45.15	and enter the king's palace.
PSA.45.16	You, my king, will have many sons
PSA.45.16	to succeed your ancestors as kings,
PSA.45.16	and you will make them rulers over the whole earth.
PSA.45.17	My song will keep your fame alive forever,
PSA.45.17	and everyone will praise you for all time to come.
PSA.46.1	God is our shelter and strength,
PSA.46.1	always ready to help in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	So we will not be afraid, even if the earth is shaken
PSA.46.2	and mountains fall into the ocean depths;
PSA.46.3	even if the seas roar and rage,
PSA.46.3	and the hills are shaken by the violence.
PSA.46.4	There is a river that brings joy to the city of God,
PSA.46.4	to the sacred house of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in that city, and it will never be destroyed;
PSA.46.5	at early dawn he will come to its aid.
PSA.46.6	Nations are terrified, kingdoms are shaken;
PSA.46.6	God thunders, and the earth dissolves.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob is our refuge.
PSA.46.8	Come and see what the 
PSA.46.8	See what amazing things he has done on earth.
PSA.46.9	He stops wars all over the world;
PSA.46.9	he breaks bows, destroys spears,
PSA.46.9	and sets shields on fire.
PSA.46.10	“Stop fighting,” he says, “and know that I am God,
PSA.46.10	supreme among the nations,
PSA.46.10	supreme over the world.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob is our refuge.
PSA.47.1	Clap your hands for joy, all peoples!
PSA.47.1	Praise God with loud songs!
PSA.47.2	The 
PSA.47.2	he is a great king, ruling over all the world.
PSA.47.3	He gave us victory over the peoples;
PSA.47.3	he made us rule over the nations.
PSA.47.4	He chose for us the land where we live,
PSA.47.4	the proud possession of his people, whom he loves.
PSA.47.5	God goes up to his throne.
PSA.47.5	There are shouts of joy and the blast of trumpets,
PSA.47.5	as the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praise to God;
PSA.47.6	sing praise to our king!
PSA.47.7	God is king over all the world;
PSA.47.7	praise him with songs!
PSA.47.8	God sits on his sacred throne;
PSA.47.8	he rules over the nations.
PSA.47.9	The rulers of the nations assemble
PSA.47.9	with the people
PSA.47.9	More powerful than all armies is he;
PSA.47.9	he rules supreme.
PSA.48.1	The 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God, on his sacred hill.
PSA.48.2	the city of the great king brings joy to all the world.
PSA.48.3	God has shown that there is safety with him
PSA.48.3	inside the fortresses of the city.
PSA.48.4	The kings gathered together
PSA.48.4	and came to attack Mount Zion.
PSA.48.5	But when they saw it, they were amazed;
PSA.48.5	they were afraid and ran away.
PSA.48.6	There they were seized with fear and anguish,
PSA.48.6	like a woman about to bear a child,
PSA.48.7	like ships tossing in a furious storm.
PSA.48.8	We have heard what God has done,
PSA.48.8	and now we have seen it
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God, the 
PSA.48.8	he will keep the city safe forever.
PSA.48.9	Inside your Temple, O God,
PSA.48.9	we think of your constant love.
PSA.48.10	You are praised by people everywhere,
PSA.48.10	and your fame extends over all the earth.
PSA.48.10	You rule with justice;
PSA.48.11	let the people of Zion be glad!
PSA.48.11	You give right judgments;
PSA.48.11	let there be joy in the cities of Judah!
PSA.48.12	People of God, walk around Zion and count the towers;
PSA.48.13	take notice of the walls and examine the fortresses,
PSA.48.13	so that you may tell the next generation:
PSA.48.14	“This God is our God forever and ever;
PSA.48.14	he will lead us for all time to come.”
PSA.49.1	Hear this, everyone!
PSA.49.1	Listen, all people everywhere,
PSA.49.2	great and small alike,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My thoughts will be clear;
PSA.49.3	I will speak words of wisdom.
PSA.49.4	I will turn my attention to proverbs
PSA.49.4	and explain their meaning as I play the harp.
PSA.49.5	I am not afraid in times of danger
PSA.49.5	when I am surrounded by enemies,
PSA.49.6	by evil people who trust in their riches
PSA.49.6	and boast of their great wealth.
PSA.49.7	We can never redeem ourselves;
PSA.49.7	we cannot pay God the price for our lives,
PSA.49.8	because the payment for a human life is too great.
PSA.49.8	What we could pay would never be enough
PSA.49.9	to keep us from the grave,
PSA.49.9	to let us live forever.
PSA.49.10	as well as the foolish and stupid.
PSA.49.10	They all leave their riches to their descendants.
PSA.49.11	Their graves
PSA.49.11	there they stay for all time,
PSA.49.11	though they once had lands of their own.
PSA.49.12	Our greatness cannot keep us from death;
PSA.49.12	we will still die like the animals.
PSA.49.13	See what happens to those who trust in themselves,
PSA.49.13	the fate of those
PSA.49.14	they are doomed to die like sheep,
PSA.49.14	and Death will be their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	The righteous will triumph over them,
PSA.49.14	as their bodies quickly decay
PSA.49.14	in the world of the dead far from their homes.
PSA.49.15	But God will rescue me;
PSA.49.15	he will save me from the power of death.
PSA.49.16	Don't be upset when someone becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	when his wealth grows even greater;
PSA.49.17	he cannot take it with him when he dies;
PSA.49.17	his wealth will not go with him to the grave.
PSA.49.18	Even if someone is satisfied with this life
PSA.49.18	and is praised because he is successful,
PSA.49.19	he will join all his ancestors in death,
PSA.49.19	where the darkness lasts forever.
PSA.49.20	Our greatness cannot keep us from death;
PSA.49.20	we will still die like the animals.
PSA.50.1	The Almighty God, the 
PSA.50.1	he calls to the whole earth from east to west.
PSA.50.2	God shines from Zion,
PSA.50.2	the city perfect in its beauty.
PSA.50.3	Our God is coming, but not in silence;
PSA.50.3	a raging fire is in front of him,
PSA.50.3	a furious storm around him.
PSA.50.4	He calls heaven and earth as witnesses
PSA.50.4	to see him judge his people.
PSA.50.5	He says, “Gather my faithful people to me,
PSA.50.5	those who made a covenant with me by offering a sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	The heavens proclaim that God is righteous,
PSA.50.6	that he himself is judge.
PSA.50.7	“Listen, my people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	I will testify against you, Israel.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not reprimand you because of your sacrifices
PSA.50.8	and the burnt offerings you always bring me.
PSA.50.9	And yet I do not need bulls from your farms
PSA.50.9	or goats from your flocks;
PSA.50.10	all the animals in the forest are mine
PSA.50.10	and the cattle on thousands of hills.
PSA.50.11	All the wild birds are mine
PSA.50.11	and all living things in the fields.
PSA.50.12	“If I were hungry, I would not ask you for food,
PSA.50.12	for the world and everything in it is mine.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Let the giving of thanks be your sacrifice to God,
PSA.50.14	and give the Almighty all that you promised.
PSA.50.15	Call to me when trouble comes;
PSA.50.15	I will save you,
PSA.50.15	and you will praise me.”
PSA.50.16	But God says to the wicked,
PSA.50.16	“Why should you recite my commandments?
PSA.50.16	Why should you talk about my covenant?
PSA.50.17	You refuse to let me correct you;
PSA.50.17	you reject my commands.
PSA.50.18	You become the friend of every thief you see,
PSA.50.18	and you associate with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	“You are always ready to speak evil;
PSA.50.19	you never hesitate to tell lies.
PSA.50.20	You are ready to accuse your own relatives
PSA.50.20	and to find fault with them.
PSA.50.21	You have done all this, and I have said nothing,
PSA.50.21	so you thought that I am like you.
PSA.50.21	But now I reprimand you
PSA.50.21	and make the matter plain to you.
PSA.50.22	“Listen to this, you that ignore me,
PSA.50.22	or I will destroy you,
PSA.50.22	and there will be no one to save you.
PSA.50.23	Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me,
PSA.50.23	and I will surely save all who obey me.”
PSA.51.1	Be merciful to me, O God,
PSA.51.1	because of your constant love.
PSA.51.1	Because of your great mercy
PSA.51.1	wipe away my sins!
PSA.51.2	Wash away all my evil
PSA.51.2	and make me clean from my sin!
PSA.51.3	I recognize my faults;
PSA.51.3	I am always conscious of my sins.
PSA.51.4	and done what you consider evil.
PSA.51.4	So you are right in judging me;
PSA.51.4	you are justified in condemning me.
PSA.51.5	I have been evil from the day I was born;
PSA.51.5	from the time I was conceived, I have been sinful.
PSA.51.6	Sincerity and truth are what you require;
PSA.51.6	fill my mind with your wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Remove my sin, and I will be clean;
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Let me hear the sounds of joy and gladness;
PSA.51.8	and though you have crushed me and broken me,
PSA.51.8	I will be happy once again.
PSA.51.9	Close your eyes to my sins
PSA.51.9	and wipe out all my evil.
PSA.51.10	Create a pure heart in me, O God,
PSA.51.10	and put a new and loyal spirit in me.
PSA.51.11	Do not banish me from your presence;
PSA.51.11	do not take your holy spirit away from me.
PSA.51.12	Give me again the joy that comes from your salvation,
PSA.51.12	and make me willing to obey you.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach sinners your commands,
PSA.51.13	and they will turn back to you.
PSA.51.14	Spare my life, O God, and save me,
PSA.51.14	and I will gladly proclaim your righteousness.
PSA.51.15	Help me to speak, Lord,
PSA.51.15	and I will praise you.
PSA.51.16	You do not want sacrifices,
PSA.51.16	or I would offer them;
PSA.51.16	you are not pleased with burnt offerings.
PSA.51.17	My sacrifice is a humble spirit, O God;
PSA.51.17	you will not reject a humble and repentant heart.
PSA.51.18	O God, be kind to Zion and help her;
PSA.51.18	rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will be pleased with proper sacrifices
PSA.51.19	and with our burnt offerings;
PSA.51.19	and bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast, great one, of your evil?
PSA.52.1	God's faithfulness is eternal.
PSA.52.2	You make plans to ruin others;
PSA.52.2	your tongue is like a sharp razor.
PSA.52.2	You are always inventing lies.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good
PSA.52.3	and falsehood more than truth.
PSA.52.4	You love to hurt people with your words, you liar!
PSA.52.5	So God will ruin you forever;
PSA.52.5	he will take hold of you and snatch you from your home;
PSA.52.5	he will remove you from the world of the living.
PSA.52.6	Righteous people will see this and be afraid;
PSA.52.6	then they will laugh at you and say,
PSA.52.7	“Look, here is someone who did not depend on God for safety,
PSA.52.7	but trusted instead in great wealth
PSA.52.7	and looked for security in being wicked.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree growing in the house of God;
PSA.52.8	I trust in his constant love forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will always thank you, God, for what you have done;
PSA.52.9	in the presence of your people
PSA.52.9	I will proclaim that you are good.
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are all corrupt,
PSA.53.1	and they have done terrible things;
PSA.53.1	there is no one who does what is right.
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven at people
PSA.53.2	to see if there are any who are wise,
PSA.53.2	any who worship him.
PSA.53.3	But they have all turned away;
PSA.53.3	they are all equally bad.
PSA.53.3	Not one of them does what is right,
PSA.53.3	not a single one.
PSA.53.4	“Don't they know?” God asks.
PSA.53.4	“Are these evildoers ignorant?
PSA.53.4	They live by robbing my people,
PSA.53.4	and they never pray to me.”
PSA.53.5	But then they will become terrified,
PSA.53.5	as they have never been before,
PSA.53.5	for God will scatter the bones of the enemies of his people.
PSA.53.5	God has rejected them,
PSA.53.5	and so Israel will totally defeat them.
PSA.53.6	How I pray that victory
PSA.53.6	will come to Israel from Zion.
PSA.53.6	How happy the people of Israel will be
PSA.53.6	when God makes them prosperous again!
PSA.54.1	Save me by your power, O God;
PSA.54.1	set me free by your might!
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	listen to my words!
PSA.54.3	Proud people are coming to attack me;
PSA.54.3	cruel people are trying to kill me—
PSA.54.3	those who do not care about God.
PSA.54.4	But God is my helper.
PSA.54.4	The Lord is my defender.
PSA.54.5	May God use their own evil to punish my enemies.
PSA.54.5	He will destroy them because he is faithful.
PSA.54.6	I will gladly offer you a sacrifice, O 
PSA.54.6	I will give you thanks
PSA.54.6	because you are good.
PSA.54.7	You have rescued me from all my troubles,
PSA.54.7	and I have seen my enemies defeated.
PSA.55.1	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.55.1	don't turn away from my plea!
PSA.55.2	Listen to me and answer me;
PSA.55.2	I am worn out by my worries.
PSA.55.3	I am terrified by the threats of my enemies,
PSA.55.3	crushed by the oppression of the wicked.
PSA.55.3	They bring trouble on me;
PSA.55.3	they are angry with me and hate me.
PSA.55.4	I am terrified,
PSA.55.4	and the terrors of death crush me.
PSA.55.5	I am gripped by fear and trembling;
PSA.55.5	I am overcome with horror.
PSA.55.6	I wish I had wings like a dove.
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and find rest.
PSA.55.7	I would fly far away
PSA.55.7	and make my home in the desert.
PSA.55.8	I would hurry and find myself a shelter
PSA.55.8	from the raging wind and the storm.
PSA.55.9	Confuse the speech of my enemies, O Lord!
PSA.55.9	I see violence and riots in the city,
PSA.55.10	surrounding it day and night,
PSA.55.10	filling it with crime and trouble.
PSA.55.11	There is destruction everywhere;
PSA.55.11	the streets are full of oppression and fraud.
PSA.55.12	If it were an enemy making fun of me,
PSA.55.12	I could endure it;
PSA.55.12	if it were an opponent boasting over me,
PSA.55.12	I could hide myself from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, my companion,
PSA.55.13	my colleague and close friend.
PSA.55.14	We had intimate talks with each other
PSA.55.14	and worshiped together in the Temple.
PSA.55.15	May my enemies die before their time;
PSA.55.15	may they go down alive into the world of the dead!
PSA.55.15	Evil is in their homes and in their hearts.
PSA.55.16	But I call to the 
PSA.55.16	and he will save me.
PSA.55.17	Morning, noon, and night
PSA.55.17	my complaints and groans go up to him,
PSA.55.17	and he will hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He will bring me safely back
PSA.55.18	from the battles that I fight
PSA.55.18	against so many enemies.
PSA.55.19	God, who has ruled from eternity,
PSA.55.19	will hear me and defeat them;
PSA.55.19	for they refuse to change,
PSA.55.19	and they do not fear him.
PSA.55.20	My former companion attacked his friends;
PSA.55.20	he broke his promises.
PSA.55.21	His words were smoother than cream,
PSA.55.21	but there was hatred in his heart;
PSA.55.21	his words were as soothing as oil,
PSA.55.21	but they cut like sharp swords.
PSA.55.22	Leave your troubles with the 
PSA.55.22	and he will defend you;
PSA.55.22	he never lets honest people be defeated.
PSA.55.23	But you, O God, will bring those murderers and liars to their graves
PSA.55.23	before half their life is over.
PSA.55.23	As for me, I will trust in you.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful to me, O God,
PSA.56.1	because I am under attack;
PSA.56.1	my enemies persecute me all the time.
PSA.56.2	All day long my opponents attack me.
PSA.56.2	There are so many who fight against me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid, O 
PSA.56.3	I put my trust in you.
PSA.56.4	I trust in God and am not afraid;
PSA.56.4	I praise him for what he has promised.
PSA.56.4	What can a mere human being do to me?
PSA.56.5	My enemies make trouble for me all day long;
PSA.56.5	they are always thinking up some way to hurt me!
PSA.56.6	They gather in hiding places
PSA.56.6	and watch everything I do,
PSA.56.6	hoping to kill me.
PSA.56.7	Punish
PSA.56.7	defeat those people in your anger!
PSA.56.8	You know how troubled I am;
PSA.56.8	you have kept a record of my tears.
PSA.56.8	Aren't they listed in your book?
PSA.56.9	The day I call to you,
PSA.56.9	my enemies will be turned back.
PSA.56.9	I know this: God
PSA.56.10	the 
PSA.56.11	In him I trust, and I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can a mere human being do to me?
PSA.56.12	O God, I will offer you what I have promised;
PSA.56.12	I will give you my offering of thanksgiving,
PSA.56.13	because you have rescued me from death
PSA.56.13	and kept me from defeat.
PSA.56.13	And so I walk in the presence of God,
PSA.56.13	in the light that shines on the living.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful,
PSA.57.1	because I come to you for safety.
PSA.57.1	In the shadow of your wings I find protection
PSA.57.1	until the raging storms are over.
PSA.57.2	I call to God, the Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God, who supplies my every need.
PSA.57.3	He will answer from heaven and save me;
PSA.57.3	he will defeat my oppressors.
PSA.57.3	God will show me his constant love and faithfulness.
PSA.57.4	I am surrounded by enemies,
PSA.57.4	who are like lions hungry for human flesh.
PSA.57.4	Their teeth are like spears and arrows;
PSA.57.4	their tongues are like sharp swords.
PSA.57.5	Show your greatness in the sky, O God,
PSA.57.5	and your glory over all the earth.
PSA.57.6	My enemies have spread a net to catch me;
PSA.57.6	I am overcome with distress.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit in my path,
PSA.57.6	but fell into it themselves.
PSA.57.7	I have complete confidence, O God;
PSA.57.7	I will sing and praise you!
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my soul!
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up the sun.
PSA.57.9	I will thank you, O Lord, among the nations.
PSA.57.9	I will praise you among the peoples.
PSA.57.10	Your constant love reaches the heavens;
PSA.57.10	your faithfulness touches the skies.
PSA.57.11	Show your greatness in the sky, O God,
PSA.57.11	and your glory over all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you rulers
PSA.58.1	Do you judge everyone fairly?
PSA.58.2	No! You think only of the evil you can do,
PSA.58.2	and commit crimes of violence in the land.
PSA.58.3	Evildoers go wrong all their lives;
PSA.58.3	they tell lies from the day they are born.
PSA.58.4	They are full of poison like snakes;
PSA.58.4	they stop up their ears like a deaf cobra,
PSA.58.5	which does not hear the voice of the snake charmer,
PSA.58.5	or the chant of the clever magician.
PSA.58.6	Break the teeth of these fierce lions, O God.
PSA.58.7	May they disappear like water draining away;
PSA.58.7	may they be crushed like weeds on a path.
PSA.58.8	May they be like snails that dissolve into slime;
PSA.58.8	may they be like a baby born dead that never sees the light.
PSA.58.9	Before they know it, they are cut down like weeds;
PSA.58.9	in his fierce anger God will blow them away
PSA.58.9	while they are still living.
PSA.58.10	The righteous will be glad when they see sinners punished;
PSA.58.10	they will wade through the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	People will say, “The righteous are indeed rewarded;
PSA.58.11	there is indeed a God who judges the world.”
PSA.59.1	Save me from my enemies, my God;
PSA.59.1	protect me from those who attack me!
PSA.59.2	Save me from those evil people;
PSA.59.2	rescue me from those murderers!
PSA.59.3	Look! They are waiting to kill me;
PSA.59.3	cruel people are gathering against me.
PSA.59.3	It is not because of any sin or wrong I have done,
PSA.59.4	nor because of any fault of mine, O 
PSA.59.4	that they hurry to their places.
PSA.59.5	Rise, 
PSA.59.5	see for yourself, God of Israel!
PSA.59.5	Wake up and punish the heathen;
PSA.59.5	show no mercy to evil traitors!
PSA.59.6	They come back in the evening,
PSA.59.6	snarling like dogs as they go about the city.
PSA.59.7	Listen to their insults and threats.
PSA.59.7	Their tongues are like swords in their mouths,
PSA.59.7	yet they think that no one hears them.
PSA.59.8	But you laugh at them, 
PSA.59.8	you mock all the heathen.
PSA.59.9	I have confidence in your strength;
PSA.59.9	you are my refuge, O God.
PSA.59.10	My God loves me and will come to me;
PSA.59.10	he will let me see my enemies defeated.
PSA.59.11	Do not kill them, O God, or my people may forget.
PSA.59.11	Scatter them by your strength and defeat them,
PSA.59.11	O Lord, our protector.
PSA.59.12	Sin is on their lips; all their words are sinful;
PSA.59.12	may they be caught in their pride!
PSA.59.12	Because they curse and lie,
PSA.59.13	destroy them in your anger;
PSA.59.13	destroy them completely.
PSA.59.13	Then everyone will know that God rules in Israel,
PSA.59.13	that his rule extends over all the earth.
PSA.59.14	My enemies come back in the evening,
PSA.59.14	snarling like dogs as they go about the city,
PSA.59.15	like dogs roaming about for food
PSA.59.15	and growling if they do not find enough.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing about your strength;
PSA.59.16	every morning I will sing aloud of your constant love.
PSA.59.16	You have been a refuge for me,
PSA.59.16	a shelter in my time of trouble.
PSA.59.17	I will praise you, my defender.
PSA.59.17	My refuge is God,
PSA.59.17	the God who loves me.
PSA.60.1	You have rejected us, God, and defeated us;
PSA.60.1	you have been angry with us—but now turn back to us.
PSA.60.2	You have made the land tremble, and you have cut it open;
PSA.60.2	now heal its wounds, because it is falling apart.
PSA.60.3	You have made your people suffer greatly;
PSA.60.3	we stagger around as though we were drunk.
PSA.60.4	You have warned those who have reverence for you,
PSA.60.4	so that they might escape destruction.
PSA.60.5	Save us by your might; answer our prayer,
PSA.60.5	so that the people you love may be rescued.
PSA.60.6	From his sanctuary
PSA.60.6	“In triumph I will divide Shechem
PSA.60.6	and distribute Sukkoth Valley to my people.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh too;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is my helmet
PSA.60.7	and Judah my royal scepter.
PSA.60.8	But I will use Moab as my washbowl,
PSA.60.8	and I will throw my sandals on Edom,
PSA.60.8	as a sign that I own it.
PSA.60.8	Did the Philistines think they would shout in triumph over me?”
PSA.60.9	Who, O God, will take me into the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Have you really rejected us?
PSA.60.10	Aren't you going to march out with our armies?
PSA.60.11	Help us against the enemy;
PSA.60.11	human help is worthless.
PSA.60.12	With God on our side we will win;
PSA.60.12	he will defeat our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	listen to my prayer!
PSA.61.2	In despair and far from home
PSA.61.2	I call to you!
PSA.61.2	Take me to a safe refuge,
PSA.61.3	for you are my protector,
PSA.61.3	my strong defense against my enemies.
PSA.61.4	Let me live in your sanctuary all my life;
PSA.61.4	let me find safety under your wings.
PSA.61.5	You have heard my promises, O God,
PSA.61.5	and you have given me what belongs to those who honor you.
PSA.61.6	Add many years to the king's life;
PSA.61.6	let him live on and on!
PSA.61.7	May he rule forever in your presence, O God;
PSA.61.7	protect him with your constant love and faithfulness.
PSA.61.8	So I will always sing praises to you,
PSA.61.8	as I offer you daily what I have promised.
PSA.62.1	I wait patiently for God to save me;
PSA.62.1	I depend on him alone.
PSA.62.2	He alone protects and saves me;
PSA.62.2	he is my defender,
PSA.62.2	and I shall never be defeated.
PSA.62.3	How much longer will all of you attack someone
PSA.62.3	who is no stronger than a broken-down fence?
PSA.62.4	You only want to bring him down from his place of honor;
PSA.62.4	you take pleasure in lies.
PSA.62.4	You speak words of blessing,
PSA.62.4	but in your heart you curse him.
PSA.62.5	I depend on God alone;
PSA.62.5	I put my hope in him.
PSA.62.6	He alone protects and saves me;
PSA.62.6	he is my defender,
PSA.62.6	and I shall never be defeated.
PSA.62.7	My salvation and honor depend on God;
PSA.62.7	he is my strong protector;
PSA.62.7	he is my shelter.
PSA.62.8	Trust in God at all times, my people.
PSA.62.8	Tell him all your troubles,
PSA.62.8	for he is our refuge.
PSA.62.9	Human beings are all like a puff of breath;
PSA.62.9	great and small alike are worthless.
PSA.62.9	Put them on the scales, and they weigh nothing;
PSA.62.9	they are lighter than a mere breath.
PSA.62.10	Don't put your trust in violence;
PSA.62.10	don't hope to gain anything by robbery;
PSA.62.10	even if your riches increase,
PSA.62.10	don't depend on them.
PSA.62.11	More than once I have heard God say
PSA.62.11	that power belongs to him
PSA.62.12	You yourself, O Lord, reward everyone according to their deeds.
PSA.63.1	O God, you are my God,
PSA.63.1	and I long for you.
PSA.63.1	My whole being desires you;
PSA.63.1	like a dry, worn-out, and waterless land,
PSA.63.1	my soul is thirsty for you.
PSA.63.2	Let me see you in the sanctuary;
PSA.63.2	let me see how mighty and glorious you are.
PSA.63.3	Your constant love is better than life itself,
PSA.63.3	and so I will praise you.
PSA.63.4	I will give you thanks as long as I live;
PSA.63.4	I will raise my hands to you in prayer.
PSA.63.5	My soul will feast and be satisfied,
PSA.63.5	and I will sing glad songs of praise to you.
PSA.63.6	As I lie in bed, I remember you;
PSA.63.6	all night long I think of you,
PSA.63.7	because you have always been my help.
PSA.63.7	In the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.
PSA.63.8	I cling to you,
PSA.63.8	and your hand keeps me safe.
PSA.63.9	Those who are trying to kill me
PSA.63.9	will go down into the world of the dead.
PSA.63.10	They will be killed in battle,
PSA.63.10	and their bodies eaten by wolves.
PSA.63.11	Because God gives him victory,
PSA.63.11	the king will rejoice.
PSA.63.11	Those who make promises in God's name will praise him,
PSA.63.11	but the mouths of liars will be shut.
PSA.64.1	I am in trouble, God—listen to my prayer!
PSA.64.1	I am afraid of my enemies—save my life!
PSA.64.2	Protect me from the plots of the wicked,
PSA.64.2	from mobs of evil people.
PSA.64.3	They sharpen their tongues like swords
PSA.64.3	and aim cruel words like arrows.
PSA.64.4	They are quick to spread their shameless lies;
PSA.64.4	they destroy good people with cowardly slander.
PSA.64.5	They encourage each other in their evil plots;
PSA.64.5	they talk about where they will place their traps.
PSA.64.5	“No one can see them,” they say.
PSA.64.6	They make evil plans and say,
PSA.64.6	“We have planned a perfect crime.”
PSA.64.6	The human heart and mind are a mystery.
PSA.64.7	But God shoots his arrows at them,
PSA.64.7	and suddenly they are wounded.
PSA.64.8	He will destroy them because of those words;
PSA.64.8	all who see them will shake their heads.
PSA.64.9	They will all be afraid;
PSA.64.9	they will think about what God has done
PSA.64.9	and tell about his deeds.
PSA.64.10	All righteous people will rejoice
PSA.64.10	because of what the 
PSA.64.10	They will find safety in him;
PSA.64.10	all good people will praise him.
PSA.65.1	O God, it is right for us to praise you in Zion
PSA.65.1	and keep our promises to you,
PSA.65.2	because you answer prayers.
PSA.65.2	People everywhere will come to you
PSA.65.3	on account of their sins.
PSA.65.3	Our faults defeat us,
PSA.65.3	but you forgive them.
PSA.65.4	Happy are those whom you choose,
PSA.65.4	whom you bring to live in your sanctuary.
PSA.65.4	We shall be satisfied with the good things of your house,
PSA.65.4	the blessings of your sacred Temple.
PSA.65.5	You answer us by giving us victory,
PSA.65.5	and you do wonderful things to save us.
PSA.65.5	People all over the world
PSA.65.5	and across the distant seas trust in you.
PSA.65.6	You set the mountains in place by your strength,
PSA.65.6	showing your mighty power.
PSA.65.7	You calm the roar of the seas
PSA.65.7	and the noise of the waves;
PSA.65.7	you calm the uproar of the peoples.
PSA.65.8	The whole world stands in awe
PSA.65.8	of the great things that you have done.
PSA.65.8	Your deeds bring shouts of joy
PSA.65.8	from one end of the earth to the other.
PSA.65.9	You show your care for the land by sending rain;
PSA.65.9	you make it rich and fertile.
PSA.65.9	You fill the streams with water;
PSA.65.9	you provide the earth with crops.
PSA.65.9	This is how you do it:
PSA.65.10	you send abundant rain on the plowed fields
PSA.65.10	and soak them with water;
PSA.65.10	you soften the soil with showers
PSA.65.10	and cause the young plants to grow.
PSA.65.11	What a rich harvest your goodness provides!
PSA.65.11	Wherever you go there is plenty.
PSA.65.12	The pastures are filled with flocks;
PSA.65.12	the hillsides are full of joy.
PSA.65.13	The fields are covered with sheep;
PSA.65.13	the valleys are full of wheat.
PSA.65.13	Everything shouts and sings for joy.
PSA.66.1	Praise God with shouts of joy, all people!
PSA.66.2	Sing to the glory of his name;
PSA.66.2	offer him glorious praise!
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How wonderful are the things you do!
PSA.66.3	Your power is so great
PSA.66.3	that your enemies bow down in fear before you.
PSA.66.4	Everyone on earth worships you;
PSA.66.4	they sing praises to you,
PSA.66.4	they sing praises to your name.”
PSA.66.5	Come and see what God has done,
PSA.66.5	his wonderful acts among people.
PSA.66.6	our ancestors crossed the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	There we rejoiced because of what he did.
PSA.66.7	He rules forever by his might
PSA.66.7	and keeps his eyes on the nations.
PSA.66.7	Let no rebels rise against him.
PSA.66.8	Praise our God, all nations;
PSA.66.8	let your praise be heard.
PSA.66.9	He has kept us alive
PSA.66.9	and has not allowed us to fall.
PSA.66.10	You have put us to the test, God;
PSA.66.10	as silver is purified by fire,
PSA.66.10	so you have tested us.
PSA.66.11	You let us fall into a trap
PSA.66.11	and placed heavy burdens on our backs.
PSA.66.12	You let our enemies trample us;
PSA.66.12	we went through fire and flood,
PSA.66.12	but now you have brought us to a place of safety.
PSA.66.13	I will bring burnt offerings to your house;
PSA.66.13	I will offer you what I promised.
PSA.66.14	I will give you what I said I would
PSA.66.14	when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer sheep to be burned on the altar;
PSA.66.15	I will sacrifice bulls and goats,
PSA.66.15	and the smoke will go up to the sky.
PSA.66.16	Come and listen, all who honor God,
PSA.66.16	and I will tell you what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried to him for help;
PSA.66.17	I praised him with songs.
PSA.66.18	If I had ignored my sins,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened to me.
PSA.66.19	But God has indeed heard me;
PSA.66.19	he has listened to my prayer.
PSA.66.20	I praise God,
PSA.66.20	because he did not reject my prayer
PSA.66.20	or keep back his constant love from me.
PSA.67.1	God, be merciful to us and bless us;
PSA.67.1	look on us with kindness,
PSA.67.2	so that the whole world may know your will;
PSA.67.2	so that all nations may know your salvation.
PSA.67.3	May the peoples praise you, O God;
PSA.67.3	may all the peoples praise you!
PSA.67.4	May the nations be glad and sing for joy,
PSA.67.4	because you judge the peoples with justice
PSA.67.4	and guide every nation on earth.
PSA.67.5	May the peoples praise you, O God;
PSA.67.5	may all the peoples praise you!
PSA.67.6	The land has produced its harvest;
PSA.67.6	God, our God, has blessed us.
PSA.67.7	God has blessed us;
PSA.67.7	may all people everywhere honor him.
PSA.68.1	God rises up and scatters his enemies.
PSA.68.1	Those who hate him run away in defeat.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is blown away, so he drives them off;
PSA.68.2	as wax melts in front of the fire,
PSA.68.2	so do the wicked perish in God's presence.
PSA.68.3	But the righteous are glad and rejoice in his presence;
PSA.68.3	they are happy and shout for joy.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing praises to his name;
PSA.68.4	prepare a way for him who rides on the clouds.
PSA.68.4	His name is the 
PSA.68.5	God, who lives in his sacred Temple,
PSA.68.5	cares for orphans and protects widows.
PSA.68.6	He gives the lonely a home to live in
PSA.68.6	and leads prisoners out into happy freedom,
PSA.68.6	but rebels will have to live in a desolate land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when you led your people,
PSA.68.7	when you marched across the desert,
PSA.68.8	because of the coming of the God of Sinai,
PSA.68.8	the coming of the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You caused abundant rain to fall
PSA.68.9	and restored your worn-out land;
PSA.68.10	your people made their home there;
PSA.68.10	in your goodness you provided for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the command,
PSA.68.11	and many women carried the news:
PSA.68.12	“Kings and their armies are running away!”
PSA.68.12	The women at home divided what was captured:
PSA.68.13	figures of doves covered with silver,
PSA.68.13	whose wings glittered with fine gold.
PSA.68.13	(Why did some of you stay among the sheep pens on the day of battle?)
PSA.68.14	When Almighty God scattered the kings on Mount Zalmon,
PSA.68.14	he caused snow to fall there.
PSA.68.15	What a mighty mountain is Bashan,
PSA.68.15	a mountain of many peaks!
PSA.68.16	Why from your mighty peaks do you look with scorn
PSA.68.16	on the mountain
PSA.68.16	The 
PSA.68.17	With his many thousands of mighty chariots
PSA.68.17	the Lord comes from Sinai
PSA.68.18	taking many captives with him;
PSA.68.18	he receives gifts from rebellious people.
PSA.68.18	The 
PSA.68.19	Praise the Lord,
PSA.68.19	who carries our burdens day after day;
PSA.68.19	he is the God who saves us.
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God who saves;
PSA.68.20	he is the 
PSA.68.20	who rescues us from death.
PSA.68.21	God will surely break the heads of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	of those who persist in their sinful ways.
PSA.68.22	The Lord has said, “I will bring your enemies back from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the ocean,
PSA.68.23	so that you may wade in their blood,
PSA.68.23	and your dogs may lap up as much as they want.”
PSA.68.24	O God, your march of triumph is seen by all,
PSA.68.24	the procession of God, my king, into his sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers are in front, the musicians are behind,
PSA.68.25	in between are the young women beating the tambourines.
PSA.68.26	“Praise God in the meeting of his people;
PSA.68.26	praise the 
PSA.68.27	First comes Benjamin, the smallest tribe,
PSA.68.27	then the leaders of Judah with their group,
PSA.68.27	followed by the leaders of Zebulun and Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Show your power, O God,
PSA.68.28	the power you have used on our behalf
PSA.68.29	from your Temple in Jerusalem,
PSA.68.29	where kings bring gifts to you.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke Egypt, that wild animal in the reeds;
PSA.68.30	rebuke the nations, that herd of bulls with their calves,
PSA.68.30	until they all bow down and offer you their silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter those people who love to make war!
PSA.68.31	Ambassadors
PSA.68.31	the Ethiopians
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, kingdoms of the world,
PSA.68.32	sing praise to the Lord,
PSA.68.33	to him who rides in the sky,
PSA.68.33	the ancient sky.
PSA.68.33	Listen to him shout with a mighty roar.
PSA.68.34	Proclaim God's power;
PSA.68.34	his majesty is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	his might is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	How awesome is God as he comes from his sanctuary—
PSA.68.35	the God of Israel!
PSA.68.35	He gives strength and power to his people.
PSA.68.35	Praise God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God!
PSA.69.1	The water is up to my neck;
PSA.69.2	I am sinking in deep mud,
PSA.69.2	and there is no solid ground;
PSA.69.2	I am out in deep water,
PSA.69.2	and the waves are about to drown me.
PSA.69.3	I am worn out from calling for help,
PSA.69.3	and my throat is aching.
PSA.69.3	I have strained my eyes,
PSA.69.3	looking for your help.
PSA.69.4	are more numerous than the hairs of my head.
PSA.69.4	My enemies tell lies against me;
PSA.69.4	they are strong and want to kill me.
PSA.69.4	They made me give back things I did not steal.
PSA.69.5	My sins, O God, are not hidden from you;
PSA.69.5	you know how foolish I have been.
PSA.69.6	Don't let me bring shame on those who trust in you,
PSA.69.6	Sovereign 
PSA.69.6	Don't let me bring disgrace to those who worship you,
PSA.69.6	O God of Israel!
PSA.69.7	It is for your sake that I have been insulted
PSA.69.7	and that I am covered with shame.
PSA.69.8	I am like a stranger to my relatives,
PSA.69.8	like a foreigner to my family.
PSA.69.9	the insults which are hurled at you fall on me.
PSA.69.10	I humble myself
PSA.69.10	and people insult me;
PSA.69.11	I dress myself in clothes of mourning,
PSA.69.11	and they laugh at me.
PSA.69.12	They talk about me in the streets,
PSA.69.12	and drunkards make up songs about me.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, I will pray to you, 
PSA.69.13	answer me, God, at a time you choose.
PSA.69.13	Answer me because of your great love,
PSA.69.13	because you keep your promise to save.
PSA.69.14	Save me from sinking in the mud;
PSA.69.14	keep me safe from my enemies,
PSA.69.14	safe from the deep water.
PSA.69.15	Don't let the flood come over me;
PSA.69.15	don't let me drown in the depths
PSA.69.15	or sink into the grave.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, 
PSA.69.16	in your great compassion turn to me!
PSA.69.17	Don't hide yourself from your servant;
PSA.69.17	I am in great trouble—answer me now!
PSA.69.18	Come to me and save me;
PSA.69.18	rescue me from my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know how I am insulted,
PSA.69.19	how I am disgraced and dishonored;
PSA.69.19	you see all my enemies.
PSA.69.20	Insults have broken my heart,
PSA.69.20	and I am in despair.
PSA.69.20	I had hoped for sympathy, but there was none;
PSA.69.20	for comfort, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	when I was thirsty, they offered me vinegar.
PSA.69.22	may their sacred feasts cause their downfall.
PSA.69.23	Strike them with blindness!
PSA.69.23	Make their backs always weak!
PSA.69.24	Pour out your anger on them;
PSA.69.24	let your indignation overtake them.
PSA.69.25	may no one be left alive in their tents.
PSA.69.26	They persecute those whom you have punished;
PSA.69.26	they talk about the sufferings of those you have wounded.
PSA.69.27	Keep a record of all their sins;
PSA.69.27	don't let them have any part in your salvation.
PSA.69.28	may they not be included in the list of your people.
PSA.69.29	But I am in pain and despair;
PSA.69.29	lift me up, O God, and save me!
PSA.69.30	I will praise God with a song;
PSA.69.30	I will proclaim his greatness by giving him thanks.
PSA.69.31	This will please the 
PSA.69.31	more than sacrificing a full-grown bull.
PSA.69.32	When the oppressed see this, they will be glad;
PSA.69.32	those who worship God will be encouraged.
PSA.69.33	The 
PSA.69.33	and does not forget his people in prison.
PSA.69.34	Praise God, O heaven and earth,
PSA.69.34	seas and all creatures in them.
PSA.69.35	He will save Jerusalem
PSA.69.35	and rebuild the towns of Judah.
PSA.69.35	His people will live there and possess the land;
PSA.69.36	the descendants of his servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	and those who love him will live there.
PSA.70.1	Save me, O God!
PSA.70.2	May those who try to kill me
PSA.70.2	be defeated and confused.
PSA.70.2	May those who are happy because of my troubles
PSA.70.2	be turned back and disgraced.
PSA.70.3	May those who make fun of me
PSA.70.3	be dismayed by their defeat.
PSA.70.4	May all who come to you
PSA.70.4	be glad and joyful.
PSA.70.4	May all who are thankful for your salvation
PSA.70.4	always say, “How great is God!”
PSA.70.5	I am weak and poor;
PSA.70.5	come to me quickly, O God.
PSA.70.5	You are my savior and my 
PSA.70.5	hurry to my aid!
PSA.71.1	never let me be defeated!
PSA.71.2	Because you are righteous, help me and rescue me.
PSA.71.2	Listen to me and save me!
PSA.71.3	Be my secure shelter
PSA.71.3	and a strong fortress
PSA.71.3	you are my refuge and defense.
PSA.71.4	My God, rescue me from wicked people,
PSA.71.4	from the power of cruel and evil people.
PSA.71.5	Sovereign 
PSA.71.5	I have trusted in you since I was young.
PSA.71.6	I have relied on you all my life;
PSA.71.6	you have protected
PSA.71.6	I will always praise you.
PSA.71.7	My life has been an example to many,
PSA.71.7	because you have been my strong defender.
PSA.71.8	All day long I praise you
PSA.71.8	and proclaim your glory.
PSA.71.9	Do not reject me now that I am old;
PSA.71.9	do not abandon me now that I am feeble.
PSA.71.10	My enemies want to kill me;
PSA.71.10	they talk and plot against me.
PSA.71.11	They say, “God has abandoned him;
PSA.71.11	let's go after him and catch him;
PSA.71.11	there is no one to rescue him.”
PSA.71.12	Don't stay so far away, O God;
PSA.71.12	my God, hurry to my aid!
PSA.71.13	May those who attack me
PSA.71.13	be defeated and destroyed.
PSA.71.13	May those who try to hurt me
PSA.71.13	be shamed and disgraced.
PSA.71.14	I will always put my hope in you;
PSA.71.14	I will praise you more and more.
PSA.71.15	I will tell of your goodness;
PSA.71.15	all day long I will speak of your salvation,
PSA.71.15	though it is more than I can understand.
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the 
PSA.71.16	I will proclaim your goodness, yours alone.
PSA.71.17	You have taught me ever since I was young,
PSA.71.17	and I still tell of your wonderful acts.
PSA.71.18	Now that I am old and my hair is gray,
PSA.71.18	do not abandon me, O God!
PSA.71.18	Be with me while I proclaim your power and might
PSA.71.18	to all generations to come.
PSA.71.19	Your righteousness, God, reaches the skies.
PSA.71.19	You have done great things;
PSA.71.19	there is no one like you.
PSA.71.20	You have sent troubles and suffering on me,
PSA.71.20	but you will restore my strength;
PSA.71.20	you will keep me from the grave.
PSA.71.21	You will make me greater than ever;
PSA.71.21	you will comfort me again.
PSA.71.22	I will indeed praise you with the harp;
PSA.71.22	I will praise your faithfulness, my God.
PSA.71.22	On my harp I will play hymns to you,
PSA.71.22	the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	I will shout for joy as I play for you;
PSA.71.23	with my whole being I will sing
PSA.71.23	because you have saved me.
PSA.71.24	I will speak of your righteousness all day long,
PSA.71.24	because those who tried to harm me
PSA.71.24	have been defeated and disgraced.
PSA.72.1	Teach the king to judge with your righteousness, O God;
PSA.72.1	share with him your own justice,
PSA.72.2	so that he will rule over your people with justice
PSA.72.2	and govern the oppressed with righteousness.
PSA.72.3	May the land enjoy prosperity;
PSA.72.3	may it experience righteousness.
PSA.72.4	May the king judge the poor fairly;
PSA.72.4	may he help the needy
PSA.72.4	and defeat their oppressors.
PSA.72.5	May your people worship you as long as the sun shines,
PSA.72.5	as long as the moon gives light, for ages to come.
PSA.72.6	May the king be like rain on the fields,
PSA.72.6	like showers falling on the land.
PSA.72.7	May righteousness flourish in his lifetime,
PSA.72.7	and may prosperity last as long as the moon gives light.
PSA.72.8	from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	The peoples of the desert will bow down before him;
PSA.72.9	his enemies will throw themselves to the ground.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Spain and of the islands will offer him gifts;
PSA.72.10	the kings of Sheba and Seba
PSA.72.11	All kings will bow down before him;
PSA.72.11	all nations will serve him.
PSA.72.12	He rescues the poor who call to him,
PSA.72.12	and those who are needy and neglected.
PSA.72.13	He has pity on the weak and poor;
PSA.72.13	he saves the lives of those in need.
PSA.72.14	He rescues them from oppression and violence;
PSA.72.14	their lives are precious to him.
PSA.72.15	Long live the king!
PSA.72.15	May he be given gold from Sheba;
PSA.72.15	may prayers be said for him at all times;
PSA.72.15	may God's blessings be on him always!
PSA.72.16	May there be plenty of grain in the land;
PSA.72.16	may the hills be covered with crops,
PSA.72.16	as fruitful as those of Lebanon.
PSA.72.16	May the cities be filled with people,
PSA.72.16	like fields full of grass.
PSA.72.17	May the king's name never be forgotten;
PSA.72.17	may his fame last as long as the sun.
PSA.72.17	May all nations ask God to bless them
PSA.72.17	as he has blessed the king.
PSA.72.18	Praise the 
PSA.72.18	He alone does these wonderful things.
PSA.72.19	Praise his glorious name forever!
PSA.72.19	May his glory fill the whole world.
PSA.72.19	Amen! Amen!
PSA.72.20	This is the end of the prayers of David son of Jesse.
PSA.73.1	God is indeed good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	to those who have pure hearts.
PSA.73.2	But I had nearly lost confidence;
PSA.73.2	my faith was almost gone
PSA.73.3	because I was jealous of the proud
PSA.73.3	when I saw that things go well for the wicked.
PSA.73.4	They do not suffer pain;
PSA.73.4	they are strong and healthy.
PSA.73.5	They do not suffer as other people do;
PSA.73.5	they do not have the troubles that others have.
PSA.73.6	And so they wear pride like a necklace
PSA.73.6	and violence like a robe;
PSA.73.7	their hearts pour out evil,
PSA.73.7	and their minds are busy with wicked schemes.
PSA.73.8	They laugh at other people and speak of evil things;
PSA.73.8	they are proud and make plans to oppress others.
PSA.73.9	They speak evil of God in heaven
PSA.73.9	and give arrogant orders to everyone on earth,
PSA.73.10	so that even God's people turn to them
PSA.73.10	and eagerly believe whatever they say.
PSA.73.11	They say, “God will not know;
PSA.73.11	the Most High will not find out.”
PSA.73.12	That is what the wicked are like.
PSA.73.12	They have plenty and are always getting more.
PSA.73.13	Is it for nothing, then, that I have kept myself pure
PSA.73.13	and have not committed sin?
PSA.73.14	O God, you have made me suffer all day long;
PSA.73.14	every morning you have punished me.
PSA.73.15	If I had said such things,
PSA.73.15	I would not be acting as one of your people.
PSA.73.16	I tried to think this problem through,
PSA.73.16	but it was too difficult for me
PSA.73.17	until I went into your Temple.
PSA.73.17	Then I understood what will happen to the wicked.
PSA.73.18	You will put them in slippery places
PSA.73.18	and make them fall to destruction!
PSA.73.19	They are instantly destroyed;
PSA.73.19	they go down to a horrible end.
PSA.73.20	They are like a dream that goes away in the morning;
PSA.73.20	when you rouse yourself, O Lord, they disappear.
PSA.73.21	When my thoughts were bitter
PSA.73.21	and my feelings were hurt,
PSA.73.22	I was as stupid as an animal;
PSA.73.22	I did not understand you.
PSA.73.23	Yet I always stay close to you,
PSA.73.23	and you hold me by the hand.
PSA.73.24	You guide me with your instruction
PSA.73.24	and at the end you will receive me with honor.
PSA.73.25	What else do I have in heaven but you?
PSA.73.25	Since I have you, what else could I want on earth?
PSA.73.26	My mind and my body may grow weak,
PSA.73.26	but God is my strength;
PSA.73.26	he is all I ever need.
PSA.73.27	Those who abandon you will certainly perish;
PSA.73.27	you will destroy those who are unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, how wonderful to be near God,
PSA.73.28	to find protection with the Sovereign 
PSA.73.28	and to proclaim all that he has done!
PSA.74.1	Why have you abandoned us like this, O God?
PSA.74.1	Will you be angry with your own people forever?
PSA.74.2	Remember your people, whom you chose for yourself long ago,
PSA.74.2	whom you brought out of slavery to be your own tribe.
PSA.74.2	Remember Mount Zion, where once you lived.
PSA.74.3	Walk over these total ruins;
PSA.74.3	our enemies have destroyed everything in the Temple.
PSA.74.4	Your enemies have shouted in triumph in your Temple;
PSA.74.4	they have placed their flags there as signs of victory.
PSA.74.5	They looked like woodsmen
PSA.74.5	cutting down trees with their axes.
PSA.74.6	They smashed all the wooden panels
PSA.74.6	with their axes and sledge hammers.
PSA.74.7	They wrecked your Temple and set it on fire;
PSA.74.7	they desecrated the place where you are worshiped.
PSA.74.8	They wanted to crush us completely;
PSA.74.8	they burned down every holy place in the land.
PSA.74.9	All our sacred symbols are gone;
PSA.74.9	there are no prophets left,
PSA.74.9	and no one knows how long this will last.
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, will our enemies laugh at you?
PSA.74.10	Will they insult your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why have you refused to help us?
PSA.74.11	Why do you keep your hands behind you?
PSA.74.12	But you have been our king from the beginning, O God;
PSA.74.12	you have saved us many times.
PSA.74.13	and smashed the heads of the sea monsters;
PSA.74.14	and fed his body to desert animals.
PSA.74.15	You made springs and fountains flow;
PSA.74.15	you dried up large rivers.
PSA.74.16	You created the day and the night;
PSA.74.16	you set the sun and the moon in their places;
PSA.74.17	you set the limits of the earth;
PSA.74.17	you made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	But remember, O 
PSA.74.18	that they are godless and despise you.
PSA.74.19	Don't abandon your helpless people to their cruel enemies;
PSA.74.19	don't forget your persecuted people!
PSA.74.20	Remember the covenant you made with us.
PSA.74.20	There is violence in every dark corner of the land.
PSA.74.21	Don't let the oppressed be put to shame;
PSA.74.21	let those poor and needy people praise you.
PSA.74.22	Rouse yourself, God, and defend your cause!
PSA.74.22	Remember that godless people laugh at you all day long.
PSA.74.23	Don't forget the angry shouts of your enemies,
PSA.74.23	the continuous noise made by your foes.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you!
PSA.75.1	We proclaim how great you are
PSA.75.1	and tell of
PSA.75.2	“I have set a time for judgment,” says God,
PSA.75.2	“and I will judge with fairness.
PSA.75.3	Though every living creature tremble
PSA.75.3	and the earth itself be shaken,
PSA.75.3	I will keep its foundations firm.
PSA.75.4	I tell the wicked not to be arrogant;
PSA.75.5	I tell them to stop their boasting.”
PSA.75.6	Judgment does not come from the east or from the west,
PSA.75.6	from the north or from the south;
PSA.75.7	it is God who is the judge,
PSA.75.7	condemning some and acquitting others.
PSA.75.8	The 
PSA.75.8	filled with the strong wine of his anger.
PSA.75.8	He pours it out, and all the wicked drink it;
PSA.75.8	they drink it down to the last drop.
PSA.75.9	But I will never stop speaking of the God of Jacob
PSA.75.9	or singing praises to him.
PSA.75.10	He will break the power of the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but the power of the righteous will be increased.
PSA.76.1	God is known in Judah;
PSA.76.1	his name is honored in Israel.
PSA.76.2	He has his home in Jerusalem;
PSA.76.2	he lives on Mount Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he broke the arrows of the enemy,
PSA.76.3	their shields and swords, yes, all their weapons.
PSA.76.4	How glorious you are, O God!
PSA.76.4	How majestic, as you return from the mountains
PSA.76.4	where you defeated your foes.
PSA.76.5	Their brave soldiers have been stripped of all they had
PSA.76.5	and now are sleeping the sleep of death;
PSA.76.5	all their strength and skill was useless.
PSA.76.6	When you threatened them, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	the horses and their riders fell dead.
PSA.76.7	But you, 
PSA.76.7	No one can stand in your presence
PSA.76.7	when you are angry.
PSA.76.8	You made your judgment known from heaven;
PSA.76.8	the world was afraid and kept silent,
PSA.76.9	when you rose up to pronounce judgment,
PSA.76.9	to save all the oppressed on earth.
PSA.76.10	Human anger only results in more praise for you;
PSA.76.10	those who survive the wars will keep your festivals.
PSA.76.11	Give the 
PSA.76.11	bring gifts to him, all you nearby nations.
PSA.76.11	God makes everyone fear him;
PSA.76.12	he humbles proud princes
PSA.76.12	and terrifies great kings.
PSA.77.1	I cry aloud to God;
PSA.77.1	I cry aloud, and he hears me.
PSA.77.2	In times of trouble I pray to the Lord;
PSA.77.2	all night long I lift my hands in prayer,
PSA.77.2	but I cannot find comfort.
PSA.77.3	When I think of God, I sigh;
PSA.77.3	when I meditate, I feel discouraged.
PSA.77.4	He keeps me awake all night;
PSA.77.4	I am so worried that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I think of days gone by
PSA.77.5	and remember years of long ago.
PSA.77.6	I spend the night in deep thought;
PSA.77.6	I meditate, and this is what I ask myself:
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord always reject us?
PSA.77.7	Will he never again be pleased with us?
PSA.77.8	Has he stopped loving us?
PSA.77.8	Does his promise no longer stand?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be merciful?
PSA.77.9	Has anger taken the place of his compassion?”
PSA.77.10	Then I said, “What hurts me most is this—
PSA.77.10	that God is no longer powerful.”
PSA.77.11	I will remember your great deeds, 
PSA.77.11	I will recall the wonders you did in the past.
PSA.77.12	I will think about all that you have done;
PSA.77.12	I will meditate on all your mighty acts.
PSA.77.13	Everything you do, O God, is holy.
PSA.77.13	No god is as great as you.
PSA.77.14	You are the God who works miracles;
PSA.77.14	you showed your might among the nations.
PSA.77.15	By your power you saved your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and of Joseph.
PSA.77.16	When the waters saw you, O God, they were afraid,
PSA.77.16	and the depths of the sea trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down rain;
PSA.77.17	thunder crashed from the sky,
PSA.77.17	and lightning flashed in all directions.
PSA.77.18	The crash of your thunder rolled out,
PSA.77.18	and flashes of lightning lit up the world;
PSA.77.18	the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	You walked through the waves;
PSA.77.19	you crossed the deep sea,
PSA.77.19	but your footprints could not be seen.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a shepherd,
PSA.77.20	with Moses and Aaron in charge.
PSA.78.1	Listen, my people, to my teaching,
PSA.78.1	and pay attention to what I say.
PSA.78.2	and explain mysteries from the past,
PSA.78.3	things we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	things that our ancestors told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not keep them from our children;
PSA.78.4	we will tell the next generation
PSA.78.4	about the 
PSA.78.4	and the wonderful things he has done.
PSA.78.5	He gave laws to the people of Israel
PSA.78.5	and commandments to the descendants of Jacob.
PSA.78.5	He instructed our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach his laws to their children,
PSA.78.6	so that the next generation might learn them
PSA.78.6	and in turn should tell their children.
PSA.78.7	In this way they also will put their trust in God
PSA.78.7	and not forget what he has done,
PSA.78.7	but always obey his commandments.
PSA.78.8	They will not be like their ancestors,
PSA.78.8	a rebellious and disobedient people,
PSA.78.8	whose trust in God was never firm
PSA.78.8	and who did not remain faithful to him.
PSA.78.9	The Ephraimites, armed with bows and arrows,
PSA.78.9	ran away on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep their covenant with God;
PSA.78.10	they refused to obey his law.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done,
PSA.78.11	the miracles they had seen him perform.
PSA.78.12	in the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.
PSA.78.13	he made the waters stand like walls.
PSA.78.14	and all night long with the light of a fire.
PSA.78.15	and gave them water from the depths.
PSA.78.16	He caused a stream to come out of the rock
PSA.78.16	and made water flow like a river.
PSA.78.17	But they continued to sin against God,
PSA.78.17	and in the desert they rebelled against the Most High.
PSA.78.18	by demanding the food they wanted.
PSA.78.19	They spoke against God and said,
PSA.78.19	“Can God supply food in the desert?
PSA.78.20	It is true that he struck the rock,
PSA.78.20	and water flowed out in a torrent;
PSA.78.20	but can he also provide us with bread
PSA.78.20	and give his people meat?”
PSA.78.21	And so the 
PSA.78.21	he attacked his people with fire,
PSA.78.21	and his anger against them grew,
PSA.78.22	because they had no faith in him
PSA.78.22	and did not believe that he would save them.
PSA.78.23	But he spoke to the sky above
PSA.78.23	and commanded its doors to open;
PSA.78.24	by sending down manna for them to eat.
PSA.78.25	So they ate the food of angels,
PSA.78.25	and God gave them all they wanted.
PSA.78.26	He also caused the east wind to blow,
PSA.78.26	and by his power he stirred up the south wind;
PSA.78.27	and to his people he sent down birds,
PSA.78.27	as many as the grains of sand on the shore;
PSA.78.28	they fell in the middle of the camp
PSA.78.28	all around the tents.
PSA.78.29	So the people ate and were satisfied;
PSA.78.29	God gave them what they wanted.
PSA.78.30	But they had not yet satisfied their craving
PSA.78.30	and were still eating,
PSA.78.31	when God became angry with them
PSA.78.31	and killed their strongest men,
PSA.78.31	the best young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this the people kept sinning;
PSA.78.32	in spite of his miracles they did not trust him.
PSA.78.33	So he ended their days like a breath
PSA.78.33	and their lives with sudden disaster.
PSA.78.34	Whenever he killed some of them,
PSA.78.34	the rest would turn to him;
PSA.78.34	they would repent and pray earnestly to him.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God was their protector,
PSA.78.35	that the Almighty came to their aid.
PSA.78.36	But their words were all lies;
PSA.78.36	nothing they said was sincere.
PSA.78.37	they were not faithful to their covenant with him.
PSA.78.38	But God was merciful to his people.
PSA.78.38	He forgave their sin
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them.
PSA.78.38	Many times he held back his anger
PSA.78.38	and restrained his fury.
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were only mortal beings,
PSA.78.39	like a wind that blows by and is gone.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him in the desert;
PSA.78.40	how many times they made him sad!
PSA.78.41	Again and again they put God to the test
PSA.78.41	and brought pain to the Holy God of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They forgot his great power
PSA.78.42	and the day when he saved them from their enemies
PSA.78.43	and performed his mighty acts and miracles
PSA.78.43	in the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.
PSA.78.44	and the Egyptians had no water to drink.
PSA.78.45	and frogs that ruined their land.
PSA.78.46	and to destroy their fields.
PSA.78.47	and their fig trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He killed their cattle with hail
PSA.78.48	and their flocks with lightning.
PSA.78.49	He caused them great distress
PSA.78.49	by pouring out his anger and fierce rage,
PSA.78.49	which came as messengers of death.
PSA.78.50	He did not restrain his anger
PSA.78.50	or spare their lives,
PSA.78.50	but killed them with a plague.
PSA.78.51	of all the families of Egypt.
PSA.78.52	and guided them through the desert.
PSA.78.53	but the sea came rolling over their enemies.
PSA.78.54	to the mountains which he himself conquered.
PSA.78.55	he divided their land among the tribes of Israel
PSA.78.55	and gave their homes to his people.
PSA.78.56	and put him to the test.
PSA.78.56	They did not obey his commandments,
PSA.78.57	but were rebellious and disloyal like their ancestors,
PSA.78.57	unreliable as a crooked arrow.
PSA.78.58	They angered him with their heathen places of worship,
PSA.78.58	and with their idols they made him furious.
PSA.78.59	God was angry when he saw it,
PSA.78.59	so he rejected his people completely.
PSA.78.60	the home where he had lived among us.
PSA.78.61	the symbol of his power and glory.
PSA.78.62	He was angry with his own people
PSA.78.62	and let them be killed by their enemies.
PSA.78.63	Young men were killed in war,
PSA.78.63	and young women had no one to marry.
PSA.78.64	Priests died by violence,
PSA.78.64	and their widows were not allowed to mourn.
PSA.78.65	At last the Lord woke up as though from sleep;
PSA.78.65	he was like a strong man excited by wine.
PSA.78.66	He drove his enemies back
PSA.78.66	in lasting and shameful defeat.
PSA.78.67	But he rejected the descendants of Joseph;
PSA.78.67	he did not select the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	Instead he chose the tribe of Judah
PSA.78.68	and Mount Zion, which he dearly loves.
PSA.78.69	There he built his Temple
PSA.78.69	like his home in heaven;
PSA.78.69	he made it firm like the earth itself,
PSA.78.69	secure for all time.
PSA.78.70	he took him from the pastures,
PSA.78.71	where he looked after his flocks,
PSA.78.71	and he made him king of Israel,
PSA.78.71	the shepherd of the people of God.
PSA.78.72	David took care of them with unselfish devotion
PSA.78.72	and led them with skill.
PSA.79.1	They have desecrated your holy Temple
PSA.79.1	and left Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	They left the bodies of your people for the vultures,
PSA.79.2	the bodies of your servants for wild animals to eat.
PSA.79.3	They shed your people's blood like water;
PSA.79.3	blood flowed like water all through Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	and no one was left to bury the dead.
PSA.79.4	The surrounding nations insult us;
PSA.79.4	they laugh at us and mock us.
PSA.79.5	Will your anger continue to burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Turn your anger on the nations that do not worship you,
PSA.79.6	on the people who do not pray to you.
PSA.79.7	For they have killed your people;
PSA.79.7	they have ruined your country.
PSA.79.8	Do not punish us for the sins of our ancestors.
PSA.79.8	Have mercy on us now;
PSA.79.8	we have lost all hope.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God, and save us;
PSA.79.9	rescue us and forgive our sins
PSA.79.9	for the sake of your own honor.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations ask us,
PSA.79.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.79.10	Let us see you punish the nations
PSA.79.10	for shedding the blood of your servants.
PSA.79.11	Listen to the groans of the prisoners,
PSA.79.11	and by your great power free those who are condemned to die.
PSA.79.12	Lord, pay the other nations back seven times
PSA.79.12	for all the insults they have hurled at you.
PSA.79.13	Then we, your people, the sheep of your flock,
PSA.79.13	will thank you forever
PSA.79.13	and praise you for all time to come.
PSA.80.1	hear us, leader of your flock.
PSA.80.1	Seated on your throne above the winged creatures,
PSA.80.2	reveal yourself to the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Show us your strength;
PSA.80.2	come and save us!
PSA.80.3	Bring us back, O God!
PSA.80.3	Show us your mercy, and we will be saved!
PSA.80.4	How much longer, 
PSA.80.4	will you be angry with your people's prayers?
PSA.80.5	You have given us sorrow to eat,
PSA.80.5	a large cup of tears to drink.
PSA.80.6	You let the surrounding nations fight over our land;
PSA.80.6	our enemies insult us.
PSA.80.7	Bring us back, Almighty God!
PSA.80.7	Show us your mercy, and we will be saved!
PSA.80.8	You brought a grapevine out of Egypt;
PSA.80.8	you drove out other nations and planted it in their land.
PSA.80.9	You cleared a place for it to grow;
PSA.80.9	its roots went deep, and it spread out over the whole land.
PSA.80.10	It covered the hills with its shade;
PSA.80.10	its branches overshadowed the giant cedars.
PSA.80.11	It extended its branches to the Mediterranean Sea
PSA.80.11	and as far as the Euphrates River.
PSA.80.12	Why did you break down the fences around it?
PSA.80.12	Now anyone passing by can steal its grapes;
PSA.80.13	wild hogs trample it down,
PSA.80.13	and wild animals feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Turn to us, Almighty God!
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven at us;
PSA.80.14	come and save your people!
PSA.80.15	Come and save this grapevine that you planted,
PSA.80.15	this young vine you made grow so strong!
PSA.80.16	Our enemies have set it on fire and cut it down;
PSA.80.16	look at them in anger and destroy them!
PSA.80.17	Preserve and protect the people you have chosen,
PSA.80.17	the nation you made so strong.
PSA.80.18	We will never turn away from you again;
PSA.80.18	keep us alive, and we will praise you.
PSA.80.19	Bring us back, 
PSA.80.19	Show us your mercy, and we will be saved.
PSA.81.1	Shout for joy to God our defender;
PSA.81.1	sing praise to the God of Jacob!
PSA.81.2	Start the music and beat the tambourines;
PSA.81.2	play pleasant music on the harps and the lyres.
PSA.81.3	when the moon is new and when the moon is full.
PSA.81.4	This is the law in Israel,
PSA.81.4	an order from the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He gave it to the people of Israel
PSA.81.5	when he attacked the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I hear an unknown voice saying,
PSA.81.6	“I took the burdens off your backs;
PSA.81.6	I let you put down your loads of bricks.
PSA.81.7	From my hiding place in the storm, I answered you.
PSA.81.7	I put you to the test at the springs of Meribah.
PSA.81.8	Listen, my people, to my warning;
PSA.81.8	Israel, how I wish you would listen to me!
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	who brought you out of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth, and I will feed you.
PSA.81.11	“But my people would not listen to me;
PSA.81.11	Israel would not obey me.
PSA.81.12	So I let them go their stubborn ways
PSA.81.12	and do whatever they wanted.
PSA.81.13	How I wish my people would listen to me;
PSA.81.13	how I wish they would obey me!
PSA.81.14	I would quickly defeat their enemies
PSA.81.14	and conquer all their foes.
PSA.81.15	Those who hate me would bow in fear before me;
PSA.81.15	their punishment would last forever.
PSA.81.16	But I would feed you with the finest wheat
PSA.81.16	and satisfy you with wild honey.”
PSA.82.1	God presides in the heavenly council;
PSA.82.1	in the assembly of the gods he gives his decision:
PSA.82.2	“You must stop judging unjustly;
PSA.82.2	you must no longer be partial to the wicked!
PSA.82.3	Defend the rights of the poor and the orphans;
PSA.82.3	be fair to the needy and the helpless.
PSA.82.4	Rescue them from the power of evil people.
PSA.82.5	“How ignorant you are! How stupid!
PSA.82.5	You are completely corrupt,
PSA.82.5	and justice has disappeared from the world.
PSA.82.6	‘all of you are children of the Most High.’
PSA.82.7	But you will die like mortals;
PSA.82.7	your life will end like that of any prince.”
PSA.82.8	Come, O God, and rule the world;
PSA.82.8	all the nations are yours.
PSA.83.1	O God, do not keep silent;
PSA.83.1	do not be still, do not be quiet!
PSA.83.2	Look! Your enemies are in revolt,
PSA.83.2	and those who hate you are rebelling.
PSA.83.3	They are making secret plans against your people;
PSA.83.3	they are plotting against those you protect.
PSA.83.4	“Come,” they say, “let us destroy their nation,
PSA.83.4	so that Israel will be forgotten forever.”
PSA.83.5	They agree on their plan
PSA.83.5	and form an alliance against you:
PSA.83.6	the people of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
PSA.83.6	the people of Moab and the Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	the people of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	and of Philistia and Tyre.
PSA.83.8	Assyria has also joined them
PSA.83.8	as a strong ally of the Ammonites and Moabites, the descendants of Lot.
PSA.83.9	and to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
PSA.83.10	You defeated them at Endor,
PSA.83.10	and their bodies rotted on the ground.
PSA.83.11	defeat all their rulers as you did Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	who said, “We will take for our own
PSA.83.12	the land that belongs to God.”
PSA.83.13	Scatter them like dust, O God,
PSA.83.13	like straw blown away by the wind.
PSA.83.14	As fire burns the forest,
PSA.83.14	as flames set the hills on fire,
PSA.83.15	chase them away with your storm
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with your fierce winds.
PSA.83.16	Cover their faces with shame, O 
PSA.83.16	and make them acknowledge your power.
PSA.83.17	May they be defeated and terrified forever;
PSA.83.17	may they die in complete disgrace.
PSA.83.18	May they know that you alone are the 
PSA.83.18	supreme ruler over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How I love your Temple, 
PSA.84.2	How I want to be there!
PSA.84.2	I long to be in the 
PSA.84.2	With my whole being I sing for joy
PSA.84.2	to the living God.
PSA.84.3	Even the sparrows have built a nest,
PSA.84.3	and the swallows have their own home;
PSA.84.3	they keep their young near your altars,
PSA.84.4	How happy are those who live in your Temple,
PSA.84.4	always singing praise to you.
PSA.84.5	How happy are those whose strength comes from you,
PSA.84.5	who are eager to make the pilgrimage to Mount Zion.
PSA.84.6	As they pass through the dry valley of Baca,
PSA.84.6	it becomes a place of springs;
PSA.84.6	the autumn rain fills it with pools.
PSA.84.7	They grow stronger as they go;
PSA.84.7	they will see the God of gods on Zion.
PSA.84.8	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.84.8	Listen, O God of Jacob!
PSA.84.9	Bless our king, O God,
PSA.84.9	the king you have chosen.
PSA.84.10	One day spent in your Temple
PSA.84.10	is better than a thousand anywhere else;
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand at the gate of the house of my God
PSA.84.10	than live in the homes of the wicked.
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	blessing us with kindness and honor.
PSA.84.11	He does not refuse any good thing
PSA.84.11	to those who do what is right.
PSA.85.1	you have made Israel prosperous again.
PSA.85.2	You have forgiven your people's sins
PSA.85.2	and pardoned all their wrongs.
PSA.85.3	You stopped being angry with them
PSA.85.3	and held back your furious rage.
PSA.85.4	Bring us back, O God our savior,
PSA.85.4	and stop being displeased with us!
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will your anger never cease?
PSA.85.6	Make us strong again,
PSA.85.6	and we, your people, will praise you.
PSA.85.7	Show us your constant love, O 
PSA.85.7	and give us your saving help.
PSA.85.8	I am listening to what the 
PSA.85.8	he promises peace to us, his own people,
PSA.85.8	if we do not go back to our foolish ways.
PSA.85.9	Surely he is ready to save those who honor him,
PSA.85.9	and his saving presence will remain in our land.
PSA.85.10	Love and faithfulness will meet;
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace will embrace.
PSA.85.11	Human loyalty will reach up from the earth,
PSA.85.11	and God's righteousness will look down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	The 
PSA.85.12	and our land will produce rich harvests.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before the 
PSA.85.13	and prepare the path for him.
PSA.86.1	Listen to me, 
PSA.86.1	for I am helpless and weak.
PSA.86.2	Save me from death, because I am loyal to you;
PSA.86.2	save me, for I am your servant and I trust in you.
PSA.86.3	You are my God, so be merciful to me;
PSA.86.3	I pray to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	Make your servant glad, O Lord,
PSA.86.4	because my prayers go up to you.
PSA.86.5	You are good to us and forgiving,
PSA.86.5	full of constant love for all who pray to you.
PSA.86.6	Listen, 
PSA.86.6	hear my cries for help.
PSA.86.7	I call to you in times of trouble,
PSA.86.7	because you answer my prayers.
PSA.86.8	There is no god like you, O Lord,
PSA.86.8	not one has done what you have done.
PSA.86.9	will come and bow down to you;
PSA.86.9	they will praise your greatness.
PSA.86.10	You are mighty and do wonderful things;
PSA.86.10	you alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me, 
PSA.86.11	and I will obey you faithfully;
PSA.86.11	teach me to serve you with complete devotion.
PSA.86.12	I will praise you with all my heart, O Lord my God;
PSA.86.12	I will proclaim your greatness forever.
PSA.86.13	How great is your constant love for me!
PSA.86.13	You have saved me from the grave itself.
PSA.86.14	Proud people are coming against me, O God;
PSA.86.14	a cruel gang is trying to kill me—
PSA.86.14	people who pay no attention to you.
PSA.86.15	But you, O Lord, are a merciful and loving God,
PSA.86.15	always patient, always kind and faithful.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and have mercy on me;
PSA.86.16	strengthen me and save me,
PSA.86.16	because I serve you just as my mother did.
PSA.86.17	Show me proof of your goodness, 
PSA.86.17	those who hate me will be ashamed
PSA.86.17	when they see that you have given me comfort and help.
PSA.87.1	The 
PSA.87.2	more than any other place in Israel
PSA.87.2	he loves the city of Jerusalem.
PSA.87.3	Listen, city of God,
PSA.87.3	to the wonderful things he says about you:
PSA.87.4	“I will include Egypt and Babylonia
PSA.87.4	when I list the nations that obey me;
PSA.87.4	the people of Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia
PSA.87.4	I will number among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.”
PSA.87.5	Of Zion it will be said
PSA.87.5	that all nations belong there
PSA.87.5	and that the Almighty will make her strong.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	and include them all as citizens of Jerusalem.
PSA.87.7	They dance and sing,
PSA.87.7	“In Zion is the source of all our blessings.”
PSA.88.1	and at night I come before you.
PSA.88.2	Hear my prayer;
PSA.88.2	listen to my cry for help!
PSA.88.3	So many troubles have fallen on me
PSA.88.3	that I am close to death.
PSA.88.4	I am like all others who are about to die;
PSA.88.4	all my strength is gone.
PSA.88.5	I am abandoned among the dead;
PSA.88.5	I am like the slain lying in their graves,
PSA.88.5	those you have forgotten completely,
PSA.88.5	who are beyond your help.
PSA.88.6	You have thrown me into the depths of the tomb,
PSA.88.6	into the darkest and deepest pit.
PSA.88.7	Your anger lies heavy on me,
PSA.88.7	and I am crushed beneath its waves.
PSA.88.8	You have caused my friends to abandon me;
PSA.88.8	you have made me repulsive to them.
PSA.88.8	I am closed in and cannot escape;
PSA.88.9	my eyes are weak from suffering.
PSA.88.9	and lift my hands to you in prayer.
PSA.88.10	Do you perform miracles for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do they rise up and praise you?
PSA.88.11	Is your constant love spoken of in the grave
PSA.88.11	or your faithfulness in the place of destruction?
PSA.88.12	Are your miracles seen in that place of darkness
PSA.88.12	or your goodness in the land of the forgotten?
PSA.88.13	every morning I pray to you.
PSA.88.14	Why do you reject me, 
PSA.88.14	Why do you turn away from me?
PSA.88.15	Ever since I was young, I have suffered and been near death;
PSA.88.15	I am worn out
PSA.88.16	Your furious anger crushes me;
PSA.88.16	your terrible attacks destroy me.
PSA.88.17	All day long they surround me like a flood;
PSA.88.17	they close in on me from every side.
PSA.88.18	You have made even my closest friends abandon me,
PSA.88.18	and darkness is my only companion.
PSA.89.1	O 
PSA.89.1	I will proclaim your faithfulness forever.
PSA.89.2	I know that your love will last for all time,
PSA.89.2	that your faithfulness is as permanent as the sky.
PSA.89.3	You said, “I have made a covenant with the man I chose;
PSA.89.3	I have promised my servant David,
PSA.89.4	I will preserve your dynasty forever.’”
PSA.89.5	The heavens sing of the wonderful things you do;
PSA.89.5	the holy ones sing of your faithfulness, 
PSA.89.6	No one in heaven is like you, 
PSA.89.6	none of the heavenly beings is your equal.
PSA.89.7	You are feared in the council of the holy ones;
PSA.89.7	they all stand in awe of you.
PSA.89.8	in all things you are faithful, O 
PSA.89.9	You rule over the powerful sea;
PSA.89.9	you calm its angry waves.
PSA.89.10	You crushed the monster Rahab
PSA.89.10	with your mighty strength you defeated your enemies.
PSA.89.11	Heaven is yours, the earth also;
PSA.89.11	you made the world and everything in it.
PSA.89.12	You created the north and the south;
PSA.89.12	Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon sing to you for joy.
PSA.89.13	How powerful you are!
PSA.89.13	How great is your strength!
PSA.89.14	Your kingdom is founded on righteousness and justice;
PSA.89.14	love and faithfulness are shown in all you do.
PSA.89.15	How happy are the people who worship you with songs,
PSA.89.15	who live in the light of your kindness!
PSA.89.16	Because of you they rejoice all day long,
PSA.89.16	and they praise you for your goodness.
PSA.89.17	You give us great victories;
PSA.89.17	in your love you make us triumphant.
PSA.89.18	You, O 
PSA.89.18	you, the Holy God of Israel, gave us our king.
PSA.89.19	In a vision long ago you said to your faithful servants,
PSA.89.19	“I have given help to a famous soldier;
PSA.89.19	I have given the throne to one I chose from the people.
PSA.89.20	by anointing him with holy oil.
PSA.89.21	My strength will always be with him,
PSA.89.21	my power will make him strong.
PSA.89.22	His enemies will never succeed against him;
PSA.89.22	the wicked will not defeat him.
PSA.89.23	I will crush his foes
PSA.89.23	and kill everyone who hates him.
PSA.89.24	I will love him and be loyal to him;
PSA.89.24	I will make him always victorious.
PSA.89.25	I will extend his kingdom
PSA.89.25	from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River.
PSA.89.26	He will say to me,
PSA.89.26	‘You are my father and my God;
PSA.89.26	you are my protector and savior.’
PSA.89.27	the greatest of all kings.
PSA.89.28	I will always keep my promise to him,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant with him will last forever.
PSA.89.29	His dynasty will be as permanent as the sky;
PSA.89.29	a descendant of his will always be king.
PSA.89.30	“But if his descendants disobey my law
PSA.89.30	and do not live according to my commands,
PSA.89.31	if they disregard my instructions
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commandments,
PSA.89.32	then I will punish them for their sins;
PSA.89.32	I will make them suffer for their wrongs.
PSA.89.33	But I will not stop loving David
PSA.89.33	or fail to keep my promise to him.
PSA.89.34	I will not break my covenant with him
PSA.89.34	or take back even one promise I made him.
PSA.89.35	“Once and for all I have promised by my holy name:
PSA.89.35	I will never lie to David.
PSA.89.36	He will always have descendants,
PSA.89.36	and I will watch over his kingdom as long as the sun shines.
PSA.89.37	It will be as permanent as the moon,
PSA.89.37	that faithful witness in the sky.”
PSA.89.38	But you are angry with your chosen king;
PSA.89.38	you have deserted and rejected him.
PSA.89.39	You have broken your covenant with your servant
PSA.89.39	and thrown his crown in the dirt.
PSA.89.40	You have torn down the walls of his city
PSA.89.40	and left his forts in ruins.
PSA.89.41	All who pass by steal his belongings;
PSA.89.41	all his neighbors laugh at him.
PSA.89.42	You have given the victory to his enemies;
PSA.89.42	you have made them all happy.
PSA.89.43	You have made his weapons useless
PSA.89.43	and let him be defeated in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have taken away his royal scepter
PSA.89.44	and knocked his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have made him old before his time
PSA.89.45	and covered him with disgrace.
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my life is;
PSA.89.47	remember that you created all of us mortal!
PSA.89.48	Who can live and never die?
PSA.89.48	How can we humans keep ourselves from the grave?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are the former proofs of your love?
PSA.89.49	Where are the promises you made to David?
PSA.89.50	Don't forget how I, your servant, am insulted,
PSA.89.50	how I endure all the curses
PSA.89.51	Your enemies insult your chosen king, O 
PSA.89.51	They insult him wherever he goes.
PSA.89.52	Praise the 
PSA.89.52	Amen! Amen!
PSA.90.1	O Lord, you have always been our home.
PSA.90.2	Before you created the hills
PSA.90.2	or brought the world into being,
PSA.90.2	you were eternally God,
PSA.90.2	and will be God forever.
PSA.90.3	You tell us to return to what we were;
PSA.90.3	you change us back to dust.
PSA.90.4	they are like yesterday, already gone,
PSA.90.4	like a short hour in the night.
PSA.90.5	You carry us away like a flood;
PSA.90.5	we last no longer than a dream.
PSA.90.5	We are like weeds that sprout in the morning,
PSA.90.6	that grow and burst into bloom,
PSA.90.6	then dry up and die in the evening.
PSA.90.7	We are destroyed by your anger;
PSA.90.7	we are terrified by your fury.
PSA.90.8	You place our sins before you,
PSA.90.8	our secret sins where you can see them.
PSA.90.9	Our life is cut short by your anger;
PSA.90.9	it fades away like a whisper.
PSA.90.10	eighty years, if we are strong;
PSA.90.10	yet all they bring us is trouble and sorrow;
PSA.90.10	life is soon over, and we are gone.
PSA.90.11	Who has felt the full power of your anger?
PSA.90.11	Who knows what fear your fury can bring?
PSA.90.12	Teach us how short our life is,
PSA.90.12	so that we may become wise.
PSA.90.13	How much longer will your anger last?
PSA.90.13	Have pity, O 
PSA.90.14	Fill us each morning with your constant love,
PSA.90.14	so that we may sing and be glad all our life.
PSA.90.15	Give us now as much happiness as the sadness you gave us
PSA.90.15	during all our years of misery.
PSA.90.16	Let us, your servants, see your mighty deeds;
PSA.90.16	let our descendants see your glorious might.
PSA.90.17	Lord our God, may your blessings be with us.
PSA.90.17	Give us success in all we do!
PSA.91.1	Whoever goes to the 
PSA.91.1	whoever remains under the protection of the Almighty,
PSA.91.2	can say to him,
PSA.91.2	“You are my defender and protector.
PSA.91.2	You are my God; in you I trust.”
PSA.91.3	He will keep you safe from all hidden dangers
PSA.91.3	and from all deadly diseases.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with his wings;
PSA.91.4	you will be safe in his care;
PSA.91.4	his faithfulness will protect and defend you.
PSA.91.5	You need not fear any dangers at night
PSA.91.5	or sudden attacks during the day
PSA.91.6	or the plagues that strike in the dark
PSA.91.6	or the evils that kill in daylight.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall dead beside you,
PSA.91.7	ten thousand all around you,
PSA.91.7	but you will not be harmed.
PSA.91.8	You will look and see
PSA.91.8	how the wicked are punished.
PSA.91.9	You have made the 
PSA.91.9	the Most High your protector,
PSA.91.10	and so no disaster will strike you,
PSA.91.10	no violence will come near your home.
PSA.91.11	to protect you wherever you go.
PSA.91.12	to keep you from hurting your feet on the stones.
PSA.91.13	fierce lions and poisonous snakes.
PSA.91.14	God says, “I will save those who love me
PSA.91.14	and will protect those who acknowledge me as 
PSA.91.15	When they call to me, I will answer them;
PSA.91.15	when they are in trouble, I will be with them.
PSA.91.15	I will rescue them and honor them.
PSA.91.16	I will reward them with long life;
PSA.91.16	I will save them.”
PSA.92.1	How good it is to give thanks to you, O 
PSA.92.1	to sing in your honor, O Most High God,
PSA.92.2	to proclaim your constant love every morning
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness every night,
PSA.92.3	with the music of stringed instruments
PSA.92.3	and with melody on the harp.
PSA.92.4	Your mighty deeds, O 
PSA.92.4	because of what you have done, I sing for joy.
PSA.92.5	How great are your actions, 
PSA.92.5	How deep are your thoughts!
PSA.92.6	someone who is stupid cannot understand:
PSA.92.7	the wicked may grow like weeds,
PSA.92.7	those who do wrong may prosper;
PSA.92.7	yet they will be totally destroyed,
PSA.92.8	because you, 
PSA.92.9	We know that your enemies will die,
PSA.92.9	and all the wicked will be defeated.
PSA.92.10	You have made me as strong as a wild ox;
PSA.92.10	you have blessed me with happiness.
PSA.92.11	I have seen the defeat of my enemies
PSA.92.11	and heard the cries of the wicked.
PSA.92.12	The righteous will flourish like palm trees;
PSA.92.12	they will grow like the cedars of Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	They are like trees planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	that flourish in the Temple of our God,
PSA.92.14	that still bear fruit in old age
PSA.92.14	and are always green and strong.
PSA.92.15	This shows that the 
PSA.92.15	that there is no wrong in my protector.
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	He is clothed with majesty and strength.
PSA.93.1	The earth is set firmly in place
PSA.93.1	and cannot be moved.
PSA.93.2	Your throne, O 
PSA.93.2	and you existed before time began.

PSA.93.3	they raise their voice and roar.

PSA.93.4	greater than the roar of the ocean,
PSA.93.4	more powerful than the waves of the sea.

PSA.93.5	and your Temple is holy indeed,
PSA.93.5	forever and ever.
PSA.94.1	reveal your anger!
PSA.94.2	You are the judge of us all;
PSA.94.2	rise and give the proud what they deserve!
PSA.94.3	How much longer will the wicked be glad?
PSA.94.3	How much longer, 
PSA.94.4	How much longer will criminals be proud
PSA.94.4	and boast about their crimes?
PSA.94.5	They crush your people, 
PSA.94.5	they oppress those who belong to you.
PSA.94.6	They kill widows and orphans,
PSA.94.6	and murder the strangers who live in our land.
PSA.94.7	They say, “The 
PSA.94.7	the God of Israel does not notice.”
PSA.94.8	My people, how can you be such stupid fools?
PSA.94.8	When will you ever learn?
PSA.94.9	God made our ears—can't he hear?
PSA.94.9	He made our eyes—can't he see?
PSA.94.10	He scolds the nations—won't he punish them?
PSA.94.10	He is the teacher of us all—hasn't he any knowledge?
PSA.94.11	he knows how senseless our reasoning is.
PSA.94.12	the ones to whom you teach your law!
PSA.94.13	You give them rest from days of trouble
PSA.94.13	until a pit is dug to trap the wicked.
PSA.94.14	The 
PSA.94.14	he will not desert those who belong to him.
PSA.94.15	Justice will again be found in the courts,
PSA.94.15	and all righteous people will support it.
PSA.94.16	Who stood up for me against the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who took my side against the evildoers?
PSA.94.17	If the 
PSA.94.17	I would have gone quickly to the land of silence.
PSA.94.18	I said, “I am falling”;
PSA.94.18	but your constant love, O 
PSA.94.19	Whenever I am anxious and worried,
PSA.94.19	you comfort me and make me glad.
PSA.94.20	You have nothing to do with corrupt judges,
PSA.94.20	who make injustice legal,
PSA.94.21	who plot against good people
PSA.94.21	and sentence the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	my God protects me.

PSA.94.23	and destroy them for their sins;

PSA.95.8	as they were that day in the desert at Massah.
PSA.95.9	There they put me to the test and tried me,
PSA.95.9	although they had seen what I did for them.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I was disgusted with those people.
PSA.95.10	I said, ‘How disloyal they are!
PSA.95.10	They refuse to obey my commands.’
PSA.95.11	‘You will never enter the land
PSA.95.11	where I would have given you rest.’”

PSA.104.3	and ride on the wings of the wind.
PSA.104.4	and flashes of lightning as your servants.
PSA.104.5	You have set the earth firmly on its foundations,
PSA.104.5	and it will never be moved.
PSA.104.6	You placed the ocean over it like a robe,
PSA.104.6	and the water covered the mountains.
PSA.104.7	When you rebuked the waters, they fled;
PSA.104.7	they rushed away when they heard your shout of command.
PSA.104.8	They flowed over the mountains and into the valleys,
PSA.104.8	to the place you had made for them.
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary they can never pass,
PSA.104.9	to keep them from covering the earth again.
PSA.104.10	You make springs flow in the valleys,
PSA.104.10	and rivers run between the hills.
PSA.104.11	They provide water for the wild animals;
PSA.104.11	there the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	In the trees near by,
PSA.104.12	the birds make their nests and sing.
PSA.104.13	From the sky you send rain on the hills,
PSA.104.13	and the earth is filled with your blessings.

PSA.104.14	and plants for us to use,
PSA.104.14	so that we can grow our crops
PSA.104.15	and produce wine to make us happy,
PSA.104.15	olive oil to make us cheerful,
PSA.104.15	and bread to give us strength.
PSA.104.16	The cedars of Lebanon get plenty of rain—
PSA.104.16	the 
PSA.104.17	There the birds build their nests;
PSA.104.17	the storks nest in the fir trees.
PSA.104.18	The wild goats live in the high mountains,
PSA.104.18	and the rock badgers hide in the cliffs.
PSA.104.19	You created the moon to mark the months;
PSA.104.19	the sun knows the time to set.
PSA.104.20	You made the night, and in the darkness
PSA.104.20	all the wild animals come out.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar while they hunt,
PSA.104.21	looking for the food that God provides.
PSA.104.22	When the sun rises, they go back
PSA.104.22	and lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Then people go out to do their work
PSA.104.23	and keep working until evening.
PSA.104.24	How wisely you made them all!
PSA.104.24	The earth is filled with your creatures.
PSA.104.25	There is the ocean, large and wide,
PSA.104.25	where countless creatures live,
PSA.104.25	large and small alike.
PSA.104.26	that sea monster which you made.
PSA.104.27	All of them depend on you
PSA.104.27	to give them food when they need it.
PSA.104.28	You give it to them, and they eat it;
PSA.104.28	you provide food, and they are satisfied.
PSA.104.29	When you turn away, they are afraid;
PSA.104.29	when you take away your breath, they die
PSA.104.29	and go back to the dust from which they came.
PSA.104.30	But when you give them breath,
PSA.104.30	you give new life to the earth.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	May the 
PSA.104.32	He looks at the earth, and it trembles;
PSA.104.32	he touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	as long as I live I will sing praises to my God.
PSA.104.34	May he be pleased with my song,
PSA.104.34	for my gladness comes from him.
PSA.104.35	May sinners be destroyed from the earth;
PSA.104.35	may the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Praise the

PSA.105.1	tell the nations what he has done.
PSA.105.2	Sing praise to the 
PSA.105.2	tell the wonderful things he has done.
PSA.105.3	Be glad that we belong to him;
PSA.105.3	let all who worship him rejoice.
PSA.105.4	Go to the 
PSA.105.4	and worship him continually.
PSA.105.5+PSA.105.6	You descendants of Abraham, his servant;
PSA.105.5+PSA.105.6	you descendants of Jacob, the man he chose:
PSA.105.5+PSA.105.6	remember the miracles that God performed
PSA.105.5+PSA.105.6	and the judgments that he gave.
PSA.105.7	The 
PSA.105.7	his commands are for all the world.
PSA.105.8	He will keep his covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	his promises for a thousand generations.
PSA.105.9	and his promise to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	one that will last forever.
PSA.105.11	“I will give you the land of Canaan,” he said.
PSA.105.11	“It will be your own possession.”
PSA.105.12	God's people were few in number,
PSA.105.12	strangers in the land of Canaan.
PSA.105.13	They wandered from country to country,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another.
PSA.105.14	to protect them, he warned the kings:
PSA.105.15	“Don't harm my chosen servants;
PSA.105.15	do not touch my prophets.”
PSA.105.16	and took away all their food.
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who had been sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	and an iron collar was around his neck,
PSA.105.19	until what he had predicted came true.
PSA.105.19	The word of the 
PSA.105.20	the ruler of nations set him free.
PSA.105.21	and made him ruler over all the land,
PSA.105.22	with power over the king's officials
PSA.105.22	and authority to instruct his advisers.
PSA.105.23	and settled in that country.
PSA.105.24	and made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He made the Egyptians hate his people
PSA.105.25	and treat his servants with deceit.
PSA.105.26	and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They did God's mighty acts
PSA.105.27	and performed miracles in Egypt.
PSA.105.28	but the Egyptians did not obey
PSA.105.29	and killed all their fish.
PSA.105.30	even the palace was filled with them.
PSA.105.31	swarmed throughout the whole country.
PSA.105.32	instead of rain;
PSA.105.33	he destroyed their grapevines and fig trees
PSA.105.33	and broke down all the trees.
PSA.105.34	countless millions of them;
PSA.105.35	they ate all the plants in the land;
PSA.105.35	they ate all the crops.
PSA.105.36	of all the families of Egypt.
PSA.105.37	they carried silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	and all of them were healthy and strong.
PSA.105.38	The Egyptians were afraid of them
PSA.105.38	and were glad when they left.
PSA.105.39	and a fire at night to give them light.
PSA.105.40	he gave them food from heaven to satisfy them.
PSA.105.41	flowing through the desert like a river.
PSA.105.42	He remembered his sacred promise
PSA.105.42	to Abraham his servant.
PSA.105.43	So he led his chosen people out,
PSA.105.43	and they sang and shouted for joy.
PSA.105.44	and let them take over their fields,
PSA.105.45	so that his people would obey his laws
PSA.105.45	and keep all his commands.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	his love is eternal.
PSA.106.2	Who can tell all the great things he has done?
PSA.106.2	Who can praise him enough?
PSA.106.3	Happy are those who obey his commands,
PSA.106.3	who always do what is right.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	include me when you save them.
PSA.106.5	Let me see the prosperity of your people
PSA.106.5	and share in the happiness of your nation,
PSA.106.5	in the glad pride of those who belong to you.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned as our ancestors did;
PSA.106.6	we have been wicked and evil.
PSA.106.7	they forgot the many times he showed them his love,
PSA.106.7	and they rebelled against the Almighty
PSA.106.8	But he saved them, as he had promised,
PSA.106.8	in order to show his great power.
PSA.106.9	and it dried up;
PSA.106.9	he led his people across on dry land.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from those who hated them;
PSA.106.10	he rescued them from their enemies.
PSA.106.11	But the water drowned their enemies;
PSA.106.11	not one of them was left.
PSA.106.12	and sang praises to him.
PSA.106.13	But they quickly forgot what he had done
PSA.106.13	and acted without waiting for his advice.
PSA.106.14	and put God to the test;
PSA.106.15	so he gave them what they asked for,
PSA.106.15	but also sent a terrible disease among them.
PSA.106.16	and of Aaron, the 
PSA.106.17	Then the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan
PSA.106.17	and buried Abiram and his family;
PSA.106.18	fire came down on their followers
PSA.106.18	and burned up those wicked people.
PSA.106.19	and worshiped that idol;
PSA.106.20	they exchanged the glory of God
PSA.106.20	for the image of an animal that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot the God who had saved them
PSA.106.21	by his mighty acts in Egypt.
PSA.106.22	What wonderful things he did there!
PSA.106.22	What amazing things at the Red Sea!
PSA.106.23	When God said that he would destroy his people,
PSA.106.23	his chosen servant, Moses, stood up against God
PSA.106.23	and kept his anger from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	because they did not believe God's promise.
PSA.106.25	They stayed in their tents and grumbled
PSA.106.25	and would not listen to the 
PSA.106.26	So he gave them a solemn warning
PSA.106.26	that he would make them die in the desert
PSA.106.27	letting them die in foreign countries.
PSA.106.28	and ate sacrifices offered to dead gods.
PSA.106.29	They stirred up the 
PSA.106.29	and a terrible disease broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas stood up and punished the guilty,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	This has been remembered in his favor ever since
PSA.106.31	and will be for all time to come.
PSA.106.32	and Moses was in trouble on their account.
PSA.106.33	They made him so bitter
PSA.106.33	that he spoke without stopping to think.
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	but they intermarried with them
PSA.106.35	and adopted their pagan ways.
PSA.106.36	God's people worshiped idols,
PSA.106.36	and this caused their destruction.
PSA.106.37	as sacrifices to the idols of Canaan.
PSA.106.38	and the land was defiled by those murders.
PSA.106.39	They made themselves impure by their actions
PSA.106.39	and were unfaithful to God.
PSA.106.40	he was disgusted with them.
PSA.106.41	He abandoned them to the power of the heathen,
PSA.106.41	and their enemies ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	They were oppressed by their enemies
PSA.106.42	and were in complete subjection to them.
PSA.106.43	Many times the 
PSA.106.43	but they chose to rebel against him
PSA.106.43	and sank deeper into sin.
PSA.106.44	Yet the 
PSA.106.44	and he took notice of their distress.
PSA.106.45	For their sake he remembered his covenant,
PSA.106.45	and because of his great love he relented.
PSA.106.46	He made all their oppressors
PSA.106.46	feel sorry for them.
PSA.106.47	and bring us back from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	so that we may be thankful
PSA.106.47	and praise your holy name.
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.106.48	praise him now and forever!
PSA.106.48	Let everyone say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	his love is eternal!”
PSA.107.2	Repeat these words in praise to the 
PSA.107.2	all you whom he has saved.
PSA.107.2	He has rescued you from your enemies
PSA.107.3	and has brought you back from foreign countries,
PSA.107.3	from east and west, from north and south.
PSA.107.4	Some wandered in the trackless desert
PSA.107.4	and could not find their way to a city to live in.
PSA.107.5	They were hungry and thirsty
PSA.107.5	and had given up all hope.
PSA.107.6	Then in their trouble they called to the 
PSA.107.6	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.7	He led them by a straight road
PSA.107.7	to a city where they could live.
PSA.107.8	They must thank the 
PSA.107.8	for the wonderful things he did for them.
PSA.107.9	He satisfies those who are thirsty
PSA.107.9	and fills the hungry with good things.
PSA.107.10	Some were living in gloom and darkness,
PSA.107.10	prisoners suffering in chains,
PSA.107.11	because they had rebelled against the commands of Almighty God
PSA.107.11	and had rejected his instructions.
PSA.107.12	They were worn out from hard work;
PSA.107.12	they would fall down, and no one would help.
PSA.107.13	Then in their trouble they called to the 
PSA.107.13	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of their gloom and darkness
PSA.107.14	and broke their chains in pieces.
PSA.107.15	They must thank the 
PSA.107.15	for the wonderful things he did for them.
PSA.107.16	He breaks down doors of bronze
PSA.107.16	and smashes iron bars.
PSA.107.17	Some were fools, suffering because of their sins
PSA.107.17	and because of their evil;
PSA.107.18	they couldn't stand the sight of food
PSA.107.18	and were close to death.
PSA.107.19	Then in their trouble they called to the 
PSA.107.19	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.20	He healed them with his command
PSA.107.20	and saved them from the grave.
PSA.107.21	They must thank the 
PSA.107.21	for the wonderful things he did for them.
PSA.107.22	They must thank him with sacrifices,
PSA.107.22	and with songs of joy must tell all that he has done.
PSA.107.23	Some sailed over the ocean in ships,
PSA.107.23	earning their living on the seas.
PSA.107.24	They saw what the 
PSA.107.24	his wonderful acts on the seas.
PSA.107.25	He commanded, and a mighty wind began to blow
PSA.107.25	and stirred up the waves.
PSA.107.26	The ships were lifted high in the air
PSA.107.26	and plunged down into the depths.
PSA.107.26	In such danger the sailors lost their courage;
PSA.107.27	they stumbled and staggered like drunks—
PSA.107.27	all their skill was useless.
PSA.107.28	Then in their trouble they called to the 
PSA.107.28	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.29	He calmed the raging storm,
PSA.107.29	and the waves became quiet.
PSA.107.30	They were glad because of the calm,
PSA.107.30	and he brought them safe to the port they wanted.
PSA.107.31	They must thank the 
PSA.107.31	for the wonderful things he did for them.
PSA.107.32	They must proclaim his greatness in the assembly of the people
PSA.107.32	and praise him before the council of the leaders.
PSA.107.33	The 
PSA.107.33	and stopped springs from flowing.
PSA.107.34	because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
PSA.107.35	He changed deserts into pools of water
PSA.107.35	and dry land into flowing springs.
PSA.107.36	He let hungry people settle there,
PSA.107.36	and they built a city to live in.
PSA.107.37	They sowed the fields and planted grapevines
PSA.107.37	and reaped an abundant harvest.
PSA.107.38	He blessed his people, and they had many children;
PSA.107.38	he kept their herds of cattle from decreasing.
PSA.107.39	When God's people were defeated and humiliated
PSA.107.39	by cruel oppression and suffering,
PSA.107.40	he showed contempt for their oppressors
PSA.107.40	and made them wander in trackless deserts.
PSA.107.41	But he rescued the needy from their misery
PSA.107.41	and made their families increase like flocks.
PSA.107.42	The righteous see this and are glad,
PSA.107.42	but all the wicked are put to silence.
PSA.107.43	May those who are wise think about these things;
PSA.107.43	may they consider the 
PSA.108.1	I have complete confidence, O God!
PSA.108.1	I will sing and praise you!
PSA.108.1	Wake up, my soul!
PSA.108.2	Wake up, my harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will wake up the sun.
PSA.108.3	I will thank you, O 
PSA.108.3	I will praise you among the peoples.
PSA.108.4	Your constant love reaches above the heavens;
PSA.108.4	your faithfulness touches the skies.
PSA.108.5	Show your greatness in the sky, O God,
PSA.108.5	and your glory over all the earth.
PSA.108.6	Save us by your might; answer my prayer,
PSA.108.6	so that the people you love may be rescued.
PSA.108.7	From his sanctuary
PSA.108.7	“In triumph I will divide Shechem
PSA.108.7	and distribute Sukkoth Valley to my people.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh too;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is my helmet
PSA.108.8	and Judah my royal scepter.
PSA.108.9	But I will use Moab as my washbowl,
PSA.108.9	and I will throw my sandals on Edom,
PSA.108.9	as a sign that I own it.
PSA.108.9	I will shout in triumph over the Philistines.”
PSA.108.10	Who, O God, will take me into the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Have you really rejected us?
PSA.108.11	Aren't you going to march out with our armies?
PSA.108.12	Help us against the enemy;
PSA.108.12	human help is worthless.
PSA.108.13	With God on our side we will win;
PSA.108.13	he will defeat our enemies.
PSA.109.1	I praise you, God; don't remain silent!
PSA.109.2	Wicked people and liars have attacked me.
PSA.109.2	They tell lies about me,
PSA.109.3	and they say evil things about me,
PSA.109.3	attacking me for no reason.
PSA.109.4	They oppose me, even though I love them
PSA.109.4	and have prayed for them.
PSA.109.5	They pay me back evil for good
PSA.109.5	and hatred for love.
PSA.109.6	Choose some corrupt judge to try my enemy,
PSA.109.6	and let one of his own enemies accuse him.
PSA.109.7	May he be tried and found guilty;
PSA.109.7	may even his prayer be considered a crime!
PSA.109.8	may someone else take his job!
PSA.109.9	May his children become orphans,
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow!
PSA.109.10	May his children be homeless beggars;
PSA.109.10	may they be driven from
PSA.109.11	May his creditors take away all his property,
PSA.109.11	and may strangers get everything he worked for.
PSA.109.12	May no one ever be kind to him
PSA.109.12	or care for the orphans he leaves behind.
PSA.109.13	May all his descendants die,
PSA.109.13	and may his name be forgotten in the next generation.
PSA.109.14	May the 
PSA.109.14	and never forgive his mother's sins.
PSA.109.15	May the 
PSA.109.15	but may they themselves be completely forgotten!
PSA.109.16	That man never thought of being kind;
PSA.109.16	he persecuted and killed
PSA.109.16	the poor, the needy, and the helpless.
PSA.109.17	He loved to curse—may he be cursed!
PSA.109.17	He hated to give blessings—may no one bless him!
PSA.109.18	He cursed as naturally as he dressed himself;
PSA.109.18	may his own curses soak into his body like water
PSA.109.18	and into his bones like oil!
PSA.109.19	May they cover him like clothes
PSA.109.19	and always be around him like a belt!
PSA.109.20	those who say such evil things against me!
PSA.109.21	But my Sovereign 
PSA.109.21	and rescue me because of the goodness of your love.
PSA.109.22	I am poor and needy;
PSA.109.22	I am hurt to the depths of my heart.
PSA.109.23	Like an evening shadow I am about to vanish;
PSA.109.23	I am blown away like an insect.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak from lack of food;
PSA.109.24	I am nothing but skin and bones.
PSA.109.25	they shake their heads in scorn.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	because of your constant love, save me!
PSA.109.27	Make my enemies know
PSA.109.27	that you are the one who saves me.
PSA.109.28	They may curse me, but you will bless me.
PSA.109.28	May my persecutors be defeated,
PSA.109.28	and may I, your servant, be glad.
PSA.109.29	May my enemies be covered with disgrace;
PSA.109.29	may they wear their shame like a robe.
PSA.109.30	I will give loud thanks to the 
PSA.109.30	I will praise him in the assembly of the people,
PSA.109.31	because he defends the poor
PSA.109.31	and saves them from those who condemn them to death.
PSA.110.1	“Sit here at my right side
PSA.110.1	until I put your enemies under your feet.”
PSA.110.2	From Zion the 
PSA.110.2	“Rule over your enemies,” he says.
PSA.110.3	On the day you fight your enemies,
PSA.110.3	your people will volunteer.
PSA.110.3	Like the dew of early morning
PSA.110.3	your young men will come to you on the sacred hills.
PSA.110.4	“You will be a priest forever
PSA.110.4	in the priestly order of Melchizedek.”
PSA.110.5	The Lord is at your right side;
PSA.110.5	when he becomes angry, he will defeat kings.
PSA.110.6	He will pass judgment on the nations
PSA.110.6	and fill the battlefield with corpses;
PSA.110.6	he will defeat kings all over the earth.
PSA.110.7	The king will drink from the stream by the road,
PSA.110.7	and strengthened, he will stand victorious.
PSA.111.1	Praise the

PSA.111.2	All who are delighted with them want to understand them.
PSA.111.3	All he does is full of honor and majesty;
PSA.111.3	his righteousness is eternal.
PSA.111.4	The 
PSA.111.4	he is kind and merciful.
PSA.111.5	He provides food for those who honor him;
PSA.111.5	he never forgets his covenant.
PSA.111.6	He has shown his power to his people
PSA.111.6	by giving them the lands of foreigners.
PSA.111.7	In all he does he is faithful and just;
PSA.111.7	all his commands are dependable.
PSA.111.8	They last for all time;
PSA.111.8	they were given in truth and righteousness.
PSA.111.9	He set his people free
PSA.111.9	and made an eternal covenant with them.
PSA.111.9	Holy and mighty is he!
PSA.111.10	he gives sound judgment to all who obey his commands.
PSA.111.10	He is to be praised forever.
PSA.112.1	Praise the 
PSA.112.1	Happy is the person who honors the 
PSA.112.1	who takes pleasure in obeying his commands.
PSA.112.2	The good man's children will be powerful in the land;
PSA.112.2	his descendants will be blessed.
PSA.112.3	His family will be wealthy and rich,
PSA.112.3	and he will be prosperous forever.
PSA.112.4	Light shines in the darkness for good people,
PSA.112.4	for those who are merciful, kind, and just.
PSA.112.5	Happy is the person who is generous with his loans,
PSA.112.5	who runs his business honestly.
PSA.112.6	A good person will never fail;
PSA.112.6	he will always be remembered.
PSA.112.7	He is not afraid of receiving bad news;
PSA.112.7	his faith is strong, and he trusts in the

PSA.112.8	he is certain to see his enemies defeated.
PSA.112.9	and his kindness never fails;
PSA.112.9	he will be powerful and respected.

PSA.119.52	I remember your judgments of long ago,
PSA.119.52	and they bring me comfort, O 
PSA.119.53	When I see the wicked breaking your law,
PSA.119.53	I am filled with anger.
PSA.119.54	During my brief earthly life
PSA.119.54	I compose songs about your commands.
PSA.119.55	In the night I remember you, 
PSA.119.55	and I think about your law.
PSA.119.56	I find my happiness
PSA.119.56	in obeying your commands.

PSA.119.81	I place my trust in your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes are tired from watching for what you promised,
PSA.119.82	while I ask, “When will you help me?”
PSA.119.83	I am as useless as a discarded wineskin;
PSA.119.83	yet I have not forgotten your commands.
PSA.119.84	How much longer must I wait?
PSA.119.84	When will you punish those who persecute me?
PSA.119.85	The proud, who do not obey your law,
PSA.119.85	have dug pits to trap me.
PSA.119.86	Your commandments are all trustworthy;
PSA.119.86	people persecute me with lies—help me!
PSA.119.87	They have almost succeeded in killing me,
PSA.119.87	but I have not neglected your commands.

PSA.119.91	All things remain to this day because of your command,
PSA.119.91	because they are all your servants.
PSA.119.92	If your law had not been the source of my joy,
PSA.119.92	I would have died from my sufferings.
PSA.119.93	I will never neglect your instructions,
PSA.119.93	because by them you have kept me alive.
PSA.119.94	I am yours—save me!
PSA.119.94	I have tried to obey your commands.
PSA.119.95	The wicked are waiting to kill me,
PSA.119.95	but I will meditate on your laws.
PSA.119.96	I have learned that everything has limits;
PSA.119.96	but your commandment is perfect.
PSA.119.97	How I love your law!
PSA.119.97	I think about it all day long.
PSA.119.98	Your commandment is with me all the time
PSA.119.98	and makes me wiser than my enemies.
PSA.119.99	I understand more than all my teachers,
PSA.119.99	because I meditate on your instructions.
PSA.119.100	I have greater wisdom than those who are old,
PSA.119.100	because I obey your commands.
PSA.119.101	I have avoided all evil conduct,
PSA.119.101	because I want to obey your word.
PSA.119.102	I have not neglected your instructions,
PSA.119.102	because you yourself are my teacher.
PSA.119.103	How sweet is the taste of your instructions—
PSA.119.103	sweeter even than honey!
PSA.119.104	I gain wisdom from your laws,
PSA.119.104	and so I hate all bad conduct.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp to guide me
PSA.119.105	and a light for my path.
PSA.119.106	I will keep my solemn promise
PSA.119.106	to obey your just instructions.
PSA.119.107	My sufferings, 
PSA.119.107	keep me alive, as you have promised.
PSA.119.108	Accept my prayer of thanks, O 
PSA.119.108	and teach me your commands.
PSA.119.109	I am always ready to risk my life;
PSA.119.109	I
PSA.119.110	The wicked lay a trap for me,
PSA.119.110	but I have not disobeyed your commands.
PSA.119.111	Your commandments are my eternal possession;

PSA.119.112	I have decided to obey your laws
PSA.119.112	until the day I die.
PSA.119.113	I hate those who are not completely loyal to you,
PSA.119.113	but I love your law.
PSA.119.114	You are my defender and protector;
PSA.119.114	I put my hope in your promise.
PSA.119.115	Go away from me, you sinful people.
PSA.119.115	I will obey the commands of my God.
PSA.119.116	Give me strength, as you promised, and I shall live;
PSA.119.116	don't let me be disappointed in my hope!
PSA.119.117	Hold me, and I will be safe,
PSA.119.117	and I will always pay attention to your commands.
PSA.119.118	You reject everyone who disobeys your laws;
PSA.119.118	their deceitful schemes are useless.
PSA.119.119	You treat all the wicked like rubbish,
PSA.119.119	and so I love your instructions.
PSA.119.120	Because of you I am afraid;
PSA.119.120	I am filled with fear because of your judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done what is right and good;
PSA.119.121	don't abandon me to my enemies!
PSA.119.122	Promise that you will help your servant;
PSA.119.122	don't let the arrogant oppress me!
PSA.119.123	My eyes are tired from watching for your saving help,
PSA.119.123	for the deliverance you promised.
PSA.119.124	Treat me according to your constant love,
PSA.119.124	and teach me your commands.
PSA.119.125	I am your servant; give me understanding,
PSA.119.125	so that I may know your teachings.
PSA.119.126	because people are disobeying your law.
PSA.119.127	I love your commands more than gold,
PSA.119.127	more than the finest gold.
PSA.119.128	And so I follow all your instructions;
PSA.119.128	I hate all wrong ways.
PSA.119.129	Your teachings are wonderful;
PSA.119.129	I obey them with all my heart.
PSA.119.130	The explanation of your teachings gives light
PSA.119.130	and brings wisdom to the ignorant.
PSA.119.131	In my desire for your commands
PSA.119.131	I pant with open mouth.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and have mercy on me
PSA.119.132	as you do on all those who love you.
PSA.119.133	As you have promised, keep me from falling;
PSA.119.133	don't let me be overcome by evil.
PSA.119.134	Save me from those who oppress me,
PSA.119.134	so that I may obey your commands.
PSA.119.135	Bless me with your presence
PSA.119.135	and teach me your laws.
PSA.119.136	My tears pour down like a river,
PSA.119.136	because people do not obey your law.
PSA.119.137	You are righteous, 
PSA.119.137	and your laws are just.
PSA.119.138	The rules that you have given
PSA.119.138	are completely fair and right.
PSA.119.139	My anger burns in me like a fire,
PSA.119.139	because my enemies disregard your commands.
PSA.119.140	How certain your promise is!
PSA.119.140	How I love it!
PSA.119.141	I am unimportant and despised,
PSA.119.141	but I do not neglect your teachings.
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness will last forever,
PSA.119.142	and your law is always true.
PSA.119.143	I am filled with trouble and anxiety,
PSA.119.143	but your commandments bring me joy.
PSA.119.144	Your instructions are always just;
PSA.119.144	give me understanding, and I shall live.
PSA.119.145	With all my heart I call to you;
PSA.119.145	answer me, 
PSA.119.146	I call to you;
PSA.119.146	save me, and I will keep your laws.
PSA.119.147	Before sunrise I call to you for help;
PSA.119.147	I place my hope in your promise.
PSA.119.148	All night long I lie awake,
PSA.119.148	to meditate on your instructions.
PSA.119.149	Because your love is constant, hear me, O 
PSA.119.149	show your mercy, and preserve my life!
PSA.119.150	My cruel persecutors are coming closer,
PSA.119.150	people who never keep your law.
PSA.119.151	But you are near to me, 
PSA.119.151	and all your commands are permanent.
PSA.119.152	Long ago I learned about your instructions;
PSA.119.152	you made them to last forever.
PSA.119.153	Look at my suffering, and save me,
PSA.119.153	because I have not neglected your law.
PSA.119.154	Defend my cause, and set me free;
PSA.119.154	save me, as you have promised.
PSA.119.155	The wicked will not be saved,
PSA.119.155	for they do not obey your laws.
PSA.119.156	But your compassion, 
PSA.119.156	show your mercy and save me!
PSA.119.157	I have many enemies and oppressors,
PSA.119.157	but I do not fail to obey your laws.
PSA.119.158	When I look at those traitors, I am filled with disgust,
PSA.119.158	because they do not keep your commands.
PSA.119.159	See how I love your instructions, 
PSA.119.159	Your love never changes, so save me!
PSA.119.160	The heart of your law is truth,
PSA.119.160	and all your righteous judgments are eternal.
PSA.119.161	Powerful people attack me unjustly,
PSA.119.161	but I respect your law.
PSA.119.162	How happy I am because of your promises—
PSA.119.162	as happy as someone who finds rich treasure.
PSA.119.163	I hate and detest all lies,
PSA.119.163	but I love your law.
PSA.119.164	Seven times each day I thank you
PSA.119.164	for your righteous judgments.
PSA.119.165	Those who love your law have perfect security,
PSA.119.165	and there is nothing that can make them fall.
PSA.119.166	I wait for you to save me, 
PSA.119.166	and I do what you command.
PSA.119.167	I obey your teachings;
PSA.119.167	I love them with all my heart.
PSA.119.168	I obey your commands and your instructions;
PSA.119.168	you see everything I do.
PSA.119.169	Let my cry for help reach you, 
PSA.119.169	Give me understanding, as you have promised.
PSA.119.170	Listen to my prayer,
PSA.119.170	and save me according to your promise!
PSA.119.171	I will always praise you,
PSA.119.171	because you teach me your laws.
PSA.119.172	I will sing about your law,
PSA.119.172	because your commands are just.
PSA.119.173	Always be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	because I follow your commands.
PSA.119.174	How I long for your saving help, O 
PSA.119.174	I find happiness in your law.
PSA.119.175	Give me life, so that I may praise you;
PSA.119.175	may your instructions help me.
PSA.119.176	I wander about like a lost sheep;
PSA.119.176	so come and look for me, your servant,
PSA.119.176	because I have not neglected your laws.
PSA.120.1	When I was in trouble, I called to the 
PSA.120.1	and he answered me.
PSA.120.2	Save me, 
PSA.120.2	from liars and deceivers.
PSA.120.3	You liars, what will God do to you?
PSA.120.3	How will he punish you?
PSA.120.4	With a soldier's sharp arrows,
PSA.120.4	with red-hot coals!
PSA.120.5	Living among you is as bad as living in Meshech
PSA.120.5	or among the people of Kedar.
PSA.120.6	I have lived too long
PSA.120.6	with people who hate peace!
PSA.120.7	When I speak of peace,
PSA.120.7	they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I look to the mountains;
PSA.121.1	where will my help come from?
PSA.121.2	My help will come from the 
PSA.121.2	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not let you fall;
PSA.121.3	your protector is always awake.
PSA.121.4	The protector of Israel
PSA.121.4	never dozes or sleeps.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	he is by your side to protect you.
PSA.121.6	The sun will not hurt you during the day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon during the night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	he will keep you safe.
PSA.121.8	He will protect you as you come and go
PSA.121.8	now and forever.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the 
PSA.122.2	And now we are here,
PSA.122.2	standing inside the gates of Jerusalem!
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is a city restored
PSA.122.3	in beautiful order and harmony.
PSA.122.4	This is where the tribes come,
PSA.122.4	the tribes of Israel,
PSA.122.4	to give thanks to the 
PSA.122.4	according to his command.
PSA.122.5	Here the kings of Israel
PSA.122.5	sat to judge their people.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
PSA.122.6	“May those who love you prosper.
PSA.122.7	May there be peace inside your walls
PSA.122.7	and safety in your palaces.”
PSA.122.8	For the sake of my relatives and friends
PSA.122.8	I say to Jerusalem, “Peace be with you!”
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I pray for your prosperity.
PSA.123.1	up to heaven, where you rule.
PSA.123.2	As a servant depends on his master,
PSA.123.2	as a maid depends on her mistress,
PSA.123.2	so we will keep looking to you, O 
PSA.123.2	until you have mercy on us.
PSA.123.3	Be merciful to us, 
PSA.123.3	we have been treated with so much contempt.
PSA.123.4	We have been mocked too long by the rich
PSA.123.4	and scorned by proud oppressors.
PSA.124.1	What if the 
PSA.124.1	Answer, O Israel!
PSA.124.2	“If the 
PSA.124.2	when our enemies attacked us,
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us alive
PSA.124.3	in their furious anger against us;
PSA.124.4	then the flood would have carried us away,
PSA.124.4	the water would have covered us,
PSA.124.5	the raging torrent would have drowned us.”
PSA.124.6	Let us thank the 
PSA.124.6	who has not let our enemies destroy us.
PSA.124.7	We have escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap;
PSA.124.7	the trap is broken, and we are free!
PSA.124.8	Our help comes from the 
PSA.124.8	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	which can never be shaken, never be moved.
PSA.125.2	As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.2	now and forever.
PSA.125.3	The wicked will not always rule over the land of the righteous;
PSA.125.3	if they did, the righteous themselves might do evil.
PSA.125.4	to those who obey your commands.
PSA.125.5	But when you punish the wicked,
PSA.125.5	punish also those who abandon your ways.
PSA.125.5	Peace be with Israel!
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	it was like a dream!
PSA.126.2	How we laughed, how we sang for joy!
PSA.126.2	Then the other nations said about us,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	Indeed he did great things for us;
PSA.126.3	how happy we were!
PSA.126.4	just as the rain brings water back to dry riverbeds.
PSA.126.5	Let those who wept as they planted their crops,
PSA.126.5	gather the harvest with joy!
PSA.126.6	Those who wept as they went out carrying the seed
PSA.126.6	will come back singing for joy,
PSA.126.6	as they bring in the harvest.
PSA.127.1	If the 
PSA.127.1	the work of the builders is useless;
PSA.127.1	if the 
PSA.127.1	it does no good for the sentries to stand guard.
PSA.127.2	It is useless to work so hard for a living,
PSA.127.2	getting up early and going to bed late.
PSA.127.2	For the 
PSA.127.2	while they are asleep.
PSA.127.3	Children are a gift from the 
PSA.127.3	they are a real blessing.
PSA.127.4	The sons a man has when he is young
PSA.127.4	are like arrows in a soldier's hand.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man who has many such arrows.
PSA.127.5	He will never be defeated
PSA.127.5	when he meets his enemies in the place of judgment.
PSA.128.1	Happy are those who obey the 
PSA.128.1	who live by his commands.
PSA.128.2	Your work will provide for your needs;
PSA.128.2	you will be happy and prosperous.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your home,
PSA.128.3	and your children will be like young olive trees around your table.
PSA.128.4	A man who obeys the 
PSA.128.4	will surely be blessed like this.
PSA.128.5	May the 
PSA.128.5	May you see Jerusalem prosper
PSA.128.5	all the days of your life!
PSA.128.6	May you live to see your grandchildren!
PSA.128.6	Peace be with Israel!
PSA.129.1	Israel, tell us how your enemies have persecuted you
PSA.129.1	ever since you were young.
PSA.129.2	“Ever since I was young,
PSA.129.2	my enemies have persecuted me cruelly,
PSA.129.2	but they have not overcome me.
PSA.129.3	They cut deep wounds in my back
PSA.129.3	and made it like a plowed field.
PSA.129.4	But the 
PSA.129.4	has freed me from slavery.”
PSA.129.5	May everyone who hates Zion
PSA.129.5	be defeated and driven back.
PSA.129.6	May they all be like grass growing on the housetops,
PSA.129.6	which dries up before it can grow;
PSA.129.7	no one gathers it up
PSA.129.7	or carries it away in bundles.
PSA.129.8	No one who passes by will say,
PSA.129.8	“May the 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	From the depths of my despair I call to you, 
PSA.130.2	Hear my cry, O Lord;
PSA.130.2	listen to my call for help!
PSA.130.3	If you kept a record of our sins,
PSA.130.3	who could escape being condemned?
PSA.130.4	But you forgive us,
PSA.130.4	so that we should stand in awe of you.
PSA.130.5	I wait eagerly for the 
PSA.130.5	and in his word I trust.
PSA.130.6	I wait for the Lord
PSA.130.6	more eagerly than sentries wait for the dawn—
PSA.130.6	than sentries wait for the dawn.
PSA.130.7	Israel, trust in the 
PSA.130.7	because his love is constant
PSA.130.7	and he is always willing to save.
PSA.130.8	from all their sins.
PSA.131.1	and turned away from my arrogance.
PSA.131.1	I am not concerned with great matters
PSA.131.1	or with subjects too difficult for me.
PSA.131.2	Instead, I am content and at peace.
PSA.131.2	As a child lies quietly in its mother's arms,
PSA.131.2	so my heart is quiet within me.
PSA.131.3	Israel, trust in the 
PSA.131.3	now and forever!
PSA.132.1	and all the hardships he endured.
PSA.132.2	Remember, 
PSA.132.2	the vow he made to you, the Mighty God of Jacob:
PSA.132.3	“I will not go home or go to bed;
PSA.132.4	I will not rest or sleep,
PSA.132.5	until I provide a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a home for the Mighty God of Jacob.”
PSA.132.6	and we found it in the fields of Jearim.
PSA.132.7	We said, “Let us go to the 
PSA.132.7	let us worship before his throne.”
PSA.132.8	Come to the Temple, 
PSA.132.8	the symbol of your power,
PSA.132.8	and stay here forever.
PSA.132.9	May your priests do always what is right;
PSA.132.9	may your people shout for joy!
PSA.132.10	You made a promise to your servant David;
PSA.132.10	do not reject your chosen king, 
PSA.132.11	a promise you will not take back:
PSA.132.11	“I will make one of your sons king,
PSA.132.11	and he will rule after you.
PSA.132.12	If your sons are true to my covenant
PSA.132.12	and to the commands I give them,
PSA.132.12	their sons, also, will succeed you for all time as kings.”
PSA.132.13	The 
PSA.132.13	he wants to make it his home:
PSA.132.14	“This is where I will live forever;
PSA.132.14	this is where I want to rule.
PSA.132.15	I will richly provide Zion with all she needs;
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy her poor with food.
PSA.132.16	I will bless her priests in all they do,
PSA.132.16	and her people will sing and shout for joy.
PSA.132.17	here I will preserve the rule of my chosen king.
PSA.132.18	I will cover his enemies with shame,
PSA.132.18	but his kingdom will prosper and flourish.”
PSA.133.1	How wonderful it is, how pleasant,
PSA.133.1	for God's people to live together in harmony!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious anointing oil
PSA.133.2	running down from Aaron's head and beard,
PSA.133.2	down to the collar of his robes.
PSA.133.3	It is like the dew on Mount Hermon,
PSA.133.3	falling on the hills of Zion.
PSA.133.3	That is where the 
PSA.133.3	life that never ends.
PSA.134.1	Come, praise the 
PSA.134.1	all his servants,
PSA.134.1	all who serve in his Temple at night.
PSA.134.2	Raise your hands in prayer in the Temple,
PSA.134.2	and praise the 
PSA.134.3	May the 
PSA.134.3	bless you from Zion!
PSA.135.1	Praise the 
PSA.135.1	Praise his name, you servants of the 
PSA.135.2	who stand in the 
PSA.135.2	in the Temple of our God.
PSA.135.3	Praise the 
PSA.135.3	sing praises to his name, because he is kind.
PSA.135.4	He chose Jacob for himself,
PSA.135.4	the people of Israel for his own.
PSA.135.5	I know that our 
PSA.135.5	greater than all the gods.
PSA.135.6	He does whatever he wishes
PSA.135.6	in heaven and on earth,
PSA.135.6	in the seas and in the depths below.
PSA.135.7	He brings storm clouds from the ends of the earth;
PSA.135.7	he makes lightning for the storms,
PSA.135.7	and he brings out the wind from his storeroom.
PSA.135.8	In Egypt he killed all the first-born
PSA.135.8	of people and animals alike.
PSA.135.9	There he performed miracles and wonders
PSA.135.9	to punish the king and all his officials.
PSA.135.10	He destroyed many nations
PSA.135.10	and killed powerful kings:
PSA.135.11	Sihon, king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	Og, king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kings in Canaan.
PSA.135.12	He gave their lands to his people;
PSA.135.12	he gave them to Israel.
PSA.135.13	all generations will remember you.
PSA.135.14	The 
PSA.135.14	he will take pity on his servants.
PSA.135.15	they are formed by human hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but cannot speak,
PSA.135.16	and eyes, but cannot see.
PSA.135.17	They have ears, but cannot hear;
PSA.135.17	they are not even able to breathe.
PSA.135.18	May all who made them and who trust in them
PSA.135.18	become
PSA.135.19	Praise the 
PSA.135.19	praise him, you priests of God!
PSA.135.20	Praise the 
PSA.135.20	praise him, all you that worship him!
PSA.135.21	Praise the 
PSA.135.21	in Jerusalem, his home.
PSA.135.21	Praise the 
PSA.136.1	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.2	Give thanks to the greatest of all gods;
PSA.136.2	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.3	Give thanks to the mightiest of all lords;
PSA.136.3	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.4	He alone performs great miracles;
PSA.136.4	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.5	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.6	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.7	his love is eternal;

PSA.136.8	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.9	the moon and the stars to rule over the night;
PSA.136.9	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.10	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.11	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.12	with his strong hand, his powerful arm;
PSA.136.12	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.13	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.14	he led his people through it;
PSA.136.14	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.15	but he drowned the king of Egypt and his army;
PSA.136.15	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.16	He led his people through the desert;
PSA.136.16	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.17	He killed powerful kings;
PSA.136.17	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.18	he killed famous kings;
PSA.136.18	his love is eternal;

PSA.136.20	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.21	He gave their lands to his people;
PSA.136.21	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.22	he gave them to Israel, his servant;
PSA.136.22	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.23	He did not forget us when we were defeated;
PSA.136.23	his love is eternal;
PSA.136.24	he freed us from our enemies;
PSA.136.24	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.25	He gives food to every living creature;
PSA.136.25	his love is eternal.
PSA.136.26	Give thanks to the God of heaven;
PSA.136.26	his love is eternal.
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon we sat down;
PSA.137.1	there we wept when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	On the willows near by
PSA.137.2	we hung up our harps.
PSA.137.3	Those who captured us told us to sing;
PSA.137.3	they told us to entertain them:
PSA.137.3	“Sing us a song about Zion.”
PSA.137.4	How can we sing a song to the 
PSA.137.4	in a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	May I never be able to play the harp again
PSA.137.5	if I forget you, Jerusalem!
PSA.137.6	May I never be able to sing again
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	if I do not think of you as my greatest joy!
PSA.137.7	Remember, 
PSA.137.7	the day Jerusalem was captured.
PSA.137.7	Remember how they kept saying,
PSA.137.7	“Tear it down to the ground!”
PSA.137.8	Happy are those who pay you back
PSA.137.8	for what you have done to us—
PSA.137.9	who take your babies
PSA.137.9	and smash them against a rock.
PSA.138.1	I thank you, 
PSA.138.1	I sing praise to you before the gods.
PSA.138.2	I face your holy Temple,
PSA.138.2	bow down, and praise your name
PSA.138.2	because of your constant love and faithfulness,
PSA.138.2	because you have shown that your name and your commands are supreme.
PSA.138.3	You answered me when I called to you;
PSA.138.3	with your strength you strengthened me.
PSA.138.4	All the kings in the world will praise you, 
PSA.138.4	because they have heard your promises.
PSA.138.5	They will sing about what you have done
PSA.138.5	and about your great glory.
PSA.138.6	Even though you are so high above,
PSA.138.6	you care for the lowly,
PSA.138.6	and the proud cannot hide from you.
PSA.138.7	When I am surrounded by troubles,
PSA.138.7	you keep me safe.
PSA.138.7	You oppose my angry enemies
PSA.138.7	and save me by your power.
PSA.138.8	You will do everything you have promised;
PSA.138.8	Complete the work that you have begun.
PSA.139.2	You know everything I do;
PSA.139.2	from far away you understand all my thoughts.
PSA.139.3	You see me, whether I am working or resting;
PSA.139.3	you know all my actions.
PSA.139.4	Even before I speak,
PSA.139.4	you already know what I will say.
PSA.139.5	You are all around me on every side;
PSA.139.5	you protect me with your power.
PSA.139.6	Your knowledge of me is too deep;
PSA.139.6	it is beyond my understanding.
PSA.139.7	Where could I go to escape from you?
PSA.139.7	Where could I get away from your presence?
PSA.139.8	If I went up to heaven, you would be there;
PSA.139.8	if I lay down in the world of the dead, you would be there.
PSA.139.9	If I flew away beyond the east
PSA.139.9	or lived in the farthest place in the west,
PSA.139.10	you would be there to lead me,
PSA.139.10	you would be there to help me.
PSA.139.11	I could ask the darkness to hide me
PSA.139.11	or the light around me to turn into night,
PSA.139.12	but even darkness is not dark for you,
PSA.139.12	and the night is as bright as the day.
PSA.139.12	Darkness and light are the same to you.
PSA.139.13	You created every part of me;
PSA.139.13	you put me together in my mother's womb.
PSA.139.14	I praise you because you are to be feared;
PSA.139.14	all you do is strange and wonderful.
PSA.139.14	I know it with all my heart.
PSA.139.15	When my bones were being formed,
PSA.139.15	carefully put together in my mother's womb,
PSA.139.15	when I was growing there in secret,
PSA.139.15	you knew that I was there—
PSA.139.16	you saw me before I was born.
PSA.139.16	The days allotted to me
PSA.139.16	had all been recorded in your book,
PSA.139.16	before any of them ever began.
PSA.139.17	how many of them there are!
PSA.139.18	If I counted them, they would be more than the grains of sand.
PSA.139.18	When I awake, I am still with you.
PSA.139.19	O God, how I wish you would kill the wicked!
PSA.139.19	How I wish violent people would leave me alone!
PSA.139.20	They say wicked things about you;
PSA.139.20	they speak evil things against your name.
PSA.139.21	O 
PSA.139.21	How I despise those who rebel against you!
PSA.139.22	I hate them with a total hatred;
PSA.139.22	I regard them as my enemies.
PSA.139.23	Examine me, O God, and know my mind;
PSA.139.23	test me, and discover my thoughts.
PSA.139.24	Find out if there is any evil in me
PSA.139.24	and guide me in the everlasting way.
PSA.140.1	Save me, 
PSA.140.1	keep me safe from violent people.
PSA.140.2	They are always plotting evil,
PSA.140.2	always stirring up quarrels.
PSA.140.3	their words are like a cobra's poison.
PSA.140.4	Protect me, 
PSA.140.4	keep me safe from violent people
PSA.140.4	who plot my downfall.
PSA.140.5	The proud have set a trap for me;
PSA.140.5	they have laid their snares,
PSA.140.5	and along the path they have set traps to catch me.
PSA.140.6	I say to the 
PSA.140.6	Hear my cry for help, 
PSA.140.7	My Sovereign 
PSA.140.7	you have protected me in battle.
PSA.140.8	don't let their plots succeed.
PSA.140.9	Don't let my enemies be victorious;
PSA.140.9	make their threats against me fall back on them.
PSA.140.10	May red-hot coals fall on them;
PSA.140.10	may they be thrown into a pit and never get out.
PSA.140.11	May those who accuse others falsely not succeed;
PSA.140.11	may evil overtake violent people and destroy them.
PSA.140.12	and the rights of the needy.
PSA.140.13	The righteous will praise you indeed;
PSA.140.13	they will live in your presence.
PSA.141.1	I call to you, 
PSA.141.1	Listen to me when I call to you.
PSA.141.2	my uplifted hands as an evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	a sentry at the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Keep me from wanting to do wrong
PSA.141.4	and from joining evil people in their wickedness.
PSA.141.4	May I never take part in their feasts.
PSA.141.5	Good people may punish me and rebuke me in kindness,
PSA.141.5	but I will never accept honor from evil people,
PSA.141.5	because I am always praying against their evil deeds.
PSA.141.6	When their rulers are thrown down from rocky cliffs,
PSA.141.6	the people will admit that my words were true.
PSA.141.7	Like wood that is split and chopped into bits,
PSA.141.7	so their bones are scattered at the edge of the grave.
PSA.141.8	But I keep trusting in you, my Sovereign 
PSA.141.8	I seek your protection;
PSA.141.8	don't let me die!
PSA.141.9	Protect me from the traps they have set for me,
PSA.141.9	from the snares of those evildoers.
PSA.141.10	May the wicked fall into their own traps
PSA.141.10	while I go by unharmed.
PSA.142.1	I call to the 
PSA.142.1	I plead with him.
PSA.142.2	I bring him all my complaints;
PSA.142.2	I tell him all my troubles.
PSA.142.3	When I am ready to give up,
PSA.142.3	he knows what I should do.
PSA.142.3	In the path where I walk,
PSA.142.3	my enemies have hidden a trap for me.
PSA.142.4	When I look beside me,
PSA.142.4	I see that there is no one to help me,
PSA.142.4	no one to protect me.
PSA.142.4	No one cares for me.
PSA.142.5	you, 
PSA.142.5	you are all I want in this life.
PSA.142.6	Listen to my cry for help,
PSA.142.6	for I am sunk in despair.
PSA.142.6	Save me from my enemies;
PSA.142.6	they are too strong for me.
PSA.142.7	Set me free from my distress;
PSA.142.7	then in the assembly of your people I will praise you
PSA.142.7	because of your goodness to me.
PSA.143.1	In your righteousness listen to my plea;
PSA.143.1	answer me in your faithfulness!
PSA.143.2	no one is innocent in your sight.
PSA.143.3	My enemies have hunted me down
PSA.143.3	and completely defeated me.
PSA.143.3	They have put me in a dark prison,
PSA.143.3	and I am like those who died long ago.
PSA.143.4	So I am ready to give up;
PSA.143.4	I am in deep despair.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days gone by;
PSA.143.5	I think about all that you have done,
PSA.143.5	I bring to mind all your deeds.
PSA.143.6	I lift up my hands to you in prayer;
PSA.143.6	like dry ground my soul is thirsty for you.
PSA.143.7	Answer me now, 
PSA.143.7	I have lost all hope.
PSA.143.7	Don't hide yourself from me,
PSA.143.7	or I will be among those who go down to the world of the dead.
PSA.143.8	Remind me each morning of your constant love,
PSA.143.8	for I put my trust in you.
PSA.143.8	My prayers go up to you;
PSA.143.8	show me the way I should go.
PSA.143.9	I go to you for protection, 
PSA.143.9	rescue me from my enemies.
PSA.143.10	You are my God;
PSA.143.10	teach me to do your will.
PSA.143.10	Be good to me, and guide me on a safe path.
PSA.143.11	Rescue me, 
PSA.143.11	in your goodness save me from my troubles!
PSA.143.12	Because of your love for me, kill my enemies
PSA.143.12	and destroy all my oppressors,
PSA.143.12	for I am your servant.

PSA.144.7	pull me out of the deep water, and rescue me;
PSA.144.7	save me from the power of foreigners,
PSA.144.8	who never tell the truth
PSA.144.8	and lie even under oath.
PSA.144.9	I will sing you a new song, O God;
PSA.144.9	I will play the harp and sing to you.

PRO.1.2	Here are proverbs that will help you recognize wisdom and good advice, and understand sayings with deep meaning. 
PRO.1.3	They can teach you how to live intelligently and how to be honest, just, and fair. 
PRO.1.4	They can make an inexperienced person clever and teach young people how to be resourceful. 
PRO.1.5	These proverbs can even add to the knowledge of the wise and give guidance to the educated, 
PRO.1.6	so that they can understand the hidden meanings of proverbs and the problems that the wise raise.
PRO.1.8	My child, pay attention to what your father and mother tell you. 
PRO.1.9	Their teaching will improve your character as a handsome turban or a necklace improves your appearance.
PRO.1.10	My child, when sinners tempt you, don't give in. 
PRO.1.11	Suppose they say, “Come on; let's find someone to kill! Let's attack some innocent people for the fun of it! 
PRO.1.12	They may be alive and well when we find them, but they'll be dead when we're through with them! 
PRO.1.13	We'll find all kinds of riches and fill our houses with loot! 
PRO.1.14	Come and join us, and we'll all share what we steal.”
PRO.1.15	My child, don't go with people like that. Stay away from them. 
PRO.1.16	They can't wait to do something bad. They're always ready to kill. 
PRO.1.17	It does no good to spread a net when the bird you want to catch is watching, 
PRO.1.18	but people like that are setting a trap for themselves, a trap in which they will die. 
PRO.1.19	Robbery always claims the life of the robber—this is what happens to
PRO.1.21	calling loudly at the city gates and wherever people come together:
PRO.1.22	“Foolish people! How long do you want to be foolish? How long will you enjoy making fun of knowledge? Will you never learn? 
PRO.1.23	Listen when I reprimand you; I will give you good advice and share my knowledge with you. 
PRO.1.24	I have been calling you, inviting you to come, but you would not listen. You paid no attention to me. 
PRO.1.25	You have ignored all my advice and have not been willing to let me correct you. 
PRO.1.26	So when you get into trouble, I will laugh at you. I will make fun of you when terror strikes— 
PRO.1.27	when it comes on you like a storm, bringing fierce winds of trouble, and you are in pain and misery. 
PRO.1.28	Then you will call for wisdom, but I will not answer. You may look for me everywhere, but you will not find me. 
PRO.1.29	You have never had any use for knowledge and have always refused to obey the 
PRO.1.30	You have never wanted my advice or paid any attention when I corrected you. 
PRO.1.31	So then, you will get what you deserve, and your own actions will make you sick. 
PRO.1.32	Inexperienced people die because they reject wisdom. Stupid people are destroyed by their own lack of concern. 
PRO.1.33	But whoever listens to me will have security. He will be safe, with no reason to be afraid.”
PRO.2.1	My child, learn what I teach you and never forget what I tell you to do. 
PRO.2.2	Listen to what is wise and try to understand it. 
PRO.2.3	Yes, beg for knowledge; plead for insight. 
PRO.2.4	Look for it as hard as you would for silver or some hidden treasure. 
PRO.2.5	If you do, you will know what it means to fear the 
PRO.2.6	 It is the 
PRO.2.7	He provides help and protection for those who are righteous and honest. 
PRO.2.8	He protects those who treat others fairly, and guards those who are devoted to him.
PRO.2.9	If you listen to me, you will know what is right, just, and fair. You will know what you should do. 
PRO.2.10	You will become wise, and your knowledge will give you pleasure. 
PRO.2.11	Your insight and understanding will protect you 
PRO.2.12	and prevent you from doing the wrong thing. They will keep you away from people who stir up trouble by what they say— 
PRO.2.13	those who have abandoned a righteous life to live in the darkness of sin, 
PRO.2.14	those who find pleasure in doing wrong and who enjoy senseless evil, 
PRO.2.15	unreliable people who cannot be trusted.
PRO.2.16	You will be able to resist any immoral woman who tries to seduce you with her smooth talk, 
PRO.2.17	who is faithless to her own husband and forgets her sacred vows. 
PRO.2.18	If you go to her house, you are traveling the road to death. To go there is to approach the world of the dead. 
PRO.2.19	No one who visits her ever comes back. He never returns to the road to life. 
PRO.2.20	So you must follow the example of good people and live a righteous life. 
PRO.2.21	Righteous people—people of integrity—will live in this land of ours. 
PRO.2.22	But God will snatch the wicked from the land and pull sinners out of it like plants from the ground.
PRO.3.1	My child, don't forget what I teach you. Always remember what I tell you to do. 
PRO.3.2	My teaching will give you a long and prosperous life. 
PRO.3.3	Never let go of loyalty and faithfulness. Tie them around your neck; write them on your heart. 
PRO.3.4	 If you do this, both God and people will be pleased with you.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.6	Remember the 
PRO.3.7	 Never let yourself think that you are wiser than you are; simply obey the 
PRO.3.8	If you do, it will be like good medicine, healing your wounds and easing your pains. 
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.10	If you do, your barns will be filled with grain, and you will have too much wine to store it all.
PRO.3.12	 The 
PRO.3.13	Happy is anyone who becomes wise—who comes to have understanding. 
PRO.3.14	There is more profit in it than there is in silver; it is worth more to you than gold. 
PRO.3.15	Wisdom is more valuable than jewels; nothing you could want can compare with it. 
PRO.3.16	Wisdom offers you long life, as well as wealth and honor. 
PRO.3.17	Wisdom can make your life pleasant and lead you safely through it. 
PRO.3.18	Those who become wise are happy; wisdom will give them life.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.19	by his knowledge he set the sky in place.
PRO.3.20	His wisdom caused the rivers to flow
PRO.3.20	and the clouds to give rain to the earth.
PRO.3.21	My child, hold on to your wisdom and insight. Never let them get away from you. 
PRO.3.22	They will provide you with life—a pleasant and happy life. 
PRO.3.23	You can go safely on your way and never even stumble. 
PRO.3.24	You will not be afraid when you go to bed, and you will sleep soundly through the night. 
PRO.3.25	You will not have to worry about sudden disasters, such as come on the wicked like a storm. 
PRO.3.26	The 
PRO.3.28	Never tell your neighbors to wait until tomorrow if you can help them now. 
PRO.3.29	Don't plan anything that will hurt your neighbors; they live beside you, trusting you. 
PRO.3.30	Don't argue with others for no reason when they have never done you any harm. 
PRO.3.31	Don't be jealous of violent people or decide to act as they do, 
PRO.3.32	because the 
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.34	 He has no use for conceited people, but shows favor to those who are humble. 
PRO.3.35	Wise people will gain an honorable reputation, but stupid people will only add to their own disgrace.
PRO.4.1	My children, listen to what your father teaches you. Pay attention, and you will have understanding. 
PRO.4.2	What I am teaching you is good, so remember it all. 
PRO.4.3	When I was only a little boy, my parents' only son, 
PRO.4.4	my father would teach me. He would say, “Remember what I say and never forget it. Do as I tell you, and you will live. 
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom and insight! Do not forget or ignore what I say. 
PRO.4.6	Do not abandon wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will keep you safe. 
PRO.4.7	Getting wisdom is the most important thing you can do. Whatever else you get, get insight. 
PRO.4.8	Love wisdom, and she will make you great. Embrace her,
PRO.4.9	She will be your crowning glory.”
PRO.4.10	Listen to me, my child. Take seriously what I am telling you, and you will live a long life. 
PRO.4.11	I have taught you wisdom and the right way to live. 
PRO.4.12	Nothing will stand in your way if you walk wisely, and you will not stumble when you run. 
PRO.4.13	Always remember what you have learned. Your education is your life—guard it well. 
PRO.4.14	Do not go where evil people go. Do not follow the example of the wicked. 
PRO.4.15	Don't do it! Keep away from evil! Refuse it and go on your way. 
PRO.4.16	Wicked people cannot sleep unless they have done something wrong. They lie awake unless they have hurt someone. 
PRO.4.17	Wickedness and violence are like food and drink to them.
PRO.4.18	The road the righteous travel is like the sunrise, getting brighter and brighter until daylight has come. 
PRO.4.19	The road of the wicked, however, is dark as night. They fall, but cannot see what they have stumbled over.
PRO.4.20	My child, pay attention to what I say. Listen to my words. 
PRO.4.21	Never let them get away from you. Remember them and keep them in your heart. 
PRO.4.22	They will give life and health to anyone who understands them. 
PRO.4.23	Be careful how you think; your life is shaped by your thoughts. 
PRO.4.24	Never say anything that isn't true. Have nothing to do with lies and misleading words. 
PRO.4.25	Look straight ahead with honest confidence; don't hang your head in shame. 
PRO.4.26	 Plan carefully what you do, and whatever you do will turn out right. 
PRO.4.27	Avoid evil and walk straight ahead. Don't go one step off the right way.
PRO.5.1	My child, pay attention and listen to my wisdom and insight. 
PRO.5.2	Then you will know how to behave properly, and your words will show that you have knowledge. 
PRO.5.3	The lips of another man's wife may be as sweet as honey and her kisses as smooth as olive oil, 
PRO.5.4	but when it is all over, she leaves you nothing but bitterness and pain. 
PRO.5.5	She will take you down to the world of the dead; the road she walks is the road to death. 
PRO.5.6	She does not stay on the road to life; but wanders off, and does not realize what is happening.
PRO.5.7	Now listen to me, sons, and never forget what I am saying. 
PRO.5.8	Keep away from such a woman! Don't even go near her door! 
PRO.5.9	If you do, others will gain the respect that you once had, and you will die young at the hands of merciless people. 
PRO.5.10	Yes, strangers will take all your wealth, and what you have worked for will belong to someone else. 
PRO.5.11	You will lie groaning on your deathbed, your flesh and muscles being eaten away, 
PRO.5.12	and you will say, “Why would I never learn? Why would I never let anyone correct me? 
PRO.5.13	I wouldn't listen to my teachers. I paid no attention to them. 
PRO.5.14	And suddenly I found myself
PRO.5.15	Be faithful to your own wife and give your love to her alone. 
PRO.5.16	Children that you have by other women will do you no good. 
PRO.5.17	Your children should grow up to help you, not strangers. 
PRO.5.18	So be happy with your wife and find your joy with the woman you married— 
PRO.5.19	pretty and graceful as a deer. Let her charms keep you happy; let her surround you with her love. 
PRO.5.20	Son, why should you give your love to another woman? Why should you prefer the charms of another man's wife? 
PRO.5.21	The 
PRO.5.22	The sins of the wicked are a trap. They get caught in the net of their own sin. 
PRO.5.23	They die because they have no self-control. Their utter stupidity will send them to their graves.
PRO.6.2	Have you been caught by your own words, trapped by your own promises? 
PRO.6.3	Well then, my child, you are in that person's power, but this is how to get out of it: hurry to him, and beg him to release you. 
PRO.6.4	Don't let yourself go to sleep or even stop to rest. 
PRO.6.5	Get out of the trap like a bird or a deer escaping from a hunter.
PRO.6.6	Lazy people should learn a lesson from the way ants live. 
PRO.6.7	They have no leader, chief, or ruler, 
PRO.6.8	but they store up their food during the summer, getting ready for winter. 
PRO.6.9	How long is the lazy man going to lie around? When is he ever going to get up? 
PRO.6.10	 “I'll just take a short nap,” he says; “I'll fold my hands and rest a while.” 
PRO.6.11	But while he sleeps, poverty will attack him like an armed robber.
PRO.6.12	Worthless, wicked people go around telling lies. 
PRO.6.13	 They wink and make gestures to deceive you, 
PRO.6.14	all the while planning evil in their perverted minds, stirring up trouble everywhere. 
PRO.6.15	Because of this, disaster will strike them without warning, and they will be fatally wounded.
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	There are seven things that the 
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	A proud look,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	a lying tongue,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	hands that kill innocent people,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	a mind that thinks up wicked plans,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	feet that hurry off to do evil,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	a witness who tells one lie after another,
PRO.6.16+PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	and someone who stirs up trouble among friends.
PRO.6.20	Son, do what your father tells you and never forget what your mother taught you. 
PRO.6.21	Keep their words with you always, locked in your heart. 
PRO.6.22	Their teaching will lead you when you travel, protect you at night, and advise you during the day. 
PRO.6.23	Their instructions are a shining light; their correction can teach you how to live. 
PRO.6.24	It can keep you away from bad women, from the seductive words of other men's wives. 
PRO.6.25	Don't be tempted by their beauty; don't be trapped by their flirting eyes. 
PRO.6.26	A man can hire a prostitute for the price of a loaf of bread, but adultery will cost him all he has.
PRO.6.27	Can you carry fire against your chest without burning your clothes? 
PRO.6.28	Can you walk on hot coals without burning your feet? 
PRO.6.29	It is just as dangerous to sleep with another man's wife. Whoever does it will suffer. 
PRO.6.30	People don't despise a thief if he steals food when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	yet if he is caught, he must pay back seven times more—he must give up everything he has. 
PRO.6.32	But a man who commits adultery doesn't have any sense. He is just destroying himself. 
PRO.6.33	He will be dishonored and beaten up; he will be permanently disgraced. 
PRO.6.34	A husband is never angrier than when he is jealous; his revenge knows no limits. 
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any payment; no amount of gifts will satisfy his anger.
PRO.7.1	My child, remember what I say and never forget what I tell you to do. 
PRO.7.2	Do what I say, and you will live. Be as careful to follow my teaching as you are to protect your eyes. 
PRO.7.3	Keep my teaching with you all the time; write it on your heart. 
PRO.7.4	Treat wisdom as your sister, and insight as your closest friend. 
PRO.7.5	They will keep you away from other men's wives, from women with seductive words.
PRO.7.6	Once I was looking out the window of my house, 
PRO.7.7	and I saw many inexperienced young men, but noticed one foolish fellow in particular. 
PRO.7.8	He was walking along the street near the corner where a certain woman lived. He was passing near her house 
PRO.7.9	in the evening after it was dark. 
PRO.7.10	And then she met him; she was dressed like a prostitute and was making plans. 
PRO.7.11	She was a bold and shameless woman who always walked the streets 
PRO.7.12	or stood waiting at a corner, sometimes in the streets, sometimes in the marketplace. 
PRO.7.13	She threw her arms around the young man, kissed him, looked him straight in the eye, and said, 
PRO.7.14	“I made my offerings today and have the meat from the sacrifices. 
PRO.7.15	So I came out looking for you. I wanted to find you, and here you are! 
PRO.7.16	I've covered my bed with sheets of colored linen from Egypt. 
PRO.7.17	I've perfumed it with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
PRO.7.18	Come on! Let's make love all night long. We'll be happy in each other's arms. 
PRO.7.19	My husband isn't at home. He's on a long trip. 
PRO.7.20	He took plenty of money with him and won't be back for two weeks.” 
PRO.7.21	So she tempted him with her charms, and he gave in to her smooth talk. 
PRO.7.22	Suddenly he was going with her like an ox on the way to be slaughtered, like a deer prancing into a trap
PRO.7.23	where an arrow would pierce its heart. He was like a bird going into a net—he did not know that his life was in danger.
PRO.7.24	Now then, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to what I say. 
PRO.7.25	Do not let such a woman win your heart; don't go wandering after her. 
PRO.7.26	She has been the ruin of many men and caused the death of too many to count. 
PRO.7.27	If you go to her house, you are on the way to the world of the dead. It is a shortcut to death.
PRO.8.1	Reason is making herself heard.
PRO.8.2	On the hilltops near the road
PRO.8.2	and at the crossroads she stands.
PRO.8.3	At the entrance to the city,
PRO.8.3	beside the gates, she calls:
PRO.8.4	“I appeal to all of you;
PRO.8.4	I call to everyone on earth.
PRO.8.5	Are you immature? Learn to be mature.
PRO.8.5	Are you foolish? Learn to have sense.
PRO.8.6	Listen to my excellent words;
PRO.8.6	all I tell you is right.
PRO.8.7	What I say is the truth;
PRO.8.7	lies are hateful to me.
PRO.8.8	Everything I say is true;
PRO.8.8	nothing is false or misleading.
PRO.8.9	To those with insight, it is all clear;
PRO.8.9	to the well-informed, it is all plain.
PRO.8.10	Choose my instruction instead of silver;
PRO.8.10	choose knowledge rather than the finest gold.
PRO.8.11	nothing you want can compare with me.
PRO.8.12	I am Wisdom, and I have insight;
PRO.8.12	I have knowledge and sound judgment.
PRO.8.13	To honor the 
PRO.8.13	I hate pride and arrogance,
PRO.8.13	evil ways and false words.
PRO.8.14	I make plans and carry them out.
PRO.8.14	I have understanding, and I am strong.
PRO.8.15	I help kings to govern
PRO.8.15	and rulers to make good laws.
PRO.8.16	Every ruler on earth governs with my help,
PRO.8.16	officials and nobles alike.
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me;
PRO.8.17	whoever looks for me can find me.
PRO.8.18	I have riches and honor to give,
PRO.8.18	prosperity and success.
PRO.8.19	What you get from me is better than the finest gold,
PRO.8.19	better than the purest silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk the way of righteousness;
PRO.8.20	I follow the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	giving wealth to those who love me,
PRO.8.21	filling their houses with treasures.
PRO.8.22	the first of his works, long ago.
PRO.8.23	I was made in the very beginning,
PRO.8.23	at the first, before the world began.
PRO.8.24	I was born before the oceans,
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs of water.
PRO.8.25	I was born before the mountains,
PRO.8.25	before the hills were set in place,
PRO.8.26	before God made the earth and its fields
PRO.8.26	or even the first handful of soil.
PRO.8.27	when he stretched the horizon across the ocean,
PRO.8.28	when he placed the clouds in the sky,
PRO.8.28	when he opened the springs of the ocean
PRO.8.29	and ordered the waters of the sea
PRO.8.29	to rise no further than he said.
PRO.8.29	I was there when he laid the earth's foundations.
PRO.8.30	I was beside him like an architect,
PRO.8.30	I was his daily source of joy,
PRO.8.30	always happy in his presence—
PRO.8.31	happy with the world
PRO.8.31	and pleased with the human race.
PRO.8.32	Do as I say, and you will be happy.
PRO.8.33	Listen to what you are taught.
PRO.8.33	Be wise; do not neglect it.
PRO.8.34	Those who listen to me will be happy—
PRO.8.34	those who stay at my door every day,
PRO.8.34	waiting at the entrance to my home.
PRO.8.35	Those who find me find life,
PRO.8.35	and the 
PRO.8.36	Those who do not find me hurt themselves;
PRO.8.36	anyone who hates me loves death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house and made seven columns for it. 
PRO.9.2	She has had an animal killed for a feast, mixed spices in the wine, and set the table. 
PRO.9.3	She has sent her servant women to call out from the highest place in town: 
PRO.9.4	“Come in, ignorant people!” And to the foolish she says, 
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat my food and drink the wine that I have mixed. 
PRO.9.6	Leave the company of ignorant people, and live. Follow the way of knowledge.”
PRO.9.7	If you correct conceited people, you will only be insulted. If you reprimand evil people, you will only get hurt. 
PRO.9.8	Never correct conceited people; they will hate you for it. But if you correct the wise, they will respect you. 
PRO.9.9	Anything you say to the wise will make them wiser. Whatever you tell the righteous will add to their knowledge.
PRO.9.11	Wisdom will add years to your life. 
PRO.9.12	You are the one who will profit if you have wisdom, and if you reject it, you are the one who will suffer.
PRO.9.13	Stupidity is like a loud, ignorant, shameless woman.
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house or on a seat in the highest part of town, 
PRO.9.15	and calls out to people passing by, who are minding their own business: 
PRO.9.16	“Come in, ignorant people!” To the foolish she says, 
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweeter. Stolen bread tastes better.” 
PRO.9.18	Her victims do not know that the people die who go to her house, that those who have already entered are now deep in the world of the dead.
PRO.10.1	These are Solomon's proverbs:
PRO.10.1	Wise children make their fathers proud of them; foolish ones bring their mothers grief.
PRO.10.2	Wealth you get by dishonesty will do you no good, but honesty can save your life.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.4	Being lazy will make you poor, but hard work will make you rich.
PRO.10.5	A sensible person gathers the crops when they are ready; it is a disgrace to sleep through the time of harvest.

PRO.10.7	Good people will be remembered as a blessing, but the wicked will soon be forgotten.
PRO.10.8	Sensible people accept good advice. People who talk foolishly will come to ruin.
PRO.10.9	Honest people are safe and secure, but the dishonest will be caught.
PRO.10.10	Someone who holds back the truth causes trouble, but one who openly criticizes works for peace.
PRO.10.11	A good person's words are a fountain of life, but a wicked person's words hide a violent nature.
PRO.10.13	Intelligent people talk sense, but stupid people need to be punished.
PRO.10.14	The wise get all the knowledge they can, but when fools speak, trouble is not far off.
PRO.10.15	Wealth protects the rich; poverty destroys the poor.
PRO.10.16	The reward for doing good is life, but sin leads only to more sin.
PRO.10.17	People who listen when they are corrected will live, but those who will not admit that they are wrong are in danger.
PRO.10.18	Anyone who hides hatred is a liar. Anyone who spreads gossip is a fool.
PRO.10.19	The more you talk, the more likely you are to sin. If you are wise, you will keep quiet.
PRO.10.20	A good person's words are like pure silver; a wicked person's ideas are worthless.
PRO.10.21	A good person's words will benefit many people, but you can kill yourself with stupidity.
PRO.10.22	It is the 
PRO.10.23	It is foolish to enjoy doing wrong. Intelligent people take pleasure in wisdom.
PRO.10.24	The righteous get what they want, but the wicked will get what they fear most.
PRO.10.25	Storms come, and the wicked are blown away, but honest people are always safe.
PRO.10.26	Never get a lazy person to do something for you; he will be as irritating as vinegar on your teeth or smoke in your eyes.
PRO.10.27	Obey the 
PRO.10.28	The hopes of good people lead to joy, but wicked people can look forward to nothing.
PRO.10.29	The 
PRO.10.30	Righteous people will always have security, but the wicked will not survive in the land.
PRO.10.31	Righteous people speak wisdom, but the tongue that speaks evil will be stopped.
PRO.10.32	Righteous people know the kind thing to say, but the wicked are always saying things that hurt.
PRO.11.1	The 
PRO.11.2	People who are proud will soon be disgraced. It is wiser to be modest.
PRO.11.3	If you are good, you are guided by honesty. People who can't be trusted are destroyed by their own dishonesty.
PRO.11.4	Riches will do you no good on the day you face death, but honesty can save your life.
PRO.11.5	Honesty makes a good person's life easier, but the wicked will cause their own downfall.
PRO.11.6	Righteousness rescues those who are honest, but those who can't be trusted are trapped by their own greed.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked die, their hope dies with them. Confidence placed in riches comes to nothing.
PRO.11.8	The righteous are protected from trouble; it comes to the wicked instead.
PRO.11.9	You can be ruined by the talk of godless people, but the wisdom of the righteous can save you.
PRO.11.10	A city is happy when honest people have good fortune, and there are joyful shouts when the wicked die.
PRO.11.11	A city becomes great when the righteous give it their blessing; but a city is brought to ruin by the words of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	It is foolish to speak scornfully of others. If you are smart, you will keep quiet.
PRO.11.13	No one who gossips can be trusted with a secret, but you can put confidence in someone who is trustworthy.
PRO.11.15	If you promise to pay a stranger's debt, you will regret it. You are better off if you don't get involved.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman is respected, but a woman without virtue is a disgrace.
PRO.11.16	Lazy people will never have money,
PRO.11.17	You do yourself a favor when you are kind. If you are cruel, you only hurt yourself.
PRO.11.18	Wicked people do not really gain anything, but if you do what is right, you are certain to be rewarded.
PRO.11.19	Anyone who is determined to do right will live, but anyone who insists on doing wrong will die.
PRO.11.20	The 
PRO.11.21	You can be sure that evil people will be punished, but the righteous will escape.
PRO.11.22	Beauty in a woman without good judgment is like a gold ring in a pig's snout.
PRO.11.23	What good people want always results in good; when the wicked get what they want, everyone is angry.
PRO.11.24	Some people spend their money freely and still grow richer. Others are cautious, and yet grow poorer.
PRO.11.25	Be generous, and you will be prosperous. Help others, and you will be helped.
PRO.11.26	People curse someone who hoards grain, waiting for a higher price, but they praise the one who puts it up for sale.
PRO.11.27	If your goals are good, you will be respected, but if you are looking for trouble, that is what you will get.
PRO.11.28	Those who depend on their wealth will fall like the leaves of autumn, but the righteous will prosper like the leaves of summer.
PRO.11.29	Those who bring trouble on their families will have nothing at the end.
PRO.11.29	Foolish people will always be servants to the wise.
PRO.11.30	Righteousness
PRO.12.2	The 
PRO.12.3	Wickedness does not give security, but righteous people stand firm.
PRO.12.4	A good wife is her husband's pride and joy; but a wife who brings shame on her husband is like a cancer in his bones.
PRO.12.5	Honest people will treat you fairly; the wicked only want to deceive you.
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked are murderous, but the words of the righteous rescue those who are threatened.
PRO.12.7	The wicked meet their downfall and leave no descendants, but the families of the righteous live on.
PRO.12.8	If you are intelligent, you will be praised; if you are stupid, people will look down on you.
PRO.12.9	It is better to be an ordinary person working for a living than to play the part of someone great but go hungry.
PRO.12.10	Good people take care of their animals, but wicked people are cruel to theirs.

PRO.12.14	Your reward depends on what you say and what you do; you will get what you deserve.
PRO.12.15	Stupid people always think they are right. Wise people listen to advice.
PRO.12.16	When a fool is annoyed, he quickly lets it be known. Smart people will ignore an insult.
PRO.12.17	When you tell the truth, justice is done, but lies lead to injustice.
PRO.12.18	Thoughtless words can wound as deeply as any sword, but wisely spoken words can heal.
PRO.12.19	A lie has a short life, but truth lives on forever.

PRO.13.1	Wise children pay attention when their parents correct them, but arrogant people never admit they are wrong.
PRO.13.2	Good people will be rewarded for what they say, but those who are deceitful are hungry for violence.
PRO.13.4	No matter how much a lazy person may want something, he will never get it. A hard worker will get everything he wants.
PRO.13.5	Honest people hate lies, but the words of wicked people are shameful and disgraceful.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness protects the innocent; wickedness is the downfall of sinners.
PRO.13.7	Some people pretend to be rich, but have nothing. Others pretend to be poor, but own a fortune.
PRO.13.8	The rich have to use their money to save their lives, but no one threatens the poor.
PRO.13.9	The righteous are like a light shining brightly; the wicked are like a lamp flickering out.
PRO.13.10	Arrogance causes nothing but trouble. It is wiser to ask for advice.

PRO.13.21	Trouble follows sinners everywhere, but righteous people will be rewarded with good things.
PRO.13.22	Good people will have wealth to leave to their grandchildren, but the wealth of sinners will go to the righteous.
PRO.13.23	Unused fields could yield plenty of food for the poor, but unjust people keep them from being farmed.
PRO.13.24	If you don't punish your children, you don't love them. If you do love them, you will correct them.

PRO.21.25	Lazy people who refuse to work are only killing themselves; 
PRO.21.26	all they do is think about what they would like to have. The righteous, however, can give, and give generously.
PRO.21.28	The testimony of a liar is not believed, but the word of someone who thinks matters through is accepted.
PRO.21.29	Righteous people are sure of themselves; the wicked have to pretend as best they can.

PRO.22.13	Lazy people stay at home; they say a lion might get them if they go outside.
PRO.22.14	Adultery is a trap—it catches those with whom the 
PRO.22.15	Children just naturally do silly, careless things, but a good spanking will teach them how to behave.
PRO.22.16	If you make gifts to rich people or oppress the poor to get rich, you will become poor yourself.

PRO.23.6	Don't eat at the table of a stingy person or be greedy for the fine food he serves.

PRO.24.22	such people could be ruined in a moment. Do you realize the disaster that God or the king can cause?
PRO.24.23	The wise have also said these things:
PRO.24.23	It is wrong for judges to be prejudiced. 
PRO.24.24	If they pronounce a guilty person innocent, they will be cursed and hated by everyone. 
PRO.24.25	Judges who punish the guilty, however, will be prosperous and enjoy a good reputation.
PRO.24.26	An honest answer is a sign of true friendship.
PRO.24.27	Don't build your house and establish a home until your fields are ready, and you are sure that you can earn a living.
PRO.24.28	Don't give evidence against others without good reason, or say misleading things about them. 
PRO.24.29	Don't say, “I'll do to them just what they did to me! I'll get even with them!”
PRO.24.30	I walked through the fields and vineyards of a lazy, stupid person. 
PRO.24.31	They were full of thorn bushes and overgrown with weeds. The stone wall around them had fallen down. 
PRO.24.32	I looked at this, thought about it, and learned a lesson from it: 
PRO.24.33	 Go ahead and take your nap; go ahead and sleep. Fold your hands and rest awhile, 
PRO.24.34	but while you are asleep, poverty will attack you like an armed robber.
PRO.25.1	Here are more of Solomon's proverbs, copied by scribes at the court of King Hezekiah of Judah.
PRO.25.2	We honor God for what he conceals; we honor kings for what they explain.
PRO.25.3	You never know what a king is thinking; his thoughts are beyond us, like the heights of the sky or the depths of the ocean.
PRO.25.4	Take the impurities out of silver and the artist can produce a thing of beauty. 
PRO.25.5	Keep evil advisers away from the king and his government will be known for its justice.
PRO.25.7	It is better to be asked to take a higher position than to be told to give your place to someone more important.
PRO.25.8	Don't be too quick to go to court about something you have seen. If another witness later proves you wrong, what will you do then?
PRO.25.9	If you and your neighbor have a difference of opinion, settle it between yourselves and do not reveal any secrets. 
PRO.25.10	Otherwise everyone will learn that you can't keep a secret, and you will never live down the shame.
PRO.25.11	An idea well-expressed is like a design of gold, set in silver.
PRO.25.12	A warning given by an experienced person to someone willing to listen is more valuable than gold rings or jewelry made of the finest gold.
PRO.25.13	A reliable messenger is refreshing to the one who sends him, like cold water in the heat of harvest time.
PRO.25.14	People who promise things that they never give are like clouds and wind that bring no rain.
PRO.25.15	Patient persuasion can break down the strongest resistance and can even convince rulers.
PRO.25.16	Never eat more honey than you need; too much may make you vomit. 
PRO.25.17	Don't visit your neighbors too often; they may get tired of you and come to hate you.
PRO.25.18	A false accusation is as deadly as a sword, a club, or a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Depending on an unreliable person in a crisis is like trying to chew with a loose tooth or walk with a crippled foot.
PRO.25.20	Singing to a person who is depressed is like taking off a person's clothes on a cold day or like rubbing salt in a wound.
PRO.25.22	You will make them burn with shame, and the 
PRO.25.23	Gossip brings anger just as surely as the north wind brings rain.
PRO.25.24	Better to live on the roof than share the house with a nagging wife.
PRO.25.25	Finally hearing good news from a distant land is like a drink of cold water when you are dry and thirsty.
PRO.25.26	A good person who gives in to someone who is evil reminds you of a polluted spring or a poisoned well.
PRO.25.27	Too much honey is bad for you, and so is trying to win too much praise.
PRO.25.28	If you cannot control your anger, you are as helpless as a city without walls, open to attack.
PRO.26.1	Praise for a fool is out of place, like snow in summer or rain at harvest time.
PRO.26.2	Curses cannot hurt you unless you deserve them. They are like birds that fly by and never light.
PRO.26.3	You have to whip a horse, you have to bridle a donkey, and you have to beat a fool.
PRO.26.4	If you answer a silly question, you are just as silly as the person who asked it.
PRO.26.5	Give a silly answer to a silly question, and the one who asked it will realize that he's not as smart as he thinks.
PRO.26.6	If you let a fool deliver a message, you might as well cut off your own feet; you are asking for trouble.
PRO.26.7	A fool can use a proverb about as well as crippled people can use their legs.
PRO.26.8	Praising someone who is stupid makes as much sense as tying a stone in a sling.
PRO.26.9	A fool quoting a wise saying reminds you of a drunk trying to pick a thorn out of his hand.
PRO.26.10	An employer who hires any fool that comes along is only hurting everybody concerned.
PRO.26.12	The most stupid fool is better off than those who think they are wise when they are not.
PRO.26.13	Why don't lazy people ever get out of the house? What are they afraid of Lions?
PRO.26.14	Lazy people turn over in bed. They get no farther than a door swinging on its hinges.
PRO.26.15	Some people are too lazy to put food in their own mouths.
PRO.26.16	A lazy person will think he is smarter than seven men who can give good reasons for their opinions.
PRO.26.17	Getting involved in an argument that is none of your business is like going down the street and grabbing a dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	Someone who tricks someone else and then claims that he was only joking is like a crazy person playing with a deadly weapon.
PRO.26.20	Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, quarreling stops.
PRO.26.21	Charcoal keeps the embers glowing, wood keeps the fire burning, and troublemakers keep arguments alive.
PRO.26.22	Gossip is so tasty! How we love to swallow it!
PRO.26.23	Insincere
PRO.26.24	A hypocrite hides hate behind flattering words. 
PRO.26.25	They may sound fine, but don't believe him, because his heart is filled to the brim with hate. 
PRO.26.26	He may disguise his hatred, but everyone will see the evil things he does.
PRO.26.28	You have to hate someone to want to hurt him with lies. Insincere talk brings nothing but ruin.
PRO.27.2	Let other people praise you—even strangers; never do it yourself.
PRO.27.3	The weight of stone and sand is nothing compared to the trouble that stupidity can cause.
PRO.27.4	Anger is cruel and destructive, but it is nothing compared to jealousy.
PRO.27.5	Better to correct someone openly than to let him think you don't care for him at all.
PRO.27.6	Friends mean well, even when they hurt you. But when an enemy puts his arm around your shoulder—watch out!
PRO.27.7	When you are full, you will refuse honey, but when you are hungry, even bitter food tastes sweet.
PRO.27.8	Anyone away from home is like a bird away from its nest.
PRO.27.9	Perfume and fragrant oils make you feel happier, but trouble shatters your peace of mind.
PRO.27.10	Do not forget your friends or your father's friends. If you are in trouble, don't ask a relative for help; a nearby neighbor can help you more than relatives who are far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my child, and I will be happy; I will have an answer for anyone who criticizes me.
PRO.27.12	Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it, but an unthinking person will walk right into it and regret it later.
PRO.27.13	Any people stupid enough to promise to be responsible for a stranger's debts
PRO.27.14	You might as well curse your friends as wake them up early in the morning with a loud greeting.
PRO.27.15	A nagging wife is like water going drip-drip-drip on a rainy day. 
PRO.27.16	How can you keep her quiet? Have you ever tried to stop the wind or ever tried to hold a handful of oil?
PRO.27.17	People learn from one another, just as iron sharpens iron.
PRO.27.18	Take care of a fig tree and you will have figs to eat. Servants who take care of their master will be honored.
PRO.27.19	It is your own face that you see reflected in the water and it is your own self that you see in your heart.
PRO.27.20	Human desires are like the world of the dead—there is always room for more.
PRO.27.21	Fire tests gold and silver; a person's reputation can also be tested.
PRO.27.22	Even if you beat fools half to death, you still can't beat their foolishness out of them.
PRO.27.23	Look after your sheep and cattle as carefully as you can, 
PRO.27.24	because wealth is not permanent. Not even nations last forever. 
PRO.27.25	You cut the hay and then cut the grass on the hillsides while the next crop of hay is growing. 
PRO.27.26	You can make clothes from the wool of your sheep and buy land with the money you get from selling some of your goats. 
PRO.27.27	The rest of the goats will provide milk for you and your family, and for your servant women as well.
PRO.28.1	The wicked run when no one is chasing them, but an honest person is as brave as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a nation sins, it will have one ruler after another. But a nation will be strong and endure when it has intelligent, sensible leaders.
PRO.28.3	Someone in authority who oppresses poor people is like a driving rain that destroys the crops.
PRO.28.4	If you have no regard for the law, you are on the side of the wicked; but if you obey it, you are against them.
PRO.28.5	Evil people do not know what justice is, but those who worship the 
PRO.28.6	Better to be poor and honest than rich and dishonest.
PRO.28.7	Young people who obey the law are intelligent. Those who make friends with good-for-nothings are a disgrace to their parents.
PRO.28.8	If you get rich by charging interest and taking advantage of people, your wealth will go to someone who is kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	If you do not obey the law, God will find your prayers too hateful to hear.
PRO.28.10	If you trick an honest person into doing evil, you will fall into your own trap.
PRO.28.10	The innocent will be well rewarded.
PRO.28.11	Rich people always think they are wise, but a poor person who has insight into character knows better.
PRO.28.12	When good people come to power, everybody celebrates, but when bad people rule, people stay in hiding.
PRO.28.13	You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you.
PRO.28.14	Always obey the 
PRO.28.15	Poor people are helpless against a wicked ruler; he is as dangerous as a growling lion or a prowling bear.
PRO.28.16	A ruler without good sense will be a cruel tyrant. One who hates dishonesty will rule a long time.
PRO.28.17	Someone guilty of murder is digging his own grave as fast as he can. Don't try to stop him.
PRO.28.18	Be honest and you will be safe. If you are dishonest, you will suddenly fall.
PRO.28.19	A hard-working farmer has plenty to eat. People who waste time will always be poor.
PRO.28.20	Honest people will lead a full, happy life. But if you are in a hurry to get rich, you are going to be punished.
PRO.28.21	Prejudice is wrong. But some judges will do wrong to get even the smallest bribe.
PRO.28.22	Selfish people are in such a hurry to get rich that they do not know when poverty is about to strike.
PRO.28.23	Correct someone, and afterward he will appreciate it more than flattery.
PRO.28.24	Anyone who thinks it isn't wrong to steal from his parents is no better than a common thief.
PRO.28.25	Selfishness only causes trouble. You are much better off to trust the 
PRO.28.26	It is foolish to follow your own opinions. Be safe, and follow the teachings of wiser people.
PRO.28.27	Give to the poor and you will never be in need. If you close your eyes to the poor, many people will curse you.
PRO.28.28	People stay in hiding when the wicked come to power. But when they fall from power, the righteous will rule again.
PRO.29.1	If you get more stubborn every time you are corrected, one day you will be crushed and never recover.
PRO.29.2	Show me a righteous ruler and I will show you a happy people. Show me a wicked ruler and I will show you a miserable people.
PRO.29.3	If you appreciate wisdom, your parents will be proud of you.
PRO.29.3	It is a foolish waste to spend money on prostitutes.
PRO.29.4	When the king is concerned with justice, the nation will be strong, but when he is only concerned with money, he will ruin his country.
PRO.29.5	If you flatter your friends, you set a trap for yourself.
PRO.29.6	Evil people are trapped in their own sins, while honest people are happy and free.
PRO.29.7	A good person knows the rights of the poor, but wicked people cannot understand such things.
PRO.29.8	People with no regard for others can throw whole cities into turmoil. Those who are wise keep things calm.
PRO.29.9	When an intelligent person brings a lawsuit against a fool, the fool only laughs and becomes loud and abusive.
PRO.29.10	Bloodthirsty people hate anyone who's honest, but righteous people will protect
PRO.29.11	Stupid people express their anger openly, but sensible people are patient and hold it back.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler pays attention to false information, all his officials will be liars.
PRO.29.13	A poor person and his oppressor have this in common—the 
PRO.29.14	If a king defends the rights of the poor, he will rule for a long time.
PRO.29.15	Correction and discipline are good for children. If they have their own way, they will make their mothers ashamed of them.
PRO.29.16	When evil people are in power, crime increases. But the righteous will live to see the downfall of such people.
PRO.29.17	Discipline your children and you can always be proud of them. They will never give you reason to be ashamed.
PRO.29.18	A nation without God's guidance is a nation without order. Happy are those who keep God's law!
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a stupid fool than for someone who speaks without thinking.
PRO.29.21	If you give your servants everything they want from childhood on, some day they will take over everything you own.
PRO.29.22	People with quick tempers cause a lot of quarreling and trouble.
PRO.29.23	Arrogance will bring your downfall, but if you are humble, you will be respected.
PRO.29.24	A thief's partner is his own worst enemy. He will be punished if he tells the truth in court, and God will curse him if he doesn't.
PRO.29.25	It is dangerous to be concerned with what others think of you, but if you trust the 
PRO.29.26	Everybody wants the good will of the ruler, but only from the 
PRO.29.27	The righteous hate the wicked, and the wicked hate the righteous.
PRO.30.1	These are the solemn words of Agur son of Jakeh:
PRO.30.1	“God is not with me, God is not with me,
PRO.30.1	and I am helpless.
PRO.30.2	I am more like an animal than a human being;
PRO.30.2	I do not have the sense we humans should have.
PRO.30.3	I have never learned any wisdom,
PRO.30.3	and I know nothing at all about God.
PRO.30.4	Have any ever mastered heavenly knowledge?
PRO.30.4	Have any ever caught the wind in their hands?
PRO.30.4	Or wrapped up water in a piece of cloth?
PRO.30.4	Or fixed the boundaries of the earth?
PRO.30.4	Who are they, if you know? Who are their children?
PRO.30.5	“God keeps every promise he makes. He is like a shield for all who seek his protection. 
PRO.30.6	If you claim that he said something that he never said, he will reprimand you and show that you are a liar.”
PRO.30.7	I ask you, God, to let me have two things before I die: 
PRO.30.8	keep me from lying, and let me be neither rich nor poor. So give me only as much food as I need. 
PRO.30.9	If I have more, I might say that I do not need you. But if I am poor, I might steal and bring disgrace on my God.
PRO.30.10	Never criticize servants to their master. You will be cursed and suffer for it.
PRO.30.11	There are people who curse their fathers and do not show their appreciation for their mothers.
PRO.30.12	There are people who think they are pure when they are as filthy as they can be.
PRO.30.13	There are people who think they are so good—oh, how good they think they are!
PRO.30.14	There are people who take cruel advantage of the poor and needy; that is the way they make their living.
PRO.30.15	A leech has two daughters, and both are named “Give me!”
PRO.30.15	There are four things that are never satisfied:
PRO.30.16	the world of the dead,
PRO.30.16	a woman without children,
PRO.30.16	dry ground that needs rain,
PRO.30.16	and a fire burning out of control.
PRO.30.17	If you make fun of your father or despise your mother in her old age,
PRO.30.18	There are four things that are too mysterious for me to understand:
PRO.30.19	a snake moving on a rock,
PRO.30.19	a ship finding its way over the sea,
PRO.30.19	and a man and a woman falling in love.
PRO.30.20	This is how an unfaithful wife acts: she commits adultery, takes a bath, and says, “But I haven't done anything wrong!”
PRO.30.21	There are four things that the earth itself cannot tolerate:
PRO.30.22	a slave who becomes a king,
PRO.30.22	a fool who has all he wants to eat,
PRO.30.23	a hateful woman who gets married,
PRO.30.23	and a servant woman who takes the place of her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There are four animals in the world that are small, but very, very clever:
PRO.30.25	Ants: they are weak, but they store up their food in the summer.
PRO.30.26	Rock badgers: they are not strong either, but they make their homes among the rocks.
PRO.30.27	Locusts: they have no king, but they move in formation.
PRO.30.28	Lizards: you can hold one in your hand, but you can find them in palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are four things that are impressive to watch as they walk:
PRO.30.30	lions, strongest of all animals and afraid of none;
PRO.30.31	goats, strutting roosters,
PRO.30.31	and kings in front of their people.
PRO.30.32	If you have been foolish enough to be arrogant and plan evil, stop and think! 
PRO.30.33	If you churn milk, you get butter. If you hit someone's nose, it bleeds. If you stir up anger, you get into trouble.
PRO.31.1	These are the solemn words which King Lemuel's mother said to him:
PRO.31.2	“You are my own dear son, the answer to my prayers. What shall I tell you? 
PRO.31.3	Don't spend all your energy on sex and all your money on women; they have destroyed kings. 
PRO.31.4	Listen, Lemuel. Kings should not drink wine or have a craving for alcohol. 
PRO.31.5	When they drink, they forget the laws and ignore the rights of people in need. 
PRO.31.6	Alcohol is for people who are dying, for those who are in misery. 
PRO.31.7	Let them drink and forget their poverty and unhappiness.
PRO.31.8	“Speak up for people who cannot speak for themselves. Protect the rights of all who are helpless. 
PRO.31.9	Speak for them and be a righteous judge. Protect the rights of the poor and needy.”
PRO.31.10	How hard it is to find a capable wife! She is worth far more than jewels!
PRO.31.11	Her husband puts his confidence in her, and he will never be poor.
PRO.31.12	As long as she lives, she does him good and never harm.
PRO.31.13	She keeps herself busy making wool and linen cloth.
PRO.31.14	She brings home food from out-of-the-way places, as merchant ships do.
PRO.31.15	She gets up before daylight to prepare food for her family and to tell her servant women what to do.
PRO.31.16	She looks at land and buys it, and with money she has earned she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She is a hard worker, strong and industrious.
PRO.31.18	She knows the value of everything she makes, and works late into the night.
PRO.31.19	She spins her own thread and weaves her own cloth.
PRO.31.20	She is generous to the poor and needy.
PRO.31.21	She doesn't worry when it snows, because her family has warm clothing.
PRO.31.22	She makes bedspreads and wears clothes of fine purple linen.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is well known, one of the leading citizens.
PRO.31.24	She makes clothes and belts, and sells them to merchants.
PRO.31.25	She is strong and respected and not afraid of the future.
PRO.31.26	She speaks with a gentle wisdom.
PRO.31.27	She is always busy and looks after her family's needs.
PRO.31.28	Her children show their appreciation, and her husband praises her.
PRO.31.29	He says, “Many women are good wives, but you are the best of them all.”
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceptive and beauty disappears, but a woman who honors the 
PRO.31.31	Give her credit for all she does. She deserves the respect of everyone.
ECC.1.1	These are the words of the Philosopher, David's son, who was king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	It is useless, useless, said the Philosopher. Life is useless, all useless. 
ECC.1.3	You spend your life working, laboring, and what do you have to show for it? 
ECC.1.4	 Generations come and generations go, but the world stays just the same. 
ECC.1.5	The sun still rises, and it still goes down, going wearily back to where it must start all over again. 
ECC.1.6	The wind blows south, the wind blows north—round and round and back again. 
ECC.1.7	Every river flows into the sea, but the sea is not yet full. The water returns to where the rivers began, and starts all over again. 
ECC.1.8	Everything leads to weariness—a weariness too great for words. Our eyes can never see enough to be satisfied; our ears can never hear enough. 
ECC.1.9	What has happened before will happen again. What has been done before will be done again. There is nothing new in the whole world. 
ECC.1.10	“Look,” they say, “here is something new!” But no, it has all happened before, long before we were born. 
ECC.1.11	No one remembers what has happened in the past, and no one in days to come will remember what happens between now and then.
ECC.1.12	I, the Philosopher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	I determined that I would examine and study all the things that are done in this world.
ECC.1.13	God has laid a miserable fate upon us. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen everything done in this world, and I tell you, it is all useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
ECC.1.15	You can't straighten out what is crooked; you can't count things that aren't there.
ECC.1.17	I was determined to learn the difference between knowledge and foolishness, wisdom and madness. But I found out that I might as well be chasing the wind. 
ECC.1.18	The wiser you are, the more worries you have; the more you know, the more it hurts.
ECC.2.1	I decided to enjoy myself and find out what happiness is. But I found that this is useless, too. 
ECC.2.2	I discovered that laughter is foolish, that pleasure does you no good. 
ECC.2.3	Driven on by my desire for wisdom, I decided to cheer myself up with wine and have a good time. I thought that this might be the best way people can spend their short lives on earth.
ECC.2.5	I planted gardens and orchards, with all kinds of fruit trees in them; 
ECC.2.6	I dug ponds to irrigate them. 
ECC.2.7	 I bought many slaves, and there were slaves born in my household. I owned more livestock than anyone else who had ever lived in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	 I also piled up silver and gold from the royal treasuries of the lands I ruled. Men and women sang to entertain me, and I had all the women a man could want.
ECC.2.10	Anything I wanted, I got. I did not deny myself any pleasure. I was proud of everything I had worked for, and all this was my reward. 
ECC.2.11	Then I thought about all that I had done and how hard I had worked doing it, and I realized that it didn't mean a thing. It was like chasing the wind—of no use at all. 
ECC.2.12	After all, a king can only do what previous kings have done.
ECC.2.12	So I started thinking about what it meant to be wise or reckless or foolish. 
ECC.2.13	Oh, I know, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise can see where they are going, and fools cannot.” But I also know that the same fate is waiting for us all. 
ECC.2.15	I thought to myself, “What happens to fools is going to happen to me, too. So what have I gained from being so wise?” “Nothing,” I answered, “not a thing.” 
ECC.2.16	No one remembers the wise, and no one remembers fools. In days to come, we will all be forgotten. We must all die—wise and foolish alike. 
ECC.2.17	So life came to mean nothing to me, because everything in it had brought me nothing but trouble. It had all been useless; I had been chasing the wind.
ECC.2.18	Nothing that I had worked for and earned meant a thing to me, because I knew that I would have to leave it to my successor, 
ECC.2.19	and he might be wise, or he might be foolish—who knows? Yet he will own everything I have worked for, everything my wisdom has earned for me in this world. It is all useless. 
ECC.2.20	So I came to regret that I had worked so hard. 
ECC.2.21	You work for something with all your wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then you have to leave it all to someone who hasn't had to work for it. It is useless, and it isn't right! 
ECC.2.22	You work and worry your way through life, and what do you have to show for it? 
ECC.2.23	 As long as you live, everything you do brings nothing but worry and heartache. Even at night your mind can't rest. It is all useless.
ECC.2.25	How else could you have anything to eat or enjoy yourself at all? 
ECC.2.26	 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness to those who please him, but he makes sinners work, earning and saving, so that what they get can be given to those who please him. It is all useless. It is like chasing the wind.
ECC.3.1	Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses.
ECC.3.2	He sets the time for birth and the time for death,
ECC.3.2	the time for planting and the time for pulling up,
ECC.3.3	the time for killing and the time for healing,
ECC.3.3	the time for tearing down and the time for building.
ECC.3.4	He sets the time for sorrow and the time for joy,
ECC.3.4	the time for mourning and the time for dancing,
ECC.3.5	the time for making love and the time for not making love,
ECC.3.5	the time for kissing and the time for not kissing.
ECC.3.6	He sets the time for finding and the time for losing,
ECC.3.6	the time for saving and the time for throwing away,
ECC.3.7	the time for tearing and the time for mending,
ECC.3.7	the time for silence and the time for talk.
ECC.3.8	He sets the time for love and the time for hate,
ECC.3.8	the time for war and the time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What do we gain from all our work? 
ECC.3.10	I know the heavy burdens that God has laid on us. 
ECC.3.11	He has set the right time for everything. He has given us a desire to know the future, but never gives us the satisfaction of fully understanding what he does. 
ECC.3.12	So I realized that all we can do is be happy and do the best we can while we are still alive. 
ECC.3.13	All of us should eat and drink and enjoy what we have worked for. It is God's gift.
ECC.3.14	I know that everything God does will last forever. You can't add anything to it or take anything away from it. And one thing God does is to make us stand in awe of him. 
ECC.3.15	Whatever happens or can happen has already happened before. God makes the same thing happen again and again.
ECC.3.16	In addition, I have also noticed that in this world you find wickedness where justice and right ought to be. 
ECC.3.17	I told myself, “God is going to judge the righteous and the evil alike, because every thing, every action, will happen at its own set time.”
ECC.3.18	I decided that God is testing us, to show us that we are no better than animals. 
ECC.3.19	After all, the same fate awaits human beings and animals alike. One dies just like the other. They are the same kind of creature. A human being is no better off than an animal, because life has no meaning for either. 
ECC.3.20	They are both going to the same place—the dust. They both came from it; they will both go back to it. 
ECC.3.21	How can anyone be sure that the human spirit goes upward while an animal's spirit goes down into the ground? 
ECC.3.22	So I realized then that the best thing we can do is enjoy what we have worked for. There is nothing else we can do.
ECC.4.1	Then I looked again at all the injustice that goes on in this world. The oppressed were crying, and no one would help them. No one would help them, because their oppressors had power on their side. 
ECC.4.2	I envy those who are dead and gone; they are better off than those who are still alive. 
ECC.4.3	But better off than either are those who have never been born, who have never seen the injustice that goes on in this world.
ECC.4.4	I have also learned why people work so hard to succeed: it is because they envy the things their neighbors have. But it is useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
ECC.4.5	They say that we would be fools to fold our hands and let ourselves starve to death. 
ECC.4.6	Maybe so, but it is better to have only a little, with peace of mind, than be busy all the time with both hands, trying to catch the wind.
ECC.4.7	I have noticed something else in life that is useless. 
ECC.4.8	Here is someone who lives alone. He has no son, no brother, yet he is always working, never satisfied with the wealth he has. For whom is he working so hard and denying himself any pleasure? This is useless, too—and a miserable way to live.
ECC.4.9	Two are better off than one, because together they can work more effectively. 
ECC.4.10	If one of them falls down, the other can help him up. But if someone is alone and falls, it's just too bad, because there is no one to help him. 
ECC.4.11	If it is cold, two can sleep together and stay warm, but how can you keep warm by yourself? 
ECC.4.12	Two people can resist an attack that would defeat one person alone. A rope made of three cords is hard to break.
ECC.4.13+ECC.4.14	Someone may rise from poverty to become king of his country, or go from prison to the throne, but if in his old age he is too foolish to take advice, he is not as well off as a young man who is poor but intelligent. 
ECC.4.15	I thought about all the people who live in this world, and I realized that somewhere among them there is a young man who will take the king's place. 
ECC.4.16	There may be no limit to the number of people a king rules; when he is gone, no one will be grateful for what he has done. It is useless. It is like chasing the wind.
ECC.5.1	Be careful about going to the Temple. It is better to go there to learn than to offer sacrifices like foolish people who don't know right from wrong. 
ECC.5.2	Think before you speak, and don't make any rash promises to God. He is in heaven and you are on earth, so don't say any more than you have to. 
ECC.5.3	The more you worry, the more likely you are to have bad dreams, and the more you talk, the more likely you are to say something foolish. 
ECC.5.4	 So when you make a promise to God, keep it as quickly as possible. He has no use for a fool. Do what you promise to do. 
ECC.5.5	Better not to promise at all than to make a promise and not keep it. 
ECC.5.6	Don't let your own words lead you into sin, so that you have to tell God's priest that you didn't mean it. Why make God angry with you? Why let him destroy what you have worked for? 
ECC.5.7	No matter how much you dream, how much useless work you do, or how much you talk, you must still stand in awe of God.
ECC.5.8	Don't be surprised when you see that the government oppresses the poor and denies them justice and their rights. Every official is protected by someone higher, and both are protected by still higher officials.
ECC.5.9	Even a king depends on the harvest.
ECC.5.10	If you love money, you will never be satisfied; if you long to be rich, you will never get all you want. It is useless. 
ECC.5.11	The richer you are, the more mouths you have to feed. All you gain is the knowledge that you are rich. 
ECC.5.12	Workers may or may not have enough to eat, but at least they can get a good night's sleep. The rich, however, have so much that they stay awake worrying.
ECC.5.13	Here is a terrible thing that I have seen in this world: people save up their money for a time when they may need it,
ECC.5.14	and then lose it all in some bad deal and end up with nothing left to pass on to their children. 
ECC.5.15	 We leave this world just as we entered it—with nothing. In spite of all our work there is nothing we can take with us. 
ECC.5.16	It isn't right! We go just as we came. We labor, trying to catch the wind, and what do we get? 
ECC.5.17	We get to live our lives in darkness and grief,
ECC.5.18	Here is what I have found out: the best thing we can do is eat and drink and enjoy what we have worked for during the short life that God has given us; this is our fate. 
ECC.5.19	If God gives us wealth and property and lets us enjoy them, we should be grateful and enjoy what we have worked for. It is a gift from God. 
ECC.5.20	Since God has allowed us to be happy, we will not worry too much about how short life is.
ECC.6.1	I have noticed that in this world a serious injustice is done. 
ECC.6.2	God will give us wealth, honor, and property, yes, everything we want, but then will not let us enjoy it. Some stranger will enjoy it instead. It is useless, and it just isn't right. 
ECC.6.3	We may have a hundred children and live a long time, but no matter how long we live, if we do not get our share of happiness and do not receive a decent burial, then I say that a baby born dead is better off. 
ECC.6.4	It does that baby no good to be born; it disappears into darkness, where it is forgotten. 
ECC.6.5	It never sees the light of day or knows what life is like, but at least it has found rest— 
ECC.6.6	more so than the man who never enjoys life, though he may live two thousand years. After all, both of them are going to the same place.
ECC.6.7	We do all our work just to get something to eat, but we never have enough. 
ECC.6.8	How are the wise better off than fools? What good does it do the poor to know how to face life? 
ECC.6.9	It is useless; it is like chasing the wind. It is better to be satisfied with what you have than to be always wanting something else.
ECC.6.10	Everything that happens was already determined long ago, and we all know that you
ECC.6.11	The longer you argue, the more useless it is, and you are no better off. 
ECC.6.12	How can anyone know what is best for us in this short, useless life of ours—a life that passes like a shadow? How can we know what will happen in the world after we die?
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to a home where there is mourning than to one where there is a party, because the living should always remind themselves that death is waiting for us all.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter; it may sadden your face, but it sharpens your understanding.
ECC.7.4	Someone who is always thinking about happiness is a fool. A wise person thinks about death.
ECC.7.5	It is better to have wise people reprimand you than to have stupid people sing your praises.
ECC.7.6	When a fool laughs, it is like thorns crackling in a fire. It doesn't mean a thing.
ECC.7.7	You may be wise, but if you cheat someone, you are acting like a fool. If you take a bribe, you ruin your character.
ECC.7.8	The end of something is better than its beginning.
ECC.7.8	Patience is better than pride.
ECC.7.10	Never ask, “Oh, why were things so much better in the old days?” It's not an intelligent question.
ECC.7.11	Everyone who lives ought to be wise; it is as good as receiving an inheritance 
ECC.7.12	and will give you as much security as money can. Wisdom keeps you safe—this is the advantage of knowledge.
ECC.7.13	Think about what God has done. How can anyone straighten out what God has made crooked? 
ECC.7.14	When things are going well for you, be glad, and when trouble comes, just remember: God sends both happiness and trouble; you never know what is going to happen next.
ECC.7.15	My life has been useless, but in it I have seen everything. Some good people may die while others live on, even though they are evil. 
ECC.7.16	So don't be too good or too wise—why kill yourself? 
ECC.7.17	But don't be too wicked or too foolish, either—why die before you have to? 
ECC.7.18	Avoid both extremes. If you have reverence for God, you will be successful anyway.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom does more for a person than ten rulers can do for a city.
ECC.7.20	There is no one on earth who does what is right all the time and never makes a mistake.
ECC.7.21	Don't pay attention to everything people say—you may hear your servant insulting you, 
ECC.7.22	and you know yourself that you have insulted other people many times.
ECC.7.23	I used my wisdom to test all of this. I was determined to be wise, but it was beyond me. 
ECC.7.24	How can anyone discover what life means? It is too deep for us, too hard to understand. 
ECC.7.25	But I devoted myself to knowledge and study; I was determined to find wisdom and the answers to my questions, and to learn how wicked and foolish stupidity is.
ECC.7.26	I found something more bitter than death—the woman who is like a trap. The love she offers you will catch you like a net, and her arms around you will hold you like a chain. A man who pleases God can get away, but she will catch the sinner. 
ECC.7.27	Yes, said the Philosopher, I found this out little by little while I was looking for answers. 
ECC.7.28	I have looked for other answers but have found none. I found one man in a thousand that I could respect, but not one woman. 
ECC.7.29	This is all that I have learned: God made us plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated.
ECC.8.1	Only the wise know what things really mean. Wisdom makes them smile and makes their frowns disappear.
ECC.8.2	Do what the king says,
ECC.8.3	The king can do anything he likes, so depart from his presence; don't stay in such a dangerous place. 
ECC.8.4	The king acts with authority, and no one can challenge what he does. 
ECC.8.5	As long as you obey his commands, you are safe, and a wise person knows how and when to do it. 
ECC.8.6	There is a right time and a right way to do everything, but we know so little! 
ECC.8.7	None of us knows what is going to happen, and there is no one to tell us. 
ECC.8.8	No one can keep from dying or put off the day of death. That is a battle we cannot escape; we cannot cheat our way out.
ECC.8.9	I saw all this when I thought about the things that are done in this world, a world where some people have power and others have to suffer under them. 
ECC.8.10	Yes, I have seen the wicked buried and in their graves, but on the way back from the cemetery people praise them in the very city where they did their evil.
ECC.8.11	Why do people commit crimes so readily? Because crime is not punished quickly enough. 
ECC.8.12	A sinner may commit a hundred crimes and still live. Oh yes, I know what they say: “If you obey God, everything will be all right, 
ECC.8.13	but it will not go well for the wicked. Their life is like a shadow and they will die young, because they do not obey God.” 
ECC.8.14	But this is nonsense. Look at what happens in the world: sometimes the righteous get the punishment of the wicked, and the wicked get the reward of the righteous. I say it is useless.
ECC.8.15	So I am convinced that we should enjoy ourselves, because the only pleasure we have in this life is eating and drinking and enjoying ourselves. We can at least do this as we labor during the life that God has given us in this world.
ECC.8.16	Whenever I tried to become wise and learn what goes on in the world, I realized that you could stay awake night and day 
ECC.8.17	and never be able to understand what God is doing. However hard you try, you will never find out. The wise may claim to know, but they don't.
ECC.9.1	I thought long and hard about all this and saw that God controls the actions of wise and righteous people, even their love and their hate. No one knows anything about what lies ahead. 
ECC.9.2	It makes no difference.
ECC.9.3	One fate comes to all alike, and this is as wrong as anything that happens in this world. As long as people live, their minds are full of evil and madness, and suddenly they die. 
ECC.9.4	But anyone who is alive in the world of the living has some hope; a live dog is better off than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	Yes, the living know they are going to die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward; they are completely forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Their loves, their hates, their passions, all died with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens in this world.
ECC.9.7	Go ahead—eat your food and be happy; drink your wine and be cheerful. It's all right with God. 
ECC.9.8	Always look happy and cheerful. 
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the one you love, as long as you live the useless life that God has given you in this world. Enjoy every useless day of it, because that is all you will get for all your trouble. 
ECC.9.10	Work hard at whatever you do, because there will be no action, no thought, no knowledge, no wisdom in the world of the dead—and that is where you are going.
ECC.9.11	I realized another thing, that in this world fast runners do not always win the races, and the brave do not always win the battles. The wise do not always earn a living, intelligent people do not always get rich, and capable people do not always rise to high positions. Bad luck happens to everyone. 
ECC.9.12	You never know when your time is coming. Like birds suddenly caught in a trap, like fish caught in a net, we are trapped at some evil moment when we least expect it.
ECC.9.13	There is something else I saw, a good example of how wisdom is regarded in this world. 
ECC.9.14	There was a little town without many people in it. A powerful king attacked it. He surrounded it and prepared to break through the walls. 
ECC.9.15	Someone lived there who was poor, but so clever that he could have saved the town. But no one thought about him.
ECC.9.16	I have always said that wisdom is better than strength, but no one thinks of the poor as wise or pays any attention to what they say. 
ECC.9.17	It is better to listen to the quiet words of someone wise than to the shouts of a ruler at a council of fools. 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom does more good than weapons, but one sinner can undo a lot of good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies can make a whole bottle of perfume stink, and a little stupidity can cancel out the greatest wisdom.
ECC.10.2	It is natural for the wise to do the right thing and for fools to do the wrong thing. 
ECC.10.3	Their stupidity will be evident even to strangers they meet along the way; they let everyone know that they are fools.
ECC.10.4	If your ruler becomes angry with you, do not hand in your resignation; serious wrongs may be pardoned if you keep calm.
ECC.10.5	Here is an injustice I have seen in the world—an injustice caused by rulers. 
ECC.10.6	Stupid people are given positions of authority while the rich are ignored. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves on horseback while noblemen go on foot like slaves.
ECC.10.9	If you work in a stone quarry, you get hurt by stones. If you split wood, you get hurt doing it. 
ECC.10.10	If your ax is dull and you don't sharpen it, you have to work harder to use it. It is smarter to plan ahead. 
ECC.10.11	Knowing how to charm a snake is of no use if you let the snake bite first. 
ECC.10.12	What the wise say brings them honor, but fools are destroyed by their own words. 
ECC.10.13	They start out with silly talk and end up with pure madness. 
ECC.10.14	A fool talks on and on.
ECC.10.14	No one knows what is going to happen next, and no one can tell us what will happen after we die.
ECC.10.15	Only someone too stupid to find his way home would wear himself out with work.
ECC.10.16	A country is in trouble when its king is a youth and its leaders feast all night long. 
ECC.10.17	But a country is fortunate to have a king who makes his own decisions and leaders who eat at the proper time, who control themselves and don't get drunk.
ECC.10.18	When you are too lazy to repair your roof, it will leak, and the house will fall in.
ECC.10.19	Feasting makes you happy and wine cheers you up, but you can't have either without money.
ECC.10.20	Don't criticize the king, even silently, and don't criticize the rich, even in the privacy of your bedroom. A bird might carry the message and tell them what you said.
ECC.11.1	Invest your money in foreign trade, and one of these days you will make a profit. 
ECC.11.2	Put your investments in several places—many places even—because you never know what kind of bad luck you are going to have in this world.
ECC.11.3	No matter which direction a tree falls, it will lie where it fell. When the clouds are full, it rains. 
ECC.11.4	If you wait until the wind and the weather are just right, you will never plant anything and never harvest anything. 
ECC.11.5	God made everything, and you can no more understand what he does than you understand how new life begins in the womb of a pregnant woman. 
ECC.11.6	Do your planting in the morning and in the evening, too. You never know whether it will all grow well or whether one planting will do better than the other.
ECC.11.7	It is good to be able to enjoy the pleasant light of day. 
ECC.11.8	Be grateful for every year you live. No matter how long you live, remember that you will be dead much longer. There is nothing at all to look forward to.
ECC.11.9	Young people, enjoy your youth. Be happy while you are still young. Do what you want to do, and follow your heart's desire. But remember that God is going to judge you for whatever you do.
ECC.11.10	Don't let anything worry you or cause you pain. You aren't going to be young very long.
ECC.12.1	So remember your Creator
ECC.12.2	That is when the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars will grow dim for you, and the rain clouds will never pass away. 
ECC.12.3	Then your arms, that have protected you, will tremble, and your legs, now strong, will grow weak. Your teeth will be too few to chew your food, and your eyes too dim to see clearly. 
ECC.12.4	Your ears will be deaf to the noise of the street. You will barely be able to hear the mill as it grinds or music as it plays, but even the song of a bird will wake you from sleep. 
ECC.12.5	You will be afraid of high places, and walking will be dangerous. Your hair will turn white; you will hardly be able to drag yourself along, and all desire will be gone.
ECC.12.5	We are going to our final resting place, and then there will be mourning in the streets. 
ECC.12.6	The silver chain will snap, and the golden lamp will fall and break; the rope at the well will break, and the water jar will be shattered. 
ECC.12.7	Our bodies will return to the dust of the earth, and the breath of life will go back to God, who gave it to us.
ECC.12.8	Useless, useless, said the Philosopher. It is all useless.
ECC.12.9	But because the Philosopher was wise, he kept on teaching the people what he knew. He studied proverbs and honestly tested their truth. 
ECC.12.10	The Philosopher tried to find comforting words, but the words he wrote were honest. 
ECC.12.11	The sayings of the wise are like the sharp sticks that shepherds use to guide sheep, and collected proverbs are as lasting as firmly driven nails. They have been given by God, the one Shepherd of us all.
ECC.12.12	My child, there is something else to watch out for. There is no end to the writing of books, and too much study will wear you out.
ECC.12.13	After all this, there is only one thing to say: Have reverence for God, and obey his commands, because this is all that we were created for. 
ECC.12.14	God is going to judge everything we do, whether good or bad, even things done in secret.
SNG.1.2	Your lips cover me with kisses;
SNG.1.2	your love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	There is a fragrance about you;
SNG.1.3	the sound of your name recalls it.
SNG.1.3	No woman could keep from loving you.
SNG.1.4	Take me with you, and we'll run away;
SNG.1.4	be my king and take me to your room.
SNG.1.4	We will be happy together,
SNG.1.4	drink deep, and lose ourselves in love.
SNG.1.4	No wonder all women love you!
SNG.1.5	Women of Jerusalem, I am dark but
SNG.1.5	dark as the desert tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	but beautiful as the draperies in Solomon's palace.
SNG.1.6	Don't look down on me because of my color,
SNG.1.6	because the sun has tanned me.
SNG.1.6	My brothers were angry with me
SNG.1.6	and made me work in the vineyard.
SNG.1.6	I had no time to care for myself.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, my love,
SNG.1.7	Where will you lead your flock to graze?
SNG.1.7	Where will they rest from the noonday sun?
SNG.1.7	Why should I need to look for you
SNG.1.7	among the flocks of the other shepherds?
SNG.1.8	Don't you know the place, loveliest of women?
SNG.1.8	Go and follow the flock;
SNG.1.8	find pasture for your goats
SNG.1.8	near the tents of the shepherds.
SNG.1.9	You, my love, excite men
SNG.1.9	as a mare excites the stallions of Pharaoh's chariots.
SNG.1.10	Your hair is beautiful upon your cheeks
SNG.1.10	and falls along your neck like jewels.
SNG.1.11	But we will make for you a chain of gold
SNG.1.11	with ornaments of silver.
SNG.1.12	My king was lying on his couch,
SNG.1.12	and my perfume filled the air with fragrance.
SNG.1.13	My lover has the scent of myrrh
SNG.1.13	as he lies upon my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My lover is like the wild flowers
SNG.1.14	that bloom in the vineyards at Engedi.
SNG.1.15	How beautiful you are, my love;
SNG.1.15	how your eyes shine with love!
SNG.1.16	How handsome you are, my dearest;
SNG.1.16	how you delight me!
SNG.1.16	The green grass will be our bed;
SNG.1.17	the cedars will be the beams of our house,
SNG.1.17	and the cypress trees the ceiling.
SNG.2.1	I am only a wild flower in Sharon,
SNG.2.1	a lily in a mountain valley.
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thorns
SNG.2.2	is my darling among women.
SNG.2.3	Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,
SNG.2.3	so is my dearest compared to other men.
SNG.2.3	I love to sit in its shadow,
SNG.2.3	and its fruit is sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to his banquet hall
SNG.2.4	and raised the banner of love over me.
SNG.2.5	Restore my strength with raisins
SNG.2.5	and refresh me with apples!
SNG.2.5	I am weak from passion.
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right hand caresses me.
SNG.2.7	Promise me, women of Jerusalem;
SNG.2.7	swear by the swift deer and the gazelles
SNG.2.7	that you will not interrupt our love.
SNG.2.8	I hear my lover's voice.
SNG.2.8	He comes running over the mountains,
SNG.2.8	racing across the hills to me.
SNG.2.9	My lover is like a gazelle,
SNG.2.9	like a young stag.
SNG.2.9	There he stands beside the wall.
SNG.2.9	He looks in through the window
SNG.2.9	and glances through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My lover speaks to me.
SNG.2.10	Come then, my love;
SNG.2.10	my darling, come with me.
SNG.2.11	The winter is over; the rains have stopped;
SNG.2.12	in the countryside the flowers are in bloom.
SNG.2.12	This is the time for singing;
SNG.2.12	the song of doves is heard in the fields.
SNG.2.13	Figs are beginning to ripen;
SNG.2.13	the air is fragrant with blossoming vines.
SNG.2.13	Come then, my love;
SNG.2.13	my darling, come with me.
SNG.2.14	You are like a dove that hides
SNG.2.14	in the crevice of a rock.
SNG.2.14	Let me see your lovely face
SNG.2.14	and hear your enchanting voice.
SNG.2.15	Catch the foxes, the little foxes,
SNG.2.15	before they ruin our vineyard in bloom.
SNG.2.16	My lover is mine, and I am his.
SNG.2.16	He feeds his flock among the lilies
SNG.2.17	until the morning breezes blow
SNG.2.17	and the darkness disappears.
SNG.2.17	Return, my darling, like a gazelle,
SNG.2.17	like a stag on the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	Asleep on my bed, night after night
SNG.3.1	I dreamed of the one I love;
SNG.3.1	I was looking for him, but couldn't find him.
SNG.3.2	I went wandering through the city,
SNG.3.2	through its streets and alleys.
SNG.3.2	I looked for the one I love.
SNG.3.2	I looked, but couldn't find him.
SNG.3.3	The sentries patrolling the city saw me.
SNG.3.3	I asked them, “Have you found my lover?”
SNG.3.4	As soon as I left them, I found him.
SNG.3.4	I held him and wouldn't let him go
SNG.3.4	until I took him to my mother's house,
SNG.3.4	to the room where I was born.
SNG.3.5	Promise me, women of Jerusalem;
SNG.3.5	swear by the swift deer and the gazelles
SNG.3.5	that you will not interrupt our love.
SNG.3.6	What is this coming from the desert like a column of smoke,
SNG.3.6	fragrant with incense and myrrh,
SNG.3.6	the incense sold by the traders?
SNG.3.7	Solomon is coming, carried on his throne;
SNG.3.7	sixty soldiers form the bodyguard,
SNG.3.7	the finest soldiers in Israel.
SNG.3.8	All of them are skillful with the sword;
SNG.3.8	they are battle-hardened veterans.
SNG.3.8	Each of them is armed with a sword,
SNG.3.8	on guard against a night attack.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon is carried on a throne
SNG.3.9	made of the finest wood.
SNG.3.10	Its posts are covered with silver;
SNG.3.10	over it is cloth embroidered with gold.
SNG.3.10	Its cushions are covered with purple cloth,
SNG.3.10	lovingly woven by the women of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Women of Zion, come and see King Solomon.
SNG.3.11	He is wearing the crown that his mother placed on his head
SNG.3.11	on his wedding day,
SNG.3.11	on the day of his gladness and joy.
SNG.4.1	How beautiful you are, my love!
SNG.4.1	How your eyes shine with love behind your veil.
SNG.4.1	Your hair dances like a flock of goats
SNG.4.1	bounding down the hills of Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are as white as sheep
SNG.4.2	that have just been shorn and washed.
SNG.4.2	Not one of them is missing;
SNG.4.2	they are all perfectly matched.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon;
SNG.4.3	how lovely they are when you speak.
SNG.4.3	Your cheeks glow behind your veil.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	round and smooth,
SNG.4.4	with a necklace like a thousand shields hung around it.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like gazelles,
SNG.4.5	twin deer feeding among lilies.
SNG.4.6	I will stay on the hill of myrrh,
SNG.4.6	the hill of incense,
SNG.4.6	until the morning breezes blow
SNG.4.6	and the darkness disappears.
SNG.4.7	How beautiful you are, my love;
SNG.4.7	how perfect you are!
SNG.4.8	Come with me from the Lebanon Mountains, my bride;
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Come down from the top of Mount Amana,
SNG.4.8	from Mount Senir and Mount Hermon,
SNG.4.8	where the lions and leopards live.
SNG.4.9	The look in your eyes, my sweetheart and bride,
SNG.4.9	and the necklace you are wearing
SNG.4.9	have stolen my heart.
SNG.4.10	Your love delights me,
SNG.4.10	my sweetheart and bride.
SNG.4.10	Your love is better than wine;
SNG.4.10	your perfume more fragrant than any spice.
SNG.4.11	The taste of honey is on your lips, my darling;
SNG.4.11	your tongue is milk and honey for me.
SNG.4.11	Your clothing has all the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	My sweetheart, my bride, is a secret garden,
SNG.4.12	a walled garden, a private spring;
SNG.4.13	there the plants flourish.
SNG.4.13	They grow like an orchard of pomegranate trees
SNG.4.13	and bear the finest fruits.
SNG.4.13	There is no lack of henna and nard,
SNG.4.14	of saffron, calamus, and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	or incense of every kind.
SNG.4.14	Myrrh and aloes grow there
SNG.4.14	with all the most fragrant perfumes.
SNG.4.15	Fountains water the garden,
SNG.4.15	streams of flowing water,
SNG.4.15	brooks gushing down from the Lebanon Mountains.
SNG.4.16	Wake up, North Wind.
SNG.4.16	South Wind, blow on my garden;
SNG.4.16	fill the air with fragrance.
SNG.4.16	Let my lover come to his garden
SNG.4.16	and eat the best of its fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have entered my garden,
SNG.5.1	my sweetheart, my bride.
SNG.5.1	I am gathering my spices and myrrh;
SNG.5.1	I am eating my honey and honeycomb;
SNG.5.1	I am drinking my wine and milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, lovers, and drink
SNG.5.1	until you are drunk with love!
SNG.5.2	While I slept, my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	I dreamed my lover knocked at the door.
SNG.5.2	Let me come in, my darling,
SNG.5.2	my sweetheart, my dove.
SNG.5.2	My head is wet with dew,
SNG.5.2	and my hair is damp from the mist.
SNG.5.3	I have already undressed;
SNG.5.3	why should I get dressed again?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet;
SNG.5.3	why should I get them dirty again?
SNG.5.4	My lover put his hand to the door,
SNG.5.4	and I was thrilled that he was near.
SNG.5.5	I was ready to let him come in.
SNG.5.5	My hands were covered with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	my fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	as I grasped the handle of the door.
SNG.5.6	I opened the door for my lover,
SNG.5.6	but he had already gone.
SNG.5.6	How I wanted to hear his voice!
SNG.5.6	I looked for him, but couldn't find him;
SNG.5.6	I called to him, but heard no answer.
SNG.5.7	The sentries patrolling the city found me;
SNG.5.7	they struck me and bruised me;
SNG.5.7	the guards at the city wall tore off my cape.
SNG.5.8	Promise me, women of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	that if you find my lover,
SNG.5.8	you will tell him I am weak from passion.
SNG.5.9	Most beautiful of women,
SNG.5.9	is your lover different from everyone else?
SNG.5.9	What is there so wonderful about him
SNG.5.9	that we should give you our promise?
SNG.5.10	My lover is handsome and strong;
SNG.5.10	he is one in ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His face is bronzed and smooth;
SNG.5.11	his hair is wavy,
SNG.5.11	black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are as beautiful as doves by a flowing brook,
SNG.5.12	doves washed in milk and standing by the stream.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are as lovely as a garden
SNG.5.13	that is full of herbs and spices.
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies,
SNG.5.13	wet with liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are well-formed,
SNG.5.14	and he wears rings set with gems.
SNG.5.14	His body is like smooth ivory,
SNG.5.14	with sapphires set in it.
SNG.5.15	His thighs are columns of alabaster
SNG.5.15	set in sockets of gold.
SNG.5.15	He is majestic, like the Lebanon Mountains
SNG.5.15	with their towering cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweet to kiss;
SNG.5.16	everything about him enchants me.
SNG.5.16	This is what my lover is like,
SNG.5.16	women of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Most beautiful of women,
SNG.6.1	where has your lover gone?
SNG.6.1	Tell us which way your lover went,
SNG.6.1	so that we can help you find him.
SNG.6.2	My lover has gone to his garden,
SNG.6.2	where the balsam trees grow.
SNG.6.2	He is feeding his flock in the garden
SNG.6.2	and gathering lilies.
SNG.6.3	My lover is mine, and I am his;
SNG.6.3	he feeds his flock among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	My love, you are as beautiful as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	as lovely as the city of Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	as breathtaking as these great cities.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me;
SNG.6.5	they are holding me captive.
SNG.6.5	Your hair dances like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	bounding down the hills of Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are as white as a flock of sheep
SNG.6.6	that have just been washed.
SNG.6.6	Not one of them is missing;
SNG.6.6	they are all perfectly matched.
SNG.6.7	Your cheeks glow behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	Let the king have sixty queens, eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	young women without number!
SNG.6.9	But I love only one,
SNG.6.9	and she is as lovely as a dove.
SNG.6.9	She is her mother's only daughter,
SNG.6.9	her mother's favorite child.
SNG.6.9	All women look at her and praise her;
SNG.6.9	queens and concubines sing her praises.
SNG.6.10	Who is this whose glance is like the dawn?
SNG.6.10	She is beautiful and bright,
SNG.6.10	as dazzling as the sun or the moon.
SNG.6.11	I have come down among the almond trees
SNG.6.11	to see the young plants in the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see the new leaves on the vines
SNG.6.11	and the blossoms on the pomegranate trees.
SNG.6.12	I am trembling; you have made me as eager for love
SNG.6.12	as a chariot driver is for battle.
SNG.6.13	Dance, dance,
SNG.6.13	Let us watch you as you dance.
SNG.6.13	Why do you want to watch me
SNG.6.13	as I dance between the rows of onlookers?
SNG.7.1	What a magnificent young woman you are!
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your feet in sandals.
SNG.7.1	The curve of your thighs
SNG.7.1	is like the work of an artist.
SNG.7.2	A bowl is there,
SNG.7.2	that never runs out of spiced wine.
SNG.7.2	A sheaf of wheat is there,
SNG.7.2	surrounded by lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like twin deer,
SNG.7.3	like two gazelles.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like a tower of ivory.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like the pools in the city of Heshbon,
SNG.7.4	near the gate of that great city.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is as lovely as the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	that stands guard at Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head is held high like Mount Carmel.
SNG.7.5	Your braided hair shines like the finest satin;
SNG.7.5	its beauty
SNG.7.6	How pretty you are, how beautiful;
SNG.7.6	how complete the delights of your love.
SNG.7.7	You are as graceful as a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are clusters of dates.
SNG.7.8	I will climb the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and pick its fruit.
SNG.7.8	To me your breasts are like bunches of grapes,
SNG.7.8	your breath like the fragrance of apples,
SNG.7.9	and your mouth like the finest wine.
SNG.7.9	Then let the wine flow straight to my lover,
SNG.7.9	flowing over his lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I belong to my lover, and he desires me.
SNG.7.11	Come, darling, let's go out to the countryside
SNG.7.11	and spend the night in the villages.
SNG.7.12	We will get up early and look at the vines
SNG.7.12	to see whether they've started to grow,
SNG.7.12	whether the blossoms are opening
SNG.7.12	and the pomegranate trees are in bloom.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	You can smell the scent of mandrakes,
SNG.7.13	and all the pleasant fruits are near our door.
SNG.7.13	Darling, I have kept for you
SNG.7.13	the old delights and the new.
SNG.8.1	I wish that you were my brother,
SNG.8.1	that my mother had nursed you at her breast.
SNG.8.1	Then, if I met you in the street,
SNG.8.1	I could kiss you and no one would mind.
SNG.8.2	I would take you to my mother's house,
SNG.8.2	where you could teach me love.
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine,
SNG.8.2	my pomegranate wine to drink.
SNG.8.3	Your left hand is under my head,
SNG.8.3	and your right hand caresses me.
SNG.8.4	Promise me, women of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	that you will not interrupt our love.
SNG.8.5	Who is this coming from the desert,
SNG.8.5	arm in arm with her lover?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I woke you,
SNG.8.5	in the place where you were born.
SNG.8.6	Close your heart to every love but mine;
SNG.8.6	hold no one in your arms but me.
SNG.8.6	Love is as powerful as death;
SNG.8.6	passion is as strong as death itself.
SNG.8.6	It bursts into flame
SNG.8.6	and burns like a raging fire.
SNG.8.7	Water cannot put it out;
SNG.8.7	no flood can drown it.
SNG.8.7	But if any tried to buy love with their wealth,
SNG.8.7	contempt is all they would get.
SNG.8.8	We have a young sister,
SNG.8.8	and her breasts are still small.
SNG.8.8	What will we do for her
SNG.8.8	when a young man comes courting?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build her a silver tower.
SNG.8.9	But if she is a gate,
SNG.8.9	we will protect her with panels of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall,
SNG.8.10	and my breasts are its towers.
SNG.8.10	My lover knows that with him
SNG.8.10	I find contentment and peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon has a vineyard
SNG.8.11	in a place called Baal Hamon.
SNG.8.11	There are farmers who rent it from him;
SNG.8.11	each one pays a thousand silver coins.
SNG.8.12	Solomon is welcome to his thousand coins,
SNG.8.12	and the farmers to two hundred as their share;
SNG.8.12	I have a vineyard of my own!
SNG.8.13	Let me hear your voice from the garden, my love;
SNG.8.13	my companions are waiting to hear you speak.
SNG.8.14	Come to me, my lover, like a gazelle,
SNG.8.14	like a young stag on the mountains where spices grow.
ISA.1.2	The 
ISA.1.3	Cattle know who owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all.”
ISA.1.4	You are doomed, you sinful nation, you corrupt and evil people! Your sins drag you down! You have rejected the 
ISA.1.5	Why do you keep on rebelling? Do you want to be punished even more? Israel, your head is already covered with wounds, and your heart and mind are sick. 
ISA.1.6	From head to foot there is not a healthy spot on your body. You are covered with bruises and sores and open wounds. Your wounds have not been cleaned or bandaged. No medicine has been put on them.
ISA.1.7	Your country has been devastated, and your cities have been burned to the ground. While you look on, foreigners take over your land and bring everything to ruin. 
ISA.1.8	Jerusalem alone is left, a city under siege—as defenseless as a guard's hut in a vineyard or a shed in a cucumber field. 
ISA.1.9	 If the 
ISA.1.10	Jerusalem, your rulers and your people are like those of Sodom and Gomorrah. Listen to what the 
ISA.1.11	 He says, “Do you think I want all these sacrifices you keep offering to me? I have had more than enough of the sheep you burn as sacrifices and of the fat of your fine animals. I am tired of the blood of bulls and sheep and goats. 
ISA.1.12	Who asked you to bring me all this when you come to worship me? Who asked you to do all this tramping around in my Temple? 
ISA.1.13	It's useless to bring your offerings. I am disgusted with the smell of the incense you burn. I cannot stand your New Moon Festivals, your Sabbaths, and your religious gatherings; they are all corrupted by your sins. 
ISA.1.14	I hate your New Moon Festivals and holy days; they are a burden that I am tired of bearing.
ISA.1.15	“When you lift your hands in prayer, I will not look at you. No matter how much you pray, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with blood. 
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves clean. Stop all this evil that I see you doing. Yes, stop doing evil 
ISA.1.17	and learn to do right. See that justice is done—help those who are oppressed, give orphans their rights, and defend widows.”
ISA.1.18	The 
ISA.1.19	If you will only obey me, you will eat the good things the land produces. 
ISA.1.20	But if you defy me, you are doomed to die. I, the 
ISA.1.21	The city that once was faithful is behaving like a whore! At one time it was filled with righteous people, but now only murderers remain. 
ISA.1.22	Jerusalem, you were once like silver, but now you are worthless; you were like good wine, but now you are only water. 
ISA.1.23	Your leaders are rebels and friends of thieves; they are always accepting gifts and bribes. They never defend orphans in court or listen when widows present their case.
ISA.1.24	So now, listen to what the 
ISA.1.25	I will take action against you. I will purify you the way metal is refined, and will remove all your impurity. 
ISA.1.26	I will give you rulers and advisers like those you had long ago. Then Jerusalem will be called the righteous, faithful city.”
ISA.1.27	Because the 
ISA.1.28	But he will crush everyone who sins and rebels against him; he will kill everyone who forsakes him.
ISA.1.29	You will be sorry that you ever worshiped trees and planted sacred gardens.
ISA.1.30	You will wither like a dying oak, like a garden that no one waters. 
ISA.1.31	Just as straw is set on fire by a spark, so powerful people will be destroyed by their own evil deeds, and no one will be able to stop the destruction.
ISA.2.1	Here is the message which God gave to Isaiah son of Amoz about Judah and Jerusalem:
ISA.2.2	In days to come
ISA.2.2	the mountain where the Temple stands
ISA.2.2	will be the highest one of all,
ISA.2.2	towering above all the hills.
ISA.2.2	Many nations will come streaming to it,
ISA.2.3	and their people will say,
ISA.2.3	“Let us go up the hill of the 
ISA.2.3	to the Temple of Israel's God.
ISA.2.3	He will teach us what he wants us to do;
ISA.2.3	we will walk in the paths he has chosen.
ISA.2.3	For the 
ISA.2.3	from Zion he speaks to his people.”
ISA.2.4	They will hammer their swords into plows
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning knives.
ISA.2.4	Nations will never again go to war,
ISA.2.4	never prepare for battle again.
ISA.2.5	Now, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light which the 
ISA.2.6	O God, you have forsaken your people, the descendants of Jacob! The land is full of magic practices from the East and from Philistia.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their chariots. 
ISA.2.8	Their land is full of idols, and they worship objects that they have made with their own hands.
ISA.2.9	Everyone will be humiliated and disgraced. Do not forgive them, 
ISA.2.11	A day is coming when human pride will be ended and human arrogance destroyed. Then the 
ISA.2.12	On that day the 
ISA.2.13	He will destroy the tall cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks in the land of Bashan. 
ISA.2.14	He will level the high mountains and hills, 
ISA.2.15	every high tower, and the walls of every fortress. 
ISA.2.16	He will sink even the largest and most beautiful ships. 
ISA.2.17+ISA.2.18	Human pride will be ended, and human arrogance will be destroyed. Idols will completely disappear, and the 
ISA.2.19	People will hide in caves in the rocky hills or dig holes in the ground to try to escape from the 
ISA.2.20	When that day comes, they will throw away the gold and silver idols they have made, and abandon them to the moles and the bats. 
ISA.2.21	When the 
ISA.2.22	Put no more confidence in mortals. What are they worth?
ISA.3.1	Now the Lord, the Almighty 
ISA.3.2	their heroes and their soldiers, their judges and their prophets, their fortunetellers and their statesmen, 
ISA.3.3	their military and civilian leaders, their politicians and everyone who uses magic to control events. 
ISA.3.4	The 
ISA.3.5	Everyone will take advantage of everyone else. Young people will not respect their elders, and worthless people will not respect their superiors.
ISA.3.6	A time will come when the members of a clan will choose one of their number and say to him, “You at least have something to wear, so be our leader in this time of trouble.”
ISA.3.7	But he will answer, “Not me! I can't help you. I don't have any food or clothes either. Don't make me your leader!”
ISA.3.8	Yes, Jerusalem is doomed! Judah is collapsing! Everything they say and do is against the 
ISA.3.9	Their prejudices will be held against them. They sin as openly as the people of Sodom did. They are doomed, and they have brought it on themselves.
ISA.3.10	The righteous will be happy,
ISA.3.11	But evil people are doomed; what they have done to others will now be done to them.
ISA.3.12	Moneylenders oppress my people, and their creditors cheat them.
ISA.3.12	My people, your leaders are misleading you, so that you do not know which way to turn.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	You have no right to crush my people and take advantage of the poor. I, the Sovereign 
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.17	But I will punish them—I will shave their heads and leave them bald.”
ISA.3.18	A day is coming when the Lord will take away from the women of Jerusalem everything they are so proud of—the ornaments they wear on their ankles, on their heads, on their necks, 
ISA.3.19	and on their wrists. He will take away their veils 
ISA.3.20	and their hats; the magic charms they wear on their arms and at their waists; 
ISA.3.21	the rings they wear on their fingers and in their noses; 
ISA.3.22	all their fine robes, gowns, cloaks, and purses; 
ISA.3.23	their revealing garments, their linen handkerchiefs, and the scarves and long veils they wear on their heads.
ISA.3.24	Instead of using perfumes, they will stink; instead of fine belts, they will wear coarse ropes; instead of having beautiful hair, they will be bald; instead of fine clothes, they will be dressed in rags; their beauty will be turned to shame!
ISA.3.25	The men of the city, yes, even the strongest men, will be killed in war. 
ISA.3.26	The city gates will mourn and cry, and the city itself will be like a woman sitting on the ground, stripped naked.
ISA.4.1	When that time comes, seven women will grab hold of one man and say, “We can feed and clothe ourselves, but please let us say you are our husband, so that we won't have to endure the shame of being unmarried.”
ISA.4.2	The time is coming when the 
ISA.4.3	Everyone who is left in Jerusalem, whom God has chosen for survival, will be called holy. 
ISA.4.4	By his power the Lord will judge and purify the nation and wash away the guilt of Jerusalem and the blood that has been shed there. 
ISA.4.5	 Then over Mount Zion and over all who are gathered there, the 
ISA.4.6	His glory will shade the city from the heat of the day and make it a place of safety, sheltered from the rain and storm.
ISA.5.1	a song of my friend and his vineyard:
ISA.5.1	My friend had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a very fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	He dug the soil and cleared it of stones;
ISA.5.2	he planted the finest vines.
ISA.5.2	He built a tower to guard them,
ISA.5.2	dug a pit for treading the grapes.
ISA.5.2	He waited for the grapes to ripen,
ISA.5.2	but every grape was sour.
ISA.5.3	So now my friend says, “You people who live in Jerusalem and Judah, judge between my vineyard and me. 
ISA.5.4	Is there anything I failed to do for it? Then why did it produce sour grapes and not the good grapes I expected?
ISA.5.5	“Here is what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge around it, break down the wall that protects it, and let wild animals eat it and trample it down. 
ISA.5.6	I will let it be overgrown with weeds. I will not trim the vines or hoe the ground; instead, I will let briers and thorns cover it. I will even forbid the clouds to let rain fall on it.”
ISA.5.7	Israel is the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	the people of Judah are the vines he planted.
ISA.5.7	He expected them to do what was good,
ISA.5.7	but instead they committed murder.
ISA.5.7	He expected them to do what was right,
ISA.5.7	but their victims cried out for justice.
ISA.5.8	You are doomed! You buy more houses and fields to add to those you already have. Soon there will be no place for anyone else to live, and you alone will live in the land. 
ISA.5.9	I have heard the 
ISA.5.10	The grapevines growing on five acres of land will yield only five gallons of wine. Ten bushels of seed will produce only one bushel of grain.”
ISA.5.12	At your feasts you have harps and tambourines and flutes—and wine. But you don't understand what the 
ISA.5.13	and so you will be carried away as prisoners. Your leaders will starve to death, and the common people will die of thirst. 
ISA.5.14	The world of the dead is hungry for them, and it opens its mouth wide. It gulps down the nobles of Jerusalem along with the noisy crowd of common people.
ISA.5.15	Everyone will be disgraced, and all who are proud will be humbled. 
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.17	In the ruins of the cities lambs will eat grass and young goats will find pasture.
ISA.5.18	You are doomed! You are unable to break free from your sins. 
ISA.5.19	You say, “Let the 
ISA.5.20	You are doomed! You call evil good and call good evil. You turn darkness into light and light into darkness. You make what is bitter sweet, and what is sweet you make bitter.
ISA.5.21	You are doomed! You think you are wise, so very clever.
ISA.5.22	You are doomed! Heroes of the wine bottle! Brave and fearless when it comes to mixing drinks! 
ISA.5.23	But for just a bribe you let the guilty go free, and you keep the innocent from getting justice. 
ISA.5.24	So now, just as straw and dry grass shrivel and burn in the fire, your roots will rot and your blossoms will dry up and blow away, because you have rejected what the 
ISA.5.25	The 
ISA.5.26	The 
ISA.5.27	None of them grow tired; none of them stumble. They never doze or sleep. Not a belt is loose; not a sandal strap is broken. 
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready to shoot. Their horses' hoofs are as hard as flint, and their chariot wheels turn like a whirlwind. 
ISA.5.29	The soldiers roar like lions that have killed an animal and are carrying it off where no one can take it away from them.
ISA.5.30	When that day comes, they will roar over Israel as loudly as the sea. Look at this country! Darkness and distress! The light is swallowed by darkness.
ISA.6.2	Around him flaming creatures were standing, each of which had six wings. Each creature covered its face with two wings, and its body with two, and used the other two for flying. 
ISA.6.3	 They were calling out to each other:
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy!
ISA.6.3	The 
ISA.6.3	His glory fills the world.”
ISA.6.5	I said, “There is no hope for me! I am doomed because every word that passes my lips is sinful, and I live among a people whose every word is sinful. And yet, with my own eyes I have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the creatures flew down to me, carrying a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. 
ISA.6.7	He touched my lips with the burning coal and said, “This has touched your lips, and now your guilt is gone, and your sins are forgiven.”
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the Lord say, “Whom shall I send? Who will be our messenger?”
ISA.6.8	I answered, “I will go! Send me!”
ISA.6.10	Then he said to me, “Make the minds of these people dull, their ears deaf, and their eyes blind, so that they cannot see or hear or understand. If they did, they might turn to me and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	I asked, “How long will it be like this, Lord?”
ISA.6.11	He answered, “Until the cities are ruined and empty—until the houses are uninhabited—until the land itself is a desolate wasteland. 
ISA.6.12	I will send the people far away and make the whole land desolate. 
ISA.6.13	Even if one person out of ten remains in the land, he too will be destroyed; he will be like the stump of an oak tree that has been cut down.”
ISA.6.13	(The stump represents a new beginning for God's people.)
ISA.7.2	When word reached the king of Judah that the armies of Syria were already in the territory of Israel, he and all his people were so terrified that they trembled like trees shaking in the wind.
ISA.7.3	The 
ISA.7.4	Tell him to keep alert, to stay calm, and not to be frightened or disturbed. The anger of King Rezin and his Syrians and of King Pekah is no more dangerous than the smoke from two smoldering sticks of wood. 
ISA.7.5	Syria, together with Israel and its king, has made a plot. 
ISA.7.6	They intend to invade Judah, terrify the people into joining their side, and then put Tabeel's son on the throne.
ISA.7.7	“But I, the 
ISA.7.8	Why? Because Syria is no stronger than Damascus, its capital city, and Damascus is no stronger than King Rezin. As for Israel, within sixty-five years it will be too shattered to survive as a nation. 
ISA.7.9	Israel is no stronger than Samaria, its capital city, and Samaria is no stronger than King Pekah.
ISA.7.9	“If your faith is not enduring, you will not endure.”
ISA.7.10	The 
ISA.7.11	“Ask the 
ISA.7.12	Ahaz answered, “I will not ask for a sign. I refuse to put the 
ISA.7.13	To that Isaiah replied, “Listen, now, descendants of King David. It's bad enough for you to wear out the patience of people—do you have to wear out God's patience too? 
ISA.7.14	 Well then, the Lord himself will give you a sign: a young woman
ISA.7.15	By the time he is old enough to make his own decisions, people will be drinking milk and eating honey.
ISA.7.16	Even before that time comes, the lands of those two kings who terrify you will be deserted.
ISA.7.17	“The 
ISA.7.18	“When that time comes, the 
ISA.7.19	They will swarm in the rugged valleys and in the caves in the rocks, and they will cover every thorn bush and every pasture.
ISA.7.20	“When that time comes, the Lord will hire a barber from across the Euphrates—the emperor of Assyria!—and he will shave off your beards and the hair on your heads and your bodies.
ISA.7.21	“When that time comes, even if a farmer has been able to save only one young cow and two goats, 
ISA.7.22	they will give so much milk that he will have all he needs. Yes, the few survivors left in the land will have milk and honey to eat.
ISA.7.23	“When that time comes, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and each worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be overgrown with thorn bushes and briers. 
ISA.7.24	People will go hunting there with bows and arrows. Yes, the whole country will be full of briers and thorn bushes. 
ISA.7.25	All the hills where crops were once planted will be so overgrown with thorns that no one will go there. It will be a place where cattle and sheep graze.”
ISA.8.1	The 
ISA.8.2	Get two reliable men, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to serve as witnesses.”
ISA.8.3	Some time later my wife became pregnant. When our son was born, the 
ISA.8.4	Before the boy is old enough to say ‘Mamma’ and ‘Daddy,’ all the wealth of Damascus and all the loot of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	He said, “Because these people have rejected the quiet waters of Shiloah Brook
ISA.8.7	I, the Lord, will bring the emperor of Assyria and all his forces to attack Judah. They will advance like the flood waters of the Euphrates River, overflowing all its banks. 
ISA.8.8	They will sweep through Judah in a flood, rising shoulder high and covering everything.”
ISA.8.8	God is with us! His outspread wings protect the land.
ISA.8.9	Gather together in fear, you nations! Listen, you distant parts of the earth. Get ready to fight, but be afraid! Yes, get ready, but be afraid! 
ISA.8.10	Make your plans! But they will never succeed. Talk all you want to! But it is all useless, because God is with us.
ISA.8.11	With his great power the 
ISA.8.12	 “Do not join in the schemes of the people and do not be afraid of the things that they fear. 
ISA.8.13	Remember that I, the 
ISA.8.14	 Because of my awesome holiness I am like a stone that people stumble over; I am like a trap that will catch the people of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel and the people of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	Many will stumble; they will fall and be crushed. They will be caught in a trap.”
ISA.8.16	You, my disciples, are to guard and preserve the messages that God has given me. 
ISA.8.17	 The 
ISA.8.19	But people will tell you to ask for messages from fortunetellers and mediums, who chirp and mutter. They will say, “After all, people should ask for messages from the spirits and consult the dead on behalf of the living.”
ISA.8.20	You are to answer them, “Listen to what the 
ISA.8.21	The people will wander through the land, discouraged and hungry. In their hunger and their anger they will curse their king and their God. They may look up to the sky 
ISA.8.22	or stare at the ground, but they will see nothing but trouble and darkness, terrifying darkness into which they are being driven.
ISA.9.1	The land of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali was once disgraced, but the future will bring honor to this region, from the Mediterranean eastward to the land on the other side of the Jordan, and even to Galilee itself, where the foreigners live.
ISA.9.2	have seen a great light.
ISA.9.2	They lived in a land of shadows,
ISA.9.2	but now light is shining on them.
ISA.9.3	You have given them great joy,
ISA.9.3	you have made them happy.
ISA.9.3	They rejoice in what you have done,
ISA.9.3	as people rejoice when they harvest grain
ISA.9.3	or when they divide captured wealth.
ISA.9.4	For you have broken the yoke that burdened them
ISA.9.4	and the rod that beat their shoulders.
ISA.9.4	You have defeated the nation
ISA.9.4	that oppressed and exploited your people,
ISA.9.4	just as you defeated the army of Midian long ago.
ISA.9.5	The boots of the invading army
ISA.9.5	and all their bloodstained clothing
ISA.9.5	will be destroyed by fire.
ISA.9.6	A child is born to us!
ISA.9.6	A son is given to us!
ISA.9.6	And he will be our ruler.
ISA.9.6	He will be called, “Wonderful
ISA.9.6	“Mighty God,” “Eternal Father,”
ISA.9.6	“Prince of Peace.”
ISA.9.7	his kingdom will always be at peace.
ISA.9.7	He will rule as King David's successor,
ISA.9.7	basing his power on right and justice,
ISA.9.7	from now until the end of time.
ISA.9.7	The 
ISA.9.8	The Lord has pronounced judgment on the kingdom of Israel, on the descendants of Jacob. 
ISA.9.9	All the people of Israel, everyone who lives in the city of Samaria, will know that he has done this. Now they are proud and arrogant. They say, 
ISA.9.10	“The brick buildings have fallen down, but we will replace them with stone buildings. The beams of sycamore wood have been cut down, but we will replace them with the finest cedar.”
ISA.9.11	The 
ISA.9.12	Syria on the east and Philistia on the west have opened their mouths to devour Israel. Yet even so the 
ISA.9.13	The people of Israel have not repented; even though the 
ISA.9.14	In a single day the 
ISA.9.15	The old and honorable men are the head—and the tail is the prophets whose teachings are lies! 
ISA.9.16	Those who lead these people have misled them and totally confused them. 
ISA.9.17	And so the Lord will not let any of the young men escape, and he will not show pity on any of the widows and orphans, because all the people are godless and wicked and everything they say is evil. Yet even so the 
ISA.9.18	The wickedness of the people burns like a fire that destroys thorn bushes and thistles. It burns like a forest fire that sends up columns of smoke. 
ISA.9.19	Because the 
ISA.9.20	Everywhere in the country people snatch and eat any bit of food they can find, but their hunger is never satisfied. They even eat their own children! 
ISA.9.21	The people of Manasseh and the people of Ephraim attack each other, and together they attack Judah. Yet even so the 
ISA.10.1	You are doomed! You make unjust laws that oppress my people. 
ISA.10.2	That is how you keep the poor from having their rights and from getting justice. That is how you take the property that belongs to widows and orphans. 
ISA.10.3	What will you do when God punishes you? What will you do when he brings disaster on you from a distant country? Where will you run to find help? Where will you hide your wealth? 
ISA.10.4	You will be killed in battle or dragged off as prisoners. Yet even so the 
ISA.10.6	I sent Assyria to attack a godless nation, people who have made me angry. I sent them to loot and steal and trample the people like dirt in the streets.”
ISA.10.7	But the Assyrian emperor has his own violent plans in mind. He is determined to destroy many nations. 
ISA.10.8	He boasts, “Every one of my commanders is a king! 
ISA.10.9	I conquered the cities of Calno and Carchemish, the cities of Hamath and Arpad. I conquered Samaria and Damascus. 
ISA.10.10	I reached out to punish those kingdoms that worship idols, idols more numerous than those of Jerusalem and Samaria. 
ISA.10.11	I have destroyed Samaria and all its idols, and I will do the same to Jerusalem and the images that are worshiped there.”
ISA.10.12	But the Lord says, “When I finish what I am doing on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the emperor of Assyria for all his boasting and all his pride.”
ISA.10.13	The emperor of Assyria boasts, “I have done it all myself. I am strong and wise and clever. I wiped out the boundaries between nations and took the supplies they had stored. Like a bull I have trampled the people who live there. 
ISA.10.14	The nations of the world were like a bird's nest, and I gathered their wealth as easily as gathering eggs. Not a wing fluttered to scare me off; no beak opened to scream at me!”
ISA.10.15	But the 
ISA.10.16	The 
ISA.10.17	God, the light of Israel, will become a fire. Israel's holy God will become a flame, which in a single day will burn up everything, even the thorns and thistles. 
ISA.10.18	The rich forests and farmlands will be totally destroyed, in the same way that a fatal sickness destroys someone. 
ISA.10.19	There will be so few trees left that even a child will be able to count them.
ISA.10.20	A time is coming when the people of Israel who have survived will not rely any more on the nation that almost destroyed them. They will truly put their trust in the 
ISA.10.21	A few of the people of Israel will come back to their mighty God. 
ISA.10.22	 Even though now there are as many people of Israel as there are grains of sand by the sea, only a few will come back. Destruction is in store for the people, and it is fully deserved. 
ISA.10.23	Yes, throughout the whole country the Sovereign 
ISA.10.24	The Sovereign 
ISA.10.25	In only a little while I will finish punishing you, and then I will destroy them. 
ISA.10.26	I, the 
ISA.10.27	When that time comes, I will free you from the power of Assyria, and their yoke will no longer be a burden on your shoulders.”
ISA.10.28	The enemy army has captured the city of Ai!
ISA.10.29	They have crossed the pass and are spending the night at Geba! The people in the town of Ramah are terrified, and the people in King Saul's hometown of Gibeah have run away. 
ISA.10.30	Shout, people of Gallim! Listen, people of Laishah! Answer, people of Anathoth! 
ISA.10.31	The people of Madmenah and Gebim are running for their lives. 
ISA.10.32	Today the enemy are in the town of Nob, and there they are shaking their fists at Mount Zion, at the city of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	The 
ISA.10.34	The 
ISA.11.2	The spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	and the knowledge and skill to rule his people.
ISA.11.2	He will know the 
ISA.11.3	and find pleasure in obeying him.
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by appearance or hearsay;
ISA.11.4	and defend the rights of the helpless.
ISA.11.4	At his command the people will be punished,
ISA.11.4	and evil persons will die.
ISA.11.6	and leopards will lie down with young goats.
ISA.11.6	Calves and lion cubs will feed
ISA.11.6	and little children will take care of them.
ISA.11.7	Cows and bears will eat together,
ISA.11.7	and their calves and cubs will lie down in peace.
ISA.11.7	Lions will eat straw as cattle do.
ISA.11.8	Even a baby will not be harmed
ISA.11.8	if it plays near a poisonous snake.
ISA.11.9	there will be nothing harmful or evil.
ISA.11.9	The land will be as full of knowledge of the 
ISA.11.9	as the seas are full of water.
ISA.11.11	When that day comes, the Lord will once again use his power and bring back home those of his people who are left in Assyria and Egypt, in the lands of Pathros, Ethiopia,
ISA.11.12	The Lord will raise a signal flag to show the nations that he is gathering together again the scattered people of Israel and Judah and bringing them back from the four corners of the earth. 
ISA.11.13	The kingdom of Israel will not be jealous of Judah any more, and Judah will not be the enemy of Israel. 
ISA.11.14	Together they will attack the Philistines on the west and plunder the people who live to the east. They will conquer the people of Edom and Moab, and the people of Ammon will obey them. 
ISA.11.15	 The 
ISA.11.16	There will be a highway out of Assyria for those of his people Israel who have survived there, just as there was for their ancestors when they left Egypt.
ISA.12.1	A day is coming when people will sing,
ISA.12.1	“I praise you, 
ISA.12.1	but now you comfort me and are angry no longer.
ISA.12.2	I will trust him and not be afraid.
ISA.12.2	The 
ISA.12.2	he is my savior.
ISA.12.3	As fresh water brings joy to the thirsty,
ISA.12.3	so God's people rejoice when he saves them.”
ISA.12.4	A day is coming when people will sing,
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to the 
ISA.12.4	Tell all the nations what he has done!
ISA.12.4	Tell them how great he is!
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	Let the whole world hear the news.
ISA.12.6	Let everyone who lives in Zion shout and sing!
ISA.12.6	Israel's holy God is great,
ISA.12.6	and he lives among his people.”
ISA.13.2	On the top of a barren hill raise the battle flag! Shout to the soldiers and raise your arm as the signal for them to attack the gates of the proud city. 
ISA.13.3	The 
ISA.13.4	Listen to the noise on the mountains—the sound of a great crowd of people, the sound of nations and kingdoms gathering. The 
ISA.13.5	They are coming from far-off countries at the ends of the earth. In his anger the 
ISA.13.7	Everyone's hands will hang limp, and everyone's courage will fail. 
ISA.13.8	They will all be terrified and overcome with pain, like the pain of a woman in labor. They will look at each other in fear, and their faces will burn with shame. 
ISA.13.9	The day of the 
ISA.13.10	 Every star and every constellation will stop shining, the sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will give no light.
ISA.13.11	The 
ISA.13.12	Those who survive will be scarcer than gold. 
ISA.13.13	I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place on that day when I, the 
ISA.13.14	“The foreigners living in Babylon will run away to their homelands, scattering like deer escaping from hunters, like sheep without a shepherd. 
ISA.13.15	Anyone who is caught will be stabbed to death. 
ISA.13.16	While they look on helplessly, their babies will be battered to death, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be raped.”
ISA.13.17	The 
ISA.13.18	With their bows and arrows they will kill the young men. They will show no mercy to babies and take no pity on children. 
ISA.13.19	 Babylonia is the most beautiful kingdom of all; it is the pride of its people. But I, the 
ISA.13.20	No one will ever live there again. No wandering Arab will ever pitch a tent there, and no shepherd will ever pasture a flock there. 
ISA.13.21	 It will be a place where desert animals live and where owls build their nests. Ostriches will live there, and wild goats will prance through the ruins. 
ISA.13.22	The towers and palaces will echo with the cries of hyenas and jackals. Babylon's time has come! Her days are almost over.”
ISA.14.1	The 
ISA.14.2	Many nations will help the people of Israel return to the land which the 
ISA.14.3	The 
ISA.14.4	When he does this, they are to mock the king of Babylon and say:
ISA.14.4	“The cruel king has fallen! He will never oppress anyone again! 
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	who angrily oppressed the peoples and never stopped persecuting the nations they had conquered. 
ISA.14.7	Now at last the whole world enjoys rest and peace, and everyone sings for joy. 
ISA.14.8	The cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice over the fallen king, because there is no one to cut them down, now that he is gone!
ISA.14.9	“The world of the dead is getting ready to welcome the king of Babylon. The ghosts of those who were powerful on earth are stirring about. The ghosts of kings are rising from their thrones. 
ISA.14.10	They all call out to him, ‘Now you are as weak as we are! You are one of us! 
ISA.14.11	You used to be honored with the music of harps, but now here you are in the world of the dead. You lie on a bed of maggots and are covered with a blanket of worms.’”
ISA.14.13	 You were determined to climb up to heaven and to place your throne above the highest stars. You thought you would sit like a king on that mountain in the north where the gods assemble. 
ISA.14.14	You said you would climb to the tops of the clouds and be like the Almighty. 
ISA.14.15	But instead, you have been brought down to the deepest part of the world of the dead.
ISA.14.16	The dead will stare and gape at you. They will ask, “Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble? 
ISA.14.17	Is this the man who destroyed cities and turned the world into a desert? Is this the man who never freed his prisoners or let them go home?”
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the earth lie in their magnificent tombs, 
ISA.14.19	but you have no tomb, and your corpse is thrown out to rot. It is covered by the bodies of soldiers killed in battle, thrown with them into a rocky pit, and trampled down. 
ISA.14.20	Because you ruined your country and killed your own people, you will not be buried like other kings. None of your evil family will survive. 
ISA.14.21	Let the slaughter begin! The sons of this king will die because of their ancestors' sins. None of them will ever rule the earth or cover it with cities.
ISA.14.22	The 
ISA.14.23	I will turn Babylon into a marsh, and owls will live there. I will sweep Babylon with a broom that will sweep everything away. I, the 
ISA.14.25	I will destroy the Assyrians in my land of Israel and trample them on my mountains. I will free my people from the Assyrian yoke and from the burdens they have had to bear. 
ISA.14.26	This is my plan for the world, and my arm is stretched out to punish the nations.” 
ISA.14.27	The 
ISA.14.30	The 
ISA.14.31	Howl and cry for help, all you Philistine cities! Be terrified, all of you! A cloud of dust is coming from the north—it is an army with no cowards in its ranks.
ISA.14.32	How shall we answer the messengers that come to us from Philistia? We will tell them that the 
ISA.15.1	The cities of Ar and Kir are destroyed in a single night, and silence covers the land of Moab. 
ISA.15.2	The people of Dibon
ISA.15.3	The people in the streets are dressed in sackcloth; in the city squares and on the rooftops people mourn and cry. 
ISA.15.4	The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, and their cry can be heard as far away as Jahaz. Even the soldiers tremble; their courage is gone. 
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab! The people have fled to the town of Zoar, and to Eglath Shelishiyah. Some climb the road to Luhith, weeping as they go; some escape to Horonaim, grieving loudly. 
ISA.15.6	Nimrim Brook is dry, the grass beside it has withered, and nothing green is left. 
ISA.15.7	The people go across the Valley of Willows, trying to escape with all their possessions. 
ISA.15.8	Everywhere at Moab's borders the sound of crying is heard. It is heard at the towns of Eglaim and Beerelim. 
ISA.15.9	At the town of Dibon the river is red with blood, and God has something even worse in store for the people there. Yes, there will be a bloody slaughter of everyone left in Moab.
ISA.16.1	From the city of Sela in the desert the people of Moab send a lamb as a present to the one who rules in Jerusalem. 
ISA.16.2	They wait on the banks of the Arnon River and move aimlessly back and forth, like birds driven from their nest.
ISA.16.3	They say to the people of Judah, “Tell us what to do. Protect us like a tree that casts a cool shadow in the heat of noon, and let us rest in your shade. We are refugees; hide us where no one can find us. 
ISA.16.4	Let us stay in your land. Protect us from those who want to destroy us.”
ISA.16.4	(Oppression and destruction will end, and those who are devastating the country will be gone. 
ISA.16.5	Then one of David's descendants will be king, and he will rule the people with faithfulness and love. He will be quick to do what is right, and he will see that justice is done.)
ISA.16.6	The people of Judah say, “We have heard how proud the people of Moab are. We know that they are arrogant and conceited, but their boasts are empty.”
ISA.16.7	The people of Moab will weep because of the troubles they suffer. They will all weep when they remember the fine food they used to eat in the city of Kir Heres. They will be driven to despair. 
ISA.16.8	The farms near Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah are destroyed—those vineyards whose wine used to make the rulers of the nations drunk. At one time the vines spread as far as the city of Jazer, and eastward into the desert, and westward to the other side of the Dead Sea. 
ISA.16.9	Now I weep for Sibmah's vines as I weep for Jazer. My tears fall for Heshbon and Elealeh, because there is no harvest to make the people glad. 
ISA.16.10	No one is happy now in the fertile fields. No one shouts or sings in the vineyards. No one tramples grapes to make wine; the shouts of joy are ended.
ISA.16.11	I groan with sadness for Moab, with grief for Kir Heres. 
ISA.16.12	The people of Moab wear themselves out going to their mountain shrines and to their temples to pray, but it will do them no good.
ISA.16.13	That is the message the 
ISA.16.14	And now the 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Syria will be deserted forever.
ISA.17.3	Israel will be defenseless, and Damascus will lose its independence. Those Syrians who survive will be in disgrace like the people of Israel. I, the 
ISA.17.4	The 
ISA.17.5	Israel will be like a field where the grain has been cut and harvested, as desolate as a field in Rephaim Valley when it has been picked bare. 
ISA.17.6	Only a few people will survive, and Israel will be like an olive tree from which all the olives have been picked except two or three at the very top, or a few that are left on the lower branches. I, the 
ISA.17.7	When that day comes, people will turn for help to their Creator, the holy God of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	They will no longer rely on the altars they made with their own hands, or trust in their own handiwork—symbols of the goddess Asherah and altars for burning incense.
ISA.17.9	When that day comes, well-defended cities will be deserted and left in ruins like the cities that the Hivites and the Amorites
ISA.17.10	Israel, you have forgotten the God who rescues you and protects you like a mighty rock. Instead, you plant sacred gardens
ISA.17.11	But even if they sprouted and blossomed the very morning you planted them, there would still be no harvest. There would be only trouble and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Powerful nations are in commotion with a sound like the roar of the sea, like the crashing of huge waves. 
ISA.17.13	The nations advance like rushing waves, but God reprimands them and they retreat, driven away like dust on a mountainside, like straw in a whirlwind. 
ISA.17.14	At evening they cause terror, but by morning they are gone. That is the fate of everyone who plunders our land.
ISA.18.2	From that land ambassadors come down the Nile in boats made of reeds. Go back home, swift messengers! Take a message back to your land divided by rivers, to your strong and powerful nation, to your tall and smooth-skinned people, who are feared all over the world.
ISA.18.3	Listen, everyone who lives on earth! Look for a signal flag to be raised on the mountaintops! Listen for the blowing of the bugle! 
ISA.18.4	The 
ISA.18.5	Before the grapes are gathered, when the blossoms have all fallen and the grapes are ripening, the enemy will destroy the Ethiopians
ISA.18.6	The corpses of their soldiers will be left exposed to the birds and the wild animals. In summer the birds will feed on them, and in winter, the animals.”
ISA.18.7	A time is coming when the 
ISA.19.1	The 
ISA.19.2	The 
ISA.19.3	I am going to frustrate the plans of the Egyptians and destroy their morale. They will ask their idols to help them, and they will go and consult mediums and ask the spirits of the dead for advice. 
ISA.19.4	I will hand the Egyptians over to a tyrant, to a cruel king who will rule them. I, the 
ISA.19.5	The water will be low in the Nile, and the river will gradually dry up. 
ISA.19.6	The channels of the river will stink as they slowly go dry. Reeds and rushes will wither, 
ISA.19.7	and all the crops planted along the banks of the Nile will dry up and be blown away. 
ISA.19.8	Everyone who earns a living by fishing in the Nile will groan and cry; their hooks and their nets will be useless. 
ISA.19.9	Those who make linen cloth will be in despair; 
ISA.19.10	weavers and skilled workers will be broken and depressed.
ISA.19.11	The leaders of the city of Zoan are fools! Egypt's wisest people give stupid advice! How do they dare to tell the king that they are successors to the ancient scholars and kings? 
ISA.19.12	King of Egypt, where are those clever advisers of yours? Perhaps they can tell you what plans the 
ISA.19.13	The leaders of Zoan and Memphis are fools. They were supposed to lead the nation, but they have misled it. 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	No one in Egypt, rich or poor, important or unknown, can offer help.
ISA.19.16	A time is coming when the people of Egypt will be as timid as women. They will tremble in terror when they see that the 
ISA.19.17	The people of Egypt will be terrified of Judah every time they are reminded of the fate that the 
ISA.19.18	When that time comes, the Hebrew language will be spoken in five Egyptian cities. The people there will take their oaths in the name of the 
ISA.19.19	When that time comes, there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	They will be symbols of the 
ISA.19.21	The 
ISA.19.22	The 
ISA.19.23	When that time comes, there will be a highway between Egypt and Assyria. The people of these two countries will travel back and forth between them, and the two nations will worship together. 
ISA.19.24	When that time comes, Israel will rank with Egypt and Assyria, and these three nations will be a blessing to all the world. 
ISA.19.25	The 
ISA.20.1	Under the orders of Emperor Sargon of Assyria, the commander-in-chief of the Assyrian army attacked the Philistine city of Ashdod. 
ISA.20.2	Three years earlier the 
ISA.20.3	When Ashdod was captured, the 
ISA.20.4	The emperor of Assyria will lead away naked the prisoners he captures from those two countries. Young and old, they will walk barefoot and naked, with their buttocks exposed, bringing shame on Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	Those who have put their trust in Ethiopia
ISA.20.6	When that time comes, the people who live along the coast of Philistia will say, ‘Look at what has happened to the people we relied on to protect us from the emperor of Assyria! How will we ever survive?’”
ISA.21.1	This is a message about Babylonia.
ISA.21.1	Like a whirlwind sweeping across the desert, disaster will come from a terrifying land. 
ISA.21.2	I have seen a vision of cruel events, a vision of betrayal and destruction.
ISA.21.2	Army of Elam, attack! Army of Media, lay siege to the cities! God will put an end to the suffering which Babylon has caused.
ISA.21.3	What I saw and heard in the vision has filled me with terror and pain, pain like that of a woman in labor. 
ISA.21.4	My head is spinning, and I am trembling with fear. I had been longing for evening to come, but it has brought me nothing but terror.
ISA.21.5	In the vision a banquet is ready; rugs are spread for the guests to sit on. They are eating and drinking. Suddenly the command rings out: “Officers! Prepare your shields!”
ISA.21.6	Then the Lord said to me, “Go and post a sentry, and tell him to report what he sees. 
ISA.21.7	If he sees riders coming on horseback, two by two, and riders on donkeys and camels, he is to observe them carefully.”
ISA.21.8	The sentry calls out, “Sir, I have been standing guard at my post day and night.”
ISA.21.10	My people Israel, you have been threshed like wheat, but now I have announced to you the good news that I have heard from the 
ISA.21.11	This is a message about Edom.
ISA.21.11	Someone calls to me from Edom, “Sentry, how soon will the night be over? Tell me how soon it will end.”
ISA.21.12	I answer, “Morning is coming, but night will come again. If you want to ask again, come back and ask.”
ISA.21.13	This is a message about Arabia.
ISA.21.13	People of Dedan, you whose caravans camp in the barren country of Arabia, 
ISA.21.14	give water to the thirsty people who come to you. You people of the land of Tema, give food to the refugees. 
ISA.21.15	People are fleeing to escape from swords that are ready to kill them, from bows that are ready to shoot, from all the dangers of war.
ISA.21.16	Then the Lord said to me, “In exactly one year the greatness of the tribes of Kedar will be at an end. 
ISA.21.17	The archers are the bravest warriors of Kedar, but few of them will be left. I, the 
ISA.22.1	This is a message about the Valley of Vision.
ISA.22.1	What is happening? Why are all the people of the city celebrating on the roofs of the houses? 
ISA.22.2	The whole city is in an uproar, filled with noise and excitement.
ISA.22.2	Your people who died in this war did not die fighting. 
ISA.22.3	All your leaders ran away and were captured before they shot a single arrow. 
ISA.22.4	Now leave me alone to weep bitterly over all those of my people who have died. Don't try to comfort me. 
ISA.22.5	This is a time of panic, defeat, and confusion in the Valley of Vision, and the Sovereign 
ISA.22.6	The soldiers from the land of Elam came riding on horseback, armed with bows and arrows. Soldiers from the land of Kir had their shields ready. 
ISA.22.7	The fertile valleys of Judah were filled with chariots; soldiers on horseback stood in front of Jerusalem's gates. 
ISA.22.8	All of Judah's defenses crumbled.
ISA.22.8	When that happened, you brought weapons out of the arsenal. 
ISA.22.9+ISA.22.10	You found the places where the walls of Jerusalem needed repair. You inspected all the houses in Jerusalem and tore some of them down to get stones to repair the city walls. In order to store water, 
ISA.22.11	you built a reservoir inside the city to hold the water flowing down from the old pool. But you paid no attention to God, who planned all this long ago and who caused it to happen.
ISA.22.12	The Sovereign 
ISA.22.13	 Instead, you laughed and celebrated. You killed sheep and cattle to eat, and you drank wine. You said, “We might as well eat and drink! Tomorrow we'll be dead.”
ISA.22.14	The Sovereign 
ISA.22.15	The Sovereign 
ISA.22.16	“Who do you think you are? What right do you have to carve a tomb for yourself out of the rocky hillside? 
ISA.22.17	You may be important, but the 
ISA.22.18	He will pick you up like a ball and throw you into a much larger country. You will die there beside the chariots you were so proud of. You are a disgrace to your master's household. 
ISA.22.19	The 
ISA.22.20	The 
ISA.22.21	I will put your official robe and belt on him and give him all the authority you have had. He will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah. 
ISA.22.22	 I will give him complete authority under the king, the descendant of David. He will have the keys of office; what he opens, no one will shut, and what he shuts, no one will open. 
ISA.22.23	I will fasten him firmly in place like a peg, and he will be a source of honor to his whole family.
ISA.22.24	“But all his relatives and dependents will become a burden to him. They will hang on him like pots and bowls hanging from a peg! 
ISA.22.25	When that happens, the peg that was firmly fastened will pull loose and fall. And that will be the end of everything that was hanging on it.” The 
ISA.23.1	Howl with grief, you sailors out on the ocean! Your home port of Tyre has been destroyed; its houses and its harbor are in ruins. As your ships return from Cyprus, you learn the news. 
ISA.23.2	Wail, you merchants of Sidon! You sent agents 
ISA.23.3	across the sea to buy and sell the grain that grew in Egypt and to do business with all the nations.
ISA.23.4	City of Sidon, you are disgraced! The sea and the great ocean depths disown you and say, “I never had any children. I never raised sons or daughters.”
ISA.23.5	Even the Egyptians will be shocked and dismayed when they learn that Tyre has been destroyed.
ISA.23.6	Howl with grief, you people of Phoenicia! Try to escape to Spain! 
ISA.23.7	Can this be the joyful city of Tyre, founded so long ago? Is this the city that sent settlers across the sea to establish colonies? 
ISA.23.8	Who was it that planned to bring all this on Tyre, that imperial city, whose merchant princes were the most honored men on earth? 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Go and farm the land, you people in the colonies in Spain! There is no one to protect you any more.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.12	City of Sidon, your happiness has ended, and your people are oppressed. Even if they escape to Cyprus, they will still not be safe.
ISA.23.13	(It was the Babylonians, not the Assyrians, who let the wild animals overrun Tyre. It was the Babylonians who put up siege towers, tore down the fortifications of Tyre, and left the city in ruins.
ISA.23.14	Howl with grief, you sailors out on the ocean! The city you relied on has been destroyed.
ISA.23.15	A time is coming when Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the lifetime of a king. When those years are over, Tyre will be like the prostitute in the song:
ISA.23.16	Take your harp, go round the town,
ISA.23.16	you poor forgotten whore!
ISA.23.16	Play and sing your songs again
ISA.23.16	to bring men back once more.
ISA.23.17	When the seventy years are over, the 
ISA.23.18	The money she earns by commerce will be dedicated to the 
ISA.24.1	The 
ISA.24.2	Everyone will meet the same fate—the priests and the people, slaves and masters, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, rich and poor. 
ISA.24.3	The earth will lie shattered and ruined. The 
ISA.24.4	The earth dries up and withers; the whole world grows weak; both earth and sky decay. 
ISA.24.5	The people have defiled the earth by breaking God's laws and by violating the covenant he made to last forever. 
ISA.24.6	So God has pronounced a curse on the earth. Its people are paying for what they have done. Fewer and fewer remain alive. 
ISA.24.7	The grapevines wither, and wine is becoming scarce. Everyone who was once happy is now sad, 
ISA.24.8	and the joyful music of their harps and drums has ceased. 
ISA.24.9	There is no more happy singing over wine; no one enjoys its taste any more. 
ISA.24.10	In the city everything is in chaos, and people lock themselves in their houses for safety. 
ISA.24.11	People shout in the streets because there is no more wine. Happiness is gone forever; it has been banished from the land. 
ISA.24.12	The city is in ruins, and its gates have been broken down. 
ISA.24.13	This is what will happen in every nation all over the world. It will be like the end of harvest, when the olives have been beaten off every tree and the last grapes picked from the vines.
ISA.24.14	Those who survive will sing for joy. Those in the West will tell how great the 
ISA.24.15	and those in the East will praise him. The people who live along the sea will praise the 
ISA.24.16	From the most distant parts of the world we will hear songs in praise of Israel, the righteous nation.
ISA.24.16	But there is no hope for me! I am wasting away! Traitors continue to betray, and their treachery grows worse and worse. 
ISA.24.17	Listen to me, everyone! There are terrors, pits, and traps waiting for you. 
ISA.24.18	Anyone who tries to escape from the terror will fall in a pit, and anyone who escapes from the pit will be caught in a trap. Torrents of rain will pour from the sky, and earth's foundations will shake. 
ISA.24.19	The earth will crack and shatter and split open. 
ISA.24.20	The earth itself will stagger like a drunk, sway like a hut in a storm. The world is weighed down by its sins; it will collapse and never rise again.
ISA.24.21	A time is coming when the 
ISA.24.22	God will crowd kings together like prisoners in a pit. He will shut them in prison until the time of their punishment comes. 
ISA.24.23	The moon will grow dark, and the sun will no longer shine, for the 
ISA.25.1	I will honor you and praise your name.
ISA.25.1	You have done amazing things;
ISA.25.1	you have faithfully carried out
ISA.25.1	the plans you made long ago.
ISA.25.2	You have turned cities into ruins
ISA.25.2	and destroyed their fortifications.
ISA.25.2	The palaces which our enemies built
ISA.25.2	are gone forever.
ISA.25.3	The people of powerful nations will praise you;
ISA.25.3	you will be feared in the cities of cruel nations.
ISA.25.4	The poor and the helpless have fled to you
ISA.25.4	and have been safe in times of trouble.
ISA.25.4	You give them shelter from storms
ISA.25.4	and shade from the burning heat.
ISA.25.4	Cruel enemies attack like a winter storm,
ISA.25.5	like drought in a dry land.
ISA.25.5	But you, 
ISA.25.5	you silence the shouts of cruel people,
ISA.25.5	as a cloud cools a hot day.
ISA.25.6	Here on Mount Zion the 
ISA.25.7	Here he will suddenly remove the cloud of sorrow that has been hanging over all the nations. 
ISA.25.8	 The Sovereign 
ISA.25.9	When it happens, everyone will say, “He is our God! We have put our trust in him, and he has rescued us. He is the 
ISA.25.11	They will reach out their hands as if they were trying to swim, but God will humiliate them, and their hands will sink helplessly. 
ISA.25.12	He will destroy the fortresses of Moab with their high walls and bring them tumbling down into the dust.
ISA.26.1	A day is coming when the people will sing this song in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	Our city is strong!
ISA.26.1	God himself defends its walls!
ISA.26.2	Open the city gates
ISA.26.2	and let the faithful nation enter,
ISA.26.2	the nation whose people do what is right.
ISA.26.3	You, 
ISA.26.3	to those who keep their purpose firm
ISA.26.3	and put their trust in you.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	he will always protect us.
ISA.26.5	He has humbled those who were proud;
ISA.26.5	he destroyed the strong city they lived in,
ISA.26.5	and sent its walls crashing into the dust.
ISA.26.6	Those who were oppressed walk over it now
ISA.26.6	and trample it under their feet.
ISA.26.7	the road they travel is level.
ISA.26.8	We follow your will and put our hope in you;
ISA.26.8	you are all that we desire.
ISA.26.9	At night I long for you with all my heart;
ISA.26.9	when you judge the earth and its people,
ISA.26.9	they will all learn what justice is.
ISA.26.10	Even though you are kind to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	they never learn to do what is right.
ISA.26.10	Even here in a land of righteous people
ISA.26.10	they still do wrong;
ISA.26.10	they refuse to recognize your greatness.
ISA.26.11	let them suffer the punishment you have prepared.
ISA.26.11	Show them how much you love your people.
ISA.26.12	You will give us prosperity, 
ISA.26.12	everything that we achieve
ISA.26.12	is the result of what you do.
ISA.26.13	but you alone are our 
ISA.26.14	Now they are dead and will not live again;
ISA.26.14	their ghosts will not rise,
ISA.26.14	for you have punished them and destroyed them.
ISA.26.14	No one remembers them any more.
ISA.26.15	enlarging its territory on every side;
ISA.26.15	and this has brought you honor.
ISA.26.16	You punished your people, 
ISA.26.16	and in anguish they prayed to you.
ISA.26.17	You, 
ISA.26.17	as a woman in labor cries out in pain.
ISA.26.18	We were in pain and agony,
ISA.26.18	but we gave birth to nothing.
ISA.26.18	We have won no victory for our land;
ISA.26.18	we have accomplished nothing.
ISA.26.19	Those of our people who have died will live again!
ISA.26.19	Their bodies will come back to life.
ISA.26.19	All those sleeping in their graves
ISA.26.19	will wake up and sing for joy.
ISA.26.19	As the sparkling dew refreshes the earth,
ISA.26.19	so the 
ISA.26.20	Go into your houses, my people, and shut the door behind you. Hide yourselves for a little while until God's anger is over. 
ISA.26.21	The 
ISA.27.2	On that day the 
ISA.27.3	“I watch over it and water it continually. I guard it night and day so that no one will harm it. 
ISA.27.4	I am no longer angry with the vineyard. If there were thorns and briers to fight against, I would burn them up completely. 
ISA.27.5	But if the enemies of my people want my protection, let them make peace with me. Yes, let them make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	In the days to come the people of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, will take root like a tree, and they will blossom and bud. The earth will be covered with the fruit they produce.
ISA.27.7	Israel has not been punished by the 
ISA.27.8	The 
ISA.27.9	But Israel's sins will be forgiven only when the stones of pagan altars are ground up like chalk, and no more incense altars or symbols of the goddess Asherah are left.
ISA.27.10	The fortified city lies in ruins. It is deserted like an empty wilderness. It has become a pasture for cattle, where they can rest and graze. 
ISA.27.11	The branches of the trees are withered and broken, and women gather them for firewood. Because the people have understood nothing, God their Creator will not pity them or show them any mercy.
ISA.27.12	On that day, from the Euphrates to the Egyptian border, the 
ISA.27.13	When that day comes, a trumpet will be blown to call back from Assyria and Egypt all the Israelites who are in exile there. They will come and worship the 
ISA.28.1	The kingdom of Israel is doomed! Its glory is fading like the crowns of flowers on the heads of its drunken leaders. Their proud heads are well perfumed, but there they lie, dead drunk. 
ISA.28.2	The Lord has someone strong and powerful ready to attack them, someone who will come like a hailstorm, like a torrent of rain, like a rushing, overpowering flood, and will overwhelm the land. 
ISA.28.3	The pride of those drunken leaders will be trampled underfoot. 
ISA.28.4	The fading glory of those proud leaders will disappear like the first figs of the season, picked and eaten as soon as they are ripe.
ISA.28.5	A day is coming when the 
ISA.28.6	He will give a sense of justice to those who serve as judges, and courage to those who defend the city gates from attack.
ISA.28.7	Even the prophets and the priests are so drunk that they stagger. They have drunk so much wine and liquor that they stumble in confusion. The prophets are too drunk to understand the visions that God sends, and the priests are too drunk to decide the cases that are brought to them. 
ISA.28.8	The tables where they sit are all covered with vomit, and not a clean spot is left.
ISA.28.9	They complain about me. They say, “Who does that man think he's teaching? Who needs his message? It's only good for babies that have just stopped nursing! 
ISA.28.10	He is trying to teach us letter by letter, line by line, lesson by lesson.”
ISA.28.12	He offered rest and comfort to all of you, but you refused to listen to him. 
ISA.28.13	That is why the 
ISA.28.14	Now you arrogant leaders who rule here in Jerusalem over this people, listen to what the 
ISA.28.15	 You boast that you have made a treaty with death and reached an agreement with the world of the dead. You are certain that disaster will spare you when it comes, because you depend on lies and deceit to keep you safe. 
ISA.28.16	 This, now, is what the Sovereign 
ISA.28.17	Justice will be the measuring line for the foundation, and honesty will be its plumb line.”
ISA.28.17	Hailstorms will sweep away all the lies you depend on, and floods will destroy your security. 
ISA.28.18	The treaty you have made with death will be abolished, and your agreement with the world of the dead will be canceled. When disaster sweeps down, you will be overcome. 
ISA.28.19	It will strike you again and again, morning after morning. You will have to bear it day and night. Each new message from God will bring new terror! 
ISA.28.20	You will be like the person in the proverb, who tries to sleep in a bed too short to stretch out on, with a blanket too narrow to wrap himself in. 
ISA.28.21	 The 
ISA.28.22	Don't laugh at the warning I am giving you! If you do, it will be even harder for you to escape. I have heard the 
ISA.28.23	Listen to what I am saying; pay attention to what I am telling you. 
ISA.28.24	Farmers don't constantly plow their fields and keep getting them ready for planting. 
ISA.28.25	Once they have prepared the soil, they plant the seeds of herbs such as dill and cumin. They plant rows of wheat and barley,
ISA.28.26	They know how to do their work, because God has taught them. 
ISA.28.27	They never use a heavy club to beat out dill seeds or cumin seeds; instead they use light sticks of the proper size. 
ISA.28.28	They do not ruin the wheat by threshing it endlessly, and they know how to thresh it by driving a cart over it without bruising the grains. 
ISA.28.29	All this wisdom comes from the 
ISA.29.1	God's altar, Jerusalem itself, is doomed! The city where David camped is doomed! Let another year or two come and go, with its feasts and festivals, 
ISA.29.2	and then God will bring disaster on the city that is called “God's altar.” There will be weeping and wailing, and the whole city will be like an altar covered with blood. 
ISA.29.3	God will attack the city, surround it, and besiege it. 
ISA.29.4	Jerusalem will be like a ghost struggling to speak from under the ground, a muffled voice coming from the dust.
ISA.29.5	Jerusalem, all the foreigners who attack you will be blown away like dust, and their terrifying armies will fly away like straw. Suddenly and unexpectedly 
ISA.29.6	the 
ISA.29.7	then all the armies of the nations attacking the city of God's altar, all their weapons and equipment—everything—will vanish like a dream, like something imagined in the night. 
ISA.29.8	All the nations that assemble to attack Jerusalem will be like a starving person who dreams he is eating and wakes up hungry, or like someone dying of thirst who dreams he is drinking and wakes with a dry throat.
ISA.29.9	Go ahead and be stupid! Go ahead and be blind! Get drunk without any wine! Stagger without drinking a drop! 
ISA.29.10	 The 
ISA.29.11	The meaning of every prophetic vision will be hidden from you; it will be like a sealed scroll. If you take it to someone who knows how to read and ask him to read it to you, he will say he can't because it is sealed. 
ISA.29.12	If you give it to someone who can't read and ask him to read it to you, he will answer that he doesn't know how.
ISA.29.14	 So I will startle them with one unexpected blow after another. Those who are wise will turn out to be fools, and all their cleverness will be useless.”
ISA.29.15	Those who try to hide their plans from the 
ISA.29.16	 They turn everything upside down. Which is more important, the potter or the clay? Can something you have made say, “You didn't make me”? Or can it say, “You don't know what you are doing”?
ISA.29.17	As the saying goes, before long the dense forest will become farmland, and the farmland will go back to forest.
ISA.29.18	When that day comes, the deaf will be able to hear a book being read aloud, and the blind, who have been living in darkness, will open their eyes and see. 
ISA.29.19	Poor and humble people will once again find the happiness which the 
ISA.29.20	It will be the end of those who oppress others and show contempt for God. Every sinner will be destroyed. 
ISA.29.21	God will destroy those who slander others, those who prevent the punishment of criminals, and those who tell lies to keep honest people from getting justice.
ISA.29.22	So now the 
ISA.29.23	When you see the children that I will give you, then you will acknowledge that I am the holy God of Israel. You will honor me and stand in awe of me. 
ISA.29.24	Foolish people will learn to understand, and those who are always grumbling will be glad to be taught.”
ISA.30.1	The 
ISA.30.2	They go to Egypt for help without asking for my advice. They want Egypt to protect them, so they put their trust in Egypt's king. 
ISA.30.3	But the king will be powerless to help them, and Egypt's protection will end in disaster. 
ISA.30.4	Although their ambassadors have already arrived at the Egyptian cities of Zoan and Hanes, 
ISA.30.5	the people of Judah will regret that they ever trusted that unreliable nation, a nation that fails them when they expect help.”
ISA.30.6	This is God's message about the animals of the southern desert: “The ambassadors travel through dangerous country, where lions live and where there are poisonous snakes and flying dragons. They load their donkeys and camels with expensive gifts for a nation that cannot give them any help. 
ISA.30.7	The help that Egypt gives is useless. So I have nicknamed Egypt, ‘The Harmless Dragon.’”
ISA.30.8	God told me to write down in a book what the people are like, so that there would be a permanent record of how evil they are. 
ISA.30.9	They are always rebelling against God, always lying, always refusing to listen to the 
ISA.30.10	They tell the prophets to keep quiet. They say, “Don't talk to us about what's right. Tell us what we want to hear. Let us keep our illusions. 
ISA.30.11	Get out of our way and stop blocking our path. We don't want to hear about your holy God of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	But this is what the holy God of Israel says: “You ignore what I tell you and rely on violence and deceit. 
ISA.30.13	You are guilty. You are like a high wall with a crack running down it; suddenly you will collapse. 
ISA.30.14	You will be shattered like a clay pot, so badly broken that there is no piece big enough to pick up hot coals with or to dip water from a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	The Sovereign 
ISA.30.16	Instead, you plan to escape from your enemies by riding fast horses. And you are right—escape is what you will have to do! You think your horses are fast enough, but those who pursue you will be faster! 
ISA.30.17	A thousand of you will run away when you see one enemy soldier, and five soldiers will be enough to make you all run away. Nothing will be left of your army except a lonely flagpole on the top of a hill. 
ISA.30.18	And yet the 
ISA.30.19	You people who live in Jerusalem will not weep any more. The 
ISA.30.20	The Lord will make you go through hard times, but he himself will be there to teach you, and you will not have to search for him any more. 
ISA.30.21	If you wander off the road to the right or the left, you will hear his voice behind you saying, “Here is the road. Follow it.” 
ISA.30.22	You will take your idols plated with silver and your idols covered with gold, and will throw them away like filth, shouting, “Out of my sight!” 
ISA.30.23	Whenever you plant your crops, the Lord will send rain to make them grow and will give you a rich harvest, and your livestock will have plenty of pasture. 
ISA.30.24	The oxen and donkeys that plow your fields will eat the finest and best fodder. 
ISA.30.25	On the day when the forts of your enemies are captured and their people are killed, streams of water will flow from every mountain and every hill. 
ISA.30.26	The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter than usual, like the light of seven days in one. This will all happen when the 
ISA.30.27	The 
ISA.30.28	He sends the wind in front of him like a flood that carries everything away. It sweeps nations to destruction and puts an end to their evil plans. 
ISA.30.29	But you, God's people, will be happy and sing as you do on the night of a sacred festival. You will be as happy as those who walk to the music of flutes on their way to the Temple of the 
ISA.30.30	The 
ISA.30.31	The Assyrians will be terrified when they hear the 
ISA.30.32	As the 
ISA.30.33	Long ago a place was prepared where a huge fire will burn the emperor of Assyria. It is deep and wide, and piled high with wood. The 
ISA.31.1	Those who go to Egypt for help are doomed! They are relying on Egypt's vast military strength—horses, chariots, and soldiers. But they do not rely on the 
ISA.31.2	He knows what he is doing! He sends disaster. He carries out his threats to punish evil people and those who protect them. 
ISA.31.3	The Egyptians are not gods—they are only human. Their horses are not supernatural. When the 
ISA.31.4	The 
ISA.31.5	Just as a bird hovers over its nest to protect its young, so I, the 
ISA.31.6	God said, “People of Israel, you have sinned against me and opposed me. But now, come back to me! 
ISA.31.7	A time is coming when all of you will throw away the sinful idols you made out of silver and gold. 
ISA.31.8	Assyria will be destroyed in war, but not by human power. The Assyrians will run from battle, and their young men will be made slaves. 
ISA.31.9	Their emperor will run away in terror, and the officers will be so frightened that they will abandon their battle flags.” The 
ISA.32.1	Some day there will be a king who rules with integrity, and national leaders who govern with justice. 
ISA.32.2	Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a place to hide from storms. They will be like streams flowing in a desert, like the shadow of a giant rock in a barren land. 
ISA.32.3	Their eyes and ears will be open to the needs of the people. 
ISA.32.4	They will not be impatient any longer, but they will act with understanding and will say what they mean. 
ISA.32.5	No one will think that a fool is honorable or say that a scoundrel is honest. 
ISA.32.6	A fool speaks foolishly and thinks up evil things to do. What he does and what he says are an insult to the 
ISA.32.7	A stupid person is evil and does evil things; he plots to ruin the poor with lies and to keep them from getting their rights. 
ISA.32.8	But an honorable person acts honestly and stands firm for what is right.
ISA.32.9	You women who live an easy life, free from worries, listen to what I am saying. 
ISA.32.10	You may be satisfied now, but this time next year you will be in despair because there will be no grapes for you to gather. 
ISA.32.11	You have been living an easy life, free from worries; but now, tremble with fear! Strip off your clothes and tie rags around your waist. 
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts in grief because the fertile fields and the vineyards have been destroyed, 
ISA.32.13	and thorn bushes and briers are growing on my people's land. Weep for all the houses where people were happy and for the city that was full of life. 
ISA.32.14	Even the palace will be abandoned and the capital city totally deserted. Homes and the forts that guarded them will be in ruins forever. Wild donkeys will roam there, and sheep will find pasture there.
ISA.32.15	But once more God will send us his spirit. The wasteland will become fertile, and fields will produce rich crops. 
ISA.32.16	Everywhere in the land righteousness and justice will be done. 
ISA.32.17	Because everyone will do what is right, there will be peace and security forever. 
ISA.32.18	God's people will be free from worries, and their homes peaceful and safe. 
ISA.32.19	(But hail will fall on the forests, and the city will be torn down.) 
ISA.32.20	How happy everyone will be with plenty of water for the crops and safe pasture everywhere for the donkeys and cattle.
ISA.33.1	Our enemies are doomed! They have robbed and betrayed, although no one has robbed them or betrayed them. But their time to rob and betray will end, and they themselves will become victims of robbery and treachery.
ISA.33.3	When you fight for us, nations run away from the noise of battle. 
ISA.33.4	Their belongings are pounced upon and taken as loot.
ISA.33.5	How great the 
ISA.33.6	and give stability to the nation. He always protects his people and gives them wisdom and knowledge. Their greatest treasure is their reverence for the 
ISA.33.7	The brave are calling for help. The ambassadors who tried to bring about peace are crying bitterly. 
ISA.33.8	The highways are so dangerous that no one travels on them. Treaties are broken and agreements are violated. No one is respected any more. 
ISA.33.9	The land lies idle and deserted. The forests of Lebanon have withered, the fertile valley of Sharon is like a desert, and in Bashan and on Mount Carmel the leaves are falling from the trees.
ISA.33.10	The 
ISA.33.11	You make worthless plans and everything you do is useless. My spirit is like a fire that will destroy you.
ISA.33.12	You will crumble like rocks burned to make lime, like thorns burned to ashes. 
ISA.33.13	Let everyone near and far hear what I have done and acknowledge my power.”
ISA.33.14	The sinful people of Zion are trembling with fright. They say, “God's judgment is like a fire that burns forever. Can any of us survive a fire like that?” 
ISA.33.15	You can survive if you say and do what is right. Don't use your power to cheat the poor and don't accept bribes. Don't join with those who plan to commit murder or to do other evil things. 
ISA.33.16	Then you will be safe; you will be as secure as if in a strong fortress. You will have food to eat and water to drink.
ISA.33.17	Once again you will see a king ruling in splendor over a land that stretches in all directions. 
ISA.33.18	Your old fears of foreign tax collectors and spies will be only a memory. 
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see any arrogant foreigners who speak a language that you can't understand. 
ISA.33.20	Look at Zion, the city where we celebrate our religious festivals. Look at Jerusalem! What a safe place it will be to live in! It will be like a tent that is never moved, whose pegs are never pulled up and whose ropes never break. 
ISA.33.21	The 
ISA.33.22+ISA.33.23	All the rigging on those ships is useless; the sails cannot be spread! We will seize all the wealth of enemy armies, and there will be so much that even the lame can get a share. The 
ISA.33.24	No one who lives in our land will ever again complain of being sick, and all sins will be forgiven.
ISA.34.1	Come, people of all nations! Gather around and listen. Let the whole earth and everyone living on it come here and listen. 
ISA.34.2	The 
ISA.34.3	Their corpses will not be buried, but will lie there rotting and stinking; and the mountains will be red with blood. 
ISA.34.4	 The sun, moon, and stars will crumble to dust. The sky will disappear like a scroll being rolled up, and the stars will fall like leaves dropping from a vine or a fig tree.
ISA.34.6	His sword will be covered with their blood and fat, like the blood and fat of lambs and goats that are sacrificed. The 
ISA.34.7	The people will fall like wild oxen and young bulls, and the earth will be red with blood and covered with fat. 
ISA.34.8	This is the time when the 
ISA.34.9	The rivers of Edom will turn into tar, and the soil will turn into sulfur. The whole country will burn like tar. 
ISA.34.10	 It will burn day and night, and smoke will rise from it forever. The land will lie waste age after age, and no one will ever travel through it again. 
ISA.34.11	Owls and ravens will take over the land. The 
ISA.34.12	There will be no king to rule the country, and the leaders will all be gone.
ISA.34.13	Thorns and thistles will grow up in all the palaces and walled towns, and jackals and owls will live in them. 
ISA.34.14	Wild animals will roam there, and demons will call to each other. The night monster
ISA.34.15	Owls will build their nests, lay eggs, hatch their young, and care for them there. Vultures will gather there, one after another.
ISA.34.16	Search in the 
ISA.34.17	It is the 
ISA.35.1	The desert will rejoice,
ISA.35.1	and flowers will bloom in the wastelands.
ISA.35.2	The desert will sing and shout for joy;
ISA.35.2	it will be as beautiful as the Lebanon Mountains
ISA.35.2	and as fertile as the fields of Carmel and Sharon.
ISA.35.2	Everyone will see the 
ISA.35.2	see his greatness and power.
ISA.35.3	and to knees that tremble with weakness.
ISA.35.4	Tell everyone who is discouraged,
ISA.35.4	“Be strong and don't be afraid!
ISA.35.4	God is coming to your rescue,
ISA.35.4	coming to punish your enemies.”
ISA.35.5	and the deaf will hear.
ISA.35.6	The lame will leap and dance,
ISA.35.6	and those who cannot speak will shout for joy.
ISA.35.6	Streams of water will flow through the desert;
ISA.35.7	the burning sand will become a lake,
ISA.35.7	and dry land will be filled with springs.
ISA.35.7	Where jackals used to live,
ISA.35.7	marsh grass and reeds will grow.
ISA.35.8	There will be a highway there,
ISA.35.8	called “The Road of Holiness.”
ISA.35.8	No sinner will ever travel that road;
ISA.35.8	no fools will mislead those who follow it.
ISA.35.9	No lions will be there;
ISA.35.9	no fierce animals will pass that way.
ISA.35.9	Those whom the 
ISA.35.9	will travel home by that road.
ISA.35.10	They will reach Jerusalem with gladness,
ISA.35.10	singing and shouting for joy.
ISA.35.10	They will be happy forever,
ISA.35.10	forever free from sorrow and grief.
ISA.36.1	In the fourteenth year that Hezekiah was king of Judah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
ISA.36.2	Then he ordered his chief official to go from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large military force to demand that King Hezekiah surrender. The official occupied the road where the cloth makers work, by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. 
ISA.36.3	Three Judeans came out to meet him: the official in charge of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah; the court secretary, Shebna; and the official in charge of the records, Joah son of Asaph. 
ISA.36.4	The Assyrian official told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident. 
ISA.36.5	He demanded, “Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might? Who do you think will help you rebel against Assyria? 
ISA.36.6	 You are expecting Egypt to help you, but that would be like using a reed as a walking stick—it would break and would jab your hand. That is what the king of Egypt is like when anyone relies on him.”
ISA.36.7	The Assyrian official went on, “Or will you tell me that you are relying on the 
ISA.36.8	I will make a bargain with you in the name of the emperor. I will give you two thousand horses if you can find that many riders. 
ISA.36.9	You are no match for even the lowest ranking Assyrian official, and yet you expect the Egyptians to send you chariots and horsemen. 
ISA.36.10	Do you think I have attacked your country and destroyed it without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the official, “Speak Aramaic to us. We understand it. Don't speak Hebrew; all the people on the wall are listening.”
ISA.36.12	He replied, “Do you think you and the king are the only ones the emperor sent me to say all these things to? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall, who will have to eat their excrement and drink their urine, just as you will.”
ISA.36.13	Then the official stood up and shouted in Hebrew, “Listen to what the emperor of Assyria is telling you. 
ISA.36.14	He warns you not to let Hezekiah deceive you. Hezekiah can't save you. 
ISA.36.15	And don't let him persuade you to rely on the 
ISA.36.16	Don't listen to Hezekiah! The emperor of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. You will all be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells— 
ISA.36.17	until the emperor resettles you in a country much like your own, where there are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread. 
ISA.36.18	Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the 
ISA.36.19	Where are they now, the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did anyone save Samaria? 
ISA.36.20	When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our emperor? Then what makes you think the 
ISA.36.21	The people kept quiet, just as King Hezekiah had told them to; they did not say a word. 
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes in grief and went and reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said.
ISA.37.1	As soon as King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes in grief, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple of the 
ISA.37.2	He sent Eliakim, the official in charge of the palace, Shebna, the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They also were wearing sackcloth. 
ISA.37.3	This is the message which he told them to give to Isaiah: “Today is a day of suffering; we are being punished and are in disgrace. We are like a woman who is ready to give birth, but is too weak to do it. 
ISA.37.4	The Assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living God. May the 
ISA.37.5	When Isaiah received King Hezekiah's message, 
ISA.37.6	he sent back this answer: “The 
ISA.37.7	The 
ISA.37.8	The Assyrian official learned that the emperor had left Lachish and was fighting against the nearby city of Libnah; so he went there to consult him. 
ISA.37.9	Word reached the Assyrians that the Egyptian army, led by King Tirhakah of Ethiopia,
ISA.37.10	of Judah to tell him: “The god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands, but don't let that deceive you. 
ISA.37.11	You have heard what an Assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy. Do you think that you can escape? 
ISA.37.12	My ancestors destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and killed the people of Betheden who lived in Telassar, and none of their gods could save them. 
ISA.37.13	Where are the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
ISA.37.14	King Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went to the Temple, placed the letter there in the presence of the 
ISA.37.15	and prayed, 
ISA.37.16	 “Almighty 
ISA.37.17	Now, 
ISA.37.18	We all know, 
ISA.37.19	and burned up their gods—which were no gods at all, only images of wood and stone made by human hands. 
ISA.37.20	Now, 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah sent a message telling King Hezekiah that in answer to the king's prayer 
ISA.37.22	the 
ISA.37.23	Whom do you think you have been insulting and ridiculing? You have been disrespectful to me, the holy God of Israel. 
ISA.37.24	You sent your servants to boast to me that with all your chariots you had conquered the highest mountains of Lebanon. You boasted that there you cut down the tallest cedars and the finest cypress trees, and that you reached the deepest parts of the forests. 
ISA.37.25	You boasted that you dug wells and drank water in foreign lands, and that the feet of your soldiers tramped the Nile River dry.
ISA.37.26	“Have you never heard that I planned all this long ago? And now I have carried it out. I gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble. 
ISA.37.27	The people who lived there were powerless; they were frightened and stunned. They were like grass in a field or weeds growing on a roof when the hot east wind blasts them.
ISA.37.28	“But I know everything about you, what you do and where you go. I know how you rage against me. 
ISA.37.29	I have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours, and now I will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth and will take you back by the same road you came.”
ISA.37.30	Then Isaiah said to King Hezekiah, “Here is a sign of what will happen. This year and next you will have only wild grain to eat, but the following year you will be able to plant grain and harvest it, and plant vines and eat grapes. 
ISA.37.31	Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit. 
ISA.37.32	There will be people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive, because the 
ISA.37.33	“And this is what the 
ISA.37.34	He will go back by the same road he came, without entering this city. I, the 
ISA.37.35	I will defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.’”
ISA.37.36	An angel of the 
ISA.37.37	Then the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	One day when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords and then escaped to the land of Ararat. Another of his sons, Esarhaddon, succeeded him as emperor.
ISA.38.1	About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and said to him, “The 
ISA.38.2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed: 
ISA.38.3	“Remember, 
ISA.38.4	Then the 
ISA.38.5	to go back to Hezekiah and say to him, “I, the 
ISA.38.6	I will rescue you and this city of Jerusalem from the emperor of Assyria, and I will continue to protect the city.”
ISA.38.21	Isaiah told the king to put a paste made of figs on his boil, and he would get well. 
ISA.38.22	Then King Hezekiah asked, “What is the sign to prove that I will be able to go to the Temple?”
ISA.38.7	Isaiah replied, “The 
ISA.38.8	On the stairway built by King Ahaz, the 
ISA.38.9	After Hezekiah recovered from his illness, he wrote this song of praise:
ISA.38.10	I thought that in the prime of life
ISA.38.10	I was going to the world of the dead,
ISA.38.10	Never to live out my life.
ISA.38.11	I thought that in this world of the living
ISA.38.11	I would never again see the 
ISA.38.11	Or any living person.
ISA.38.12	My life was cut off and ended,
ISA.38.12	Like a tent that is taken down,
ISA.38.12	Like cloth that is cut from a loom.
ISA.38.12	I thought that God was ending my life.
ISA.38.13	All night I cried out with pain,
ISA.38.13	As if a lion were breaking my bones.
ISA.38.13	I thought that God was ending my life.
ISA.38.14	My voice was thin and weak,
ISA.38.14	And I moaned like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes grew tired from looking to heaven.
ISA.38.15	What can I say? The 
ISA.38.15	My heart is bitter, and I cannot sleep.
ISA.38.16	Lord, I will live for you, for you alone;
ISA.38.16	Heal me and let me live.
ISA.38.17	My bitterness will turn into peace.
ISA.38.17	You save
ISA.38.17	You forgive all my sins.
ISA.38.18	The dead cannot trust in your faithfulness.
ISA.38.19	It is the living who praise you,
ISA.38.19	As I praise you now.
ISA.38.19	Parents tell their children how faithful you are.
ISA.38.20	We will play harps and sing your praise,
ISA.38.20	Sing praise in your Temple as long as we live.
ISA.39.1	About that same time the king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan, son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been sick, so he sent him a letter and a present. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth—his silver and gold, his spices and perfumes, and all his military equipment. There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them. 
ISA.39.3	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did these messengers come from and what did they say to you?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah answered, “They came from a very distant country, from Babylonia.”
ISA.39.4	“What did they see in the palace?”
ISA.39.4	“They saw everything. There is nothing in the storerooms that I didn't show them.”
ISA.39.5	Isaiah then told the king, “The 
ISA.39.6	a time is coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylonia. Nothing will be left. 
ISA.39.7	 Some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylonia.”
ISA.39.8	King Hezekiah understood this to mean that there would be peace and security during his lifetime, so he replied, “The message you have given me from the 
ISA.40.1	“Comfort my people,” says our God. “Comfort them!
ISA.40.2	Encourage the people of Jerusalem.
ISA.40.2	Tell them they have suffered long enough
ISA.40.2	and their sins are now forgiven.
ISA.40.2	I have punished them in full for all their sins.”
ISA.40.3	“Prepare in the wilderness a road for the 
ISA.40.3	Clear the way in the desert for our God!
ISA.40.4	Fill every valley;
ISA.40.4	level every mountain.
ISA.40.4	The hills will become a plain,
ISA.40.4	and the rough country will be made smooth.
ISA.40.5	Then the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	and all people will see it.
ISA.40.5	The 
ISA.40.6	“What message shall I proclaim?” I ask.
ISA.40.6	“Proclaim that all human beings are like grass;
ISA.40.6	they last no longer than wild flowers.
ISA.40.7	Grass withers and flowers fade
ISA.40.7	when the 
ISA.40.7	People are no more enduring than grass.
ISA.40.8	Yes, grass withers and flowers fade,
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God endures forever.”
ISA.40.9	Jerusalem, go up on a high mountain
ISA.40.9	and proclaim the good news!
ISA.40.9	Call out with a loud voice, Zion;
ISA.40.9	announce the good news!
ISA.40.9	Speak out and do not be afraid.
ISA.40.9	Tell the towns of Judah
ISA.40.9	that their God is coming!
ISA.40.10	bringing with him the people he has rescued.
ISA.40.11	he will gather the lambs together
ISA.40.11	and carry them in his arms;
ISA.40.11	he will gently lead their mothers.
ISA.40.12	Can anyone measure the ocean by handfuls
ISA.40.12	or measure the sky with his hands?
ISA.40.12	Can anyone hold the soil of the earth in a cup
ISA.40.12	or weigh the mountains and hills on scales?
ISA.40.13	Who can teach him or give him advice?
ISA.40.14	With whom does God consult
ISA.40.14	in order to know and understand
ISA.40.14	and to learn how things should be done?
ISA.40.15	no more than a drop of water;
ISA.40.15	the distant islands are as light as dust.
ISA.40.16	All the animals in the forests of Lebanon
ISA.40.16	are not enough for a sacrifice to our God,
ISA.40.16	and its trees are too few to kindle the fire.
ISA.40.17	The nations are nothing at all to him.
ISA.40.18	How can you describe what he is like?
ISA.40.19	He is not like an idol that workers make,
ISA.40.19	that metalworkers cover with gold
ISA.40.19	and set in a base of silver.
ISA.40.20	chooses wood that will not rot.
ISA.40.20	He finds a skillful worker
ISA.40.20	to make an image that won't fall down.
ISA.40.21	Do you not know?
ISA.40.21	Were you not told long ago?
ISA.40.21	Have you not heard how the world began?
ISA.40.22	It was made by the one who sits on his throne
ISA.40.22	above the earth and beyond the sky;
ISA.40.22	the people below look as tiny as ants.
ISA.40.22	He stretched out the sky like a curtain,
ISA.40.22	like a tent in which to live.
ISA.40.23	He brings down powerful rulers
ISA.40.23	and reduces them to nothing.
ISA.40.24	They are like young plants,
ISA.40.24	just set out and barely rooted.
ISA.40.24	When the 
ISA.40.24	they dry up and blow away like straw.
ISA.40.25	To whom can the holy God be compared?
ISA.40.25	Is there anyone else like him?
ISA.40.26	Who created the stars you see?
ISA.40.26	The one who leads them out like an army,
ISA.40.26	he knows how many there are
ISA.40.26	and calls each one by name!
ISA.40.26	His power is so great—
ISA.40.26	not one of them is ever missing!
ISA.40.27	Israel, why then do you complain
ISA.40.27	that the 
ISA.40.27	or care if you suffer injustice?
ISA.40.28	Don't you know? Haven't you heard?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	he created all the world.
ISA.40.28	He never grows tired or weary.
ISA.40.28	No one understands his thoughts.
ISA.40.29	He strengthens those who are weak and tired.
ISA.40.30	Even those who are young grow weak;
ISA.40.30	young people can fall exhausted.
ISA.40.31	But those who trust in the 
ISA.40.31	will find their strength renewed.
ISA.40.31	They will rise on wings like eagles;
ISA.40.31	they will run and not get weary;
ISA.40.31	they will walk and not grow weak.
ISA.41.1	God says,
ISA.41.1	“Be silent and listen to me, you distant lands!
ISA.41.1	Get ready to present your case in court;
ISA.41.1	you will have your chance to speak.
ISA.41.1	Let us come together to decide who is right.
ISA.41.2	“Who was it that brought the conqueror from the east
ISA.41.2	and makes him triumphant wherever he goes?
ISA.41.2	Who gives him victory over kings and nations?
ISA.41.2	His sword strikes them down as if they were dust.
ISA.41.2	His arrows scatter them like straw before the wind.
ISA.41.3	He follows in pursuit and marches safely on,
ISA.41.3	so fast that he hardly touches the ground!
ISA.41.4	Who was it that made this happen?
ISA.41.4	Who has determined the course of history?
ISA.41.4	I, the 
ISA.41.4	and I, the 
ISA.41.5	“The people of distant lands have seen what I have done;
ISA.41.5	they are frightened and tremble with fear.
ISA.41.5	So they all assemble and come.
ISA.41.6	The skilled workers help and encourage each other.
ISA.41.7	The carpenter says to the goldsmith, ‘Well done!’
ISA.41.7	The one who beats the idol smooth
ISA.41.7	encourages the one who nails it together.
ISA.41.7	They say, ‘The soldering is good’—
ISA.41.7	and they fasten the idol in place with nails.
ISA.41.8	you are the people that I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	the descendants of Abraham, my friend.
ISA.41.9	I brought you from the ends of the earth;
ISA.41.9	I called you from its farthest corners
ISA.41.9	and said to you, ‘You are my servant.’
ISA.41.9	I did not reject you, but chose you.
ISA.41.10	Do not be afraid—I am with you!
ISA.41.10	I am your God—let nothing terrify you!
ISA.41.10	I will make you strong and help you;
ISA.41.10	I will protect you and save you.
ISA.41.11	“Those who are angry with you
ISA.41.11	will know the shame of defeat.
ISA.41.11	Those who fight against you will die
ISA.41.12	and will disappear from the earth.
ISA.41.13	I am the 
ISA.41.13	I strengthen you and tell you,
ISA.41.13	‘Do not be afraid; I will help you.’”
ISA.41.14	The 
ISA.41.14	“Small and weak as you are, Israel,
ISA.41.14	don't be afraid; I will help you.
ISA.41.14	I, the holy God of Israel, am the one who saves you.
ISA.41.15	I will make you like a threshing board,
ISA.41.15	with spikes that are new and sharp.
ISA.41.15	You will thresh mountains and destroy them;
ISA.41.15	hills will crumble into dust.
ISA.41.16	You will toss them in the air;
ISA.41.16	the wind will carry them off,
ISA.41.16	and they will be scattered by the storm.
ISA.41.16	Then you will be happy because I am your God;
ISA.41.16	you will praise me, the holy God of Israel.
ISA.41.17	“When my people in their need look for water,
ISA.41.17	when their throats are dry with thirst,
ISA.41.17	then I, the 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will never abandon them.
ISA.41.18	I will make rivers flow among barren hills
ISA.41.18	and springs of water run in the valleys.
ISA.41.18	I will turn the desert into pools of water
ISA.41.18	and the dry land into flowing springs.
ISA.41.19	I will make cedars grow in the desert,
ISA.41.19	and acacias and myrtles and olive trees.
ISA.41.19	Forests will grow in barren land,
ISA.41.19	forests of pine and juniper and cypress.
ISA.41.20	People will see this and know
ISA.41.20	that I, the 
ISA.41.20	They will come to understand
ISA.41.20	that Israel's holy God has made it happen.”
ISA.41.21	The 
ISA.41.21	“You gods of the nations, present your case.
ISA.41.21	Bring the best arguments you have!
ISA.41.22	Come here and predict what will happen,
ISA.41.22	so that we will know it when it takes place.
ISA.41.22	Explain to the court the events of the past,
ISA.41.22	and tell us what they mean.
ISA.41.23	Tell us what the future holds—
ISA.41.23	then we will know that you are gods!
ISA.41.23	Do something good or bring some disaster;
ISA.41.23	fill us with fear and awe!
ISA.41.24	You and all you do are nothing;
ISA.41.24	those who worship you are disgusting!
ISA.41.25	“I have chosen a man who lives in the east;
ISA.41.25	I will bring him to attack from the north.
ISA.41.25	He tramples on rulers as if they were mud,
ISA.41.25	like a potter trampling clay.
ISA.41.26	Which of you predicted that this would happen,
ISA.41.26	so that we could say that you were right?
ISA.41.26	None of you said a word about it;
ISA.41.26	no one heard you say a thing!
ISA.41.27	I, the 
ISA.41.27	I sent a messenger to Jerusalem to say,
ISA.41.27	‘Your people are coming! They are coming home!’
ISA.41.28	When I looked among the gods,
ISA.41.28	none of them had a thing to say;
ISA.41.28	not one could answer the questions I asked.
ISA.41.29	All these gods are useless;
ISA.41.29	they can do nothing at all—
ISA.41.29	these idols are weak and powerless.”
ISA.42.1	“Here is my servant, whom I strengthen—
ISA.42.1	the one I have chosen, with whom I am pleased.
ISA.42.1	I have filled him with my Spirit,
ISA.42.1	and he will bring justice to every nation.
ISA.42.2	He will not shout or raise his voice
ISA.42.2	or make loud speeches in the streets.
ISA.42.3	He will not break off a bent reed
ISA.42.3	nor put out a flickering lamp.
ISA.42.3	He will bring lasting justice to all.
ISA.42.4	He will not lose hope or courage;
ISA.42.4	he will establish justice on the earth.
ISA.42.4	Distant lands eagerly wait for his teaching.”
ISA.42.5	he fashioned the earth and all that lives there;
ISA.42.5	he gave life and breath to all its people.
ISA.42.5	And now the 
ISA.42.6	to see that justice is done on earth.
ISA.42.6	Through you I will make a covenant with all peoples;
ISA.42.6	through you I will bring light to the nations.
ISA.42.7	You will open the eyes of the blind
ISA.42.7	and set free those who sit in dark prisons.
ISA.42.8	“I alone am the 
ISA.42.8	No other god may share my glory;
ISA.42.8	I will not let idols share my praise.
ISA.42.9	The things I predicted have now come true.
ISA.42.9	Now I will tell you of new things
ISA.42.9	even before they begin to happen.”
ISA.42.10	Sing a new song to the 
ISA.42.10	sing his praise, all the world!
ISA.42.10	Praise him, you that sail the sea;
ISA.42.10	praise him, all creatures of the sea!
ISA.42.10	Sing, distant lands and all who live there!
ISA.42.11	Let the desert and its towns praise God;
ISA.42.11	let the people of Kedar praise him!
ISA.42.11	Let those who live in the city of Sela
ISA.42.11	shout for joy from the tops of the mountains!
ISA.42.12	Let those who live in distant lands
ISA.42.12	give praise and glory to the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	he is ready and eager for battle.
ISA.42.13	He gives a war cry, a battle shout;
ISA.42.13	he shows his power against his enemies.
ISA.42.14	God says,
ISA.42.14	“For a long time I kept silent;
ISA.42.14	I did not answer my people.
ISA.42.14	But now the time to act has come;
ISA.42.14	I cry out like a woman in labor.
ISA.42.15	I will destroy the hills and mountains
ISA.42.15	and dry up the grass and trees.
ISA.42.15	I will turn the river valleys into deserts
ISA.42.15	and dry up the pools of water.
ISA.42.16	“I will lead my blind people
ISA.42.16	by roads they have never traveled.
ISA.42.16	I will turn their darkness into light
ISA.42.16	and make rough country smooth before them.
ISA.42.16	These are my promises,
ISA.42.16	and I will keep them without fail.
ISA.42.17	All who trust in idols,
ISA.42.17	who call images their gods,
ISA.42.17	will be humiliated and disgraced.”
ISA.42.18	The 
ISA.42.18	“Listen, you deaf people!
ISA.42.18	Look closely, you that are blind!
ISA.42.19	Is anyone more blind than my servant,
ISA.42.19	more deaf than the messenger I send?
ISA.42.20	Israel, you have seen so much,
ISA.42.20	but what has it meant to you?
ISA.42.20	You have ears to hear with,
ISA.42.20	but what have you really heard?”
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.21	so he exalted his laws and teachings,
ISA.42.21	and he wanted his people to honor them.
ISA.42.22	But now his people have been plundered;
ISA.42.22	they are locked up in dungeons
ISA.42.22	and hidden away in prisons.
ISA.42.22	They were robbed and plundered,
ISA.42.22	with no one to come to their rescue.
ISA.42.23	Will any of you listen to this?
ISA.42.23	From now on will you listen with care?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Israel up to the looters?
ISA.42.24	It was the 
ISA.42.24	We would not live as he wanted us to live
ISA.42.24	or obey the teachings he gave us.
ISA.42.25	So he made us feel the force of his anger
ISA.42.25	and suffer the violence of war.
ISA.42.25	Like fire his anger burned throughout Israel,
ISA.42.25	but we never knew what was happening;
ISA.42.25	we learned nothing at all from it.
ISA.43.1	Israel, the 
ISA.43.1	“Do not be afraid—I will save you.
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name—you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through deep waters, I will be with you;
ISA.43.2	your troubles will not overwhelm you.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through fire, you will not be burned;
ISA.43.2	the hard trials that come will not hurt you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the holy God of Israel, who saves you.
ISA.43.3	I will give up Egypt to set you free;
ISA.43.3	I will give up Ethiopia
ISA.43.4	I will give up whole nations to save your life,
ISA.43.4	because you are precious to me
ISA.43.4	and because I love you and give you honor.
ISA.43.5	Do not be afraid—I am with you!
ISA.43.5	“From the distant east and the farthest west
ISA.43.5	I will bring your people home.
ISA.43.6	I will tell the north to let them go
ISA.43.6	and the south not to hold them back.
ISA.43.6	Let my people return from distant lands,
ISA.43.6	from every part of the world.
ISA.43.7	They are my own people,
ISA.43.7	and I created them to bring me glory.”
ISA.43.8	God says,
ISA.43.8	“Summon my people to court.
ISA.43.8	They have eyes, but they are blind;
ISA.43.8	they have ears, but they are deaf!
ISA.43.9	Summon the nations to come to the trial.
ISA.43.9	Which of their gods can predict the future?
ISA.43.9	Which of them foretold what is happening now?
ISA.43.9	Let these gods bring in their witnesses
ISA.43.9	to prove that they are right,
ISA.43.9	to testify to the truth of their words.
ISA.43.10	“People of Israel, you are my witnesses;
ISA.43.10	I chose you to be my servant,
ISA.43.10	so that you would know me and believe in me
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am the only God.
ISA.43.10	Besides me there is no other god;
ISA.43.10	there never was and never will be.
ISA.43.11	“I alone am the 
ISA.43.11	the only one who can save you.
ISA.43.12	I predicted what would happen,
ISA.43.12	and then I came to your aid.
ISA.43.12	No foreign god has ever done this;
ISA.43.12	you are my witnesses.
ISA.43.13	I am God and always will be.
ISA.43.13	No one can escape from my power;
ISA.43.13	no one can change what I do.”
ISA.43.14	Israel's holy God, the 
ISA.43.14	“To save you, I will send an army against Babylon;
ISA.43.14	I will break down the city gates,
ISA.43.14	and the shouts of her people will turn into crying.

ISA.43.16	a path through the swirling waters.
ISA.43.17	He led a mighty army to destruction,
ISA.43.17	an army of chariots and horses.
ISA.43.17	Down they fell, never to rise,
ISA.43.17	snuffed out like the flame of a lamp!
ISA.43.18	But the 
ISA.43.18	“Do not cling to events of the past
ISA.43.18	or dwell on what happened long ago.
ISA.43.19	Watch for the new thing I am going to do.
ISA.43.19	It is happening already—you can see it now!
ISA.43.19	I will make a road through the wilderness
ISA.43.19	and give you streams of water there.
ISA.43.20	Even the wild animals will honor me;
ISA.43.20	jackals and ostriches will praise me
ISA.43.20	when I make rivers flow in the desert
ISA.43.20	to give water to my chosen people.
ISA.43.21	They are the people I made for myself,
ISA.43.21	and they will sing my praises!”
ISA.43.22	The 
ISA.43.22	“But you were tired of me, Israel;
ISA.43.22	you did not worship me.
ISA.43.23	You did not bring me your burnt offerings of sheep;
ISA.43.23	you did not honor me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I did not burden you by demanding offerings
ISA.43.23	or wear you out by asking for incense.
ISA.43.24	You didn't buy incense for me
ISA.43.24	or satisfy me with the fat of your animals.
ISA.43.24	Instead you burdened me with your sins;
ISA.43.24	you wore me out with the wrongs you have committed.
ISA.43.25	And yet, I am the God who forgives your sins,
ISA.43.25	and I do this because of who I am.
ISA.43.25	I will not hold your sins against you.
ISA.43.26	“Let us go to court; bring your accusation!
ISA.43.26	Present your case to prove you are in the right!
ISA.43.27	Your earliest ancestor
ISA.43.27	your leaders sinned against me,
ISA.43.28	and your rulers profaned
ISA.43.28	So I brought destruction on Israel;
ISA.43.28	I let my own people be insulted.”
ISA.44.1	The 
ISA.44.1	“Listen now, Israel, my servant,
ISA.44.1	my chosen people, the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.44.2	I am the 
ISA.44.2	from the time you were born, I have helped you.
ISA.44.2	Do not be afraid; you are my servant,
ISA.44.2	my chosen people whom I love.
ISA.44.3	“I will give water to the thirsty land
ISA.44.3	and make streams flow on the dry ground.
ISA.44.3	I will pour out my spirit on your children
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your descendants.
ISA.44.4	They will thrive like well-watered grass,
ISA.44.4	like willows by streams of running water.
ISA.44.5	“One by one, people will say, ‘I am the 
ISA.44.5	They will come to join the people of Israel.
ISA.44.5	They each will mark the name of the 
ISA.44.5	and call themselves one of God's people.”
ISA.44.6	the 
ISA.44.6	“I am the first, the last, the only God;
ISA.44.6	there is no other god but me.
ISA.44.7	Could anyone else have done what I did?
ISA.44.7	Who could have predicted all that would happen
ISA.44.7	from the very beginning to the end of time?
ISA.44.8	Do not be afraid, my people!
ISA.44.8	You know that from ancient times until now
ISA.44.8	I have predicted all that would happen,
ISA.44.8	and you are my witnesses.
ISA.44.8	Is there any other god?
ISA.44.8	Is there some powerful god I never heard of?”
ISA.44.9	All those who make idols are worthless, and the gods they prize so highly are useless. Those who worship these gods are blind and ignorant—and they will be disgraced. 
ISA.44.10	It does no good to make a metal image to worship as a god! 
ISA.44.11	Everyone who worships it will be humiliated. The people who make idols are human beings and nothing more. Let them come and stand trial—they will be terrified and will suffer disgrace.
ISA.44.12	The metalworker takes a piece of metal and works with it over a fire. His strong arm swings a hammer to pound the metal into shape. As he works, he gets hungry, thirsty, and tired.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter measures the wood. He outlines a figure with chalk, carves it out with his tools, and makes it in the form of a man, a handsome human figure, to be placed in his house. 
ISA.44.14	He might cut down cedars to use, or choose oak or cypress wood from the forest. Or he might plant a laurel tree and wait for the rain to make it grow. 
ISA.44.15	 A person uses part of a tree for fuel and part of it for making an idol. With one part he builds a fire to warm himself and bake bread; with the other part he makes a god and worships it. 
ISA.44.16	With some of the wood he makes a fire; he roasts meat, eats it, and is satisfied. He warms himself and says, “How nice and warm! What a beautiful fire!” 
ISA.44.17	The rest of the wood he makes into an idol, and then he bows down and worships it. He prays to it and says, “You are my god—save me!”
ISA.44.18	Such people are too stupid to know what they are doing. They close their eyes and their minds to the truth. 
ISA.44.19	The maker of idols hasn't the wit or the sense to say, “Some of the wood I burned up. I baked some bread on the coals, and I roasted meat and ate it. And the rest of the wood I made into an idol. Here I am bowing down to a block of wood!”
ISA.44.20	It makes as much sense
ISA.44.21	The 
ISA.44.21	“Israel, remember this;
ISA.44.21	remember that you are my servant.
ISA.44.21	I created you to be my servant,
ISA.44.21	and I will never forget you.
ISA.44.22	I have swept your sins away like a cloud.
ISA.44.22	Come back to me; I am the one who saves you.”
ISA.44.23	Shout for joy, you heavens!
ISA.44.23	Shout, deep places of the earth!
ISA.44.23	Shout for joy, mountains, and every tree of the forest!
ISA.44.23	The 
ISA.44.23	by saving his people Israel.
ISA.44.24	“I am the 
ISA.44.24	I am the one who created you.
ISA.44.24	I am the 
ISA.44.24	I alone stretched out the heavens;
ISA.44.24	when I made the earth, no one helped me.
ISA.44.25	and frustrate the predictions of astrologers.
ISA.44.25	The words of the wise I refute
ISA.44.25	and show that their wisdom is foolishness.
ISA.44.26	But when my servant makes a prediction,
ISA.44.26	when I send a messenger to reveal my plans,
ISA.44.26	I make those plans and predictions come true.
ISA.44.26	I tell Jerusalem that people will live there again,
ISA.44.26	and the cities of Judah that they will be rebuilt.
ISA.44.26	Those cities will rise from the ruins.
ISA.44.27	With a word of command I dry up the ocean.
ISA.44.28	you will do what I want you to do:
ISA.44.28	you will order that Jerusalem be rebuilt
ISA.44.28	and that the foundations of the Temple be laid.’”

ISA.45.1	To Cyrus the 
ISA.45.2	“I myself will prepare your way,
ISA.45.2	leveling mountains and hills.
ISA.45.2	I will break down bronze gates
ISA.45.2	and smash their iron bars.
ISA.45.3	I will give you treasures from dark, secret places;
ISA.45.3	then you will know that I am the 
ISA.45.3	and that the God of Israel has called you by name.
ISA.45.4	I appoint you to help my servant Israel,
ISA.45.4	the people that I have chosen.
ISA.45.4	I have given you great honor,
ISA.45.4	although you do not know me.
ISA.45.5	“I am the 
ISA.45.5	I will give you the strength you need,
ISA.45.5	although you do not know me.
ISA.45.6	I do this so that everyone
ISA.45.6	from one end of the world to the other
ISA.45.6	may know that I am the 
ISA.45.6	and that there is no other god.
ISA.45.7	I create both light and darkness;
ISA.45.7	I bring both blessing and disaster.
ISA.45.7	I, the 
ISA.45.8	I will send victory from the sky like rain;
ISA.45.8	the earth will open to receive it
ISA.45.8	and will blossom with freedom and justice.
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	a pot that is like all the others?
ISA.45.9	Does the clay ask the potter what he is doing?
ISA.45.9	Does the pot complain that its maker has no skill?
ISA.45.10	Do we dare say to our parents,
ISA.45.10	“Why did you make me like this?”
ISA.45.11	The 
ISA.45.11	the one who shapes the future, says:
ISA.45.11	“You have no right to question me about my children
ISA.45.11	or to tell me what I ought to do!
ISA.45.12	I am the one who made the earth
ISA.45.12	and created human beings to live there.
ISA.45.12	By my power I stretched out the heavens;
ISA.45.12	I control the sun, the moon, and the stars.
ISA.45.13	I myself have stirred Cyrus to action
ISA.45.13	to fulfill my purpose and put things right.
ISA.45.13	I will straighten out every road that he travels.
ISA.45.13	He will rebuild my city, Jerusalem,
ISA.45.13	and set my captive people free.
ISA.45.13	No one has hired him or bribed him to do this.”
ISA.45.13	The 
ISA.45.14	The 
ISA.45.14	“The wealth of Egypt and Ethiopia
ISA.45.14	and the tall men of Seba will be your slaves;
ISA.45.14	they will follow you in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will bow down to you and confess,
ISA.45.14	‘God is with you—he alone is God.
ISA.45.15	The God of Israel, who saves his people,

ISA.45.18	and there is no other god.
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret
ISA.45.19	or kept my purpose hidden.

ISA.46.6	People open their purses and pour out gold;
ISA.46.6	they weigh out silver on the scales.
ISA.46.6	They hire a goldsmith to make a god;
ISA.46.6	then they bow down and worship it.
ISA.46.7	They lift it to their shoulders and carry it;
ISA.46.7	they put it in place, and there it stands,
ISA.46.7	unable to move from where it is.
ISA.46.7	If any pray to it, it cannot answer
ISA.46.7	or save them from disaster.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, you sinners;
ISA.46.8	consider what I have done.
ISA.46.9	Remember what happened long ago;
ISA.46.9	acknowledge that I alone am God
ISA.46.9	and that there is no one else like me.
ISA.46.10	From the beginning I predicted the outcome;
ISA.46.10	long ago I foretold what would happen.
ISA.46.10	I said that my plans would never fail,
ISA.46.10	that I would do everything I intended to do.
ISA.46.11	I am calling a man to come from the east;
ISA.46.11	he will swoop down like a hawk
ISA.46.11	and accomplish what I have planned.
ISA.46.11	I have spoken, and it will be done.
ISA.46.12	“Listen to me, you stubborn people
ISA.46.12	who think that victory is far away.
ISA.46.13	I am bringing the day of victory near—
ISA.46.13	it is not far away at all.
ISA.46.13	My triumph will not be delayed.
ISA.46.13	I will save Jerusalem
ISA.46.13	and bring honor to Israel there.”
ISA.47.1	“Babylon, come down from your throne,
ISA.47.1	and sit in the dust on the ground.
ISA.47.1	You were once like a virgin, a city unconquered,
ISA.47.1	but you are soft and delicate no longer!
ISA.47.1	You are now a slave!
ISA.47.2	Turn the millstone! Grind the flour!
ISA.47.2	Off with your veil! Strip off your fine clothes!
ISA.47.2	Lift up your skirts to cross the streams!
ISA.47.3	People will see you naked;
ISA.47.3	they will see you humbled and shamed.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance, and no one will stop me.”
ISA.47.4	The holy God of Israel sets us free—
ISA.47.4	his name is the 
ISA.47.5	The 
ISA.47.5	“Sit in silence and darkness;
ISA.47.5	no more will they call you the queen of nations!
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people;
ISA.47.6	I treated them as no longer mine:
ISA.47.6	I put them in your power,
ISA.47.6	and you showed them no mercy;
ISA.47.6	even the aged you treated harshly.
ISA.47.7	You thought you would always be a queen,
ISA.47.7	and did not take these things to heart
ISA.47.7	or think how it all would end.
ISA.47.8	you that think you are safe and secure.
ISA.47.8	You claim you are as great as God—
ISA.47.8	that there is no one else like you.
ISA.47.8	You thought that you would never be a widow
ISA.47.8	or suffer the loss of your children.
ISA.47.9	But in a moment, in a single day,
ISA.47.9	both of these things will happen.
ISA.47.9	In spite of all the magic you use,
ISA.47.9	you will lose your husband and children.
ISA.47.10	“You felt sure of yourself in your evil;
ISA.47.10	you thought that no one could see you.
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray,
ISA.47.10	and you said to yourself, ‘I am God—
ISA.47.10	there is no one else like me.’
ISA.47.11	Disaster will come upon you,
ISA.47.11	and none of your magic can stop it.
ISA.47.11	Ruin will come on you suddenly—
ISA.47.11	ruin you never dreamed of!
ISA.47.12	Keep all your magic spells and charms;
ISA.47.12	you have used them since you were young.
ISA.47.12	Perhaps they will be of some help to you;
ISA.47.12	perhaps you can frighten your enemies.
ISA.47.13	You are powerless in spite of the advice you get.
ISA.47.13	Let your astrologers come forward and save you—
ISA.47.13	those people who study the stars,
ISA.47.13	who map out the zones of the heavens
ISA.47.13	and tell you from month to month
ISA.47.13	what
ISA.47.14	“They will be like bits of straw,
ISA.47.14	and a fire will burn them up!
ISA.47.14	They will not even be able to save themselves—
ISA.47.14	the flames will be too hot for them,
ISA.47.14	not a cozy fire to warm themselves by.
ISA.47.15	That is all the good they will do you—
ISA.47.15	those astrologers you've consulted all your life.
ISA.47.15	They all will leave you and go their own way,
ISA.47.15	and none will be left to save you.”
ISA.48.1	Listen to this, people of Israel,
ISA.48.1	you that are descended from Judah:
ISA.48.1	You swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and claim to worship the God of Israel—
ISA.48.1	but you don't mean a word you say.
ISA.48.2	And yet you are proud to say
ISA.48.2	that you are citizens of the holy city
ISA.48.2	and that you depend on Israel's God,
ISA.48.2	whose name is the 
ISA.48.3	The 
ISA.48.3	“Long ago I predicted what would take place;
ISA.48.3	then suddenly I made it happen.
ISA.48.4	I knew that you would prove to be stubborn,
ISA.48.4	as rigid as iron and unyielding as bronze.
ISA.48.5	And so I predicted your future long ago,
ISA.48.5	announcing events before they took place,
ISA.48.5	to keep you from claiming
ISA.48.5	that your idols and images made them happen.
ISA.48.6	“All I foretold has now taken place;
ISA.48.6	you have to admit my predictions were right.
ISA.48.6	Now I will tell you of new things to come,
ISA.48.6	events that I did not reveal before.
ISA.48.7	Only now am I making them happen;
ISA.48.7	nothing like this took place in the past.
ISA.48.7	If it had, you would claim that you knew all about it.
ISA.48.8	I knew that you couldn't be trusted,
ISA.48.8	that you have always been known as a rebel.
ISA.48.8	That is why you never heard of this at all,
ISA.48.8	why no word of it ever came to your ears.
ISA.48.9	“In order that people will praise my name,
ISA.48.9	I am holding my anger in check;
ISA.48.9	I am keeping it back and will not destroy you.
ISA.48.10	I have tested you in the fire of suffering,
ISA.48.10	as silver is refined in a furnace.
ISA.48.10	But I have found that you are worthless.
ISA.48.11	What I do is done for my own sake—
ISA.48.11	I will not let my name be dishonored
ISA.48.11	or let anyone else share the glory
ISA.48.11	that should be mine and mine alone.”
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, Israel, the people I have called!
ISA.48.12	I am God, the first, the last, the only God!
ISA.48.13	My hands made the earth's foundations
ISA.48.13	and spread the heavens out.
ISA.48.13	When I summon earth and sky,
ISA.48.13	they come at once and present themselves.
ISA.48.14	“Assemble and listen, all of you!
ISA.48.14	None of the gods could predict
ISA.48.14	that the man I have chosen would attack Babylon;
ISA.48.14	he will do what I want him to do.
ISA.48.15	I am the one who spoke and called him;
ISA.48.15	I led him out and gave him success.
ISA.48.16	“Now come close to me and hear what I say.
ISA.48.16	From the beginning I have spoken openly
ISA.48.16	and have always made my words come true.”
ISA.48.16	(Now the Sovereign 
ISA.48.17	The holy God of Israel,
ISA.48.17	the 
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	the one who wants to teach you for your own good
ISA.48.17	and direct you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	“If only you had listened to my commands!
ISA.48.18	Then blessings would have flowed for you
ISA.48.18	like a stream that never goes dry.
ISA.48.18	Victory would have come to you
ISA.48.18	like the waves that roll on the shore.
ISA.48.19	Your descendants would be as numerous as grains of sand,
ISA.48.19	and I would have made sure they were never destroyed.”
ISA.48.20	Shout the news gladly; make it known everywhere:
ISA.48.20	“The 
ISA.48.21	When the 
ISA.48.21	they did not suffer from thirst.
ISA.48.21	He made water come from a rock for them;
ISA.48.21	he split the rock open, and water flowed out.
ISA.49.1	you people who live far away!
ISA.49.1	Before I was born, the 
ISA.49.1	and appointed me to be his servant.
ISA.49.2	With his own hand he protected me.
ISA.49.2	He made me like an arrow,
ISA.49.2	sharp and ready for use.
ISA.49.3	He said to me, “Israel, you are my servant;
ISA.49.3	because of you, people will praise me.”
ISA.49.4	I said, “I have worked, but how hopeless it is!
ISA.49.4	I have used up my strength, but have accomplished nothing.”
ISA.49.4	Yet I can trust the 
ISA.49.4	he will reward me for what I do.
ISA.49.5	Before I was born, the 
ISA.49.5	he made me his servant to bring back his people,
ISA.49.5	to bring back the scattered people of Israel.
ISA.49.5	The 
ISA.49.5	he is the source of my strength.
ISA.49.6	“I have a greater task for you, my servant.
ISA.49.6	Not only will you restore to greatness
ISA.49.6	the people of Israel who have survived,
ISA.49.6	but I will also make you a light to the nations—
ISA.49.6	so that all the world may be saved.”
ISA.49.7	Israel's holy God and savior says
ISA.49.7	to the one who is deeply despised,
ISA.49.7	who is hated by the nations
ISA.49.7	and is the servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings will see you released
ISA.49.7	and will rise to show their respect;
ISA.49.7	princes also will see it,
ISA.49.7	and they will bow low to honor you.”
ISA.49.7	This will happen because the 
ISA.49.7	the holy God of Israel keeps his promises.
ISA.49.8	“When the time comes to save you, I will show you favor
ISA.49.8	and answer your cries for help.
ISA.49.8	I will guard and protect you
ISA.49.8	and through you make a covenant with all peoples.
ISA.49.8	I will let you settle once again
ISA.49.8	in your land that is now laid waste.
ISA.49.9	I will say to the prisoners, ‘Go free!’
ISA.49.9	and to those who are in darkness,
ISA.49.9	‘Come out to the light!’
ISA.49.9	They will be like sheep that graze on the hills;
ISA.49.10	Sun and desert heat will not hurt them,
ISA.49.10	for they will be led by one who loves them.
ISA.49.10	He will lead them to springs of water.
ISA.49.11	“I will make a highway across the mountains
ISA.49.11	and prepare a road for my people to travel.
ISA.49.12	My people will come from far away,
ISA.49.12	from the north and the west,
ISA.49.12	and from Aswan
ISA.49.13	Sing, heavens! Shout for joy, earth!
ISA.49.13	Let the mountains burst into song!
ISA.49.13	The 
ISA.49.13	he will have pity on his suffering people.
ISA.49.14	But the people of Jerusalem said,
ISA.49.14	“The 
ISA.49.14	He has forgotten us.”
ISA.49.15	So the 
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her own baby
ISA.49.15	and not love the child she bore?
ISA.49.15	Even if a mother should forget her child,
ISA.49.15	I will never forget you.
ISA.49.16	Jerusalem, I can never forget you!
ISA.49.16	I have written your name on the palms of my hands.
ISA.49.17	“Those who will rebuild you are coming soon,
ISA.49.17	and those who destroyed you will leave.
ISA.49.18	Look around and see what is happening!
ISA.49.18	Your people are assembling—they are coming home!
ISA.49.18	As surely as I am the living God,
ISA.49.18	you will be proud of your people,
ISA.49.18	as proud as a bride is of her jewels.
ISA.49.19	“Your country was ruined and desolate—
ISA.49.19	but now it will be too small
ISA.49.19	for those who are coming to live there.
ISA.49.19	And those who left you in ruins
ISA.49.19	will be far removed from you.
ISA.49.20	Your people who were born in exile
ISA.49.20	will one day say to you,
ISA.49.20	‘This land is too small—
ISA.49.20	we need more room to live in!’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say to yourself,
ISA.49.21	‘Who bore all these children for me?
ISA.49.21	I lost my children and could have no more.
ISA.49.21	I was exiled and driven away—
ISA.49.21	who brought these children up?
ISA.49.21	I was left all alone—
ISA.49.21	where did these children come from?’”
ISA.49.22	“I will signal to the nations,
ISA.49.22	and they will bring your children home.
ISA.49.23	Kings will be like fathers to you;
ISA.49.23	queens will be like mothers.
ISA.49.23	They will bow low before you and honor you;
ISA.49.23	they will humbly show their respect for you.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	no one who waits for my help will be disappointed.”
ISA.49.24	Can you take away a soldier's loot?
ISA.49.24	Can you rescue the prisoners of a tyrant?
ISA.49.25	The 
ISA.49.25	“That is just what is going to happen.
ISA.49.25	The soldier's prisoners will be taken away,
ISA.49.25	and the tyrant's loot will be seized.
ISA.49.25	I will fight against whoever fights you,
ISA.49.25	and I will rescue your children.
ISA.49.26	I will make your oppressors kill each other;
ISA.49.26	they will be drunk with murder and rage.
ISA.49.26	Then all people will know that I am the 
ISA.49.26	the one who saves you and sets you free.
ISA.49.26	They will know that I am Israel's powerful God.”
ISA.50.1	“Do you think I sent my people away
ISA.50.1	like a man who divorces his wife?
ISA.50.1	Where, then, are the papers of divorce?
ISA.50.1	Do you think I sold you into captivity
ISA.50.1	like a man who sells his children as slaves?
ISA.50.1	No, you went away captive because of your sins;
ISA.50.1	you were sent away because of your crimes.
ISA.50.2	“Why did my people fail to respond
ISA.50.2	when I went to them to save them?
ISA.50.2	Why did they not answer when I called?
ISA.50.2	Am I too weak to save them?
ISA.50.2	I can dry up the sea with a command
ISA.50.2	and turn rivers into a desert,
ISA.50.2	so that the fish in them die for lack of water.
ISA.50.3	I can make the sky turn dark,
ISA.50.3	as if it were in mourning for the dead.”
ISA.50.4	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.4	so that I can strengthen the weary.
ISA.50.4	Every morning he makes me eager
ISA.50.4	to hear what he is going to teach me.
ISA.50.5	The 
ISA.50.5	and I have not rebelled
ISA.50.5	or turned away from him.
ISA.50.6	I did not stop them when they insulted me,
ISA.50.6	when they pulled out the hairs of my beard
ISA.50.6	and spit in my face.
ISA.50.7	But their insults cannot hurt me
ISA.50.7	because the Sovereign 
ISA.50.7	I brace myself to endure them.
ISA.50.7	I know that I will not be disgraced,
ISA.50.8	and he will prove me innocent.
ISA.50.8	Does anyone dare bring charges against me?
ISA.50.8	Let us go to court together!
ISA.50.8	Let him bring his accusation!
ISA.50.9	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.9	who, then, can prove me guilty?
ISA.50.9	All my accusers will disappear;
ISA.50.9	they will vanish like moth-eaten cloth.
ISA.50.10	All of you that honor the 
ISA.50.10	and obey the words of his servant,
ISA.50.10	the path you walk may be dark indeed,
ISA.50.10	but trust in the 
ISA.50.11	All of you that plot to destroy others
ISA.50.11	will be destroyed by your own plots.
ISA.50.11	The 
ISA.50.11	you will suffer a miserable fate.
ISA.51.1	The 
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, you that want to be saved,
ISA.51.1	you that come to me for help.
ISA.51.1	Think of the rock from which you came,
ISA.51.1	the quarry from which you were cut.
ISA.51.2	Think of your ancestor, Abraham,
ISA.51.2	and of Sarah, from whom you are descended.
ISA.51.2	When I called Abraham, he was childless,
ISA.51.2	but I blessed him and gave him children;
ISA.51.2	I made his descendants numerous.
ISA.51.3	“I will show compassion to Jerusalem,
ISA.51.3	to all who live in her ruins.
ISA.51.3	Though her land is a desert, I will make it a garden,
ISA.51.3	like the garden I planted in Eden.
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be there,
ISA.51.3	and songs of praise and thanks to me.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to me, my people,
ISA.51.4	listen to what I say:
ISA.51.4	I give my teaching to the nations;
ISA.51.4	my laws will bring them light.
ISA.51.5	I will come quickly and save them;
ISA.51.5	the time of my victory is near.
ISA.51.5	I myself will rule over the nations.
ISA.51.5	Distant lands wait for me to come;
ISA.51.5	they wait with hope for me to save them.
ISA.51.6	Look up at the heavens; look at the earth!
ISA.51.6	The heavens will disappear like smoke;
ISA.51.6	the earth will wear out like old clothing,
ISA.51.6	and all its people will die like flies.
ISA.51.6	But the deliverance I bring will last forever;
ISA.51.6	my victory will be final.
ISA.51.7	“Listen to me, you that know what is right,
ISA.51.7	who have my teaching fixed in your hearts.
ISA.51.7	Do not be afraid when people taunt and insult you;
ISA.51.8	they will vanish like moth-eaten clothing!
ISA.51.8	But the deliverance I bring will last forever;
ISA.51.8	my victory will endure for all time.”
ISA.51.9	Wake up, 
ISA.51.9	Use your power and save us;
ISA.51.9	use it as you did in ancient times.
ISA.51.9	It was you that cut the sea monster Rahab
ISA.51.10	It was you also who dried up the sea
ISA.51.10	and made a path through the water,
ISA.51.10	so that those you were saving could cross.
ISA.51.11	Those whom you have rescued
ISA.51.11	will reach Jerusalem with gladness,
ISA.51.11	singing and shouting for joy.
ISA.51.11	They will be happy forever,
ISA.51.11	forever free from sorrow and grief.
ISA.51.12	The 
ISA.51.12	“I am the one who strengthens you.
ISA.51.12	Why should you fear mortals,
ISA.51.12	who are no more enduring than grass?
ISA.51.13	Have you forgotten the 
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the heavens
ISA.51.13	and laid the earth's foundations?
ISA.51.13	Why should you live in constant fear
ISA.51.13	of the fury of those who oppress you,
ISA.51.13	of those who are ready to destroy you?
ISA.51.13	Their fury can no longer touch you.
ISA.51.14	Those who are prisoners will soon be set free;
ISA.51.14	they will live a long life
ISA.51.14	and have all the food they need.
ISA.51.15	“I am the 
ISA.51.15	I stir up the sea
ISA.51.15	and make its waves roar.
ISA.51.15	My name is the 
ISA.51.16	I stretched out
ISA.51.16	and laid the earth's foundations;

ISA.51.16	I have given you my teaching,
ISA.51.16	and I protect you with my hand.’”
ISA.51.17	Rouse yourself and get up!
ISA.51.17	You have drunk the cup of punishment
ISA.51.17	that the 
ISA.51.17	you drank it down, and it made you stagger.
ISA.51.18	There is no one to lead you,
ISA.51.18	no one among your people
ISA.51.18	to take you by the hand.
ISA.51.19	A double disaster has fallen on you:
ISA.51.19	your land has been devastated by war,
ISA.51.19	and your people have starved.
ISA.51.19	There is no one to show you sympathy.
ISA.51.20	At the corner of every street
ISA.51.20	your people collapse from weakness;
ISA.51.20	they are like deer caught in a hunter's net.
ISA.51.20	They have felt the force of God's anger.
ISA.51.21	You suffering people of Jerusalem,
ISA.51.21	you that stagger as though you were drunk,

ISA.51.22	“I am taking away the cup
ISA.51.22	that I gave you in my anger.
ISA.51.22	You will no longer have to drink
ISA.51.22	the wine that makes you stagger.
ISA.51.23	I will give it to those who oppressed you,
ISA.51.23	to those who made you lie down in the streets
ISA.51.23	and trampled on you as if you were dirt.”
ISA.52.1	Holy city of God, clothe yourself with splendor!
ISA.52.1	The heathen will never enter your gates again.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself free, Jerusalem!
ISA.52.2	Rise from the dust and sit on your throne!
ISA.52.2	Undo the chains that bind you,
ISA.52.2	captive people of Zion!
ISA.52.3	The Sovereign 
ISA.52.4	When you went to live in Egypt as foreigners, you did so of your own free will; Assyria, however, took you away by force and paid nothing for you. 
ISA.52.5	 And now in Babylonia the same thing has happened: you are captives, and nothing was paid for you. Those who rule over you boast and brag and constantly show contempt for me. 
ISA.52.6	In time to come you will acknowledge that I am God and that I have spoken to you.”
ISA.52.7	a messenger coming across the mountains,
ISA.52.7	bringing good news, the news of peace!
ISA.52.7	He announces victory and says to Zion,
ISA.52.7	“Your God is king!”
ISA.52.8	Those who guard the city are shouting,
ISA.52.8	shouting together for joy.

ISA.52.10	and all the world will see it.
ISA.52.11	all you that carry the Temple equipment.
ISA.52.11	Touch no forbidden thing;
ISA.52.11	keep yourselves holy and leave.
ISA.52.12	This time you will not have to leave in a hurry;

ISA.52.12	and protect you on every side.
ISA.52.13	The 
ISA.52.13	“My servant will succeed in his task;
ISA.52.13	he will be highly honored.
ISA.52.14	Many people were shocked when they saw him;
ISA.52.14	he was so disfigured that he hardly looked human.
ISA.52.15	and kings will be speechless with amazement.

ISA.52.15	something they had never known.”
ISA.53.1	“Who would have believed what we now report?
ISA.53.1	Who could have seen the

ISA.53.2	grow like a plant taking root in dry ground.
ISA.53.2	He had no dignity or beauty
ISA.53.2	to make us take notice of him.
ISA.53.2	There was nothing attractive about him,
ISA.53.2	nothing that would draw us to him.
ISA.53.3	We despised him and rejected him;
ISA.53.3	he endured suffering and pain.
ISA.53.3	No one would even look at him—
ISA.53.3	we ignored him as if he were nothing.
ISA.53.4	the pain that we should have borne.
ISA.53.4	All the while we thought that his suffering
ISA.53.4	was punishment sent by God.
ISA.53.5	beaten because of the evil we did.
ISA.53.5	We are healed by the punishment he suffered,
ISA.53.5	made whole by the blows he received.
ISA.53.6	each of us going his own way.
ISA.53.6	But the 
ISA.53.6	the punishment all of us deserved.
ISA.53.7	he never said a word.
ISA.53.7	Like a lamb about to be slaughtered,
ISA.53.7	like a sheep about to be sheared,
ISA.53.7	he never said a word.
ISA.53.8	He was arrested and sentenced and led off to die,
ISA.53.8	and no one cared about his fate.
ISA.53.8	He was put to death for the sins of our people.
ISA.53.9	he was buried with the rich,
ISA.53.9	even though he had never committed a crime
ISA.53.9	or ever told a lie.”
ISA.53.10	The 
ISA.53.10	“It was my will that he should suffer;
ISA.53.10	his death was a sacrifice to bring forgiveness.
ISA.53.10	And so he will see his descendants;
ISA.53.10	he will live a long life,
ISA.53.10	and through him my purpose will succeed.
ISA.53.11	After a life of suffering, he will again have joy;
ISA.53.11	he will know that he did not suffer in vain.
ISA.53.11	My devoted servant, with whom I am pleased,
ISA.53.11	will bear the punishment of many
ISA.53.11	and for his sake I will forgive them.
ISA.53.12	a place among the great and powerful.
ISA.53.12	He willingly gave his life
ISA.53.12	and shared the fate of evil men.
ISA.53.12	He took the place of many sinners
ISA.53.12	and prayed that they might be forgiven.”
ISA.54.1	but now you can sing and shout for joy.
ISA.54.1	Now you will have more children
ISA.54.1	than a woman whose husband never left her.
ISA.54.2	Make the tent you live in larger;
ISA.54.2	lengthen its ropes and strengthen the pegs!
ISA.54.3	You will extend your boundaries on all sides;
ISA.54.3	your people will get back the land
ISA.54.3	that the other nations now occupy.
ISA.54.3	Cities now deserted will be filled with people.
ISA.54.4	Do not be afraid—you will not be disgraced again;
ISA.54.4	you will not be humiliated.
ISA.54.4	You will forget your unfaithfulness as a young wife,
ISA.54.4	and your desperate loneliness as a widow.
ISA.54.5	Your Creator will be like a husband to you—
ISA.54.5	the 
ISA.54.5	The holy God of Israel will save you—
ISA.54.5	he is the ruler of all the world.
ISA.54.6	Israel, you are like a young wife,
ISA.54.6	deserted by her husband and deeply distressed.
ISA.54.6	But the 
ISA.54.7	“For one brief moment I left you;
ISA.54.7	with deep love I will take you back.
ISA.54.8	I turned away angry for only a moment,
ISA.54.8	but I will show you my love forever.”
ISA.54.8	So says the 
ISA.54.9	never again to flood the earth.
ISA.54.9	Now I promise not to be angry with you again;
ISA.54.9	I will not reprimand or punish you.
ISA.54.10	but my love for you will never end;
ISA.54.10	I will keep forever my promise of peace.”
ISA.54.10	So says the 
ISA.54.11	“O Jerusalem, you suffering, helpless city,
ISA.54.11	with no one to comfort you,
ISA.54.11	I will rebuild your foundations with precious stones.
ISA.54.12	I will build your towers with rubies,
ISA.54.12	your gates with stones that glow like fire,
ISA.54.12	and the wall around you with jewels.
ISA.54.13	and give them prosperity and peace.
ISA.54.14	Justice and right will make you strong.
ISA.54.14	You will be safe from oppression and terror.
ISA.54.15	Whoever attacks you,
ISA.54.15	does it without my consent;
ISA.54.15	whoever fights against you will fall.
ISA.54.16	“I create the blacksmith,
ISA.54.16	who builds a fire and forges weapons.
ISA.54.16	I also create the soldier,
ISA.54.16	who uses the weapons to kill.
ISA.54.17	But no weapon will be able to hurt you;
ISA.54.17	you will have an answer for all who accuse you.
ISA.54.17	I will defend my servants
ISA.54.17	and give them victory.”
ISA.54.17	The 
ISA.55.1	“Come, everyone who is thirsty—
ISA.55.1	here is water!
ISA.55.1	Come, you that have no money—
ISA.55.1	buy grain and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come! Buy wine and milk—
ISA.55.1	it will cost you nothing!
ISA.55.2	Why spend your wages and still be hungry?
ISA.55.2	Listen to me and do what I say,
ISA.55.2	and you will enjoy the best food of all.
ISA.55.3	come to me, and you will have life!
ISA.55.3	I will make a lasting covenant with you
ISA.55.3	and give you the blessings I promised to David.
ISA.55.4	I made him a leader and commander of nations,
ISA.55.4	and through him I showed them my power.
ISA.55.5	Now you will summon foreign nations;
ISA.55.5	at one time they did not know you,
ISA.55.5	but now they will come running to join you!
ISA.55.5	I, the 
ISA.55.5	will make all this happen;
ISA.55.5	I will give you honor and glory.”
ISA.55.6	Turn to the 
ISA.55.6	now that he is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked leave their way of life
ISA.55.7	and change their way of thinking.
ISA.55.7	Let them turn to the 
ISA.55.7	he is merciful and quick to forgive.
ISA.55.8	“My thoughts,” says the 
ISA.55.8	and my ways are different from yours.
ISA.55.9	As high as the heavens are above the earth,
ISA.55.9	so high are my ways and thoughts above yours.
ISA.55.10	that come down from the sky to water the earth.
ISA.55.10	They make the crops grow
ISA.55.10	and provide seed for planting and food to eat.
ISA.55.11	So also will be the word that I speak—
ISA.55.11	it will not fail to do what I plan for it;
ISA.55.11	it will do everything I send it to do.
ISA.55.12	“You will leave Babylon with joy;
ISA.55.12	you will be led out of the city in peace.
ISA.55.12	The mountains and hills will burst into singing,
ISA.55.12	and the trees will shout for joy.
ISA.55.13	Cypress trees will grow where now there are briers;
ISA.55.13	myrtle trees will come up in place of thorns.
ISA.55.13	This will be a sign that will last forever,
ISA.55.13	a reminder of what I, the 
ISA.56.1	The 
ISA.56.2	I will bless those who always observe the Sabbath and do not misuse it. I will bless those who do nothing evil.”
ISA.56.3	A foreigner who has joined the 
ISA.56.3	A man who has been castrated should never think that because he cannot have children, he can never be part of God's people. 
ISA.56.4	 The 
ISA.56.5	then your name will be remembered in my Temple and among my people longer than if you had sons and daughters. You will never be forgotten.”
ISA.56.6	And the 
ISA.56.7	 “I will bring you to Zion, my sacred hill,
ISA.56.8	The Sovereign 
ISA.56.9	The 
ISA.56.10	He says, “All the leaders, who are supposed to warn my people, are blind! They know nothing. They are like watch dogs that don't bark—they only lie around and dream. How they love to sleep! 
ISA.56.11	They are like greedy dogs that never get enough. These leaders have no understanding. They each do as they please and seek their own advantage. 
ISA.56.12	‘Let's get some wine,’ these drunkards say, ‘and drink all we can hold! Tomorrow will be even better than today!’”
ISA.57.1	Good people die, and no one understands or even cares. But when they die, no calamity can hurt them. 
ISA.57.2	Those who live good lives find peace and rest in death.
ISA.57.3	Come here to be judged, you sinners! You are no better than sorcerers, adulterers, and prostitutes. 
ISA.57.4	Who are you making fun of? Who are you liars jeering at? 
ISA.57.5	You worship the fertility gods by having sex under those sacred trees of yours. You offer your children as sacrifices in the rocky caves near stream beds. 
ISA.57.6	You take smooth stones from there and worship them as gods. You pour out wine as offerings to them and bring them grain offerings. Do you think I am pleased with all this? 
ISA.57.7	You go to the high mountains to offer sacrifices and have sex. 
ISA.57.8	You set up your obscene idols just inside your front doors. You forsake me; you take off your clothes and climb in your large beds with your lovers, whom you pay to sleep with you. And there you satisfy your lust. 
ISA.57.9	You put on your perfumes and ointments and go to worship the god Molech. To find gods to worship, you send messengers far and wide, even to the world of the dead. 
ISA.57.10	You wear yourselves out looking for other gods, but you never give up. You think your obscene idols give you strength, and so you never grow weak.
ISA.57.11	The 
ISA.57.12	You think that what you do is right, but I will expose your conduct, and your idols will not be able to help you. 
ISA.57.13	When you cry for help, let those idols of yours save you! A puff of wind will carry them off! But those who trust in me will live in the land and will worship me in my Temple.”
ISA.57.14	The 
ISA.57.15	“I am the high and holy God, who lives forever. I live in a high and holy place, but I also live with people who are humble and repentant, so that I can restore their confidence and hope. 
ISA.57.16	I gave my people life, and I will not continue to accuse them or be angry with them forever.
ISA.57.17	I was angry with them because of their sin and greed, and so I punished them and abandoned them. But they were stubborn and kept on going their own way.
ISA.57.18	“I have seen how they acted, but I will heal them. I will lead them and help them, and I will comfort those who mourn. 
ISA.57.19	 I offer peace to all, both near and far! I will heal my people. 
ISA.57.20	But evil people are like the restless sea, whose waves never stop rolling in, bringing filth and muck. 
ISA.57.21	 There is no safety for sinners,” says the 
ISA.58.1	The 
ISA.58.2	They worship me every day, claiming that they are eager to know my ways and obey my laws. They say they want me to give them just laws and that they take pleasure in worshiping me.”
ISA.58.3	The people ask, “Why should we fast if the 
ISA.58.3	The 
ISA.58.4	Your fasting makes you violent, and you quarrel and fight. Do you think this kind of fasting will make me listen to your prayers? 
ISA.58.5	When you fast, you make yourselves suffer; you bow your heads low like a blade of grass and spread out sackcloth and ashes to lie on. Is that what you call fasting? Do you think I will be pleased with that?
ISA.58.6	“The kind of fasting I want is this: Remove the chains of oppression and the yoke of injustice, and let the oppressed go free. 
ISA.58.7	 Share your food with the hungry and open your homes to the homeless poor. Give clothes to those who have nothing to wear, and do not refuse to help your own relatives.
ISA.58.8	“Then my favor will shine on you like the morning sun, and your wounds will be quickly healed. I will always be with you to save you; my presence will protect you on every side. 
ISA.58.9	When you pray, I will answer you. When you call to me, I will respond.
ISA.58.9	“If you put an end to oppression, to every gesture of contempt, and to every evil word; 
ISA.58.10	if you give food to the hungry and satisfy those who are in need, then the darkness around you will turn to the brightness of noon. 
ISA.58.11	And I will always guide you and satisfy you with good things. I will keep you strong and well. You will be like a garden that has plenty of water, like a spring of water that never goes dry. 
ISA.58.12	Your people will rebuild what has long been in ruins, building again on the old foundations. You will be known as the people who rebuilt the walls, who restored the ruined houses.”
ISA.58.13	The 
ISA.58.14	then you will find the joy that comes from serving me. I will make you honored all over the world, and you will enjoy the land I gave to your ancestor, Jacob. I, the 
ISA.59.1	Don't think that the 
ISA.59.2	It is because of your sins that he doesn't hear you. It is your sins that separate you from God when you try to worship him. 
ISA.59.3	You are guilty of lying, violence, and murder.
ISA.59.4	You go to court, but you do not have justice on your side. You depend on lies to win your case. You carry out your plans to hurt others. 
ISA.59.5+ISA.59.6	The evil plots you make are as deadly as the eggs of a poisonous snake. Crush an egg, out comes a snake! But your plots will do you no good—they are as useless as clothing made of cobwebs! 
ISA.59.7	 You are always planning something evil, and you can hardly wait to do it. You never hesitate to murder innocent people. You leave ruin and destruction wherever you go, 
ISA.59.8	and no one is safe when you are around. Everything you do is unjust. You follow a crooked path, and no one who walks that path will ever be safe.
ISA.59.9	The people say, “Now we know why God does not save us from those who oppress us. We hope for light to walk by, but there is only darkness, 
ISA.59.10	and we grope about like blind people. We stumble at noon, as if it were night, as if we were in the dark world of the dead. 
ISA.59.11	We are frightened and distressed. We long for God to save us from oppression and wrong, but nothing happens.
ISA.59.12	“
ISA.59.13	We have rebelled against you, rejected you, and refused to follow you. We have oppressed others and turned away from you. Our thoughts are false; our words are lies. 
ISA.59.14	Justice is driven away, and right cannot come near. Truth stumbles in the public square, and honesty finds no place there. 
ISA.59.15	There is so little honesty that those who stop doing evil find themselves the victims of crime.”
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.16	 He is astonished to see that there is no one to help the oppressed. So he will use his own power to rescue them and to win the victory. 
ISA.59.17	 He will wear justice like a coat of armor and saving power like a helmet. He will clothe himself with the strong desire to set things right and to punish and avenge the wrongs that people suffer. 
ISA.59.18	He will punish his enemies according to what they have done, even those who live in distant lands. 
ISA.59.19	From east to west everyone will fear him and his great power. He will come like a rushing river, like a strong wind.
ISA.59.21	And I make a covenant with you: I have given you my power and my teachings to be yours forever, and from now on you are to obey me and teach your children and your descendants to obey me for all time to come.”
ISA.60.1	Arise, Jerusalem, and shine like the sun;
ISA.60.1	The glory of the 
ISA.60.2	Other nations will be covered by darkness,
ISA.60.2	But on you the light of the 
ISA.60.2	The brightness of his presence will be with you.
ISA.60.3	Nations will be drawn to your light,
ISA.60.3	And kings to the dawning of your new day.
ISA.60.4	Your people are gathering to come home!
ISA.60.4	Your sons will come from far away;
ISA.60.4	Your daughters will be carried like children.
ISA.60.5	You will see this and be filled with joy;
ISA.60.5	You will tremble with excitement.
ISA.60.5	The wealth of the nations will be brought to you;
ISA.60.5	From across the sea their riches will come.
ISA.60.6	Great caravans of camels will come, from Midian and Ephah.
ISA.60.6	They will come from Sheba, bringing gold and incense.
ISA.60.6	People will tell the good news of what the 
ISA.60.7	All the sheep of Kedar and Nebaioth
ISA.60.7	Will be brought to you as sacrifices
ISA.60.7	And offered on the altar to please the 
ISA.60.7	The 
ISA.60.8	What are these ships that skim along like clouds,
ISA.60.8	Like doves returning home?
ISA.60.9	They are ships coming from distant lands,
ISA.60.9	Bringing God's people home.
ISA.60.9	They bring with them silver and gold
ISA.60.9	To honor the name of the 
ISA.60.9	The holy God of Israel,
ISA.60.9	Who has made all nations honor his people.
ISA.60.10	The 
ISA.60.10	“Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
ISA.60.10	And their kings will serve you.
ISA.60.10	In my anger I punished you,
ISA.60.10	But now I will show you my favor and mercy.
ISA.60.11	So that the kings of the nations
ISA.60.11	May bring you their wealth.
ISA.60.12	But nations that do not serve you
ISA.60.12	Will be completely destroyed.
ISA.60.13	“The wood of the pine, the juniper, and the cypress,
ISA.60.13	The finest wood from the forests of Lebanon,
ISA.60.13	Will be brought to rebuild you, Jerusalem,
ISA.60.13	To make my Temple beautiful,
ISA.60.13	To make my city glorious.
ISA.60.14	And bow low to show their respect.
ISA.60.14	All who once despised you will worship at your feet.
ISA.60.14	They will call you ‘The City of the 
ISA.60.14	‘Zion, the City of Israel's Holy God.’
ISA.60.15	“You will no longer be forsaken and hated,
ISA.60.15	A city deserted and desolate.
ISA.60.15	I will make you great and beautiful,
ISA.60.15	A place of joy forever and ever.
ISA.60.16	Nations and kings will care for you
ISA.60.16	As a mother nurses her child.
ISA.60.16	You will know that I, the 
ISA.60.16	That the mighty God of Israel sets you free.
ISA.60.17	“I will bring you gold instead of bronze,
ISA.60.17	Silver and bronze instead of iron and wood,
ISA.60.17	And iron instead of stone.
ISA.60.17	Your rulers will no longer oppress you;
ISA.60.17	I will make them rule with justice and peace.
ISA.60.18	The sounds of violence will be heard no more;
ISA.60.18	Destruction will not shatter your country again.
ISA.60.18	I will protect and defend you like a wall;
ISA.60.18	You will praise me because I have saved you.
ISA.60.19	Or the moon be your light by night;
ISA.60.19	I, the 
ISA.60.19	The light of my glory will shine on you.
ISA.60.20	Your days of grief will come to an end.
ISA.60.20	I, the 
ISA.60.20	More lasting than the sun and moon.
ISA.60.21	Your people will all do what is right,
ISA.60.21	And will possess the land forever.
ISA.60.21	I planted them, I made them,
ISA.60.21	To reveal my greatness to all.
ISA.60.22	Even your smallest and humblest family
ISA.60.22	Will become as great as a powerful nation.
ISA.60.22	When the right time comes,
ISA.60.22	I will make this happen quickly.
ISA.60.22	I am the 
ISA.61.1	He has chosen me and sent me
ISA.61.1	To bring good news to the poor,
ISA.61.1	To heal the broken-hearted,
ISA.61.1	To announce release to captives
ISA.61.1	And freedom to those in prison.
ISA.61.2	That the time has come
ISA.61.2	When the 
ISA.61.2	And defeat their enemies.
ISA.61.2	He has sent me to comfort all who mourn,
ISA.61.3	To give to those who mourn in Zion
ISA.61.3	Joy and gladness instead of grief,
ISA.61.3	A song of praise instead of sorrow.
ISA.61.3	They will be like trees
ISA.61.3	That the 
ISA.61.3	They will all do what is right,
ISA.61.3	And God will be praised for what he has done.
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild cities that have long been in ruins.
ISA.61.5	My people, foreigners will serve you.
ISA.61.5	They will take care of your flocks
ISA.61.5	And farm your land and tend your vineyards.
ISA.61.6	And you will be known as the priests of the 
ISA.61.6	The servants of our God.
ISA.61.6	You will enjoy the wealth of the nations
ISA.61.6	And be proud that it is yours.
ISA.61.7	Your shame and disgrace are ended.
ISA.61.7	You will live in your own land,
ISA.61.7	And your wealth will be doubled;
ISA.61.7	Your joy will last forever.
ISA.61.8	The 
ISA.61.8	“I love justice and I hate oppression and crime.
ISA.61.8	I will faithfully reward my people
ISA.61.8	And make an eternal covenant with them.
ISA.61.9	They will be famous among the nations;
ISA.61.9	Everyone who sees them will know
ISA.61.9	That they are a people whom I have blessed.”
ISA.61.10	She is like a bride dressed for her wedding.
ISA.61.10	God has clothed her with salvation and victory.
ISA.61.11	As surely as seeds sprout and grow,
ISA.61.11	The Sovereign 
ISA.61.11	And all the nations will praise him.
ISA.62.1	I will speak out to encourage Jerusalem;
ISA.62.1	I will not be silent until she is saved,
ISA.62.1	And her victory shines like a torch in the night.
ISA.62.2	Jerusalem, the nations will see you victorious!
ISA.62.2	All their kings will see your glory.
ISA.62.2	You will be called by a new name,
ISA.62.2	A name given by the 
ISA.62.3	You will be like a beautiful crown for the 
ISA.62.4	No longer will you be called “Forsaken,”
ISA.62.4	Or your land be called “The Deserted Wife.”
ISA.62.4	Your new name will be “God Is Pleased with Her.”
ISA.62.4	Your land will be called “Happily Married,”
ISA.62.4	Because the 
ISA.62.4	And will be like a husband to your land.
ISA.62.5	Like a young man taking a virgin as his bride,
ISA.62.5	He who formed you will marry you.
ISA.62.5	As a groom is delighted with his bride,
ISA.62.5	So your God will delight in you.
ISA.62.6	On your walls, Jerusalem, I have placed sentries;
ISA.62.6	They must never be silent day or night.
ISA.62.6	They must remind the 
ISA.62.6	And never let him forget them.
ISA.62.7	They must give him no rest until he restores Jerusalem
ISA.62.7	And makes it a city the whole world praises.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	And by his power he will carry it out:
ISA.62.8	“Your grain will no longer be food for your enemies,
ISA.62.8	And foreigners will no longer drink your wine.
ISA.62.9	But you that planted and harvested the grain
ISA.62.9	Will eat the bread and praise the 
ISA.62.9	You that tended and gathered the grapes
ISA.62.9	Will drink the wine in the courts of my Temple.”
ISA.62.10	People of Jerusalem, go out of the city
ISA.62.10	And build a road for your returning people!
ISA.62.10	Prepare a highway; clear it of stones!
ISA.62.10	Put up a signal so that the nations can know
ISA.62.11	“Tell the people of Jerusalem
ISA.62.11	That the 
ISA.62.11	Bringing with him the people he has rescued.”
ISA.62.12	You will be called “God's Holy People,”
ISA.62.12	“The People the 
ISA.62.12	Jerusalem will be called “The City That God Loves,”
ISA.62.12	“The City That God Did Not Forsake.”
ISA.63.1	It is the 
ISA.63.2	“Why is his clothing so red, like that of someone who tramples grapes to make wine?”
ISA.63.4	I decided that the time to save my people had come; it was time to punish their enemies. 
ISA.63.5	 I was amazed when I looked and saw that there was no one to help me. But my anger made me strong, and I won the victory myself. 
ISA.63.6	In my anger I trampled whole nations and shattered them. I poured out their lifeblood on the ground.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell of the 
ISA.63.7	I praise him for all he has done for us.
ISA.63.7	He has richly blessed the people of Israel
ISA.63.7	because of his mercy and constant love.
ISA.63.8	The 
ISA.63.9	from all their suffering. It was not an angel, but the 
ISA.63.10	but they rebelled against him and made his holy spirit sad. So the 
ISA.63.11	But then they
ISA.63.12+ISA.63.13	 Where is the 
ISA.63.12+ISA.63.13	Led by the 
ISA.63.14	As cattle are led into a fertile valley, so the 
ISA.63.16	You are our father. Our ancestors Abraham and Jacob do not acknowledge us, but you, 
ISA.63.17	Why do you let us stray from your ways? Why do you make us so stubborn that we turn away from you? Come back, for the sake of those who serve you, for the sake of the people who have always been yours.
ISA.63.18	We, your holy people, were driven out by our enemies for a little while; they trampled down your sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	You treat us as though you had never been our ruler, as though we had never been your people.
ISA.64.1	Why don't you tear the sky open and come down? The mountains would see you and shake with fear. 
ISA.64.2	They would tremble like water boiling over a hot fire. Come and reveal your power to your enemies, and make the nations tremble at your presence! 
ISA.64.3	There was a time when you came and did terrifying things that we did not expect; the mountains saw you and shook with fear. 
ISA.64.4	 No one has ever seen or heard of a God like you, who does such deeds for those who put their hope in him. 
ISA.64.5	You welcome those who find joy in doing what is right, those who remember how you want them to live. You were angry with us, but we went on sinning; in spite of your great anger we have continued to do wrong since ancient times.
ISA.64.6	All of us have been sinful; even our best actions are filthy through and through. Because of our sins we are like leaves that wither and are blown away by the wind. 
ISA.64.7	No one turns to you in prayer; no one goes to you for help. You have hidden yourself from us and have abandoned
ISA.64.8	But you are our father, 
ISA.64.9	so do not be too angry with us or hold our sins against us forever. We are your people; be merciful to us. 
ISA.64.10	Your sacred cities are like a desert; Jerusalem is a deserted ruin, 
ISA.64.11	and our Temple, the sacred and beautiful place where our ancestors praised you, has been destroyed by fire. All the places we loved are in ruins. 
ISA.64.12	, are you unmoved by all this? Are you going to do nothing and make us suffer more than we can endure?
ISA.65.2	 I have always been ready to welcome my people, who stubbornly do what is wrong and go their own way. 
ISA.65.3	They shamelessly keep on making me angry. They offer pagan sacrifices at sacred gardens
ISA.65.4	At night they go to caves and tombs to consult the spirits of the dead. They eat pork and drink broth made from meat offered in pagan sacrifices. 
ISA.65.5	And then they say to others, ‘Keep away from us; we are too holy for you to touch!’ I cannot stand people like that—my anger against them is like a fire that never goes out.
ISA.65.6	“I have already decided on their punishment, and their sentence is written down. I will not overlook what they have done, but will repay them 
ISA.65.7	for their sins and the sins of their ancestors. They have burned incense at pagan hill shrines and spoken evil of me. So I will punish them as their past deeds deserve.”
ISA.65.8	The 
ISA.65.9	I will bless the Israelites who belong to the tribe of Judah, and their descendants will possess my land of mountains. My chosen people, who serve me, will live there. 
ISA.65.10	 They will worship me and will lead their sheep and cattle to pasture in the Plain of Sharon in the west and in Trouble Valley in the east.
ISA.65.11	“But it will be different for you that forsake me, who ignore Zion, my sacred hill,
ISA.65.12	It will be your fate to die a violent death, because you did not answer when I called you or listen when I spoke. You chose to disobey me and do evil. 
ISA.65.13	And so I tell you that those who worship and obey me will have plenty to eat and drink, but you will be hungry and thirsty. They will be happy, but you will be disgraced. 
ISA.65.14	They will sing for joy, but you will cry with a broken heart. 
ISA.65.15	My chosen people will use your name as a curse. I, the Sovereign 
ISA.65.16	Anyone in the land who asks for a blessing will ask to be blessed by the faithful God. Whoever takes an oath will swear by the name of the faithful God. The troubles of the past will be gone and forgotten.”
ISA.65.18	Be glad and rejoice forever in what I create. The new Jerusalem I make will be full of joy, and her people will be happy. 
ISA.65.19	 I myself will be filled with joy because of Jerusalem and her people. There will be no weeping there, no calling for help. 
ISA.65.20	Babies will no longer die in infancy, and all people will live out their life span. Those who live to be a hundred will be considered young. To die before that would be a sign that I had punished them. 
ISA.65.21+ISA.65.22	People will build houses and get to live in them—they will not be used by someone else. They will plant vineyards and enjoy the wine—it will not be drunk by others. Like trees, my people will live long lives. They will fully enjoy the things that they have worked for. 
ISA.65.23	The work they do will be successful, and their children will not meet with disaster. I will bless them and their descendants for all time to come. 
ISA.65.24	Even before they finish praying to me, I will answer their prayers. 
ISA.65.25	 Wolves and lambs will eat together; lions will eat straw, as cattle do, and snakes will no longer be dangerous. On Zion, my sacred hill,
ISA.66.2	I myself created the whole universe! I am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.
ISA.66.3	“The people do as they please. It's all the same to them whether they kill a bull as a sacrifice or sacrifice a human being; whether they sacrifice a lamb or break a dog's neck; whether they present a grain offering or offer pigs' blood; whether they offer incense or pray to an idol. They take pleasure in disgusting ways of worship. 
ISA.66.4	So I will bring disaster upon them—the very things they are afraid of—because no one answered when I called or listened when I spoke. They chose to disobey me and do evil.”
ISA.66.5	Listen to what the 
ISA.66.6	Listen! That loud noise in the city, that sound in the Temple, is the sound of the 
ISA.66.8	Has anyone ever seen or heard of such a thing? Has a nation ever been born in a day? Zion will not have to suffer long, before the nation is born. 
ISA.66.9	Do not think that I will bring my people to the point of birth and not let them be born.” The 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice with Jerusalem; be glad for her,
ISA.66.10	all you that love this city!
ISA.66.10	Rejoice with her now,
ISA.66.10	all you that have mourned for her!
ISA.66.11	You will enjoy her prosperity,
ISA.66.11	like a child at its mother's breast.
ISA.66.12	The 
ISA.66.13	I will comfort you in Jerusalem, as a mother comforts her child. 
ISA.66.14	When you see this happen, you will be glad; it will make you strong and healthy. Then you will know that I, the 
ISA.66.15	The 
ISA.66.16	By fire and sword he will punish all the people of the world whom he finds guilty—and many will be put to death.
ISA.66.17	The 
ISA.66.18	I know
ISA.66.19	and will know that I am the one who punishes them.
ISA.66.19	“But I will spare some of them and send them to the nations and the distant lands that have not heard of my fame or seen my greatness and power: to Spain, Libya,
ISA.66.20	They will bring back all your people from the nations as a gift to me. They will bring them to my sacred hill
ISA.66.21	I will make some of them priests and Levites.
ISA.66.23	On every New Moon Festival and every Sabbath people of every nation will come to worship me here in Jerusalem,” says the 
ISA.66.24	 “As they leave, they will see the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me. The worms that eat them will never die, and the fire that burns them will never be put out. The sight of them will be disgusting to all people.”
JER.1.1	This book is the account of what was said by Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests of the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. 
JER.1.2	 The 
JER.1.3	 and he spoke to him again when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was king. After that, the 
JER.1.4	The 
JER.1.5	“I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	I answered, “Sovereign 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of them, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	Today I give you authority over nations and kingdoms to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”
JER.1.11	The 
JER.1.11	I answered, “A branch of an almond tree.”
JER.1.12	“You are right,” the 
JER.1.13	Then the 
JER.1.13	I answered, “I see a pot boiling in the north, and it is about to tip over this way.”
JER.1.14	He said to me, “Destruction will boil over from the north on all who live in this land, 
JER.1.15	because I am calling all the nations in the north to come. Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem and around its walls and also around the other cities of Judah. 
JER.1.16	I will punish my people because they have sinned; they have abandoned me, have offered sacrifices to other gods, and have made idols and worshiped them. 
JER.1.17	Get ready, Jeremiah; go and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them now, or I will make you even more afraid when you are with them. 
JER.1.18+JER.1.19	Listen, Jeremiah! Everyone in this land—the kings of Judah, the officials, the priests, and the people—will be against you. But today I am giving you the strength to resist them; you will be like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. They will not defeat you, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the 
JER.2.1	The 
JER.2.2	to proclaim this message to everyone in Jerusalem.
JER.2.2	“I remember how faithful you were when you were young,
JER.2.2	how you loved me when we were first married;
JER.2.2	you followed me through the desert,
JER.2.2	through a land that had not been planted.
JER.2.3	Israel, you belonged to me alone;
JER.2.3	you were my sacred possession.
JER.2.3	I sent suffering and disaster
JER.2.3	on everyone who hurt you.
JER.2.3	I, the 
JER.2.4	Listen to the 
JER.2.5	The 
JER.2.5	“What accusation did your ancestors bring against me?
JER.2.5	What made them turn away from me?
JER.2.5	They worshiped worthless idols
JER.2.5	and became worthless themselves.
JER.2.6	They did not care about me,
JER.2.6	even though I rescued them from Egypt
JER.2.6	and led them through the wilderness:
JER.2.6	a land of deserts and sand pits,
JER.2.6	a dry and dangerous land
JER.2.6	where no one lives
JER.2.6	and no one will even travel.
JER.2.7	I brought them into a fertile land,
JER.2.7	to enjoy its harvests and its other good things.
JER.2.7	But instead they ruined my land;
JER.2.7	they defiled the country I had given them.
JER.2.8	The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.8	My own priests did not know me.
JER.2.8	The rulers rebelled against me;
JER.2.8	the prophets spoke in the name of Baal
JER.2.8	and worshiped useless idols.
JER.2.9	“And so I, the 
JER.2.9	I will bring charges against their descendants.
JER.2.10	Go west to the island of Cyprus,
JER.2.10	and send someone eastward to the land of Kedar.
JER.2.10	You will see that nothing like this has ever happened before.
JER.2.11	No other nation has ever changed its gods,
JER.2.11	even though they were not real.
JER.2.11	But my people have exchanged me,
JER.2.11	the God who has brought them honor,
JER.2.11	for gods that can do nothing for them.
JER.2.12	And so I command the sky to shake with horror,
JER.2.12	to be amazed and astonished,
JER.2.13	for my people have committed two sins:
JER.2.13	they have turned away from me,
JER.2.13	the spring of fresh water,
JER.2.13	and they have dug cisterns,
JER.2.13	cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all.
JER.2.14	“Israel is not a slave;
JER.2.14	he was not born into slavery.
JER.2.14	Why then do his enemies hunt him down?
JER.2.15	They have roared at him like lions;
JER.2.15	they have made his land a desert,
JER.2.15	and his towns lie in ruins, completely abandoned.
JER.2.16	Yes, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes
JER.2.16	have cracked his skull.
JER.2.17	Israel, you brought this on yourself!
JER.2.17	You deserted me, the 
JER.2.17	while I was leading you along the way.
JER.2.18	What do you think you will gain by going to Egypt
JER.2.18	to drink water from the Nile?
JER.2.18	What do you think you will gain by going to Assyria
JER.2.18	to drink water from the Euphrates?
JER.2.19	Your own evil will punish you,
JER.2.19	and your turning from me will condemn you.
JER.2.19	You will learn how bitter and wrong it is
JER.2.19	to abandon me, the 
JER.2.19	and no longer to remain faithful to me.
JER.2.19	I, the Sovereign 
JER.2.20	The Sovereign 
JER.2.20	“Israel, long ago you rejected my authority;
JER.2.20	you refused to obey me and worship me.
JER.2.20	On every high hill
JER.2.20	and under every green tree
JER.2.20	you worshiped fertility gods.
JER.2.21	I planted you like a choice vine
JER.2.21	from the very best seed.
JER.2.21	But look what you have become!
JER.2.21	You are like a rotten, worthless vine.
JER.2.22	Even if you washed with the strongest soap,
JER.2.22	I would still see the stain of your guilt.
JER.2.23	How can you say you have not defiled yourself,
JER.2.23	that you have never worshiped Baal?
JER.2.23	Look how you sinned in the valley;
JER.2.23	see what you have done.
JER.2.23	You are like a wild camel in heat,
JER.2.23	running around loose,
JER.2.24	rushing into the desert.
JER.2.24	When she is in heat, who can control her?
JER.2.24	No male that wants her has to trouble himself;
JER.2.24	she is always available in mating season.
JER.2.25	Israel, don't wear your feet out,
JER.2.25	or let your throat become dry
JER.2.25	from chasing after other gods.
JER.2.25	But you say, ‘No! I can't turn back.
JER.2.25	I have loved foreign gods
JER.2.25	and will go after them.’”
JER.2.26	The 
JER.2.27	You will all be disgraced—you that say that a tree is your father and that a rock is your mother. This will happen because you turned away from me instead of turning to me. But when you are in trouble, you ask me to come and save you.
JER.2.28	“Where are the gods that you made for yourselves? When you are in trouble, let them save you—if they can! Judah, you have as many gods as you have cities. 
JER.2.29	What is your complaint? Why have you rebelled against me? 
JER.2.30	I punished you, but it did no good; you would not let me correct you. Like a raging lion, you have murdered your prophets. 
JER.2.31	People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Have I been like a desert to you, like a dark and dangerous land? Why, then, do you say that you will do as you please, that you will never come back to me? 
JER.2.32	Does a young woman forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding dress? But my people have forgotten me for more days than can be counted. 
JER.2.33	You certainly know how to chase after lovers. Even the worst of women can learn from you. 
JER.2.34	Your clothes are stained with the blood of the poor and innocent, not with the blood of burglars.
JER.2.34	“But in spite of all this, 
JER.2.35	you say, ‘I am innocent; surely the 
JER.2.36	You have cheapened yourself by turning to the gods of other nations. You will be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were by Assyria. 
JER.2.37	You will turn away from Egypt, hanging your head in shame. I, the 
JER.3.1	The 
JER.3.2	Look up at the hilltops. Is there any place where you have not acted like a prostitute? You waited for lovers along the roadside, as an Arab waits for victims in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution. 
JER.3.3	That is why the rains were held back, and the spring showers did not come. You even look like a prostitute; you have no shame.
JER.3.4	“And now you say to me, ‘You are my father, and you have loved me ever since I was a child. 
JER.3.5	You won't always be angry; you won't be mad at me forever.’ Israel, that is what you said, but you did all the evil you could.”
JER.3.7	I thought that after she had done all this, she would surely return to me. But she did not return, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it all. 
JER.3.8	Judah also saw that I divorced Israel and sent her away because she had turned from me and had become a prostitute. But Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, was not afraid. She too became a prostitute 
JER.3.9	and was not at all ashamed. She defiled the land, and she committed adultery by worshiping stones and trees. 
JER.3.10	And after all this, Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, only pretended to return to me; she was not sincere. I, the 
JER.3.11	Then the 
JER.3.12	He told me to go and say to Israel, “Unfaithful Israel, come back to me. I am merciful and will not be angry; I will not be angry with you forever. 
JER.3.13	Only admit that you are guilty and that you have rebelled against the 
JER.3.14	“Unfaithful people, come back; you belong to me. I will take one of you from each town and two from each clan, and I will bring you back to Mount Zion. 
JER.3.15	I will give you rulers who obey me, and they will rule you with wisdom and understanding. 
JER.3.16	Then when you have become numerous in that land, people will no longer talk about my Covenant Box. They will no longer think about it or remember it; they will not even need it, nor will they make another one. 
JER.3.17	When that time comes, Jerusalem will be called ‘The Throne of the 
JER.3.18	Israel will join with Judah, and together they will come from exile in the country in the north and will return to the land that I gave your ancestors as a permanent possession.”
JER.3.19	The 
JER.3.19	“Israel, I wanted to accept you as my child
JER.3.19	and give you a delightful land,
JER.3.19	the most beautiful land in all the world.
JER.3.19	I wanted you to call me father
JER.3.19	and never again turn away from me.
JER.3.20	But like an unfaithful wife,
JER.3.20	you have not been faithful to me.
JER.3.20	I, the 
JER.3.21	A noise is heard on the hilltops:
JER.3.21	it is the people of Israel crying and pleading
JER.3.21	because they have lived sinful lives
JER.3.21	and have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	Return, all of you who have turned away from the 
JER.3.22	he will heal you and make you faithful.
JER.3.22	You say, “Yes, we are coming to the 
JER.3.23	We were not helped at all by our pagan worship on the hilltops. Help for Israel comes only from the 
JER.3.24	But the worship of Baal, the god of shame, has made us lose flocks and herds, sons and daughters—everything that our ancestors have worked for since ancient times. 
JER.3.25	We should lie down in shame and let our disgrace cover us. We and our ancestors have always sinned against the 
JER.4.1	The 
JER.4.2	it will be right for you to swear by my name. Then
JER.4.4	Keep your covenant with me, your 
JER.4.5	Blow the trumpet throughout the land!
JER.4.5	Shout loud and clear!
JER.4.5	Tell the people of Judah and Jerusalem
JER.4.5	to run to the fortified cities.
JER.4.6	Point the way to Zion!
JER.4.6	Run for safety! Don't delay!
JER.4.6	The 
JER.4.6	and great destruction from the north.
JER.4.7	Like a lion coming from its hiding place,
JER.4.7	a destroyer of nations has set out.
JER.4.7	He is coming to destroy Judah.
JER.4.7	The cities of Judah will be left in ruins,
JER.4.7	and no one will live in them.
JER.4.8	So put on sackcloth, and weep and wail
JER.4.8	because the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.8	has not turned away from Judah.
JER.4.9	The 
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Sovereign 
JER.4.11	The time is coming when the people of Jerusalem will be told that a scorching wind is blowing in from the desert toward them. It will not be a gentle wind that only blows away the chaff— 
JER.4.12	the wind that comes at the 
JER.4.13	Look, the enemy is coming like clouds. Their war chariots are like a whirlwind, and their horses are faster than eagles. We are lost! We are doomed!
JER.4.14	Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart, so that you may be saved. How long will you go on thinking sinful thoughts?
JER.4.15	Messengers from the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim announce the bad news. 
JER.4.16	They have come to warn the nations and to tell Jerusalem that enemies are coming from a country far away. These enemies will shout against the cities of Judah 
JER.4.17	and will surround Jerusalem like men guarding a field, because her people have rebelled against the 
JER.4.18	Judah, you have brought this on yourself by the way you have lived and by the things you have done. Your sin has caused this suffering; it has stabbed you through the heart.
JER.4.19	The pain! I can't bear the pain!
JER.4.19	My heart! My heart is beating wildly!
JER.4.19	I can't keep quiet;
JER.4.19	I hear the trumpets
JER.4.19	and the shouts of battle.
JER.4.20	One disaster follows another;
JER.4.20	the whole country is left in ruins.
JER.4.20	Suddenly our tents are destroyed;
JER.4.20	their curtains are torn to pieces.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the battle raging
JER.4.21	and hear the blasts of trumpets?
JER.4.22	The 
JER.4.22	they don't know me.
JER.4.22	They are like foolish children;
JER.4.22	they have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are experts at doing what is evil,
JER.4.22	but failures at doing what is good.”
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth—it was a barren waste;
JER.4.23	at the sky—there was no light.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains—they were shaking,
JER.4.24	and the hills were rocking back and forth.
JER.4.25	I saw that there were no people;
JER.4.25	even the birds had flown away.
JER.4.26	The fertile land had become a desert;
JER.4.26	its cities were in ruins
JER.4.26	because of the 
JER.4.26	( 
JER.4.27	The 
JER.4.28	The earth will mourn;
JER.4.28	the sky will grow dark.
JER.4.28	The 
JER.4.28	and will not change his mind.
JER.4.28	He has made his decision
JER.4.28	and will not turn back.
JER.4.29	At the noise of the cavalry and archers
JER.4.29	everyone will run away.
JER.4.29	Some will run to the forest;
JER.4.29	others will climb up among the rocks.
JER.4.29	Every town will be left empty,
JER.4.29	and no one will live in them again.
JER.4.30	Jerusalem, you are doomed!
JER.4.30	Why do you dress in scarlet?
JER.4.30	Why do you put on jewelry and paint your eyes?
JER.4.30	You are making yourself beautiful for nothing!
JER.4.30	Your lovers have rejected you
JER.4.30	and want to kill you.
JER.4.31	I heard a cry, like a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	a scream like a woman bearing her first child.
JER.4.31	It was the cry of Jerusalem gasping for breath,
JER.4.31	stretching out her hand and saying,
JER.4.31	“I am doomed!
JER.4.31	They are coming to kill me!”
JER.5.1	People of Jerusalem, run through your streets!
JER.5.1	Look around! See for yourselves!
JER.5.1	Search the marketplaces!
JER.5.1	Can you find one person
JER.5.1	who does what is right
JER.5.1	and tries to be faithful to God?
JER.5.1	If you can, the 
JER.5.2	Even though you claim to worship the 
JER.5.2	you do not mean what you say.
JER.5.3	Surely the 
JER.5.3	He struck you, but you paid no attention;
JER.5.3	he crushed you, but you refused to learn.
JER.5.3	You were stubborn and would not turn from your sins.
JER.5.4	Then I thought, “These are only the poor and ignorant.
JER.5.4	They behave foolishly;
JER.5.4	they don't know what their God requires,
JER.5.4	what the 
JER.5.5	I will go to the people in power
JER.5.5	and talk with them.
JER.5.5	Surely they know what their God requires,
JER.5.5	what the 
JER.5.5	But all of them have rejected the 
JER.5.5	and refuse to obey him.
JER.5.6	That is why lions from the forest will kill them;
JER.5.6	wolves from the desert will tear them to pieces,
JER.5.6	and leopards will prowl through their towns.
JER.5.6	If those people go out, they will be torn apart
JER.5.6	because their sins are numerous
JER.5.6	and time after time they have turned from God.
JER.5.7	The 
JER.5.7	They have abandoned me
JER.5.7	and have worshiped gods that are not real.
JER.5.7	I fed my people until they were full,
JER.5.7	but they committed adultery
JER.5.7	and spent their time with prostitutes.
JER.5.8	They were like well-fed stallions wild with desire,
JER.5.8	each lusting for his neighbor's wife.
JER.5.9	Shouldn't I punish them for these things
JER.5.9	and take revenge on a nation such as this?
JER.5.10	I will send enemies to cut down my people's vineyards,
JER.5.10	but not to destroy them completely.
JER.5.10	I will tell them to strip away the branches,
JER.5.10	because those branches are not mine.
JER.5.11	The people of Israel and Judah
JER.5.11	have betrayed me completely.
JER.5.11	I, the 
JER.5.12	The 
JER.5.13+JER.5.14	They have said that the prophets are nothing but windbags and that they have no message from the 
JER.5.15	People of Israel, the 
JER.5.16	Their archers are mighty soldiers who kill without mercy. 
JER.5.17	They will devour your crops and your food; they will kill your sons and your daughters. They will slaughter your flocks and your herds and destroy your vines and fig trees. The fortified cities in which you trust will be destroyed by their army.
JER.5.18	The 
JER.5.19	When they ask why I did all these things, tell them, Jeremiah, that just as they turned away from me and served foreign gods in their own land, so they will serve strangers in a land that is not theirs.”
JER.5.20	The 
JER.5.21	 Pay attention, you foolish and stupid people, who have eyes, but cannot see, and have ears, but cannot hear. 
JER.5.22	 I am the 
JER.5.23	But you people! You are stubborn and rebellious; you have turned aside and left me. 
JER.5.24	You never thought to honor me, even though I send the autumn rains and the spring rains and give you the harvest season each year. 
JER.5.25	Instead, your sins have kept these good things from you.
JER.5.26	“Evildoers live among my people; they lie in wait like those who lay nets to catch birds,
JER.5.27	Just as a hunter fills a cage with birds, they have filled their houses with loot. That is why they are powerful and rich, 
JER.5.28	why they are fat and well fed. There is no limit to their evil deeds. They do not give orphans their rights or show justice to the oppressed.
JER.5.29	“But I, the 
JER.5.30	A terrible and shocking thing has happened in the land: 
JER.5.31	prophets speak nothing but lies; priests rule as the prophets command, and my people offer no objections. But what will they do when it all comes to an end?”
JER.6.1	People of Benjamin, run for safety! Escape from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa and build a signal fire in Beth Haccherem. Disaster and destruction are about to come from the north. 
JER.6.2	The city of Zion is beautiful, but it will be destroyed; 
JER.6.3	kings will camp there with their armies. They will pitch their tents around the city, and each of them will camp wherever they want. 
JER.6.4	They will say, “Prepare to attack Jerusalem! Get ready! We'll attack at noon!” But then they will say, “It's too late, the day is almost over, and the evening shadows are growing long. 
JER.6.5	We'll attack by night; we'll destroy the city's fortresses.”
JER.6.6	The 
JER.6.7	As a well keeps its water fresh, so Jerusalem keeps its evil fresh. I hear violence and destruction in the city; sickness and wounds are all I see. 
JER.6.8	People of Jerusalem, let these troubles be a warning to you, or else I will abandon you; I will turn your city into a desert, a place where no one lives.”
JER.6.9	The 
JER.6.10	I answered, “Who would listen to me if I spoke to them and warned them? They are stubborn and refuse to listen to your message; they laugh at what you tell me to say. 
JER.6.11	Your anger against them burns in me too, 
JER.6.11	Then the 
JER.6.12	 Their houses will be given to others, and so will their fields and their wives. I am going to punish the people of this land. 
JER.6.13	Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly; even prophets and priests cheat the people. 
JER.6.14	 They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. ‘All is well,’ they say, when all is not well. 
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed because they did these disgusting things? No, they were not at all ashamed; they don't even know how to blush. And so they will fall as others have fallen; when I punish them, that will be the end of them. I, the 
JER.6.16	The 
JER.6.16	But they said, “No, we will not!” 
JER.6.17	Then the 
JER.6.18	So the 
JER.6.19	Listen, earth! As punishment for all their schemes I am bringing ruin on these people, because they have rejected my teaching and have not obeyed my words. 
JER.6.20	What do I care about the incense they bring me from Sheba, or the spices from a distant land? I will not accept their offerings or be pleased with their sacrifices. 
JER.6.21	And so I will make these people stumble and fall. Parents and children will die, and so will friends and neighbors.”
JER.6.22	The 
JER.6.23	They have taken up their bows and swords; they are cruel and merciless. They sound like the roaring sea, as they ride their horses. They are ready for battle against Jerusalem.”
JER.6.24	“We have heard the news,” say the people of Jerusalem, “and our hands hang limp; we are seized by anguish and pain like a woman in labor. 
JER.6.25	We don't dare go to the countryside or walk on the roads, because our enemies are armed and terror is all around us.”
JER.6.26	The 
JER.6.27	Jeremiah, test my people, as you would test metal, and find out what they are like. 
JER.6.28	They are all stubborn rebels, hard as bronze and iron. They are all corrupt, going around and spreading gossip. 
JER.6.29	The furnace burns fiercely, but the waste metals do not melt and run off. It is useless to go on refining my people, because those who are evil are not taken away. 
JER.6.30	They will be called worthless dross, because I, the 
JER.7.1+JER.7.2+JER.7.3	The 
JER.7.4	Stop believing those deceitful words, ‘We are safe! This is the 
JER.7.5	“Change the way you are living and stop doing the things you are doing. Be fair in your treatment of one another. 
JER.7.6	Stop taking advantage of aliens, orphans, and widows. Stop killing innocent people in this land. Stop worshiping other gods, for that will destroy you. 
JER.7.7	If you change, I will let you go on living here in the land which I gave your ancestors as a permanent possession.
JER.7.8	“Look, you put your trust in deceitful words. 
JER.7.9	You steal, murder, commit adultery, tell lies under oath, offer sacrifices to Baal, and worship gods that you had not known before. 
JER.7.10	You do these things I hate, and then you come and stand in my presence, in my own Temple, and say, ‘We are safe!’ 
JER.7.11	 Do you think that my Temple is a hiding place for robbers? I have seen what you are doing. 
JER.7.12	 Go to Shiloh,
JER.7.13	You have committed all these sins, and even though I spoke to you over and over again, you refused to listen. You would not answer when I called you. 
JER.7.14	And so, what I did to Shiloh I will do to this Temple of mine, in which you trust. Here in this place that I gave to your ancestors and you, I will do the same thing that I did to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	I will drive you out of my sight as I drove out your relatives, the people of Israel. I, the 
JER.7.16	The 
JER.7.17	Don't you see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	 The children gather firewood, the men build fires, and the women mix dough to bake cakes for the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven. They also pour out offerings of wine to other gods, in order to hurt me. 
JER.7.19	But am I really the one they are hurting? No, they are hurting themselves and bringing shame on themselves. 
JER.7.20	And so I, the Sovereign 
JER.7.21	“My people, some sacrifices you burn completely on the altar, and some you are permitted to eat. But what I, the 
JER.7.22	I gave your ancestors no commands about burnt offerings or any other kinds of sacrifices when I brought them out of Egypt. 
JER.7.23	But I did command them to obey me, so that I would be their God and they would be my people. And I told them to live the way I had commanded them, so that things would go well for them. 
JER.7.24	But they did not obey or pay any attention. Instead, they did whatever their stubborn and evil hearts told them to do, and they became worse instead of better. 
JER.7.25	From the day that your ancestors came out of Egypt until this very day I have kept on sending to you my servants, the prophets. 
JER.7.26	Yet no one listened or paid any attention. Instead, you became more stubborn and rebellious than your ancestors.
JER.7.27	“So, Jeremiah, you will speak all these words to my people, but they will not listen to you; you will call them, but they will not answer. 
JER.7.28	You will tell them that their nation does not obey me, the 
JER.7.29	“Mourn, people of Jerusalem;
JER.7.29	cut off your hair and throw it away.
JER.7.29	Sing a funeral song on the hilltops,
JER.7.29	because I, the 
JER.7.29	and have rejected my people.
JER.7.30	“The people of Judah have done an evil thing. They have placed their idols, which I hate, in my Temple and have defiled it. 
JER.7.31	 In Hinnom Valley they have built an altar called Topheth, so that they can sacrifice their sons and daughters in the fire. I did not command them to do this—it did not even enter my mind. 
JER.7.32	And so, the time will come when it will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley, but Slaughter Valley. They will bury people there because there will be nowhere else to bury them. 
JER.7.33	The corpses will be food for the birds and wild animals, and there will be no one to scare them off. 
JER.7.34	 The land will become a desert. In the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the happy sounds of wedding feasts.
JER.8.1	“At that time the bones of the kings and of the officials of Judah, as well as the bones of the priests, of the prophets, and of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, will be taken out of their graves. 
JER.8.2	Instead of being gathered and buried, their bones will be like manure lying on the ground. They will be spread out before the sun, the moon, and the stars, which these people have loved and served, and which they have consulted and worshiped. 
JER.8.3	And the people of this evil nation who survive, who live in the places where I have scattered them, will prefer to die rather than to go on living. I, the 
JER.8.4	The 
JER.8.5	Why then, my people, do you turn away from me without ever turning back? You cling to your idols and refuse to return to me. 
JER.8.6	I listened carefully, but you did not speak the truth. Not one of you has been sorry for your wickedness; not one of you has asked, ‘What have I done wrong?’ Each of you keep on going your own way, like a horse rushing into battle. 
JER.8.7	Even storks know when it is time to return; doves, swallows, and thrushes know when it is time to migrate. But, my people, you do not know the laws by which I rule you. 
JER.8.8	How can you say that you are wise and that you know my laws? Look, the laws have been changed by dishonest scribes. 
JER.8.9	Your wise men are put to shame; they are confused and trapped. They have rejected my words; what wisdom do they have now? 
JER.8.10	 So I will give their fields to new owners and their wives to other men. Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly. Even prophets and priests cheat the people. 
JER.8.11	 They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. ‘All is well,’ they say, when all is not well. 
JER.8.12	My people, were you ashamed because you did these disgusting things? No, you were not ashamed at all; you don't even know how to blush! And so you will fall as others have fallen; when I punish you, that will be the end of you. I, the 
JER.8.13	“I wanted to gather my people, as a farmer gathers a harvest; but they are like a vine with no grapes, like a fig tree with no figs; even the leaves have withered. Therefore, I have allowed outsiders to take over the land.”
JER.8.14	“Why are we sitting still?” God's people ask. “Come on, we will run to the fortified cities and die there. The 
JER.8.15	We hoped for peace and a time of healing, but it was no use; terror came instead. 
JER.8.16	Our enemies are already in the city of Dan; we hear the snorting of their horses. The whole land trembles when their horses neigh. Our enemies have come to destroy our land and everything in it, our city and all its people.”
JER.8.17	“Watch out!” the 
JER.8.18	My sorrow cannot be healed;
JER.8.18	I am sick at heart.
JER.8.19	Listen! Throughout the land
JER.8.19	I hear my people crying out,
JER.8.19	“Is the 
JER.8.19	Is Zion's king no longer there?”
JER.8.19	The 
JER.8.19	“Why have you made me angry by worshiping your idols
JER.8.19	and by bowing down to your useless foreign gods?”
JER.8.20	The people cry out,
JER.8.20	“The summer is gone, the harvest is over,
JER.8.20	but we have not been saved.”
JER.8.21	My heart has been crushed
JER.8.21	because my people are crushed;
JER.8.21	I mourn; I am completely dismayed.
JER.8.22	Is there no medicine in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Are there no doctors there?
JER.8.22	Why, then, have my people not been healed?
JER.9.1	I wish my head were a well of water,
JER.9.1	and my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	so that I could cry day and night
JER.9.1	for my people who have been killed.
JER.9.2	I wish I had a place to stay in the desert
JER.9.2	where I could get away from my people.
JER.9.2	They are all unfaithful,
JER.9.2	a mob of traitors.
JER.9.3	They are always ready to tell lies;
JER.9.3	dishonesty instead of truth rules the land.
JER.9.3	The 
JER.9.3	“My people do one evil thing after another
JER.9.3	and do not acknowledge me as their God.”
JER.9.4	Everyone must be on guard against their friends,
JER.9.4	and no one can trust their relatives;
JER.9.4	for all relatives are as deceitful as Jacob,
JER.9.4	and everyone slanders their friends.
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	They all mislead their friends,
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	and no one tells the truth;
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	they have taught their tongues to lie
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	and will not give up their sinning.
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	They do one violent thing after another,
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	and one deceitful act follows another.
JER.9.5+JER.9.6	The 
JER.9.7	Because of this the 
JER.9.7	“I will refine my people like metal
JER.9.7	and put them to the test.
JER.9.7	My people have done evil—
JER.9.7	what else can I do with them?
JER.9.8	Their tongues are like deadly arrows;
JER.9.8	they always tell lies.
JER.9.8	Everyone speaks friendly words to their neighbors,
JER.9.8	but they are really setting a trap for them.
JER.9.9	Will I not punish them for these things?
JER.9.9	Will I not take revenge on a nation like this?
JER.9.9	I, the 
JER.9.10	I said, “I will mourn for the mountains
JER.9.10	and weep for the pastures,
JER.9.10	because they have dried up,
JER.9.10	and no one travels through them.
JER.9.10	The sound of livestock is no longer heard;
JER.9.10	birds and wild animals have fled and gone.”
JER.9.11	The 
JER.9.11	a place where jackals live;
JER.9.11	the cities of Judah will become a desert,
JER.9.11	a place where no one lives.”
JER.9.12	I asked, “
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.14	Instead, they have been stubborn and have worshiped the idols of Baal as their ancestors taught them to do. 
JER.9.15	So then, listen to what I, the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have heard about, and I will send armies against them until I have completely destroyed them.”
JER.9.17	The 
JER.9.17	“Think about what is happening!
JER.9.17	Call for the mourners to come,
JER.9.17	for the women who sing funeral songs.”
JER.9.18	The people said,
JER.9.18	“Tell them to hurry and sing a funeral song for us,
JER.9.18	until our eyes fill with tears,
JER.9.18	and our eyelids are wet from crying.”
JER.9.19	Listen to the sound of crying in Zion:
JER.9.19	“We are ruined!
JER.9.19	We are completely disgraced!
JER.9.19	We must leave our land;
JER.9.19	our homes have been torn down.”
JER.9.20	I said,
JER.9.20	“Listen to the 
JER.9.20	and pay attention to his words.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters how to mourn,
JER.9.20	and your friends how to sing a funeral song.
JER.9.21	Death has come in through our windows
JER.9.21	and entered our palaces;
JER.9.21	it has cut down the children in the streets
JER.9.21	and the young men in the marketplaces.
JER.9.22	Dead bodies are scattered everywhere,
JER.9.22	like piles of manure on the fields,
JER.9.22	like grain cut and left behind by the reapers,
JER.9.22	grain that no one gathers.
JER.9.22	This is what the 
JER.9.23	The 
JER.9.23	“The wise should not boast of their wisdom,
JER.9.23	nor the strong of their strength,
JER.9.23	nor the rich of their wealth.
JER.9.24	they should boast that they know and understand me,
JER.9.24	because my love is constant,
JER.9.24	and I do what is just and right.
JER.9.24	These are the things that please me.
JER.9.24	I, the 
JER.9.25+JER.9.26	The 
JER.10.1	People of Israel, listen to the message that the 
JER.10.2	He says,
JER.10.2	“Do not follow the ways of other nations;
JER.10.2	do not be disturbed by unusual sights in the sky,
JER.10.2	even though other nations are terrified.
JER.10.3	The religion of these people is worthless.
JER.10.3	A tree is cut down in the forest;
JER.10.3	it is carved by the tools of the woodworker
JER.10.4	and decorated with silver and gold.
JER.10.4	It is fastened down with nails
JER.10.4	to keep it from falling over.
JER.10.5	Such idols are like scarecrows in a field of melons;
JER.10.5	they cannot speak;
JER.10.5	they have to be carried
JER.10.5	because they cannot walk.
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of them:
JER.10.5	they can cause you no harm,
JER.10.5	and they can do you no good.”
JER.10.6	you are mighty,
JER.10.6	and your name is great and powerful.
JER.10.7	You deserve to be honored.
JER.10.7	There is no one like you
JER.10.7	among all the wise men of the nations
JER.10.7	or among any of their kings.
JER.10.8	All of them are stupid and foolish.
JER.10.8	What can they learn from wooden idols?
JER.10.9	Their idols are covered with silver from Spain
JER.10.9	and with gold from Uphaz,
JER.10.9	all the work of artists;
JER.10.9	they are dressed in violet and purple cloth
JER.10.9	woven by skilled weavers.
JER.10.10	But you, 
JER.10.10	you are the living God
JER.10.10	and the eternal king.
JER.10.10	When you are angry, the world trembles;
JER.10.10	the nations cannot endure your anger.
JER.10.10	( 
JER.10.11	You people must tell them that the gods who did not make the earth and the sky will be destroyed. They will no longer exist anywhere on earth.)
JER.10.12	The 
JER.10.12	by his wisdom he created the world
JER.10.12	and stretched out the heavens.
JER.10.13	At his command the waters above the sky
JER.10.13	he brings clouds from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He makes lightning flash in the rain
JER.10.13	and sends the wind from his storeroom.
JER.10.14	At the sight of this, people feel stupid and senseless;
JER.10.14	those who make idols are disillusioned,
JER.10.14	because the gods they make are false and lifeless.
JER.10.15	They are worthless and should be despised;
JER.10.15	they will be destroyed when the 
JER.10.16	The God of Jacob is not like them;
JER.10.16	he is the one who made everything,
JER.10.16	and he has chosen Israel to be his very own people.
JER.10.16	The 
JER.10.17	People of Jerusalem, you are under siege! Gather up your belongings. 
JER.10.18	The 
JER.10.19	The people of Jerusalem cried out,
JER.10.19	“How badly we are hurt!
JER.10.19	Our wounds will not heal.
JER.10.19	And we thought this was something we could endure!
JER.10.20	Our tents are ruined;
JER.10.20	the ropes that held them have broken.
JER.10.20	Our children have all gone away;
JER.10.20	there is no one left to put up our tents again;
JER.10.20	there is no one to hang their curtains.”
JER.10.21	I answered, “Our leaders are stupid;
JER.10.21	they do not ask the 
JER.10.21	This is why they have failed,
JER.10.21	and our people have been scattered.
JER.10.22	Listen! News has come!
JER.10.22	There is a great commotion in a nation to the north;
JER.10.22	its army will turn the cities of Judah into a desert,
JER.10.22	a place where jackals live.”
JER.10.23	none of us have control over our own life.
JER.10.24	Correct your people, 
JER.10.24	but do not be too hard on us
JER.10.24	or punish us when you are angry;
JER.10.24	that would be the end of us.
JER.10.25	Turn your anger on the nations that do not worship you
JER.10.25	and on the people who reject you.
JER.10.25	They have killed your people;
JER.10.25	they have destroyed us completely
JER.10.25	and left our country in ruins.
JER.11.1	The 
JER.11.2	“Listen to the terms of the covenant. Tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem 
JER.11.3	that I, the 
JER.11.4	It is the covenant I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the land that was like a blazing furnace to them. I told them to obey me and to do everything that I had commanded. I told them that if they obeyed, they would be my people and I would be their God. 
JER.11.5	Then I would keep the promise I made to their ancestors that I would give them the rich and fertile land which they now have.”
JER.11.5	I said, “Yes, 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly warned them to obey me, and I have kept on warning the people until this day. 
JER.11.8	But they did not listen or obey. Instead, everyone continued to be as stubborn and evil as ever. I had commanded them to keep the covenant, but they refused. So I brought on them all the punishments described in it.”
JER.11.9	Then the 
JER.11.10	They have gone back to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to do what I said; they have worshiped other gods. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their ancestors. 
JER.11.11	So now I, the 
JER.11.12	Then the people of Judah and of Jerusalem will go to the gods to whom they offer sacrifices and will cry out to them for help. But those gods will not be able to save them when this destruction comes. 
JER.11.13	The people of Judah have as many gods as they have cities, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have set up as many altars for sacrifices to that disgusting god Baal as there are streets in the city. 
JER.11.14	Jeremiah, don't pray to me or plead with me on behalf of these people. When they are in trouble and call to me for help, I will not listen to them.”
JER.11.15	The 
JER.11.16	I once called them a leafy olive tree, full of beautiful fruit; but now, with a roar like thunder I will set its leaves on fire and break its branches.
JER.11.17	“I, the 
JER.11.18	The 
JER.11.19	I was like a trusting lamb taken out to be killed, and I did not know that it was against me that they were planning evil things. They were saying, “Let's chop down the tree while it is still healthy;
JER.11.21	The people of Anathoth wanted me killed, and they told me that they would kill me if I kept on proclaiming the 
JER.11.22	So the 
JER.11.23	I have set a time for bringing disaster on the people of Anathoth, and when that time comes, none of them will survive.”
JER.12.1	“
JER.12.1	you would prove to be right.
JER.12.1	Yet I must question you about matters of justice.
JER.12.1	Why are the wicked so prosperous?
JER.12.1	Why do dishonest people succeed?
JER.12.2	You plant them, and they take root;
JER.12.2	they grow and bear fruit.
JER.12.2	They always speak well of you,
JER.12.2	yet they do not really care about you.
JER.12.3	But, 
JER.12.3	you see what I do
JER.12.3	and how I love you.
JER.12.3	Drag these evil people away like sheep to be butchered;
JER.12.3	guard them until it is time for them to be slaughtered.
JER.12.4	How long will our land be dry,
JER.12.4	and the grass in every field be withered?
JER.12.4	Animals and birds are dying
JER.12.4	because of the wickedness of our people,
JER.12.4	people who say, ‘God doesn't see what we are doing.’”
JER.12.5	The 
JER.12.5	“Jeremiah, if you get tired racing against people,
JER.12.5	how can you race against horses?
JER.12.5	If you can't even stand up in open country,
JER.12.5	how will you manage in the jungle by the Jordan?
JER.12.6	Even your relatives, members of your own family, have betrayed you;
JER.12.6	they join in the attacks against you.
JER.12.6	Do not trust them, even though they speak friendly words.”
JER.12.7	The 
JER.12.7	“I have abandoned Israel;
JER.12.7	I have rejected my chosen nation.
JER.12.7	I have given the people I love
JER.12.7	into the power of their enemies.
JER.12.8	My chosen people have turned against me;
JER.12.8	like a lion in the forest
JER.12.8	they have roared at me,
JER.12.8	and so I hate them.
JER.12.9	My chosen people are like a bird
JER.12.9	attacked from all sides by hawks.
JER.12.9	Call the wild animals
JER.12.9	to come and join in the feast!
JER.12.10	Many foreign rulers have destroyed my vineyard;
JER.12.10	they have trampled down my fields;
JER.12.10	they have turned my lovely land into a desert.
JER.12.11	They have made it a wasteland;
JER.12.11	it lies desolate before me.
JER.12.11	The whole land has become a desert,
JER.12.11	and no one cares.
JER.12.12	Across all the desert highlands
JER.12.12	people have come to plunder.
JER.12.12	I have sent war to destroy the entire land;
JER.12.12	no one can live in peace.
JER.12.13	My people planted wheat, but gathered weeds;
JER.12.13	they have worked hard, but got nothing for it.
JER.12.13	Because of my fierce anger
JER.12.13	their crops have failed.”
JER.12.14	The 
JER.12.15	But after I have taken them away, I will have mercy on them; I will bring each nation back to its own land and to its own country. 
JER.12.16	If with all their hearts they will accept the religion of my people and will swear, ‘As the 
JER.12.17	But if any nation will not obey, then I will completely uproot it and destroy it. I, the 
JER.13.1	The 
JER.13.2	So I bought them and put them on. 
JER.13.3	Then the 
JER.13.4	“Go to the Euphrates River and hide the shorts in a hole in the rocks.” 
JER.13.5	So I went and hid them near the Euphrates.
JER.13.6	Some time later the 
JER.13.7	So I went back, and when I found the place where I had hidden them, I saw that they were ruined and were no longer any good.
JER.13.8	Then the 
JER.13.9	“This is how I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
JER.13.10	These evil people have refused to obey me. They have been as stubborn and wicked as ever, and have worshiped and served other gods. So then, they will become like these shorts that are no longer any good. 
JER.13.11	Just as shorts fit tightly around the waist, so I intended all the people of Israel and Judah to hold tightly to me. I did this so that they would be my people and would bring praise and honor to my name; but they would not obey me.”
JER.13.12	The 
JER.13.13	Then tell them that I, the 
JER.13.14	Then I will smash them like jars against one another, old and young alike. No pity, compassion, or mercy will stop me from killing them.”
JER.13.15	People of Israel, the 
JER.13.15	Be humble and listen to him.
JER.13.16	Honor the 
JER.13.16	before he brings darkness,
JER.13.16	and you stumble on the mountains;
JER.13.16	before he turns into deep darkness
JER.13.16	the light you hoped for.
JER.13.17	If you will not listen,
JER.13.17	I will cry in secret because of your pride;
JER.13.17	I will cry bitterly, and my tears will flow
JER.13.17	because the 
JER.13.18	The 
JER.13.19	The towns of southern Judah are under siege; no one can get through to them. All the people of Judah have been taken away into exile.”
JER.13.20	Jerusalem, look! Your enemies are coming down from the north! Where are the people entrusted to your care, your people you were so proud of? 
JER.13.21	What will you say when people you thought were your friends conquer you and rule over you?
JER.13.22	If you ask why all this has happened to you—why your clothes have been torn off and you have been raped—it is because your sin is so terrible. 
JER.13.23	Can people change the color of their skin, or a leopard remove its spots? If they could, then you that do nothing but evil could learn to do what is right. 
JER.13.24	The 
JER.13.25	He has said that this will be your fate. This is what he has decided to do with you, because you have forgotten him and have trusted in false gods. 
JER.13.26	The 
JER.13.27	He has seen you do the things he hates. He has seen you go after pagan gods on the hills and in the fields, like a man lusting after his neighbor's wife or like a stallion after a mare. People of Jerusalem, you are doomed! When will you ever be pure?
JER.14.1	The 
JER.14.2	“Judah is in mourning;
JER.14.2	its cities are dying,
JER.14.2	its people lie on the ground in sorrow,
JER.14.2	and Jerusalem cries out for help.
JER.14.3	The rich people send their servants for water;
JER.14.3	they go to the cisterns,
JER.14.3	but find no water;
JER.14.3	they come back with their jars empty.
JER.14.3	Discouraged and confused,
JER.14.3	they hide their faces.
JER.14.4	Because there is no rain
JER.14.4	and the ground is dried up,
JER.14.4	the farmers are sick at heart;
JER.14.4	they hide their faces.
JER.14.5	In the field the mother deer
JER.14.5	abandons her newborn fawn
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	The wild donkeys stand on the hilltops
JER.14.6	and pant for breath like jackals;
JER.14.6	their eyesight fails them
JER.14.6	because they have no food.
JER.14.7	My people cry out to me,
JER.14.7	‘Even though our sins accuse us,
JER.14.7	help us, 
JER.14.7	We have turned away from you many times;
JER.14.7	we have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	You are Israel's only hope;
JER.14.8	you are the one who saves us from disaster.
JER.14.8	Why are you like a stranger in our land,
JER.14.8	like a traveler who stays for only one night?
JER.14.9	Why are you like someone taken by surprise,
JER.14.9	like a soldier powerless to help?
JER.14.9	Surely, 
JER.14.9	We are your people;
JER.14.9	do not abandon us.’”
JER.14.10	The 
JER.14.11	The 
JER.14.12	Even if they fast, I will not listen to their cry for help; and even if they offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not be pleased with them. Instead, I will kill them in war and by starvation and disease.”
JER.14.13	Then I said, “Sovereign 
JER.14.14	But the 
JER.14.15	I, the 
JER.14.16	The people to whom they have said these things will be killed in the same way. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will be no one to bury them. This will happen to all of them—including their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will make them pay for their wickedness.”
JER.14.17	The 
JER.14.17	“May my eyes flow with tears day and night,
JER.14.17	may I never stop weeping,
JER.14.17	for my people are deeply wounded
JER.14.17	and are badly hurt.
JER.14.18	When I go out in the fields,
JER.14.18	I see the bodies of men killed in war;
JER.14.18	when I go into the towns,
JER.14.18	I see people starving to death.
JER.14.18	Prophets and priests carry on their work,
JER.14.18	but they don't know what they are doing.”
JER.14.19	Do you hate the people of Zion?
JER.14.19	Why have you hurt us so badly
JER.14.19	that we cannot be healed?
JER.14.19	We looked for peace, but nothing good happened;
JER.14.19	we hoped for healing, but terror came instead.
JER.14.20	We have sinned against you, 
JER.14.20	we confess our own sins
JER.14.20	and the sins of our ancestors.
JER.14.21	Remember your promises and do not despise us;
JER.14.21	do not bring disgrace on Jerusalem,
JER.14.21	the place of your glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Do not break the covenant you made with us.
JER.14.22	None of the idols of the nations can send rain;
JER.14.22	the sky by itself cannot make showers fall.
JER.14.22	We have put our hope in you, O 
JER.14.22	because you are the one who does these things.
JER.15.2	 When they ask you where they should go, tell them that I have said:
JER.15.2	Some are doomed to die by disease—
JER.15.2	that's where they will go!
JER.15.2	Others are doomed to die in war—
JER.15.2	that's where they will go!
JER.15.2	Some are doomed to die of starvation—
JER.15.2	that's where they will go!
JER.15.2	Others are doomed to be taken away as prisoners—
JER.15.2	that's where they will go!
JER.15.3	I, the 
JER.15.4	 I will make all the people of the world horrified at them because of what Hezekiah's son Manasseh did in Jerusalem when he was king of Judah.”
JER.15.5	The 
JER.15.5	“Who will pity you, people of Jerusalem,
JER.15.5	and who will grieve over you?
JER.15.5	Who will stop long enough
JER.15.5	to ask how you are?
JER.15.6	You people have rejected me;
JER.15.6	you have turned your backs on me.
JER.15.6	So I reached out and crushed you
JER.15.6	because I was tired of controlling my anger.
JER.15.7	In every town in the land
JER.15.7	I threw you to the wind like straw.
JER.15.7	I destroyed you, my people,
JER.15.7	I killed your children
JER.15.7	because you did not stop your evil ways.
JER.15.8	There are more widows in your land
JER.15.8	than grains of sand by the sea.
JER.15.8	I killed your young men in their prime
JER.15.8	and made their mothers suffer.
JER.15.8	I suddenly struck them
JER.15.8	with anguish and terror.
JER.15.9	The mother who lost her seven children has fainted,
JER.15.9	gasping for breath.
JER.15.9	Her daylight has turned to darkness;
JER.15.9	she is disgraced and sick at heart.
JER.15.9	I will let your enemies kill
JER.15.9	those of you who are still alive.
JER.15.9	I, the 
JER.15.10	What an unhappy man I am! Why did my mother bring me into the world? I have to quarrel and argue with everyone in the land. I have not lent any money or borrowed any; yet everyone curses me. 
JER.15.11	, may all their curses come true if I have not served
JER.15.12	No one can break iron, especially the iron from the north that is mixed with bronze.)
JER.15.13	The 
JER.15.14	I will make them serve their enemies in a land they know nothing about, because my anger is like fire, and it will burn forever.”
JER.15.15	Then I said, “
JER.15.16	You spoke to me, and I listened to every word. I belong to you, 
JER.15.17	I did not spend my time with other people, laughing and having a good time. In obedience to your orders I stayed by myself and was filled with anger. 
JER.15.18	Why do I keep on suffering? Why are my wounds incurable? Why won't they heal? Do you intend to disappoint me like a stream that goes dry in the summer?”
JER.15.19	To this the 
JER.15.20	I will make you like a solid bronze wall as far as they are concerned. They will fight against you, but they will not defeat you. I will be with you to protect you and keep you safe. 
JER.15.21	I will rescue you from the power of wicked and violent people. I, the 
JER.16.1	Again the 
JER.16.2	“Do not marry or have children in a place like this. 
JER.16.3	I will tell you what is going to happen to the children who are born here and to their parents. 
JER.16.4	They will die of terrible diseases, and no one will mourn for them or bury them. Their bodies will lie like piles of manure on the ground. They will be killed in war or die of starvation, and their bodies will be food for the birds and the wild animals.
JER.16.5	“You must not enter a house where there is mourning. Do not grieve for anyone. I will no longer bless my people with peace or show them love and mercy. 
JER.16.6	The rich and the poor will die in this land, but no one will bury them or mourn for them. Not one of you will gash yourself or shave your head to show your grief. 
JER.16.7	No one will eat or drink with anyone to offer comfort when a loved one dies. No one will show sympathy, not even for someone who has lost a father or mother.
JER.16.8	“Do not enter a house where people are feasting. Do not sit down with them to eat and drink. 
JER.16.9	 Listen to what I, the 
JER.16.10	“When you tell them all this, they will ask you why I have decided to punish them so harshly. They will ask what crime they are guilty of and what sin they have committed against the 
JER.16.11	Then tell them that the 
JER.16.12	But you have done even worse than your ancestors. All of you are stubborn and evil, and you do not obey me. 
JER.16.13	So then, I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have ever known. And there you will serve other gods day and night, and I will show you no mercy.’”
JER.16.14	The 
JER.16.15	Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. I will bring them back to their own country, to the land that I gave their ancestors. I, the 
JER.16.16	The 
JER.16.17	I see everything they do. Nothing is hidden from me; their sins do not escape my sight. 
JER.16.18	I will make them pay double for their sin and wickedness, because they have defiled my land with idols that are as lifeless as corpses, and have filled it with their false gods.”
JER.16.20	Can people make their own gods? No, if they did, those would not really be gods.”
JER.16.21	“So then,” says the 
JER.17.1	The 
JER.17.2	Your people worship at the altars and the symbols that have been set up for the goddess Asherah by every green tree and on the hilltops 
JER.17.3	and on the mountains in the open country. I will have your enemies take away your wealth and your treasures because of all the sins you have committed
JER.17.4	You will have to give up
JER.17.5	The 
JER.17.5	“I will condemn those
JER.17.5	who turn away from me
JER.17.5	and put their trust in human beings,
JER.17.5	in the strength of mortals.
JER.17.6	He is like a bush in the desert,
JER.17.6	which grows in the dry wasteland,
JER.17.6	on salty ground where nothing else grows.
JER.17.6	Nothing good ever happens to him.
JER.17.7	“But I will bless the person
JER.17.7	who puts his trust in me.
JER.17.8	and sending out roots to the water.
JER.17.8	It is not afraid when hot weather comes,
JER.17.8	because its leaves stay green;
JER.17.8	it has no worries when there is no rain;
JER.17.8	it keeps on bearing fruit.
JER.17.9	“Who can understand the human heart?
JER.17.9	There is nothing else so deceitful;
JER.17.9	it is too sick to be healed.
JER.17.10	and test the hearts of people.
JER.17.10	I treat each of them according to the way they live,
JER.17.10	according to what they do.”
JER.17.11	The person who gets money dishonestly
JER.17.11	is like a bird that hatches eggs it didn't lay.
JER.17.11	In the prime of life he will lose his riches,
JER.17.11	and in the end he is nothing but a fool.
JER.17.12	Our Temple is like a glorious throne,
JER.17.12	standing on a high mountain from the beginning.
JER.17.13	all who abandon you will be put to shame.
JER.17.13	They will disappear like names written in the dust,
JER.17.13	because they have abandoned you, the 
JER.17.13	the spring of fresh water.
JER.17.15	The people say to me, “Where are those threats the 
JER.17.16	But, 
JER.17.17	Do not be a terror to me; you are my place of safety when trouble comes. 
JER.17.18	Bring disgrace on those who persecute me, but spare me, 
JER.17.19	The 
JER.17.20	Tell the kings and all the people of Judah and everyone who lives in Jerusalem and enters these gates, to listen to what I say. 
JER.17.21	 Tell them that if they love their lives, they must not carry any load on the Sabbath; they must not carry anything in through the gates of Jerusalem 
JER.17.22	 or carry anything out of their houses on the Sabbath. They must not work on the Sabbath; they must observe it as a sacred day, as I commanded their ancestors. 
JER.17.23	Their ancestors did not listen to me or pay any attention. Instead, they became stubborn; they would not obey me or learn from me.
JER.17.24	“Tell these people that they must obey all my commands. They must not carry any load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath. They must observe the Sabbath as a sacred day and must not do any work at all. 
JER.17.25	Then their kings and princes will enter the gates of Jerusalem and have the same royal power that David had. Together with the people of Judah and of Jerusalem, they will ride in chariots and on horses, and the city of Jerusalem will always be filled with people. 
JER.17.26	People will come from the towns of Judah and from the villages around Jerusalem; they will come from the territory of Benjamin, from the foothills, from the mountains, and from southern Judah. They will bring to my Temple burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, as well as thank offerings. 
JER.17.27	But they must obey me and observe the Sabbath as a sacred day. They must not carry any load through the gates of Jerusalem on that day, for if they do, I will set the gates of Jerusalem on fire. Fire will burn down the palaces of Jerusalem, and no one will be able to put it out.”
JER.18.1	The 
JER.18.2	“Go down to the potter's house, where I will give you my message.” 
JER.18.3	So I went there and saw the potter working at his wheel. 
JER.18.4	Whenever a piece of pottery turned out imperfect, he would take the clay and make it into something else.
JER.18.5	Then the 
JER.18.6	“Don't I have the right to do with you people of Israel what the potter did with the clay? You are in my hands just like clay in the potter's hands. 
JER.18.7	If at any time I say that I am going to uproot, break down, or destroy any nation or kingdom, 
JER.18.8	but then that nation turns from its evil, I will not do what I said I would. 
JER.18.9	On the other hand, if I say that I am going to plant or build up any nation or kingdom, 
JER.18.10	but then that nation disobeys me and does evil, I will not do what I said I would. 
JER.18.11	Now then, tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem that I am making plans against them and getting ready to punish them. Tell them to stop living sinful lives—to change their ways and the things they are doing. 
JER.18.12	They will answer, ‘No, why should we? We will all be just as stubborn and evil as we want to be.’”
JER.18.13	The 
JER.18.13	“Ask every nation if such a thing
JER.18.13	has ever happened before.
JER.18.13	The people of Israel have done a terrible thing!
JER.18.14	Are Lebanon's rocky heights ever without snow?
JER.18.14	Do its cool mountain streams ever run dry?
JER.18.15	Yet my people have forgotten me;
JER.18.15	they burn incense to idols.
JER.18.15	They have stumbled in the way they should go;
JER.18.15	they no longer follow the old ways;
JER.18.15	they walk on unmarked paths.
JER.18.16	They have made this land a thing of horror,
JER.18.16	to be despised forever.
JER.18.16	All who pass by will be shocked at what they see;
JER.18.16	they will shake their heads in amazement.
JER.18.17	I will scatter my people before their enemies,
JER.18.17	like dust blown by the east wind.
JER.18.17	I will turn my back on them;
JER.18.17	I will not help them when the disaster comes.”
JER.18.18	Then the people said, “Let's do something about Jeremiah! There will always be priests to instruct us, the wise to give us counsel, and prophets to proclaim God's message. Let's bring charges against him and stop listening to what he says.”
JER.18.19	So I prayed, “
JER.18.20	Is evil the payment for good? Yet they have dug a pit for me to fall in. Remember how I came to you and spoke on their behalf, so that you would not deal with them in anger. 
JER.18.21	But now, 
JER.18.22	Send a mob to plunder their homes without warning; make them cry out in terror. They have dug a pit for me to fall in and have set traps to catch me. 
JER.18.23	But, 
JER.19.1	The 
JER.19.2	 and to go through Potsherd Gate out to Hinnom Valley. There I was to proclaim the message that he would give me. 
JER.19.3	The 
JER.19.4	I am going to do this because the people have abandoned me and defiled this place by offering sacrifices here to other gods—gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known anything about. They have filled this place with the blood of innocent people, 
JER.19.5	 and they have built altars for Baal in order to burn their children in the fire as sacrifices. I never commanded them to do this; it never even entered my mind. 
JER.19.6	So then, the time will come when this place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley. Instead, it will be known as Slaughter Valley. 
JER.19.7	In this place I will frustrate all the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem. I will let their enemies triumph over them and kill them in battle. I will give their corpses to the birds and the wild animals as food. 
JER.19.8	I will bring such terrible destruction on this city that everyone who passes by will be shocked and amazed. 
JER.19.9	The enemy will surround the city and try to kill its people. The siege will be so terrible that the people inside the city will eat one another and even their own children.”
JER.19.10	Then the 
JER.19.11	and to tell them that the 
JER.19.12	I promise that I will make this city and its inhabitants like Topheth. 
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem, the houses of the kings of Judah, and indeed all the houses on whose roofs incense has been burned to the stars and where wine has been poured out as an offering to other gods—they will all be as unclean as Topheth.”
JER.19.14	Then I left Topheth, where the 
JER.19.15	that the 
JER.20.1	When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was the chief officer of the Temple, heard me proclaim these things, 
JER.20.2	he had me beaten and placed in chains near the upper Benjamin Gate in the Temple. 
JER.20.3	The next morning, after Pashhur had released me from the chains, I said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	The 
JER.20.5	I will also let their enemies plunder all the wealth of this city and seize all its possessions and property, even the treasures of the kings of Judah, and carry everything off to Babylonia. 
JER.20.6	As for you, Pashhur, you and all your family will also be captured and taken off to Babylonia. There you will die and be buried, along with all your friends to whom you have told so many lies.’”
JER.20.7	and I was deceived.
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I am,
JER.20.7	and you have overpowered me.
JER.20.7	Everyone makes fun of me;
JER.20.7	they laugh at me all day long.
JER.20.8	Whenever I speak, I have to cry out
JER.20.8	and shout, “Violence! Destruction!”
JER.20.8	because I proclaim your message.
JER.20.9	But when I say, “I will forget the 
JER.20.9	and no longer speak in his name,”
JER.20.9	then your message is like a fire
JER.20.9	burning deep within me.
JER.20.9	I try my best to hold it in,
JER.20.9	but can no longer keep it back.
JER.20.10	I hear everybody whispering,
JER.20.10	“Terror is everywhere!
JER.20.10	So let's report him to the authorities!”
JER.20.10	Even my close friends wait for my downfall.
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he can be tricked,” they say;
JER.20.10	“then we can catch him and get revenge.”
JER.20.11	But you, 
JER.20.11	and those who persecute me will fail.
JER.20.11	They will be disgraced forever,
JER.20.11	because they cannot succeed.
JER.20.11	Their disgrace will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	But, Almighty 
JER.20.12	you know what is in their hearts and minds.
JER.20.12	So let me see you take revenge on my enemies,
JER.20.12	for I have placed my cause in your hands.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Praise the 
JER.20.13	He rescues the oppressed from the power of evil people.
JER.20.14	Forget the day my mother gave me birth!
JER.20.15	Curse the one who made my father glad
JER.20.15	by bringing him the news,
JER.20.15	“It's a boy! You have a son!”
JER.20.16	May he be like those cities
JER.20.16	that the 
JER.20.16	May he hear cries of pain in the morning
JER.20.16	and the battle alarm at noon,
JER.20.17	for not killing me before I was born.
JER.20.17	Then my mother's womb would have been my grave.
JER.20.18	Why was I born?
JER.20.18	Was it only to have trouble and sorrow,
JER.20.18	to end my life in disgrace?
JER.21.1	King Zedekiah of Judah sent to me Pashhur son of Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah with this request: 
JER.21.2	 “Please speak to the 
JER.21.3	Then the 
JER.21.4	to tell Zedekiah that the 
JER.21.5	I will fight against you with all my might, my anger, my wrath, and my fury. 
JER.21.6	I will kill everyone living in this city; people and animals alike will die of a terrible disease. 
JER.21.7	But as for you, your officials, and the people who survive the war, the famine, and the disease—I will let all of you be captured by King Nebuchadnezzar and by your enemies, who want to kill you. Nebuchadnezzar will put you to death. He will not spare any of you or show mercy or pity to any of you. I, the 
JER.21.8	Then the 
JER.21.9	Anyone who stays in the city will be killed in war or by starvation or disease. But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians, who are now attacking the city, will not be killed; they will at least escape with their life. 
JER.21.10	I have made up my mind not to spare this city, but to destroy it. It will be given over to the king of Babylonia, and he will burn it to the ground. I, the 
JER.21.11+JER.21.12	The 
JER.21.13	You, Jerusalem, are sitting
JER.21.14	But I will punish you for what you have done. I will set your palace on fire, and the fire will burn down everything around it. I, the 
JER.22.1+JER.22.2	The 
JER.22.3	“I, the 
JER.22.4	If you really do as I have commanded, then David's descendants will continue to be kings. And they, together with their officials and their people, will continue to pass through the gates of this palace in chariots and on horses. 
JER.22.5	 But if you do not obey my commands, then I swear to you that this palace will fall into ruins. I, the 
JER.22.6	“To me, Judah's royal palace is as beautiful as the land of Gilead and as the Lebanon Mountains; but I will make it a desolate place where no one lives. 
JER.22.7	I am sending men to destroy it. They will all bring their axes, cut down its beautiful cedar pillars, and throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“Afterward many foreigners will pass by and ask one another why I, the 
JER.22.9	Then they will answer that it is because you have abandoned your covenant with me, your God, and have worshiped and served other gods.”
JER.22.10	People of Judah, do not weep for King Josiah;
JER.22.10	do not mourn his death.
JER.22.10	But weep bitterly for Joahaz, his son;
JER.22.10	they are taking him away, never to return,
JER.22.10	never again to see the land where he was born.
JER.22.12	He will die in the country where they have taken him, and he will never again see this land.”
JER.22.13	Doomed is the one who builds his house by injustice
JER.22.13	and enlarges it by dishonesty;
JER.22.13	who makes his people work for nothing
JER.22.13	and does not pay their wages.
JER.22.14	Doomed is the one who says,
JER.22.14	“I will build myself a mansion
JER.22.14	with spacious rooms upstairs.”
JER.22.14	So he puts windows in his house,
JER.22.14	panels it with cedar,
JER.22.14	and paints it red.
JER.22.15	Does it make you a better king
JER.22.15	if you build houses of cedar,
JER.22.15	finer than those of others?
JER.22.15	Your father enjoyed a full life.
JER.22.15	He was always just and fair,
JER.22.15	and he prospered in everything he did.
JER.22.16	He gave the poor a fair trial,
JER.22.16	and all went well with him.
JER.22.16	That is what it means to know the 
JER.22.17	But you can only see your selfish interests;
JER.22.17	you kill the innocent
JER.22.17	and violently oppress your people.
JER.22.17	The 
JER.22.18	“No one will mourn his death or say,
JER.22.18	‘How terrible, my friend, how terrible!’
JER.22.18	No one will weep for him or cry,
JER.22.18	‘My lord! My king!’
JER.22.19	With the funeral honors of a donkey,
JER.22.19	he will be dragged away
JER.22.19	and thrown outside Jerusalem's gates.”
JER.22.20	People of Jerusalem, go to Lebanon and shout,
JER.22.20	go to the land of Bashan and cry;
JER.22.20	call out from the mountains of Moab,
JER.22.20	because all your allies have been defeated.
JER.22.21	The 
JER.22.21	but you refused to listen.
JER.22.21	That is what you've done all your life;
JER.22.21	you never would obey the 
JER.22.22	Your leaders will be blown away by the wind,
JER.22.22	your allies taken as prisoners of war,
JER.22.22	your city disgraced and put to shame
JER.22.22	because of all the evil you have done.
JER.22.23	You rest secure among the cedars brought from Lebanon;
JER.22.23	but how pitiful you'll be when pains strike you,
JER.22.23	pains like those of a woman in labor.
JER.22.25	and give you to people you are afraid of, people who want to kill you. I will give you to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his soldiers. 
JER.22.26	I am going to force you and your mother into exile. You will go to a country where neither of you was born, and both of you will die there. 
JER.22.27	You will long to see this country again, but you will never return.”
JER.22.28	I said, “Has King Jehoiachin become like a broken jar that is thrown away and that no one wants? Is that why he and his children have been taken into exile to a land they know nothing about?”
JER.22.29	O land, land, land!
JER.22.29	Listen to what the 
JER.22.30	“This man is condemned to lose his children,
JER.22.30	to be a man who will never succeed.
JER.22.30	He will have no descendants
JER.22.30	who will rule in Judah
JER.22.30	as David's successors.
JER.22.30	I, the 
JER.23.1	How terrible will be the 
JER.23.2	This is what the 
JER.23.3	I will gather the rest of my people from the countries where I have scattered them, and I will bring them back to their homeland. They will have many children and increase in number. 
JER.23.4	I will appoint rulers to take care of them. My people will no longer be afraid or terrified, and I will not punish them again.
JER.23.6	When he is king, the people of Judah will be safe, and the people of Israel will live in peace. He will be called ‘The 
JER.23.7	“The time is coming,” says the 
JER.23.8	Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. Then they will live in their own land.”
JER.23.9	My heart is crushed,
JER.23.9	and I am trembling.
JER.23.9	Because of the 
JER.23.9	because of his holy words,
JER.23.9	I am like a man who is drunk,
JER.23.9	someone who has had too much wine.
JER.23.10	The land is full of people unfaithful to the 
JER.23.10	they live wicked lives and misuse their power.
JER.23.10	Because of the 
JER.23.10	and the pastures are dry.
JER.23.11	The 
JER.23.11	“The prophets and the priests are godless;
JER.23.11	I have caught them doing evil in the Temple itself.
JER.23.12	The paths they follow will be slippery and dark;
JER.23.12	I will make them stumble and fall.
JER.23.12	I am going to bring disaster on them;
JER.23.12	the time of their punishment is coming.
JER.23.12	I, the 
JER.23.13	I have seen the sin of Samaria's prophets:
JER.23.13	they have spoken in the name of Baal
JER.23.13	and have led my people astray.
JER.23.14	they commit adultery and tell lies;
JER.23.14	they help people to do wrong,
JER.23.14	so that no one stops doing what is evil.
JER.23.14	To me they are all as bad
JER.23.14	as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	“So then, this is what I, the 
JER.23.15	I will give them bitter plants to eat
JER.23.15	and poison to drink,
JER.23.15	because they have spread ungodliness throughout the land.”
JER.23.16	The 
JER.23.17	To the people who refuse to listen to what I have said, they keep saying that all will go well with them. And they tell everyone who is stubborn that disaster will never touch them.”
JER.23.18	I said, “None of these prophets has ever known the 
JER.23.19	His anger is a storm, a furious wind that will rage over the heads of the wicked, 
JER.23.20	and it will not end until he has done everything he intends to do. In days to come his people will understand this clearly.”
JER.23.21	The 
JER.23.22	If they had known my secret thoughts, then they could have proclaimed my message to my people and could have made them give up the evil lives they live and the wicked things they do.
JER.23.23	“I am a God who is everywhere and not in one place only. 
JER.23.24	 No one can hide where I cannot see them. Do you not know that I am everywhere in heaven and on earth? 
JER.23.25	I know what those prophets have said who speak lies in my name and claim that I have given them my messages in their dreams. 
JER.23.26	How much longer will those prophets mislead my people with the lies they have invented? 
JER.23.27	They think that the dreams they tell will make my people forget me, just as their ancestors forgot me and turned to Baal. 
JER.23.28	The prophet who has had a dream should say it is only a dream, but the prophet who has heard my message should proclaim that message faithfully. What good is straw compared with wheat? 
JER.23.29	My message is like a fire and like a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces. 
JER.23.30	I am against those prophets who take each other's words and proclaim them as my message. 
JER.23.31	I am also against those prophets who speak their own words and claim they came from me. 
JER.23.32	Listen to what I, the 
JER.23.33	The 
JER.23.34	If any of my people or a prophet or a priest even uses the words ‘the 
JER.23.35	Instead, each one of them should ask their friends and their relatives, ‘What answer has the 
JER.23.36	So they must no longer use the words ‘the 
JER.23.37	Jeremiah, ask the prophets, ‘What answer did the 
JER.23.38	And if they disobey my command and use the words ‘the 
JER.23.39	I will certainly pick them up
JER.23.40	I will bring on them everlasting shame and disgrace that will never be forgotten.”
JER.24.2	The first basket contained good figs, those that ripen early; the other one contained bad figs, too bad to eat. 
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.3	I answered, “Figs. The good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, too bad to eat.”
JER.24.4	So the 
JER.24.5	“I, the 
JER.24.6	I will watch over them and bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not pull them up. 
JER.24.7	I will give them the desire to know that I am the 
JER.24.8	“As for King Zedekiah of Judah, the politicians around him, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who have stayed in this land or moved to Egypt—I, the 
JER.24.9	I will bring such a disaster on them that all the nations of the world will be terrified. People will make fun of them, make jokes about them, ridicule them, and use their name as a curse everywhere I scatter them. 
JER.24.10	I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them until there is not one of them left in the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.”
JER.25.2	I said to all the people of Judah and of Jerusalem, 
JER.25.3	“For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah until this very day, the 
JER.25.4	You would not listen or pay attention, even though the 
JER.25.5	They told you to turn from your wicked way of life and from the evil things you are doing, so that you could go on living in the land that the 
JER.25.6	They told you not to worship and serve other gods and not to make the 
JER.25.7	But the 
JER.25.8	“So then, because you would not listen to him, the 
JER.25.9	‘I am going to send for all the peoples from the north and for my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I am going to bring them to fight against Judah and its inhabitants and against all the neighboring nations. I am going to destroy this nation and its neighbors and leave them in ruins forever, a terrible and shocking sight. I, the 
JER.25.10	 I will silence their shouts of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. They will have no oil for their lamps, and there will be no more grain. 
JER.25.11	 This whole land will be left in ruins and will be a shocking sight, and the neighboring nations will serve the king of Babylonia for seventy years. 
JER.25.12	After that I will punish Babylonia and its king for their sin. I will destroy that country and leave it in ruins forever. 
JER.25.13	I will punish Babylonia with all the disasters that I threatened to bring on the nations when I spoke through Jeremiah—all the disasters recorded in this book. 
JER.25.14	I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done, and many nations and great kings will make slaves of them.’”
JER.25.15	The 
JER.25.16	When they drink from it, they will stagger and go out of their minds because of the war I am sending against them.”
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah, together with its kings and leaders, were made to drink from it, so that they would become a desert, a terrible and shocking sight, and so that people would use their name as a curse—as they still do.
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	Here is the list of all the others who had to drink from the cup:

JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the people of Edom, Moab, and Ammon;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of the Mediterranean lands;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	the cities of Dedan, Tema, and Buz;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the people who cut their hair short;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of Arabia;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of the desert tribes;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another.
JER.25.19+JER.25.20+JER.25.21+JER.25.22+JER.25.23+JER.25.24+JER.25.25+JER.25.26	Every nation on the face of the earth had to drink from it. Last of all, the king of Babylonia will drink from it.
JER.25.27	Then the 
JER.25.28	And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink from it, then tell them that the 
JER.25.29	I will begin my work of destruction in my own city. Do they think they will go unpunished? No, they will be punished, for I am going to send war on all the people on earth. I, the 
JER.25.30	“You, Jeremiah, must proclaim everything I have said. You must tell these people,
JER.25.30	‘The 
JER.25.30	and thunder from the heights of heaven.
JER.25.30	He will roar against his people;
JER.25.30	he will shout like a man treading grapes.
JER.25.30	Everyone on earth will hear him,
JER.25.31	and the sound will echo to the ends of the earth.
JER.25.31	The 
JER.25.31	He will bring all people to trial
JER.25.31	and put the wicked to death.
JER.25.31	The 
JER.25.32	The 
JER.25.33	On that day the bodies of those whom the 
JER.25.34	Cry, you leaders, you shepherds of my people, cry out loud! Mourn and roll in the dust. The time has come for you to be slaughtered,
JER.25.35	There will be no way for you to escape. 
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	You moan and cry out in distress because the 
JER.25.38	The 
JER.26.2	the 
JER.26.3	Perhaps the people will listen and give up their evil ways. If they do, then I will change my mind about the destruction I plan to bring on them for all their wicked deeds.”
JER.26.4	The 
JER.26.5	and by paying attention to the words of my servants, the prophets, whom I have kept on sending to you. You have never obeyed what they said. 
JER.26.6	 If you continue to disobey, then I will do to this Temple what I did to Shiloh,
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard me saying these things in the Temple, 
JER.26.8	and as soon as I had finished all that the 
JER.26.9	Why have you said in the 
JER.26.10	When the leaders of Judah heard what had happened, they hurried from the royal palace to the Temple and took their places at the New Gate. 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets said to the leaders and to the people, “This man deserves to be sentenced to death because he has spoken against our city. You heard him with your own ears.”
JER.26.12	Then I said, “The 
JER.26.13	You must change the way you are living and the things you are doing, and must obey the 
JER.26.14	As for me, I am in your power! Do with me whatever you think is fair and right. 
JER.26.15	But be sure of this: if you kill me, you and the people of this city will be guilty of killing an innocent man, because it is the 
JER.26.16	Then the leaders and the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man spoke to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	After that, some of the elders stood up and said to the people who had gathered, 
JER.26.18	 “When Hezekiah was king of Judah, the prophet Micah of Moresheth told all the people that the 
JER.26.18	‘Zion will be plowed like a field;
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins,
JER.26.18	and the Temple hill will become a forest.’
JER.26.19	King Hezekiah and the people of Judah did not put Micah to death. Instead, Hezekiah honored the 
JER.26.19	( 
JER.26.20	There was another man, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim, who spoke in the name of the 
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim and his soldiers and officials heard what Uriah had said, the king tried to have him killed. But Uriah heard about it; so he fled in terror and escaped to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some other men to Egypt to get Uriah. 
JER.26.23	They brought him back to King Jehoiakim, who had him killed and his body thrown into the public burial ground.)
JER.26.24	But because I had the support of Ahikam son of Shaphan, I was not handed over to the people and killed.
JER.27.2	to make myself a yoke out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and to put it on my neck. 
JER.27.3	Then the 
JER.27.4	The 
JER.27.5	“By my great power and strength I created the world, human beings, and all the animals that live on the earth; and I give it to anyone I choose. 
JER.27.6	 I am the one who has placed all these nations under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, and I have made even the wild animals serve him. 
JER.27.7	All nations will serve him, and they will serve his son and his grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then his nation will serve powerful nations and great kings.
JER.27.8	“But if any nation or kingdom will not submit to his rule, then I will punish that nation by war, starvation, and disease until I have let Nebuchadnezzar destroy it completely. 
JER.27.9	Do not listen to your prophets or to those who claim they can predict the future, either by dreams or by calling up the spirits of the dead or by magic. They all tell you not to submit to the king of Babylonia. 
JER.27.10	They are deceiving you and will cause you to be taken far away from your country. I will drive you out, and you will be destroyed. 
JER.27.11	But if any nation submits to the king of Babylonia and serves him, then I will let it stay on in its own land, to farm it and live there. I, the 
JER.27.12	I said the same thing to King Zedekiah of Judah, “Submit to the king of Babylonia. Serve him and his people, and you will live. 
JER.27.13	Why should you and your people die in war or of starvation or disease? That is what the 
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the prophets who tell you not to surrender to him. They are deceiving you. 
JER.27.15	The 
JER.27.16	Then I told the priests and the people that the 
JER.27.17	Don't listen to them! Submit to the king of Babylonia and you will live! Why should this city become a pile of ruins? 
JER.27.18	If they are really prophets and if they have my message, let them ask me, the 
JER.27.18	( 
JER.27.19+JER.27.20	When King Nebuchadnezzar took away to Babylonia the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, and the leading men of Judah and Jerusalem, he left the columns, the bronze tank, the carts, and some of the other Temple treasures.)
JER.27.21	“Listen to what I, the 
JER.27.22	They will be taken to Babylonia and will remain there until I turn my attention to them. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place. I, the 
JER.28.2	that the 
JER.28.3	Within two years I will bring back to this place all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylonia. 
JER.28.4	I will also bring back the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, along with all of the people of Judah who went into exile in Babylonia. Yes, I will break the power of the king of Babylonia. I, the 
JER.28.5	Then in the presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the Temple, I said to Hananiah, 
JER.28.6	“Wonderful! I hope the 
JER.28.7	But listen to what I say to you and to the people. 
JER.28.8	The prophets who spoke long ago, before my time and yours, predicted that war, starvation, and disease would come to many nations and powerful kingdoms. 
JER.28.9	But a prophet who predicts peace can only be recognized as a prophet whom the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah took the yoke off my neck, broke it in pieces, 
JER.28.11	and said in the presence of all the people, “The 
JER.28.12	Some time after this the 
JER.28.13	to go and tell Hananiah: “The 
JER.28.14	The 
JER.28.15	Then I told Hananiah this, and added, “Listen, Hananiah! The 
JER.28.16	And so the 
JER.28.17	And Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year.
JER.29.2	I wrote it after King Jehoiachin, his mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and of Jerusalem, the engravers, and the skilled workers had been taken into exile. 
JER.29.3	I gave the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah was sending to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. It said:
JER.29.4	“The 
JER.29.5	‘Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them. 
JER.29.6	Marry and have children. Then let your children get married, so that they also may have children. You must increase in numbers and not decrease. 
JER.29.7	Work for the good of the cities where I have made you go as prisoners. Pray to me on their behalf, because if they are prosperous, you will be prosperous too. 
JER.29.8	I, the 
JER.29.9	They are telling you lies in my name. I did not send them. I, the 
JER.29.11	I alone know the plans I have for you, plans to bring you prosperity and not disaster, plans to bring about the future you hope for.
JER.29.12	Then you will call to me. You will come and pray to me, and I will answer you. 
JER.29.13	 You will seek me, and you will find me because you will seek me with all your heart. 
JER.29.14	Yes, I say, you will find me, and I will restore you to your land. I will gather you from every country and from every place to which I have scattered you, and I will bring you back to the land from which I had sent you away into exile. I, the 
JER.29.15	“You say that the 
JER.29.16	Listen to what the 
JER.29.17	The 
JER.29.18	I will pursue them with war, starvation, and disease, and all the nations of the world will be horrified at what they see. Everywhere I scatter them, people will be shocked and terrified at what has happened to them. People will make fun of them and use their name as a curse. 
JER.29.19	This will happen to them because they did not obey the message that I kept on sending to them through my servants the prophets. They refused to listen. 
JER.29.20	All of you whom I sent into exile in Babylonia, listen to what I, the 
JER.29.21	“The 
JER.29.22	When the people who were taken away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia want to bring a curse on someone, they will say, ‘May the 
JER.29.23	This will be their fate because they are guilty of terrible sins—they have committed adultery and have told lies in the 
JER.29.24+JER.29.25	The 
JER.29.26	“The 
JER.29.27	Why haven't you done this to Jeremiah of Anathoth, who has been speaking as a prophet to the people? 
JER.29.28	He must be stopped because he told the people in Babylonia that they would be prisoners there a long time and should build houses, settle down, plant gardens, and eat what they grow.”
JER.29.29	Zephaniah read the letter to me, 
JER.29.30	and then the 
JER.29.31+JER.29.32	to send to all the prisoners in Babylon this message about Shemaiah: “I, the 
JER.30.1	The 
JER.30.2	said to me, “Write down in a book everything that I have told you, 
JER.30.3	because the time is coming when I will restore my people, Israel and Judah. I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it again. I, the 
JER.30.4	The 
JER.30.5	“I heard a cry of terror,
JER.30.5	a cry of fear and not of peace.
JER.30.6	Now stop and think!
JER.30.6	Can a man give birth to a child?
JER.30.6	Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach
JER.30.6	like a woman in labor?
JER.30.6	Why is everyone so pale?
JER.30.7	A terrible day is coming;
JER.30.7	no other day can compare with it—
JER.30.7	a time of distress for my people,
JER.30.7	but they will survive.”
JER.30.8	The 
JER.30.9	Instead, they will serve me, the 
JER.30.10	people of Israel, do not be terrified.
JER.30.10	I will rescue you from that faraway land,
JER.30.10	from the land where you are prisoners.
JER.30.10	You will come back home and live in peace;
JER.30.10	you will be secure, and no one will make you afraid.
JER.30.11	I will come to you and save you.
JER.30.11	I will destroy all the nations
JER.30.11	where I have scattered you,
JER.30.11	but I will not destroy you.
JER.30.11	I will not let you go unpunished;
JER.30.11	but when I punish you, I will be fair.
JER.30.11	I, the 
JER.30.12	The 
JER.30.12	“Your wounds are incurable,
JER.30.12	your injuries cannot be healed.
JER.30.13	There is no one to take care of you,
JER.30.13	no remedy for your sores,
JER.30.13	no hope of healing for you.
JER.30.14	All your lovers have forgotten you;
JER.30.14	they no longer care about you.
JER.30.14	I have attacked you like an enemy;
JER.30.14	your punishment has been harsh
JER.30.14	because your sins are many
JER.30.14	and your wickedness is great.
JER.30.15	Complain no more about your injuries;
JER.30.15	there is no cure for you.
JER.30.15	I punished you like this
JER.30.15	because your sins are many
JER.30.15	and your wickedness is great.
JER.30.16	But now, all who devour you will be devoured,
JER.30.16	and all your enemies will be taken away as prisoners.
JER.30.16	All who oppress you will be oppressed,
JER.30.16	and all who plunder you will be plundered.
JER.30.17	I will make you well again;
JER.30.17	I will heal your wounds,
JER.30.17	though your enemies say,
JER.30.17	‘Zion is an outcast;
JER.30.17	no one cares about her.’
JER.30.17	I, the 
JER.30.18	The 
JER.30.18	“I will restore my people to their land
JER.30.18	and have mercy on every family;
JER.30.18	Jerusalem will be rebuilt,
JER.30.18	and its palace restored.
JER.30.19	The people who live there will sing praise;
JER.30.19	they will shout for joy.
JER.30.19	By my blessing they will increase in numbers;
JER.30.19	my blessing will bring them honor.
JER.30.20	I will restore the nation's ancient power
JER.30.20	and establish it firmly again;
JER.30.20	I will punish all who oppress them.
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	Their ruler will come from their own nation,
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	their prince from their own people.
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	He will approach me when I invite him,
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	for who would dare come uninvited?
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	They will be my people,
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	and I will be their God.
JER.30.21+JER.30.22	I, the 
JER.30.23+JER.30.24	The 
JER.31.1	The 
JER.31.2	In the desert I showed mercy to those people who had escaped death. When the people of Israel longed for rest, 
JER.31.3	I appeared to them
JER.31.4	Once again I will rebuild you. Once again you will take up your tambourines and dance joyfully. 
JER.31.5	Once again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria, and those who plant them will eat what the vineyards produce. 
JER.31.6	Yes, the time is coming when sentries will call out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Let's go up to Zion, to the 
JER.31.7	The 
JER.31.7	“Sing with joy for Israel,
JER.31.7	the greatest of the nations.
JER.31.7	Sing your song of praise,
JER.31.7	‘The 
JER.31.7	he has rescued all who are left.’
JER.31.8	I will bring them from the north
JER.31.8	and gather them from the ends of the earth.
JER.31.8	The blind and the lame will come with them,
JER.31.8	pregnant women and those about to give birth.
JER.31.8	They will come back a great nation.
JER.31.9	My people will return weeping,
JER.31.9	praying as I lead them back.
JER.31.9	I will guide them to streams of water,
JER.31.9	on a smooth road where they will not stumble.
JER.31.9	I am like a father to Israel,
JER.31.9	and Ephraim is my oldest son.”
JER.31.10	The 
JER.31.10	“Nations, listen to me
JER.31.10	and proclaim my words on the far-off shores.
JER.31.10	I scattered my people, but I will gather them
JER.31.10	and guard them as a shepherd guards his flock.
JER.31.11	I have set Israel's people free
JER.31.11	and have saved them from a mighty nation.
JER.31.12	They will come and sing for joy on Mount Zion
JER.31.12	and be delighted with my gifts—
JER.31.12	gifts of grain and wine and olive oil,
JER.31.12	gifts of sheep and cattle.
JER.31.12	They will be like a well-watered garden;
JER.31.12	they will have everything they need.
JER.31.13	Then the young women will dance and be happy,
JER.31.13	and men, young and old, will rejoice.
JER.31.13	I will comfort them and turn their mourning into joy,
JER.31.13	their sorrow into gladness.
JER.31.14	I will fill the priests with the richest food
JER.31.14	and satisfy all the needs of my people.
JER.31.14	I, the 
JER.31.15	“A sound is heard in Ramah,
JER.31.15	the sound of bitter weeping.
JER.31.15	Rachel is crying for her children;
JER.31.15	they are gone,
JER.31.15	and she refuses to be comforted.
JER.31.16	Stop your crying
JER.31.16	and wipe away your tears.
JER.31.16	All that you have done for your children
JER.31.16	will not go unrewarded;
JER.31.16	they will return from the enemy's land.
JER.31.17	There is hope for your future;
JER.31.17	your children will come back home.
JER.31.17	I, the 
JER.31.18	“I hear the people of Israel say in grief,
JER.31.18	‘
JER.31.18	but you taught us to obey.
JER.31.18	Bring us back;
JER.31.18	we are ready to return to you,
JER.31.18	the 
JER.31.19	We turned away from you,
JER.31.19	but soon we wanted to return.
JER.31.19	After you had punished us,
JER.31.19	we hung our heads in grief.
JER.31.19	We were ashamed and disgraced
JER.31.19	because we sinned when we were young.’
JER.31.20	“Israel, you are my dearest child,
JER.31.20	the one I love best.
JER.31.20	Whenever I mention your name,
JER.31.20	I think
JER.31.20	My heart goes out to you;
JER.31.20	I will be merciful.
JER.31.21	Set up signs and mark the road;
JER.31.21	find again the way by which you left.
JER.31.21	Come back, people of Israel,
JER.31.21	come home to the towns you left.
JER.31.22	How long will you hesitate, faithless people?
JER.31.22	I have created something new and different,
JER.31.22	as different as a woman protecting a man.”
JER.31.23	The 
JER.31.23	‘May the 
JER.31.23	the holy place where he lives.’
JER.31.24	People will live in Judah and in all its towns, and there will be farmers, and shepherds with their flocks. 
JER.31.25	I will refresh those who are weary and will satisfy with food everyone who is weak from hunger. 
JER.31.26	So then, people will say, ‘I went to sleep and woke up refreshed.’
JER.31.27	“I, the 
JER.31.28	And just as I took care to uproot, to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to demolish them, so I will take care to plant them and to build them up. 
JER.31.29	 When that time comes, people will no longer say,
JER.31.29	‘The parents ate the sour grapes,
JER.31.29	But the children got the sour taste.’
JER.31.30	Instead, those who eat sour grapes will have their own teeth set on edge; and everyone will die because of their own sin.”
JER.31.32	It will not be like the old covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. Although I was like a husband to them, they did not keep that covenant. 
JER.31.33	 The new covenant that I will make with the people of Israel will be this: I will put my law within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
JER.31.34	 None of them will have to teach a neighbor to know the 
JER.31.35	The 
JER.31.35	the moon and the stars to shine at night.
JER.31.35	He stirs up the sea and makes it roar;
JER.31.35	his name is the 
JER.31.36	He promises that as long as the natural order lasts,
JER.31.36	so long will Israel be a nation.
JER.31.37	If one day the sky could be measured
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth explored,
JER.31.37	only then would he reject the people of Israel
JER.31.37	because of all they have done.
JER.31.37	The 
JER.31.38	“The time is coming,” says the 
JER.31.39	And the boundary line will continue from there on the west to the hill of Gareb and then around to Goah. 
JER.31.40	The entire valley, where the dead are buried and garbage is dumped, and all the fields above Kidron Brook as far as the Horse Gate to the east, will be sacred to me. The city will never again be torn down or destroyed.”
JER.32.2	At that time the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking Jerusalem, and I was locked up in the courtyard of the royal palace. 
JER.32.3	King Zedekiah had imprisoned me there and had accused me of announcing that the 
JER.32.4	and King Zedekiah will not escape. He will be handed over to the king of Babylonia; he will see him face-to-face and will speak to him in person. 
JER.32.5	Zedekiah will be taken to Babylonia, and he will remain there until I deal with him. Even if he fights the Babylonians, he will not be successful. I, the 
JER.32.6	The 
JER.32.7	that Hanamel, my uncle Shallum's son, would come to me with the request to buy his field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, because I was his nearest relative and had the right to buy it for myself. 
JER.32.8	Then, just as the 
JER.32.9	I bought the field from Hanamel and weighed out the money to him; the price came to seventeen pieces of silver. 
JER.32.10	I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the money on scales. 
JER.32.11	Then I took both copies of the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the contract and its conditions, and the open copy— 
JER.32.12	and gave them to Baruch, the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I gave them to him in the presence of Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and of the people who were sitting in the courtyard. 
JER.32.13	Before them all I said to Baruch, 
JER.32.14	“The 
JER.32.15	The 
JER.32.16	After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, I prayed, 
JER.32.17	“Sovereign 
JER.32.18	You have shown constant love to thousands, but you also punish people for the sins of their parents. You are a great and powerful God; you are the 
JER.32.19	You make wise plans and do mighty things; you see everything that people do, and you reward them according to their actions. 
JER.32.20	Long ago you performed miracles and wonders in Egypt, and you have continued to perform them to this day, both in Israel and among all the other nations, so that you are now known everywhere. 
JER.32.21	By means of miracles and wonders that terrified our enemies, you used your power and might to bring your people Israel out of Egypt. 
JER.32.22	You gave them this rich and fertile land, as you had promised their ancestors. 
JER.32.23	But when they came into this land and took possession of it, they did not obey your commands or live according to your teaching; they did nothing that you had ordered them to do. And so you brought all this destruction on them.
JER.32.24	“The Babylonians have built siege mounds around the city to capture it, and they are attacking. War, starvation, and disease will make the city fall into their hands. You can see that all you have said has come true. 
JER.32.25	Yet, Sovereign 
JER.32.26	Then the 
JER.32.27	“I am the 
JER.32.28	 I am going to give this city over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army; they will capture it 
JER.32.29	and set it on fire. They will burn it down, together with the houses where people have made me angry by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out wine offerings to other gods. 
JER.32.30	From the very beginning of their history the people of Israel and the people of Judah have displeased me and made me angry by what they have done. 
JER.32.31	The people of this city have made me angry and furious from the day it was built. I have decided to destroy it 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil that has been done by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, together with their kings and leaders, their priests and prophets. 
JER.32.33	They turned their backs on me; and though I kept on teaching them, they would not listen and learn. 
JER.32.34	 They even placed their disgusting idols in the Temple built for my worship, and they have defiled it. 
JER.32.35	 They have built altars to Baal in Hinnom Valley, to sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I did not command them to do this, and it did not even enter my mind that they would do such a thing and make the people of Judah sin.”
JER.32.36	The 
JER.32.37	I am going to gather the people from all the countries where I have scattered them in my anger and fury, and I am going to bring them back to this place and let them live here in safety. 
JER.32.38	Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give them a single purpose in life: to honor me for all time, for their own good and the good of their descendants. 
JER.32.40	I will make an eternal covenant with them. I will never stop doing good things for them, and I will make them fear me with all their heart, so that they will never turn away from me. 
JER.32.41	I will take pleasure in doing good things for them, and I will establish them permanently in this land.
JER.32.42	“Just as I have brought this disaster on these people, so I am going to give them all the good things that I have promised. 
JER.32.43	The people are saying that this land will be like a desert where neither people nor animals live, and that it will be given over to the Babylonians. But fields will once again be bought in this land. 
JER.32.44	People will buy them, and the deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed. This will take place in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, and in the towns in the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah. I will restore the people to their land. I, the 
JER.33.1	While I was still in prison in the courtyard, the 
JER.33.2	The 
JER.33.3	“Call to me, and I will answer you; I will tell you wonderful and marvelous things that you know nothing about. 
JER.33.4	I, the 
JER.33.5	Some will fight against the Babylonians, who will fill the houses
JER.33.6	But I will heal this city and its people and restore them to health. I will show them abundant peace and security. 
JER.33.7	I will make Judah and Israel prosperous, and I will rebuild them as they were before. 
JER.33.8	I will purify them from the sins that they have committed against me, and I will forgive their sins and their rebellion. 
JER.33.9	Jerusalem will be a source of joy, honor, and pride to me; and every nation in the world will fear and tremble when they hear about the good things that I do for the people of Jerusalem and about the prosperity that I bring to the city.”
JER.33.10	The 
JER.33.11	 the shouts of gladness and joy and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. You will hear people sing as they bring thank offerings to my Temple; they will say,
JER.33.11	‘Give thanks to the 
JER.33.11	because he is good
JER.33.11	and his love is eternal.’
JER.33.11	I will make this land as prosperous as it was before. I, the 
JER.33.12	The 
JER.33.13	In the towns in the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, shepherds will once again count their sheep. I, the 
JER.33.15	At that time I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will do what is right and just throughout the land. 
JER.33.16	The people of Judah and of Jerusalem will be rescued and will live in safety. The city will be called ‘The 
JER.33.17	 I, the 
JER.33.18	 and that there will always be priests from the tribe of Levi to serve me and to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrifices.”
JER.33.19	The 
JER.33.20	“I have made a covenant with the day and with the night, so that they always come at their proper times; and that covenant can never be broken. 
JER.33.21	In the same way I have made a covenant with my servant David that he would always have a descendant to be king, and I have made a covenant with the priests from the tribe of Levi that they would always serve me; and those covenants can never be broken. 
JER.33.22	I will increase the number of descendants of my servant David and the number of priests from the tribe of Levi, so that it will be as impossible to count them as it is to count the stars in the sky or the grains of sand on the seashore.”
JER.33.23	The 
JER.33.24	“Have you noticed how people are saying that I have rejected Israel and Judah, the two families that I chose? And so they look with contempt on my people and no longer consider them a nation. 
JER.33.25	But I, the 
JER.33.26	And just as surely as I have done this, so I will maintain my covenant with Jacob's descendants and with my servant David. I will choose one of David's descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will be merciful to my people and make them prosperous again.”
JER.34.2	The 
JER.34.3	You will not escape; you will be captured and handed over to him. You will see him face-to-face and talk to him in person; then you will go to Babylonia. 
JER.34.4	Zedekiah, listen to what I say about you. You will not be killed in battle. 
JER.34.5	You will die in peace, and as people burned incense when they buried your ancestors, who were kings before you, in the same way they will burn incense for you. They will mourn over you and say, ‘Our king is dead!’ I, the 
JER.34.6	Then I gave this message to King Zedekiah in Jerusalem 
JER.34.7	while the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking the city. The army was also attacking Lachish and Azekah, the only other fortified cities left in Judah.
JER.34.8	King Zedekiah and the people of Jerusalem had made an agreement to set free 
JER.34.9	their Hebrew slaves, both male and female, so that no one would have an Israelite as a slave. 
JER.34.10	All the people and their leaders agreed to free their slaves and never to enslave them again. They did set them free, 
JER.34.11	but later they changed their minds, took them back, and forced them to become slaves again.
JER.34.12	Then the 
JER.34.13	the God of Israel, told me to say to the people: “I made a covenant with your ancestors when I rescued them from Egypt and set them free from slavery. I told them that 
JER.34.14	 every seven years they were to set free any Hebrew slave who had served them for six years. But your ancestors would not pay any attention to me or listen to what I said. 
JER.34.15	Just a few days ago you changed your minds and did what pleased me. All of you agreed to set all Israelites free, and you made a covenant in my presence, in the Temple where I am worshiped. 
JER.34.16	But then you changed your minds again and dishonored me. All of you took back the slaves whom you had set free as they desired, and you forced them into slavery again. 
JER.34.17	So now, I, the 
JER.34.18+JER.34.19	The officials of Judah and of Jerusalem, together with the palace officials, the priests, and all the leaders, made a covenant with me by walking between the two halves of a bull that they had cut in two. But they broke the covenant and did not keep its terms. So I will do to these people what they did to the bull. 
JER.34.20	I will hand them over to their enemies, who want to kill them, and their corpses will be eaten by birds and wild animals. 
JER.34.21	I will also hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to those who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the Babylonian army, which has stopped its attack against you. 
JER.34.22	I will give the order, and they will return to this city. They will attack it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make the towns of Judah like a desert where no one lives. I, the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the members of the Rechabite clan and talk to them. Then bring them into one of the rooms in the Temple and offer them some wine.” 
JER.35.3	So I took the entire Rechabite clan—Jaazaniah (the son of another Jeremiah, who was Habazziniah's son) and all his brothers and sons— 
JER.35.4	and brought them to the Temple. I took them into the room of the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah. This room was above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, an important official in the Temple, and near the rooms of the other officials. 
JER.35.5	Then I placed cups and bowls full of wine before the Rechabites, and I said to them, “Have some wine.”
JER.35.6	But they answered, “We do not drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab told us that neither we nor our descendants were ever to drink any wine. 
JER.35.7	He also told us not to build houses or farm the land and not to plant vineyards or buy them. He commanded us always to live in tents, so that we might remain in this land where we live like strangers. 
JER.35.8	We have obeyed all the instructions that Jonadab gave us. We ourselves never drink wine, and neither do our wives, our sons, or our daughters. 
JER.35.9+JER.35.10	We do not build houses for homes—we live in tents—and we own no vineyards, fields, or grain. We have fully obeyed everything that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when King Nebuchadnezzar invaded the country, we decided to come to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian and Syrian armies. That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”
JER.35.12+JER.35.13	Then the 
JER.35.14	Jonadab's descendants have obeyed his command not to drink wine, and to this very day none of them drink any. But I have kept on speaking to you, and you have not obeyed me. 
JER.35.15	I have continued to send you all my servants the prophets, and they have told you to give up your evil ways and to do what is right. They warned you not to worship and serve other gods, so that you could go on living in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not listen to me or pay any attention to me. 
JER.35.16	Jonadab's descendants have obeyed the command that their ancestor gave them, but you people have not obeyed me. 
JER.35.17	So now, I, the 
JER.35.18	Then I told the Rechabite clan that the 
JER.35.19	So I, the 
JER.36.2	“Get a scroll and write on it everything that I have told you about Israel and Judah and all the nations. Write everything that I have told you from the time I first spoke to you, when Josiah was king, up to the present. 
JER.36.3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the destruction that I intend to bring on them, they will turn from their evil ways. Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sins.”
JER.36.4	So I called Baruch son of Neriah and dictated to him everything that the 
JER.36.5	Then I gave Baruch the following instructions: “I am no longer allowed to go into the Temple. 
JER.36.6	But I want you to go there the next time the people are fasting. You are to read the scroll aloud, so that they will hear everything that the 
JER.36.7	Perhaps they will pray to the 
JER.36.8	So Baruch read the 
JER.36.9	In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, the people fasted to gain the 
JER.36.10	Then, while all the people were listening, Baruch read from the scroll everything that I had said. He did this in the Temple, from the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan, the court secretary. His room was in the upper court near the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple.
JER.36.11	Micaiah, the son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll what the 
JER.36.12	Then he went to the royal palace, to the room of the court secretary, where all the officials were in session. Elishama, the court secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were there. 
JER.36.13	Micaiah told them everything that he had heard Baruch read to the people. 
JER.36.14	Then the officials sent Jehudi (the son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah, and great-grandson of Cushi) to tell Baruch to bring the scroll that he had read to the people. Baruch brought them the scroll. 
JER.36.15	“Sit down,” they said, “and read the scroll to us.” So Baruch did. 
JER.36.16	After he had read it, they turned to one another in alarm and said to Baruch, “We must report this to the king.” 
JER.36.17	Then they asked him, “Tell us, now, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?”
JER.36.18	Baruch answered, “Jeremiah dictated every word of it to me, and I wrote it down in ink on this scroll.”
JER.36.19	Then they told him, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the court secretary, and went to the king's court, where they reported everything to the king. 
JER.36.21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He took it from the room of Elishama and read it to the king and all the officials who were standing around him. 
JER.36.22	It was winter and the king was sitting in his winter palace in front of the fire. 
JER.36.23	As soon as Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king cut them off with a small knife and threw them into the fire. He kept doing this until the entire scroll was burned up. 
JER.36.24	But neither the king nor any of his officials who heard all this was afraid or showed any sign of sorrow. 
JER.36.25	Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he paid no attention to them. 
JER.36.26	Then he ordered Prince Jerahmeel, together with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to arrest me and my secretary Baruch. But the 
JER.36.27	After King Jehoiakim had burned the scroll that I had dictated to Baruch, the 
JER.36.28	to take another scroll and write on it everything that had been on the first one. 
JER.36.29	The 
JER.36.30	So now, I, the 
JER.36.31	I will punish you, your descendants, and your officials because of the sins all of you commit. Neither you nor the people of Jerusalem and of Judah have paid any attention to my warnings, and so I will bring on all of you the disaster that I have threatened.”
JER.36.32	Then I took another scroll and gave it to my secretary Baruch, and he wrote down everything that I dictated. He wrote everything that had been on the first scroll and similar messages that I dictated to him.
JER.37.2	But neither Zedekiah nor his officials nor the people obeyed the message which the 
JER.37.3	King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to ask me to pray to the 
JER.37.4	I had not yet been put in prison and was still moving about freely among the people. 
JER.37.5	The Babylonian army had been besieging Jerusalem, but when they heard that the Egyptian army had crossed the Egyptian border, they retreated.
JER.37.6	Then the 
JER.37.7	to say to Zedekiah, “The Egyptian army is on its way to help you, but it will return home. 
JER.37.8	Then the Babylonians will come back, attack the city, capture it, and burn it down. 
JER.37.9	I, the 
JER.37.10	Even if you defeat the whole Babylonian army, so that only wounded men are left, lying in their tents, they would still get up and burn this city to the ground.”
JER.37.11	The Babylonian army retreated from Jerusalem because the Egyptian army was approaching. 
JER.37.12	So I started to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of my share of the family property. 
JER.37.13	But when I reached the Benjamin Gate, the officer in charge of the soldiers on duty there, a man by the name of Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, stopped me and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”
JER.37.14	I answered, “That's not so! I'm not deserting.” But Irijah would not listen to me. Instead, he arrested me and took me to the officials. 
JER.37.15	They were furious with me and had me beaten and locked up in the house of Jonathan, the court secretary, whose house had been made into a prison. 
JER.37.16	I was put in an underground cell and kept there a long time.
JER.37.17	Later on King Zedekiah sent for me, and there in the palace he asked me privately, “Is there any message from the 
JER.37.17	“There is,” I answered, and added, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylonia.” 
JER.37.18	Then I asked, “What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, to make you put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	What happened to your prophets who told you that the king of Babylonia would not attack you or the country? 
JER.37.20	And now, Your Majesty, I beg you to listen to me and do what I ask. Please do not send me back to the prison in Jonathan's house. If you do, I will surely die there.”
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah ordered me to be locked up in the palace courtyard. I stayed there, and each day I was given a loaf of bread from the bakeries until all the bread in the city was gone.
JER.38.1	Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard that I was telling the people that 
JER.38.2	the 
JER.38.3	I was also telling them that the 
JER.38.4	Then the officials went to the king and said, “This man must be put to death. By talking like this he is making the soldiers in the city lose their courage, and he is doing the same thing to everyone else left in the city. He is not trying to help the people; he only wants to hurt them.”
JER.38.5	King Zedekiah answered, “Very well, then, do what you want to with him; I can't stop you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took me and let me down by ropes into Prince Malchiah's well, which was in the palace courtyard. There was no water in the well, only mud, and I sank down in it.
JER.38.7	However, Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
JER.38.8	So Ebedmelech went there and said to the king, 
JER.38.9	“Your Majesty, what these men have done is wrong. They have put Jeremiah in the well, where he is sure to die of starvation, since there is no more food in the city.” 
JER.38.10	Then the king ordered Ebedmelech to take with him three men and to pull me out of the well before I died. 
JER.38.11	So Ebedmelech went with the men to the palace storeroom and got some worn-out clothing which he let down to me by ropes. 
JER.38.12	He told me to put the rags under my arms, so that the ropes wouldn't hurt me. I did this, 
JER.38.13	and they pulled me up out of the well. After that I was kept in the courtyard.
JER.38.14	On another occasion King Zedekiah had me brought to him at the third entrance to the Temple, and he said, “I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to tell me the whole truth.”
JER.38.15	I answered, “If I tell you the truth, you will put me to death, and if I give you advice, you won't pay any attention.”
JER.38.16	So King Zedekiah promised me in secret, “I swear by the living God, the God who gave us life, that I will not put you to death or hand you over to the men who want to kill you.”
JER.38.17	Then I told Zedekiah that the 
JER.38.18	But if you do not surrender, then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will burn it down, and you will not escape from them.”
JER.38.19	But the king answered, “I am afraid of our own people who have deserted to the Babylonians. I may be handed over to them and tortured.”
JER.38.20	I said, “You will not be handed over to them. I beg you to obey the 
JER.38.21	But the 
JER.38.22	In it I saw all the women left in Judah's royal palace being led out to the king of Babylonia's officers. Listen to what they were saying as they went:
JER.38.22	‘The king's best friends misled him,
JER.38.22	they overruled him.
JER.38.22	And now that his feet have sunk in the mud,
JER.38.22	his friends have left him.’”
JER.38.23	Then I added, “All your women and children will be taken out to the Babylonians, and you yourself will not escape from them. You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylonia, and this city will be burned to the ground.”
JER.38.24	Zedekiah replied, “Don't let anyone know about this conversation, and your life will not be in danger. 
JER.38.25	If the officials hear that I have talked with you, they will come and ask you what we said. They will promise not to put you to death if you tell them everything. 
JER.38.26	Just tell them you were begging me not to send you back to prison to die there.” 
JER.38.27	Then all the officials came and questioned me, and I told them exactly what the king had told me to say. There was nothing else they could do, because no one had overheard the conversation. 
JER.38.28	 And I was kept in the palace courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	In the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came with his whole army and attacked Jerusalem. 
JER.39.2	On the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year as king, the city walls were broken through.
JER.39.2	( 
JER.39.3	When Jerusalem was captured,
JER.39.4	When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers saw what was happening, they tried to escape from the city during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and escaped in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
JER.39.5	But the Babylonian army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho. Then they took him to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
JER.39.6	At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on, and he also had the officials of Judah executed. 
JER.39.7	After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains to be taken to Babylonia. 
JER.39.8	Meanwhile, the Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the houses of the people and tore down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Finally Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, together with those who had deserted to him. 
JER.39.10	He left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he gave them vineyards and fields.
JER.39.11	But King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, to give the following order: 
JER.39.12	“Go and find Jeremiah and take good care of him. Do not harm him, but do for him whatever he wants.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan, together with the high officials Nebushazban and Nergal Sharezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylonia, 
JER.39.14	had me brought from the palace courtyard. They put me under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who was to see that I got home safely. And so I stayed there among the people.
JER.39.15	While I was still imprisoned in the palace courtyard, the 
JER.39.16	to tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian
JER.39.17	But I, the 
JER.39.18	I will keep you safe, and you will not be put to death. You will escape with your life because you have put your trust in me. I, the 
JER.40.1	The 
JER.40.2	The commanding officer took me aside and said, “The 
JER.40.3	and now he has done what he said he would. All this happened because your people sinned against the 
JER.40.4	Now, I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free. If you want to go to Babylonia with me, you may do so, and I will take care of you. But if you don't want to go, you don't have to. You have the whole country to choose from, and you may go wherever you wish.”
JER.40.5	When I did not answer,
JER.40.6	I went to stay with Gedaliah in Mizpah and lived among the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.8	So Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophah, and Jezaniah from Maacah went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
JER.40.9	Gedaliah said to them, “I give you my word that there is no need for you to be afraid to surrender to the Babylonians. Settle in this land, serve the king of Babylonia, and all will go well with you. 
JER.40.10	I myself will stay in Mizpah and be your representative when the Babylonians come here. But you can gather and store up wine, fruit, and olive oil, and live in the villages you occupy.” 
JER.40.11	Meanwhile, all the Israelites who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries, heard that the king of Babylonia had allowed some Israelites to stay on in Judah and that he had made Gedaliah their governor. 
JER.40.12	So they left the places where they had been scattered, and returned to Judah. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and there they gathered in large amounts of wine and fruit.
JER.40.13	After this, Johanan and the leaders of the soldiers who had not surrendered came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Don't you know that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael to murder you?” But Gedaliah did not believe it. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan said privately to him, “Let me go and kill Ishmael, and no one will know who did it. Why should he be allowed to murder you? That would cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to be scattered, and it would bring disaster on all the people who are left in Judah.”
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah answered, “Don't do it! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true!”
JER.41.2	Ishmael and the ten men with him pulled out their swords and killed Gedaliah. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the Israelites who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there.
JER.41.4	The next day, before anyone knew about Gedaliah's murder, 
JER.41.5	eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and gashed themselves. They were taking grain and incense to offer in the Temple. 
JER.41.6	So Ishmael went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he came to them, he said, “Please come in to see Gedaliah.” 
JER.41.7	As soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael and his men killed them and threw their bodies in a well.
JER.41.8	But there were ten men in the group who said to Ishmael, “Please don't kill us! We have wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he spared them. 
JER.41.9	The well into which Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he had killed was the large one
JER.41.10	Then he made prisoners of the king's daughters and all the rest of the people in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had placed under the care of Gedaliah. Ishmael took them prisoner and started off in the direction of the territory of Ammon.
JER.41.11	Johanan and all the army leaders with him heard of the crime that Ishmael had committed. 
JER.41.12	So they went after him with their men and overtook him near the large pool at Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him, they were glad, 
JER.41.14	and turned and ran to them. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael and eight of his men got away from Johanan and escaped to the land of Ammon.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him took charge of the people whom Ishmael had taken away as prisoners from Mizpah after murdering Gedaliah—soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs. 
JER.41.17+JER.41.18	They were afraid of the Babylonians because Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylonia had made governor of the land. So they set out for Egypt, in order to get away from the Babylonians. On the way they stopped at Chimham near Bethlehem.
JER.42.1	Then all the army leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah
JER.42.2	and said to me, “Please do what we ask you! Pray to the 
JER.42.3	Pray that the 
JER.42.4	I answered, “Very well, then. I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to me, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether it pleases us or not, we will obey the 
JER.42.7	Ten days later the 
JER.42.8	so I called together Johanan, all the army leaders who were with him, and all the other people. 
JER.42.9	I said to them, “The 
JER.42.10	‘If you are willing to go on living in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up. The destruction I brought on you has caused me great sorrow. 
JER.42.11	Stop being afraid of the king of Babylonia. I am with you, and I will rescue you from his power. 
JER.42.12	Because I am merciful, I will make him have mercy on you and let you go back home. I, the 
JER.42.13+JER.42.14+JER.42.15	“But you people who are left in Judah must not disobey the 
JER.42.16	then the war that you fear will overtake you, and the hunger you dread will follow you, and you will die there in Egypt. 
JER.42.17	All the people who are determined to go and live in Egypt will die either in war or of starvation or disease. Not one of them will survive, not one will escape the disaster that I am going to bring on them.’
JER.42.18	“The 
JER.42.19	Then I continued, “The 
JER.42.20	that you are making a fatal mistake. You asked me to pray to the 
JER.42.21	And now I have told you, but you are disobeying everything that the 
JER.42.22	So then, remember this: you will die in war or of starvation or disease in the land where you want to go and live.”
JER.43.1	I finished telling the people everything that the 
JER.43.2	Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other arrogant men said to me, “You are lying. The 
JER.43.3	Baruch son of Neriah has stirred you up against us, so that the Babylonians will gain power over us and can either kill us or take us away to Babylonia.” 
JER.43.4	So neither Johanan nor any of the army officers nor any of the people would obey the 
JER.43.5	 Then Johanan and all the army officers took everybody left in Judah away to Egypt, together with all the people who had returned from the nations where they had been scattered: 
JER.43.6	the men, the women, the children, and the king's daughters. They took everyone whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had left under the care of Gedaliah, including Baruch and me. 
JER.43.7	They disobeyed the 
JER.43.8	There the 
JER.43.9	“Get some large stones and bury them in the mortar of the pavement
JER.43.10	Then tell them that I, the 
JER.43.11	Nebuchadnezzar will come and defeat Egypt. Those people who are doomed to die of disease will die of disease, those doomed to be taken away as prisoners will be taken away as prisoners, and those doomed to be killed in war will be killed in war. 
JER.43.12	I will set fire to the temples of Egypt's gods, and the king of Babylonia will either burn their gods or carry them off. As shepherds pick their clothes clean of lice, so the king of Babylonia will pick the land of Egypt clean and then leave victorious. 
JER.43.13	He will destroy the sacred stone monuments at Heliopolis in Egypt and will burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods.”
JER.44.1	The 
JER.44.2	The 
JER.44.3	because their people had done evil and had made me angry. They offered sacrifices to other gods and served gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever worshiped. 
JER.44.4	I kept sending you my servants the prophets, who told you not to do this terrible thing that I hate. 
JER.44.5	But you would not listen or pay any attention. You would not give up your evil practice of sacrificing to other gods. 
JER.44.6	So I poured out my anger and fury on the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, and I set them on fire. They were left in ruins and became a horrifying sight, as they are today.
JER.44.7	“And so I, the 
JER.44.8	Why do you make me angry by worshiping idols and by sacrificing to other gods here in Egypt, where you have come to live? Are you doing this just to destroy yourselves, so that every nation on earth will make fun of you and use your name as a curse? 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, and by you and your wives? 
JER.44.10	But to this day you have not humbled yourselves. You have not honored me or lived according to all the laws that I gave you and your ancestors.
JER.44.11	“So then, I, the 
JER.44.12	As for the people of Judah who are left and are determined to go and live in Egypt, I will see to it that all of them are destroyed. All of them, great and small, will die in Egypt, either in war or of starvation. They will be a horrifying sight; people will make fun of them and use their name as a curse. 
JER.44.13	I will punish those who live in Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem—with war, starvation, and disease. 
JER.44.14	None of the people of Judah who are left and have come to Egypt to live will escape or survive. Not one of them will return to Judah, where they long to live once again. No one will return except a few refugees.”
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives offered sacrifices to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, including the Israelites who lived in southern Egypt—a large crowd in all—said to me, 
JER.44.16	“We refuse to listen to what you have told us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	We will do everything that we said we would. We will offer sacrifices to our goddess, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out wine offerings to her, just as we and our ancestors, our king and our leaders, used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we were prosperous, and had no troubles. 
JER.44.18	But ever since we stopped sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and stopped pouring out wine offerings to her, we have had nothing, and our people have died in war and of starvation.”
JER.44.19	And the women added, “When we baked cakes shaped like the Queen of Heaven, offered sacrifices to her, and poured out wine offerings to her, our husbands approved of what we were doing.”
JER.44.20	Then I said to all the men and the women who had answered me in this way, 
JER.44.21	“As for the sacrifices which you and your ancestors, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land offered in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—do you think that the 
JER.44.22	This very day your land lies in ruins and no one lives in it. It has become a horrifying sight, and people use its name as a curse because the 
JER.44.23	This present disaster has come on you because you offered sacrifices to other gods and sinned against the 
JER.44.24+JER.44.25	I told all the people, especially the women, what the 
JER.44.26	But now listen to the vow that I, the 
JER.44.27	I will see to it that you will not prosper, but will be destroyed. All of you will die, either in war or of disease, until not one of you is left. 
JER.44.28	But a few of you will escape death and return from Egypt to Judah. Then the survivors will know whose words have come true, mine or theirs. 
JER.44.29	I, the 
JER.44.30	 I will hand over King Hophra of Egypt to his enemies who want to kill him, just as I handed over King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, who was his enemy and wanted to kill him.”
JER.45.2	that the 
JER.45.3	you are saying, ‘I give up! The 
JER.45.4	“But I, the 
JER.45.5	Are you looking for special treatment for yourself? Don't do it. I am bringing disaster on all people, but you will at least escape with your life, wherever you go. I, the 
JER.46.1	The 
JER.46.2	 beginning with Egypt. This is what he said about the army of King Neco of Egypt, which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia defeated at Carchemish near the Euphrates River in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah:
JER.46.3	“The Egyptian officers shout,
JER.46.3	‘Get your shields ready
JER.46.3	and march into battle!
JER.46.4	Harness your horses and mount them!
JER.46.4	Fall in line and put on your helmets!
JER.46.4	Sharpen your spears!
JER.46.4	Put on your armor!’
JER.46.5	“But what do I see?” asks the 
JER.46.5	“They are turning back in terror.
JER.46.5	Their soldiers are beaten back;
JER.46.5	overcome with fear, they run as fast as they can
JER.46.5	and do not look back.
JER.46.6	Those who run fast cannot get away;
JER.46.6	the soldiers cannot escape.
JER.46.6	In the north, by the Euphrates,
JER.46.6	they stumble and fall.
JER.46.7	Who is this that rises like the Nile,
JER.46.7	like a river flooding its banks?
JER.46.8	It is Egypt, rising like the Nile,
JER.46.8	like a river flooding its banks.
JER.46.8	Egypt said, ‘I will rise and cover the world;
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and the people who live there.
JER.46.9	Command the horses to go
JER.46.9	and the chariots to roll!
JER.46.9	Send out the soldiers:
JER.46.9	men from Ethiopia
JER.46.9	and skilled archers from Lydia.’”
JER.46.10	This is the day of the Sovereign 
JER.46.10	today he will take revenge;
JER.46.10	today he will punish his enemies.
JER.46.10	His sword will eat them until it is full,
JER.46.10	and drink their blood until it is satisfied.
JER.46.10	Today the Almighty sacrifices his victims
JER.46.10	in the north, by the Euphrates.
JER.46.11	People of Egypt, go to Gilead
JER.46.11	and look for medicine!
JER.46.11	All your medicine has proved useless;
JER.46.11	nothing can heal you.
JER.46.12	Nations have heard of your shame;
JER.46.12	everyone has heard you cry.
JER.46.12	One soldier trips over another,
JER.46.12	and both of them fall to the ground.
JER.46.14	“Proclaim it in the towns of Egypt,
JER.46.14	in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes:
JER.46.14	‘Get ready to defend yourselves;
JER.46.14	all you have will be destroyed in war!
JER.46.15	Why has your mighty god Apis fallen?
JER.46.15	The 
JER.46.16	Your soldiers have stumbled and fallen;
JER.46.16	each one says to the other,
JER.46.16	‘Hurry! Let's go home to our people
JER.46.16	and escape the enemy's sword!’
JER.46.17	“Give the king of Egypt a new name—
JER.46.17	‘Noisy Braggart Who Missed His Chance.’
JER.46.18	I, the 
JER.46.18	I am the living God.
JER.46.18	As Mount Tabor towers above the mountains
JER.46.18	and Mount Carmel stands high above the sea,
JER.46.18	so will be the strength of the one who attacks you.
JER.46.19	Get ready to be taken prisoner,
JER.46.19	you people of Egypt!
JER.46.19	Memphis will be made a desert,
JER.46.19	a ruin where no one lives.
JER.46.20	Egypt is like a splendid cow,
JER.46.20	attacked by a stinging fly from the north.
JER.46.21	Even her hired soldiers
JER.46.21	are helpless as calves.
JER.46.21	They did not stand and fight;
JER.46.21	all of them turned and ran.
JER.46.21	The day of their doom had arrived,
JER.46.21	the time of their destruction.
JER.46.22	Egypt runs away, hissing like a snake,
JER.46.22	as the enemy's army approaches.
JER.46.22	They attack her with axes,
JER.46.22	like people cutting down trees
JER.46.23	and destroying a thick forest.
JER.46.23	Their soldiers are too many to count;
JER.46.23	they outnumber the locusts.
JER.46.24	The people of Egypt are put to shame;
JER.46.24	they are conquered by the people of the north.
JER.46.24	I, the 
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	and hand them over to those who want to kill them, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army. But later on, people will live in Egypt again, as they did in times past. I, the 
JER.46.27	people of Israel, do not be terrified.
JER.46.27	I will rescue you from that faraway land,
JER.46.27	from the land where you are prisoners.
JER.46.27	You will come back home and live in peace;
JER.46.27	you will be secure, and no one will make you afraid.
JER.46.28	I will come to you and save you.
JER.46.28	I will destroy all the nations
JER.46.28	where I have scattered you,
JER.46.28	but I will not destroy you.
JER.46.28	I will not let you go unpunished;
JER.46.28	but when I punish you, I will be fair.
JER.46.28	I, the 
JER.47.2	He said:
JER.47.2	“Look! Waters are rising in the north
JER.47.2	and will rush like a river in flood.
JER.47.2	They will cover the land and everything on it,
JER.47.2	cities and the people who live there.
JER.47.2	People will call out for help;
JER.47.2	everyone on earth will cry bitterly.
JER.47.3	They will hear the hoofbeats of horses,
JER.47.3	the clatter of chariots,
JER.47.3	the rumble of wheels.
JER.47.3	Parents will not turn back for their children;
JER.47.3	their hands will hang limp at their sides.
JER.47.4	The time has come to destroy Philistia,
JER.47.4	to cut off from Tyre and Sidon
JER.47.4	all the help that remains.
JER.47.4	I, the 
JER.47.4	all who came from the shores of Crete.
JER.47.5	Great sorrow has come to the people of Gaza,
JER.47.5	and Ashkelon's people are silent.
JER.47.5	How long will the rest of Philistia mourn?
JER.47.6	You cry out, ‘Sword of the 
JER.47.6	How long will you go on slashing?
JER.47.6	Go back to your scabbard,
JER.47.6	stay there and rest!’
JER.47.7	But how can it rest,
JER.47.7	when I have given it work to do?
JER.47.7	I have commanded it to attack Ashkelon
JER.47.7	and the people who live on the coast.”
JER.48.1	“Pity the people of Nebo—
JER.48.1	their town is destroyed!
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim is captured,
JER.48.1	its mighty fortress torn down,
JER.48.1	and its people put to shame;
JER.48.2	the splendor of Moab is gone.
JER.48.2	The enemy have captured Heshbon
JER.48.2	and plot to destroy the nation of Moab.
JER.48.2	The town of Madmen will be silenced;
JER.48.2	armies will march against it.
JER.48.3	The people of Horonaim cry out,
JER.48.3	‘Violence! Destruction!’
JER.48.4	“Moab has been destroyed;
JER.48.4	listen to the children crying.
JER.48.5	Hear the sound of their sobs
JER.48.5	along the road up to Luhith,
JER.48.5	the cries of distress
JER.48.5	on the way down to Horonaim.
JER.48.6	‘Quick, run for your lives!’ they say.
JER.48.6	‘Run like a wild desert donkey!’
JER.48.7	“Moab, you trusted in your strength and your wealth,
JER.48.7	but now even you will be conquered;
JER.48.7	your god Chemosh will go into exile,
JER.48.7	along with his princes and priests.
JER.48.8	Not a town will escape the destruction;
JER.48.8	both valley and plain will be ruined.
JER.48.8	I, the 
JER.48.9	Set up a tombstone for Moab;
JER.48.9	it will soon be destroyed.
JER.48.9	Its towns will be left in ruins,
JER.48.9	and no one will live there again.”
JER.48.9	( 
JER.48.10	Curse those who do not do the 
JER.48.11	The 
JER.48.12	“So now, the time is coming when I will send people to pour Moab out like wine. They will empty its wine jars and break them in pieces. 
JER.48.13	Then the Moabites will be disillusioned with their god Chemosh, just as the Israelites were disillusioned with Bethel, a god in whom they trusted.
JER.48.14	“Men of Moab, why do you claim to be heroes,
JER.48.14	brave soldiers tested in war?
JER.48.15	Moab and its cities are destroyed;
JER.48.15	its finest young men have been slaughtered.
JER.48.15	I am the king, the 
JER.48.15	and I have spoken.
JER.48.16	Moab's doom approaches;
JER.48.16	its ruin is coming soon.
JER.48.17	“Mourn for that nation, you that live nearby,
JER.48.17	all of you that know its fame.
JER.48.17	Say, ‘Its powerful rule has been broken;
JER.48.17	its glory and might are no more.’
JER.48.18	You that live in Dibon,
JER.48.18	come down from your place of honor
JER.48.18	and sit on the ground in the dust;
JER.48.18	Moab's destroyer is here
JER.48.18	and has left its forts in ruins.
JER.48.19	You that live in Aroer,
JER.48.19	stand by the road and wait;
JER.48.19	ask those who are running away,
JER.48.19	find out from them what has happened.
JER.48.20	‘Moab has fallen,’ they will answer,
JER.48.20	‘weep for it; it is disgraced.
JER.48.20	Announce along the Arnon River
JER.48.20	that Moab is destroyed!’
JER.48.21	“Judgment has come on the cities of the plateau: on Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath, 
JER.48.22	Dibon, Nebo, Beth Diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	Kiriathaim, Bethgamul, Bethmeon, 
JER.48.24	Kerioth, and Bozrah. Judgment has come on all the cities of Moab, far and near. 
JER.48.25	Moab's might has been crushed; its power has been destroyed. I, the 
JER.48.26	The 
JER.48.27	Moab, remember how you made fun of the people of Israel? You treated them as though they had been caught with a gang of robbers.
JER.48.28	“You people who live in Moab, leave your towns! Go and live on the cliffs! Be like the dove that makes its nest in the sides of a ravine. 
JER.48.29	Moab is very proud! I have heard how proud, arrogant, and conceited the people are, how much they think of themselves. 
JER.48.30	I, the 
JER.48.31	And so I will weep for everyone in Moab and for the people of Kir Heres. 
JER.48.32	I will cry for the people of Sibmah, even more than for the people of Jazer. City of Sibmah, you are like a vine whose branches reach across the Dead Sea and go as far as Jazer. But now your summer fruits and your grapes have been destroyed. 
JER.48.33	Happiness and joy have been taken away from the fertile land of Moab. I have made the wine stop flowing from the wine presses; there is no one to make the wine and shout for joy.
JER.48.34	“The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
JER.48.35	I will stop the people of Moab from making burnt offerings at their places of worship and from offering sacrifices to their gods. I, the 
JER.48.36	“So my heart mourns for Moab and for the people of Kir Heres, like someone playing a funeral song on a flute, because everything they owned is gone. 
JER.48.37	All of them have shaved their heads and cut off their beards. They have all made gashes on their hands, and everyone is wearing sackcloth. 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in all its public squares there is nothing but mourning, because I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants. 
JER.48.39	Moab has been shattered! Cry out! Moab has been disgraced. It is in ruins, and all the surrounding nations make fun of it. I, the 
JER.48.40	The 
JER.48.41	and the towns and fortresses will be captured. On that day Moab's soldiers will be as frightened as a woman in labor. 
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed and will no longer be a nation, because it rebelled against me. 
JER.48.43	Terror, pits, and traps are waiting for the people of Moab. The 
JER.48.44	Whoever tries to escape the terror will fall into the pits, and whoever climbs out of the pits will be caught in the traps, because the 
JER.48.45	Helpless refugees try to find protection in Heshbon, the city that King Sihon once ruled, but it is in flames.
JER.48.46	Pity the people of Moab! The people who worshiped Chemosh have been destroyed, and their sons and daughters have been taken away as prisoners.
JER.48.47	But in days to come the 
JER.49.2	But the time is coming when I will make the people of the capital city of Rabbah hear the noise of battle, and it will be left in ruins and its villages burned to the ground. Then Israel will take its land back from those who took it from them. 
JER.49.3	People of Heshbon, cry out! Ai is destroyed! Women of Rabbah, go into mourning! Put on sackcloth and mourn. Run about in confusion. Your god Molech will be taken into exile, together with his priests and princes. 
JER.49.4	Why do you unfaithful people boast? Your strength is failing. Why do you trust in your power and say that no one would dare attack you? 
JER.49.5	I will bring terror on you from every side. You will all run away. Each one will run for his life, and there will be no one to bring your troops together again.
JER.49.6	“But later on I will make Ammon prosperous again. I, the 
JER.49.8	People of Dedan, turn and run! Hide! I am going to destroy Esau's descendants because the time has come for me to punish them. 
JER.49.9	When people pick grapes, they leave a few on the vines, and when robbers come at night, they take only what they want. 
JER.49.10	But I
JER.49.11	Leave your orphans with me, and I will take care of them. Your widows can depend on me.
JER.49.12	“If even those who did not deserve to be punished had to drink from the cup of punishment, do you think that you will go unpunished? No, you must drink from the cup! 
JER.49.13	I myself have sworn that the city of Bozrah will become a horrifying sight and a desert; people will make fun of it and use its name as a curse. All the nearby villages will be in ruins forever. I, the 
JER.49.14	I said, “Edom, I have received a message from the 
JER.49.15	The 
JER.49.16	Your pride has deceived you. No one fears you as much as you think they do. You live on the rocky cliffs, high on top of the mountain; but even though you live as high up as an eagle, the 
JER.49.17	The 
JER.49.18	 The same thing will happen to Edom that happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, when they and the nearby towns were destroyed. No one will ever live there again. I, the 
JER.49.19	 Like a lion coming out of the thick woods along the Jordan River up to the green pasture land, I will come and make the Edomites run away suddenly from their country. Then the leader I choose will rule the nation. Who can be compared to me? Who would dare challenge me? What ruler could oppose me? 
JER.49.20	So listen to the plan that I have made against the people of Edom, and to what I intend to do to the people of the city of Teman. Even their children will be dragged off, and everyone will be horrified. 
JER.49.21	When Edom falls, there will be such a noise that the entire earth will shake, and the cries of alarm will be heard as far away as the Gulf of Aqaba. 
JER.49.22	The enemy will attack Bozrah like an eagle swooping down with outspread wings. On that day Edom's soldiers will be as frightened as a woman in labor.”
JER.49.24	The people of Damascus are weak and have fled in terror. They are in pain and misery like a woman in labor. 
JER.49.25	The famous city that used to be happy
JER.49.26	On that day her young men will be killed in the city streets, and all her soldiers destroyed. 
JER.49.27	I will set the walls of Damascus on fire and will burn down King Benhadad's palaces. I, the 
JER.49.28	This is what the 
JER.49.29	Seize their tents and their flocks, their tent curtains and everything in their tents. Take their camels and tell the people, ‘Terror is all around you!’
JER.49.30	“People of Hazor, I, the 
JER.49.31	‘Come on! We'll attack those people that feel safe and secure! Their city has no gates or locks and is completely unprotected.’
JER.49.32	“Take their camels and all their livestock! I will scatter in every direction those people who cut their hair short, and I will bring disaster on them from every side. 
JER.49.33	Hazor will be made a desert forever, a place where only jackals live. No one will ever live there again. I, the 
JER.49.34	Soon after Zedekiah became king of Judah, the 
JER.49.35	He said, “I will kill all the archers who have made Elam so powerful. 
JER.49.36	I will make winds blow against Elam from all directions, and I will scatter her people everywhere, until there is no country where her refugees have not gone. 
JER.49.37	I will make the people of Elam afraid of their enemies, who want to kill them. In my great anger I will destroy the people of Elam and send armies against them until I have wiped them out. 
JER.49.38	I will destroy their kings and leaders, and set up my throne there. 
JER.49.39	But later on I will make the people of Elam prosperous again. I, the 
JER.50.2	“Tell the news to the nations! Proclaim it!
JER.50.2	Give the signal and announce the news!
JER.50.2	Do not keep it a secret!
JER.50.2	Babylon has fallen!
JER.50.2	Her god Marduk has been shattered!
JER.50.2	Babylon's idols are put to shame;
JER.50.2	her disgusting images are crushed!
JER.50.3	“A nation from the north has come to attack Babylonia and will make it a desert. People and animals will run away, and no one will live there.”
JER.50.4	The 
JER.50.5	They will ask the way to Zion and then go in that direction. They will make an eternal covenant with me and never break it.
JER.50.6	“My people are like sheep whose shepherds have let them get lost in the mountains. They have wandered like sheep from one mountain to another, and they have forgotten where their home is. 
JER.50.7	They are attacked by all who find them. Their enemies say, ‘They sinned against the 
JER.50.9	I am going to stir up a group of strong nations in the north and make them attack Babylonia. They will line up in battle against the country and conquer it. They are skillful hunters, shooting arrows that never miss the mark. 
JER.50.10	Babylonia will be looted, and those who loot it will take everything they want. I, the 
JER.50.11	The 
JER.50.12	but your own great city will be humiliated and disgraced. Babylonia will be the least important nation of all; it will become a dry and waterless desert. 
JER.50.13	Because of my anger no one will live in Babylon; it will be left in ruins, and all who pass by will be shocked and amazed.
JER.50.14	“Archers, line up for battle against Babylon and surround it. Shoot all your arrows at Babylon, because it has sinned against me, the 
JER.50.15	Raise the war cry all around the city! Now Babylon has surrendered. Its walls have been broken through and torn down.
JER.50.16	Do not let seeds be planted in that country nor let a harvest be gathered. Every foreigner living there will be afraid of the attacking army and will go back home.”
JER.50.17	The 
JER.50.18	Because of this, I, the 
JER.50.19	I will restore the people of Israel to their land. They will eat the food that grows on Mount Carmel and in the region of Bashan, and they will eat all they want of the crops that grow in the territories of Ephraim and Gilead. 
JER.50.20	When that time comes, no sin will be found in Israel and no wickedness in Judah, because I will forgive those people whose lives I have spared. I, the 
JER.50.21	The 
JER.50.22	The noise of battle is heard in the land, and there is great destruction. 
JER.50.23	Babylonia hammered the whole world to pieces, and now that hammer is shattered! All the nations are shocked at what has happened to that country. 
JER.50.24	Babylonia, you fought against me, and you have been caught in the trap I set for you, even though you did not know it. 
JER.50.25	I have opened the place where my weapons are stored, and in my anger I have taken them out, because I, the Sovereign 
JER.50.26	Attack it from every side and break open the places where its grain is stored! Pile up the loot like piles of grain! Destroy the country! Leave nothing at all! 
JER.50.27	Kill all their soldiers! Slaughter them! The people of Babylonia are doomed! The time has come for them to be punished!”
JER.50.27	( 
JER.50.28	Refugees escape from Babylonia and come to Jerusalem, and they tell how the 
JER.50.30	So its young men will be killed in the city streets, and all its soldiers will be destroyed on that day. I, the 
JER.50.31	“Babylonia, you are filled with pride, so I, the Sovereign 
JER.50.32	Your proud nation will stumble and fall, and no one will help you up. I will set your cities on fire, and everything around will be destroyed.”
JER.50.33	The 
JER.50.34	But the one who will rescue them is strong—his name is the 
JER.50.35	The 
JER.50.35	“Death to Babylonia!
JER.50.35	Death to its people,
JER.50.35	to its rulers, to its people of wisdom.
JER.50.36	Death to its lying prophets—
JER.50.36	what fools they are!
JER.50.36	Death to its soldiers—
JER.50.36	how terrified they are!
JER.50.37	Destroy its horses and chariots!
JER.50.37	Death to its hired soldiers—
JER.50.37	how weak they are!
JER.50.37	Destroy its treasures;
JER.50.37	plunder and loot.
JER.50.38	Bring a drought on its land
JER.50.38	and dry up its rivers.
JER.50.38	Babylonia is a land of terrifying idols
JER.50.38	that have made fools of the people.
JER.50.40	 The same thing will happen to Babylon that happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, when I destroyed them and the nearby towns. No one will ever live there again. I, the 
JER.50.41	“People are coming from a country in the north,
JER.50.41	a mighty nation far away;
JER.50.41	many kings are preparing for war.
JER.50.42	They have taken their bows and swords;
JER.50.42	they are cruel and merciless.
JER.50.42	They sound like the roaring sea,
JER.50.42	as they ride their horses.
JER.50.42	They are ready for battle against Babylonia.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylonia hears the news,
JER.50.43	and his hands hang limp.
JER.50.43	He is seized by anguish,
JER.50.43	by pain like a woman in labor.
JER.50.44	“Like a lion coming out of the thick woods along the Jordan up to the green pasture land, I, the 
JER.50.45	So listen to the plan that I have made against the city of Babylon and to what I intend to do to its people. Even their children will be dragged off, and everyone will be horrified. 
JER.50.46	When Babylon falls, there will be such a noise that the entire earth will shake, and the cries of alarm will be heard by the other nations.”
JER.51.1	The 
JER.51.2	I will send foreigners to destroy Babylonia like a wind that blows straw away. When that day of destruction comes, they will attack from every side and leave the land bare. 
JER.51.3	Don't give its soldiers time to shoot their arrows or to put on their armor. Do not spare the young men! Destroy the whole army! 
JER.51.4	They will be wounded and die in the streets of their cities. 
JER.51.5	I, the 
JER.51.6	Run away from Babylonia! Run for your lives! Do not be killed because of Babylonia's sin. I am now taking my revenge and punishing it as it deserves. 
JER.51.7	 Babylonia was like a gold cup in my hand, making the whole world drunk. The nations drank its wine and went out of their minds. 
JER.51.8	Babylonia has suddenly fallen and is destroyed! Mourn over it! Get medicine for its wounds, and maybe it can be healed. 
JER.51.9	 Foreigners living there said, ‘We tried to help Babylonia, but it was too late. Let's leave now and go back home. God has punished Babylonia with all his might and has destroyed it completely.’”
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	The 
JER.51.11	The attacking officers command, “Sharpen your arrows! Get your shields ready! 
JER.51.12	Give the signal to attack Babylon's walls. Strengthen the guard! Post the sentries! Place troops in ambush!”
JER.51.12	The 
JER.51.13	 That country has many rivers and rich treasures, but its time is up, and its thread of life is cut. 
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	The 
JER.51.15	by his wisdom he created the world
JER.51.15	and stretched out the heavens.
JER.51.16	At his command the waters above the sky
JER.51.16	he brings clouds from the ends of the earth.
JER.51.16	He makes lightning flash in the rain
JER.51.16	and sends the wind from his storeroom.
JER.51.17	At the sight of this, people feel stupid and senseless;
JER.51.17	those who make idols are disillusioned
JER.51.17	because the gods they make are false and lifeless.
JER.51.18	They are worthless and should be despised;
JER.51.18	they will be destroyed when the 
JER.51.19	The God of Jacob is not like them;
JER.51.19	he is the one who made everything,
JER.51.19	and he has chosen Israel to be his very own people.
JER.51.19	The 
JER.51.20	The 
JER.51.20	“Babylonia, you are my hammer, my weapon of war.
JER.51.20	I used you to crush nations and kingdoms,
JER.51.21	to shatter horses and riders,
JER.51.21	to shatter chariots and their drivers,
JER.51.22	to kill men and women,
JER.51.22	to slay old and young,
JER.51.22	to kill boys and girls,
JER.51.23	to slaughter shepherds and their flocks,
JER.51.23	to slaughter farmers and their plow horses,
JER.51.23	to crush rulers and high officials.”
JER.51.24	The 
JER.51.25	Babylonia, you are like a mountain that destroys the whole world, but I, the 
JER.51.26	None of the stones from your ruins will ever be used again for building. You will be like a desert forever. I, the 
JER.51.27	“Give the signal to attack! Blow the trumpet so that the nations can hear! Prepare the nations for war against Babylonia! Tell the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz to attack. Appoint an officer to lead the attack. Bring up the horses like a swarm of locusts. 
JER.51.28	Prepare the nations for war against Babylonia. Send for the kings of Media, their leaders and officials, and the armies of all the countries they control. 
JER.51.29	The earth trembles and shakes because the 
JER.51.30	The Babylonian soldiers have stopped fighting and remain in their forts. They have lost their courage and have become helpless. The city gates are broken down, and the houses are on fire. 
JER.51.31	Messenger after messenger runs to tell the king of Babylonia that his city has been broken into from every side. 
JER.51.32	The enemy have captured the river crossing and have set the fortresses on fire. The Babylonian soldiers have panicked. 
JER.51.33	Soon the enemy will cut them down and trample them like grain on a threshing place. I, the 
JER.51.34	The king of Babylonia cut Jerusalem up
JER.51.34	and ate it.
JER.51.34	He emptied the city like a jar;
JER.51.34	like a monster he swallowed it.
JER.51.34	He took what he wanted
JER.51.34	and threw the rest away.
JER.51.35	Let the people of Zion say,
JER.51.35	“May Babylonia be held responsible
JER.51.35	for the violence done to us!”
JER.51.35	Let the people of Jerusalem say,
JER.51.35	“May Babylonia be held responsible
JER.51.35	for what we have suffered!”
JER.51.36	And so the 
JER.51.37	That country will become a pile of ruins where wild animals live. It will be a horrible sight; no one will live there, and all who see it will be terrified. 
JER.51.38	The Babylonians all roar like lions and growl like lion cubs. 
JER.51.39	Are they greedy? I will prepare them a feast and make them drunk and happy. They will go to sleep and never wake up. 
JER.51.40	I will take them to be slaughtered, like lambs, goats, and rams. I, the 
JER.51.41	The 
JER.51.42	The sea has rolled over Babylon and covered it with roaring waves. 
JER.51.43	The towns have become a horrifying sight and are like a waterless desert, where no one lives or even travels. 
JER.51.44	I will punish Bel, the god of Babylonia, and make him give up his stolen goods; the nations will not worship him any more.
JER.51.44	“Babylon's walls have fallen. 
JER.51.45	People of Israel, run away from there! Run for your life from my fierce anger. 
JER.51.46	Do not lose courage or be afraid because of the rumors you hear. Every year a different rumor spreads—rumors of violence in the land and of one king fighting another. 
JER.51.47	And so the time is coming when I will deal with Babylonia's idols. The whole country will be put to shame, and all its people will be killed. 
JER.51.48	 Everything on earth and in the sky will shout for joy when Babylonia falls to the people who come from the north to destroy it. 
JER.51.49	 Babylonia caused the death of people all over the world, and now Babylonia will fall because it caused the death of so many Israelites. I, the 
JER.51.50	The 
JER.51.51	You say, ‘We've been disgraced and made ashamed; we feel completely helpless because foreigners have taken over the holy places in the Temple.’ 
JER.51.52	So then, I say that the time is coming when I will deal with Babylon's idols, and the wounded will groan throughout the country. 
JER.51.53	Even if Babylon could climb to the sky and build a strong fortress there, I would still send people to destroy it. I, the 
JER.51.54	The 
JER.51.54	“Listen to the sound of crying in Babylon,
JER.51.54	of mourning for the destruction in the land.
JER.51.55	I am destroying Babylon
JER.51.55	and putting it to silence.
JER.51.55	The armies rush in like roaring waves
JER.51.55	and attack with noisy shouts.
JER.51.56	They have come to destroy Babylon;
JER.51.56	its soldiers are captured,
JER.51.56	and their bows are broken.
JER.51.56	I am a God who punishes evil,
JER.51.56	and I will treat Babylon as it deserves.
JER.51.57	I will make its rulers drunk—
JER.51.57	men of wisdom, leaders, and soldiers.
JER.51.57	They will go to sleep and never wake up.
JER.51.57	I, the king, have spoken;
JER.51.57	I am the 
JER.51.58	The walls of mighty Babylon will be thrown to the ground,
JER.51.58	and its towering gates burned down.
JER.51.58	The work of the nations is all for nothing;
JER.51.58	their efforts go up in flames.
JER.51.58	I, the 
JER.51.59	King Zedekiah's personal attendant was Seraiah, the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. In the fourth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, Seraiah was going to Babylonia with him, and I gave him some instructions. 
JER.51.60	I wrote in a book an account of all the destruction that would come on Babylonia, as well as all these other things about Babylonia. 
JER.51.61	I told Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, be sure to read aloud to the people everything that is written here. 
JER.51.62	Then pray, ‘
JER.51.63	 Seraiah, when you finish reading this book to the people, then tie it to a rock and throw it into the Euphrates River 
JER.51.64	and say, ‘This is what will happen to Babylonia—it will sink and never rise again because of the destruction that the 
JER.51.64	The words of Jeremiah end here.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of the Jeremiah who lived in the city of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	King Zedekiah sinned against the 
JER.52.3	The 
JER.52.3	Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, 
JER.52.4	 and so Nebuchadnezzar came with all his army and attacked Jerusalem on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign. They set up camp outside the city, built siege walls around it, 
JER.52.5	and kept it under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year. 
JER.52.6	On the ninth day of the fourth month of that same year, when the famine was so bad that the people had nothing left to eat, 
JER.52.7	 the city walls were broken through. Although the Babylonians were surrounding the city, all the soldiers escaped during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and fled in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
JER.52.8	But the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah, captured him in the plains near Jericho, and all his soldiers deserted him. 
JER.52.9	Zedekiah was taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
JER.52.10	At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on and he also had the officials of Judah executed. 
JER.52.11	 After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains and taken to Babylon. Zedekiah remained in prison in Babylon until the day he died.
JER.52.12	On the tenth day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, Nebuzaradan, adviser to the king and commander of his army, entered Jerusalem. 
JER.52.13	 He burned down the Temple, the palace, and the houses of all the important people in Jerusalem; 
JER.52.14	and his soldiers tore down the city walls. 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan took away to Babylonia
JER.52.16	But he left in Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he put them to work in the vineyards and fields.
JER.52.18	They also took away the shovels and the ash containers used in cleaning the altar, the tools used in tending the lamps, the bowls used for catching the blood from the sacrifices, the bowls used for burning incense, and all the other bronze articles used in the Temple service. 
JER.52.19	They took away everything that was made of gold or silver: the small bowls, the pans used for carrying live coals, the bowls for holding the blood from the sacrifices, the ash containers, the lampstands, the bowls used for incense, and the bowls used for pouring out wine offerings. 
JER.52.20	The bronze objects that King Solomon had made for the Temple—the two columns, the carts, the large tank, and the twelve bulls that supported it—were too heavy to weigh. 
JER.52.21+JER.52.22	The two columns were identical: each one was 27 feet high and 18 feet around. They were hollow, and the metal was 3 inches thick. On top of each column was a bronze capital 7½ feet high, and all around it was a grillwork decorated with pomegranates, all of which was also made of bronze. 
JER.52.23	On the grillwork of each column there were a hundred pomegranates in all, and ninety-six of these were visible from the ground.
JER.52.24	In addition, Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners Seraiah the High Priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three other important Temple officials. 
JER.52.25	From the city he took the officer who had been in command of the troops, seven of the king's personal advisers who were still in the city, the commander's assistant, who was in charge of military records, and sixty other important men. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan took them to the king of Babylonia, who was in the city of Riblah 
JER.52.27	in the territory of Hamath. There the king had them beaten and put to death.
JER.52.27	So the people of Judah were carried away from their land into exile. 
JER.52.28	This is the record of the people that Nebuchadnezzar took away as prisoners: in his seventh year as king he carried away 3,023; 
JER.52.29	in his eighteenth year, 832 from Jerusalem; 
JER.52.30	and in his twenty-third year, 745—taken away by Nebuzaradan. In all, 4,600 people were taken away.
JER.52.31	In the year that Evil-merodach became king of Babylonia, he showed kindness to King Jehoiachin of Judah by releasing him from prison. This happened on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin had been taken away as a prisoner. 
JER.52.32	Evil-merodach treated him kindly and gave him a position of greater honor than he gave the other kings who were exiles with him in Babylonia. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin was permitted to change from his prison clothes and to dine at the king's table for the rest of his life. 
JER.52.34	Each day for as long as he lived, he was given a regular allowance for his needs.
LAM.1.1	Once honored by the world, she is now like a widow;
LAM.1.1	The noblest of cities has fallen into slavery.
LAM.1.2	All night long she cries; tears run down her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	Of all her former friends, not one is left to comfort her.
LAM.1.2	Her allies have betrayed her and are all against her now.
LAM.1.3	Judah's people are helpless slaves, forced away from home.
LAM.1.3	They live in other lands, with no place to call their own—
LAM.1.3	Surrounded by enemies, with no way to escape.
LAM.1.4	No one comes to the Temple now to worship on the holy days.
LAM.1.4	The young women who sang there suffer, and the priests can only groan.
LAM.1.4	The city gates stand empty, and Zion is in agony.
LAM.1.5	Her enemies succeeded; they hold her in their power.
LAM.1.5	The 
LAM.1.5	Her children have been captured and taken away.
LAM.1.6	The splendor of Jerusalem is a thing of the past.
LAM.1.6	Her leaders are like deer that are weak from hunger,
LAM.1.6	Whose strength is almost gone as they flee from the hunters.
LAM.1.7	A lonely ruin now, Jerusalem recalls her ancient splendor.
LAM.1.7	When she fell to the enemy, there was no one to help her;
LAM.1.7	Her conquerors laughed at her downfall.
LAM.1.8	Her honor is gone; she is naked and held in contempt.
LAM.1.8	She groans and hides her face in shame.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem made herself filthy with terrible sin.
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness was easily seen, but she showed no concern for her fate.
LAM.1.9	Her downfall was terrible; no one can comfort her.
LAM.1.9	Her enemies have won, and she cries to the 
LAM.1.10	The enemies robbed her of all her treasures.
LAM.1.10	She saw them enter the Temple itself,
LAM.1.10	Where the 
LAM.1.11	Her people groan as they look for something to eat;
LAM.1.11	They exchange their treasures for food to keep themselves alive.
LAM.1.11	“Look at me, 
LAM.1.12	“Look at me!” she cries to everyone who passes by.
LAM.1.12	“No one has ever had pain like mine,
LAM.1.12	Pain that the 
LAM.1.13	“He sent fire from above, a fire that burned inside me.
LAM.1.13	He set a trap for me and brought me to the ground.
LAM.1.13	Then he abandoned me and left me in constant pain.
LAM.1.14	“He took note of all my sins and tied them all together;
LAM.1.14	He hung them around my neck, and I grew weak beneath the weight.
LAM.1.14	The Lord gave me to my foes, and I was helpless against them.
LAM.1.15	“The Lord laughed at all my strongest soldiers;
LAM.1.15	He sent an army to destroy my young men.
LAM.1.15	He crushed my people like grapes in a wine press.
LAM.1.16	“That is why my eyes are overflowing with tears.
LAM.1.16	No one can comfort me; no one can give me courage.
LAM.1.16	The enemy has conquered me; my people have nothing left.
LAM.1.17	“I stretch out my hands, but no one will help me.
LAM.1.17	The 
LAM.1.17	They treat me like some filthy thing.
LAM.1.18	“But the 
LAM.1.18	Listen to me, people everywhere; look at me in my pain.
LAM.1.18	My young men and women have been taken away captive.
LAM.1.19	“I called to my allies, but they refused to help me.
LAM.1.19	The priests and the leaders died in the city streets,
LAM.1.19	Looking for food to keep themselves alive.
LAM.1.20	“Look, O 
LAM.1.20	My heart is broken in sorrow for my sins.
LAM.1.20	There is murder in the streets; even indoors there is death.
LAM.1.21	“Listen
LAM.1.21	My enemies are glad that you brought disaster on me.
LAM.1.21	Bring
LAM.1.22	“Condemn them for all their wickedness;
LAM.1.22	Punish them as you punished me for my sins.
LAM.1.22	I groan in misery, and I am sick at heart.”
LAM.2.1	The Lord in his anger has covered Zion with darkness.
LAM.2.1	Its heavenly splendor he has turned into ruins.
LAM.2.1	On the day of his anger he abandoned even his Temple.
LAM.2.2	The Lord destroyed without mercy every village in Judah
LAM.2.2	And tore down the forts that defended the land.
LAM.2.2	He brought disgrace on the kingdom and its rulers.
LAM.2.3	In his fury he shattered the strength of Israel;
LAM.2.3	He refused to help us when the enemy came.
LAM.2.3	He raged against us like fire, destroying everything.
LAM.2.4	He aimed his arrows at us like an enemy;
LAM.2.4	He killed all those who were our joy and delight.
LAM.2.4	Here in Jerusalem we felt his burning anger.
LAM.2.5	Like an enemy, the Lord has destroyed Israel;
LAM.2.5	He has left her forts and palaces in ruins.
LAM.2.5	He has brought on the people of Judah unending sorrow.
LAM.2.6	He smashed to pieces the Temple where we worshiped him;
LAM.2.6	He has put an end to holy days and Sabbaths.
LAM.2.6	King and priest alike have felt the force of his anger.
LAM.2.7	The Lord rejected his altar and deserted his holy Temple;
LAM.2.7	He allowed the enemy to tear down its walls.
LAM.2.7	They shouted in victory where once we had worshiped in joy.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	He measured them off to make sure of total destruction.
LAM.2.8	The towers and walls now lie in ruins together.
LAM.2.9	The gates lie buried in rubble, their bars smashed to pieces.
LAM.2.9	The king and the noblemen now are in exile.
LAM.2.9	The Law is no longer taught, and the prophets have no visions from the 
LAM.2.10	Jerusalem's old men sit on the ground in silence,
LAM.2.10	With dust on their heads and sackcloth on their bodies.
LAM.2.10	Young women bow their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes are worn out with weeping; my soul is in anguish.
LAM.2.11	I am exhausted with grief at the destruction of my people.
LAM.2.11	Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	Hungry and thirsty, they cry to their mothers;
LAM.2.12	They fall in the streets as though they were wounded,
LAM.2.12	And slowly die in their mothers' arms.
LAM.2.13	O Jerusalem, beloved Jerusalem, what can I say?
LAM.2.13	How can I comfort you? No one has ever suffered like this.
LAM.2.13	Your disaster is boundless as the ocean; there is no possible hope.
LAM.2.14	Your prophets had nothing to tell you but lies;
LAM.2.14	Their preaching deceived you by never exposing your sin.
LAM.2.14	They made you think you did not need to repent.
LAM.2.15	People passing by the city look at you in scorn.
LAM.2.15	They shake their heads and laugh at Jerusalem's ruins:
LAM.2.15	“Is this that lovely city? Is this the pride of the world?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies mock you and glare at you with hate.
LAM.2.16	They curl their lips and sneer, “We have destroyed it!
LAM.2.16	This is the day we have waited for!”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	He has destroyed us without mercy, as he warned us long ago.
LAM.2.17	He gave our enemies victory, gave them joy at our downfall.
LAM.2.18	O Jerusalem, let your very walls cry out to the Lord!
LAM.2.18	Let your tears flow like rivers night and day;
LAM.2.18	Wear yourself out with weeping and grief!
LAM.2.19	All through the night get up again and again to cry out to the Lord;
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart and beg him for mercy on your children—
LAM.2.19	Children starving to death on every street corner!
LAM.2.20	Look, O 
LAM.2.20	Women are eating the bodies of the children they loved!
LAM.2.20	Priests and prophets are being killed in the Temple itself!
LAM.2.21	Young and old alike lie dead in the streets,
LAM.2.21	Young men and women, killed by enemy swords.
LAM.2.21	You slaughtered them without mercy on the day of your anger.
LAM.2.22	You invited my enemies to hold a carnival of terror all around me,
LAM.2.22	And no one could escape on that day of your anger.
LAM.2.22	They murdered my children, whom I had raised and loved.
LAM.3.1	I am one who knows what it is to be punished by God.
LAM.3.2	He drove me deeper and deeper into darkness
LAM.3.3	And beat me again and again with merciless blows.
LAM.3.4	He has left my flesh open and raw, and has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has shut me in a prison of misery and anguish.
LAM.3.6	He has forced me to live in the stagnant darkness of death.
LAM.3.7	He has bound me in chains; I am a prisoner with no hope of escape.
LAM.3.8	I cry aloud for help, but God refuses to listen;
LAM.3.9	I stagger as I walk; stone walls block me wherever I turn.
LAM.3.10	He waited for me like a bear; he pounced on me like a lion.
LAM.3.11	He chased me off the road, tore me to pieces, and left me.
LAM.3.12	He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
LAM.3.13	He shot his arrows deep into my body.
LAM.3.14	People laugh at me all day long; I am a joke to them all.
LAM.3.15	Bitter suffering is all he has given me for food and drink.
LAM.3.16	He rubbed my face in the ground and broke my teeth on rocks.
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten what health and peace and happiness are.
LAM.3.18	I do not have much longer to live; my hope in the 
LAM.3.19	The thought of my pain, my homelessness, is bitter poison.
LAM.3.20	I think of it constantly, and my spirit is depressed.
LAM.3.21	Yet hope returns when I remember this one thing:
LAM.3.22	The 
LAM.3.23	Fresh as the morning, as sure as the sunrise.
LAM.3.24	The 
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.26	So it is best for us to wait in patience—to wait for him to save us—
LAM.3.27	And it is best to learn this patience in our youth.
LAM.3.28	When we suffer, we should sit alone in silent patience;
LAM.3.29	We should bow in submission, for there may still be hope.
LAM.3.30	Though beaten and insulted, we should accept it all.
LAM.3.31	The Lord is merciful and will not reject us forever.
LAM.3.32	He may bring us sorrow, but his love for us is sure and strong.
LAM.3.33	He takes no pleasure in causing us grief or pain.
LAM.3.34	The Lord knows when our spirits are crushed in prison;
LAM.3.35	He knows when we are denied the rights he gave us;
LAM.3.36	When justice is perverted in court, he knows.
LAM.3.37	The will of the Lord alone is always carried out.
LAM.3.38	Good and evil alike take place at his command.
LAM.3.39	Why should we ever complain when we are punished for our sin?
LAM.3.40	Let us examine our ways and turn back to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us open our hearts to God in heaven and pray,
LAM.3.42	“We have sinned and rebelled, and you, O 
LAM.3.43	“You pursued us and killed us; your mercy was hidden by your anger,
LAM.3.44	By a cloud of fury too thick for our prayers to get through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us the garbage dump of the world.
LAM.3.46	“We are insulted and mocked by all our enemies.
LAM.3.47	We have been through disaster and ruin; we live in danger and fear.
LAM.3.48	My eyes flow with rivers of tears at the destruction of my people.
LAM.3.49	“My tears will pour out in a ceaseless stream
LAM.3.50	Until the 
LAM.3.51	My heart is grieved when I see what has happened to the women of the city.
LAM.3.52	“I was trapped like a bird by enemies who had no cause to hate me.
LAM.3.53	They threw me alive into a pit and closed the opening with a stone.
LAM.3.54	Water began to close over me, and I thought death was near.
LAM.3.55	“From the bottom of the pit, O 
LAM.3.56	And when I begged you to listen to my cry, you heard.
LAM.3.57	You answered me and told me not to be afraid.
LAM.3.58	“You came to my rescue, Lord, and saved my life.
LAM.3.59	Judge in my favor; you know the wrongs done against me.
LAM.3.60	You know how my enemies hate me and how they plot against me.
LAM.3.61	“You have heard them insult me, O 
LAM.3.62	All day long they talk about me and make their plans.
LAM.3.63	From morning till night they make fun of me.
LAM.3.64	“Punish them for what they have done, O 
LAM.3.65	Curse them and fill them with despair!
LAM.3.66	Hunt them down and wipe them off the earth!”
LAM.4.1	Our glittering gold has grown dull;
LAM.4.1	the stones of the Temple lie scattered in the streets.
LAM.4.2	Zion's young people were as precious to us as gold,
LAM.4.2	but now they are treated like common clay pots.
LAM.4.3	Even a mother wolf will nurse her cubs,
LAM.4.3	but my people are like ostriches, cruel to their young.
LAM.4.4	They let their babies die of hunger and thirst;
LAM.4.4	children are begging for food that no one will give them.
LAM.4.5	People who once ate the finest foods die starving in the streets;
LAM.4.5	those raised in luxury are pawing through garbage for food.
LAM.4.6	which met a sudden downfall at the hands of God.
LAM.4.7	Our princes
LAM.4.7	vigorous and strong, glowing with health.
LAM.4.8	Now they lie unknown in the streets, their faces blackened in death;
LAM.4.8	their skin, dry as wood, has shriveled on their bones.
LAM.4.9	Those who died in the war were better off than those who died later,
LAM.4.9	who starved slowly to death, with no food to keep them alive.
LAM.4.10	loving mothers boiled their own children for food.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	he lit a fire in Zion that burned it to the ground.
LAM.4.12	No one anywhere, not even rulers of foreign nations,
LAM.4.12	believed that any invader could enter Jerusalem's gates.
LAM.4.13	But it happened, because her prophets sinned and her priests were guilty
LAM.4.13	of causing the death of innocent people.
LAM.4.14	Her leaders wandered through the streets as though blind,
LAM.4.14	so stained with blood that no one would touch them.
LAM.4.15	“Get away!” people shouted. “You're defiled! Don't touch me!”
LAM.4.15	So they wandered from nation to nation, welcomed by no one.
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	He showed no regard for our priests and leaders.
LAM.4.17	For help that never came, we looked until we could look no longer.
LAM.4.17	We kept waiting for help from a nation that had none to give.
LAM.4.18	The enemy was watching for us; we could not even walk in the streets.
LAM.4.18	Our days were over; the end had come.
LAM.4.19	Swifter than eagles swooping from the sky, they chased us down.
LAM.4.19	They tracked us down in the hills; they took us by surprise in the desert.
LAM.4.20	They captured the source of our life, the king the 
LAM.4.20	the one we had trusted to protect us from every invader.
LAM.4.21	Laugh on, people of Edom and Uz; be glad while you can.
LAM.4.21	Your disaster is coming too; you too will stagger naked in shame.
LAM.4.22	Zion has paid for her sin; the 
LAM.4.22	But Edom, the 
LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.1	Look at us, and see our disgrace.
LAM.5.2	Our property is in the hands of strangers;
LAM.5.2	foreigners are living in our homes.
LAM.5.3	Our fathers have been killed by the enemy,
LAM.5.3	and now our mothers are widows.
LAM.5.4	We must pay for the water we drink;
LAM.5.4	we must buy the wood we need for fuel.
LAM.5.5	Driven hard like donkeys or camels,
LAM.5.5	we are tired, but are allowed no rest.
LAM.5.6	To get food enough to stay alive,
LAM.5.6	we went begging to Egypt and Assyria.
LAM.5.7	Our ancestors sinned, but now they are gone,
LAM.5.7	and we are suffering for their sins.
LAM.5.8	Our rulers are no better than slaves,
LAM.5.8	and no one can save us from their power.
LAM.5.9	Murderers roam through the countryside;
LAM.5.9	we risk our lives when we look for food.
LAM.5.10	Hunger has made us burn with fever
LAM.5.10	until our skin is as hot as an oven.
LAM.5.11	Our wives have been raped on Mount Zion itself;
LAM.5.11	in every Judean village our daughters have been forced to submit.
LAM.5.12	Our leaders have been taken and hanged;
LAM.5.12	our elders are shown no respect.
LAM.5.13	Our young men are forced to grind grain like slaves;
LAM.5.13	boys go staggering under heavy loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The old people no longer sit at the city gate,
LAM.5.14	and the young people no longer make music.
LAM.5.15	Happiness has gone out of our lives;
LAM.5.15	grief has taken the place of our dances.
LAM.5.16	Nothing is left of all we were proud of.
LAM.5.16	We sinned, and now we are doomed.
LAM.5.17	We are sick at our very hearts
LAM.5.17	and can hardly see through our tears,
LAM.5.18	because Mount Zion lies lonely and deserted,
LAM.5.18	and wild jackals prowl through its ruins.
LAM.5.19	But you, O 
LAM.5.19	and will rule to the end of time.
LAM.5.20	Why have you abandoned us so long?
LAM.5.20	Will you ever remember us again?
LAM.5.21	Bring us back to you, 
LAM.5.21	Restore our ancient glory.
LAM.5.22	Or have you rejected us forever?
LAM.5.22	Is there no limit to your anger?
EZK.1.2	 It was the fifth year since King Jehoiachin had been taken into exile.) 
EZK.1.3	There in Babylonia beside the Chebar River, I heard the 
EZK.1.4	I looked up and saw a windstorm coming from the north. Lightning was flashing from a huge cloud, and the sky around it was glowing. Where the lightning was flashing, something shone like bronze. 
EZK.1.5	 At the center of the storm I saw what looked like four living creatures in human form, 
EZK.1.6	but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight, and they had hoofs like those of a bull. They shone like polished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	In addition to their four faces and four wings, they each had four human hands, one under each wing. 
EZK.1.9	Two wings of each creature were spread out so that the creatures formed a square, with their wing tips touching. When they moved, they moved as a group without turning their bodies.
EZK.1.11	Two wings
EZK.1.12	Each creature faced all four directions, and so the group could go wherever they wished, without having to turn.
EZK.1.14	The creatures themselves darted back and forth with the speed of lightning.
EZK.1.16	All four wheels were alike; each one shone like a precious stone, and each had another wheel intersecting it at right angles, 
EZK.1.17	so that the wheels could move in any of the four directions. 
EZK.1.18	 The rims of the wheels were covered with eyes.
EZK.1.19	Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and if the creatures rose up from the earth, so did the wheels. 
EZK.1.20	The creatures went wherever they wished, and the wheels did exactly what the creatures did, because the creatures controlled them. 
EZK.1.21	So every time the creatures moved or stopped or rose in the air, the wheels did exactly the same.
EZK.1.23	There under the dome stood the creatures, each stretching out two wings toward the ones next to it and covering its body with the other two wings. 
EZK.1.24	 I heard the noise their wings made in flight; it sounded like the roar of the sea, like the noise of a huge army, like the voice of Almighty God. When they stopped flying, they folded their wings, 
EZK.1.25	but there was still a sound coming from above the dome over their heads.
EZK.1.27	 The figure seemed to be shining like bronze in the middle of a fire. It shone all over with a bright light 
EZK.1.28	that had in it all the colors of the rainbow. This was the dazzling light which shows the presence of the 
EZK.1.28	When I saw this, I fell face downward on the ground. Then I heard a voice
EZK.2.1	saying, “Mortal man, stand up. I want to talk to you.” 
EZK.2.2	While the voice was speaking, God's spirit entered me and raised me to my feet, and I heard the voice continue, 
EZK.2.3	“Mortal man, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They have rebelled and turned against me and are still rebels, just as their ancestors were. 
EZK.2.4	They are stubborn and do not respect me, so I am sending you to tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.2.5	Whether those rebels listen to you or not, they will know that a prophet has been among them.
EZK.2.6	“But you, mortal man, must not be afraid of them or of anything they say. They will defy and despise you; it will be like living among scorpions. Still, don't be afraid of those rebels or of anything they say. 
EZK.2.7	You will tell them whatever I tell you to say, whether they listen or not. Remember what rebels they are.
EZK.2.8	“Mortal man, listen to what I tell you. Don't be rebellious like them. Open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you.” 
EZK.2.9	 I saw a hand reaching out toward me, and it was holding a scroll. 
EZK.2.10	The hand unrolled the scroll, and I saw that there was writing on both sides—cries of grief were written there, and wails and groans.
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. 
EZK.3.3	He said, “Mortal man, eat this scroll that I give you; fill your stomach with it.” I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey.
EZK.3.4	Then God said, “Mortal man, go to the people of Israel and say to them whatever I tell you to say. 
EZK.3.5	I am not sending you to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language, but to the Israelites. 
EZK.3.6	If I sent you to great nations that spoke difficult languages you didn't understand, they would listen to you. 
EZK.3.7	But none of the people of Israel will be willing to listen; they will not even listen to me. All of them are stubborn and defiant. 
EZK.3.8	Now I will make you as stubborn and as tough as they are. 
EZK.3.9	I will make you as firm as a rock, as hard as a diamond; don't be afraid of those rebels.”
EZK.3.10	God continued, “Mortal man, pay close attention and remember everything I tell you. 
EZK.3.11	Then go to the people of your nation who are in exile and tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.3.12	Then God's spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the loud roar of a voice that said, “Praise the glory of the 
EZK.3.13	I heard the wings of the creatures beating together in the air, and the noise of the wheels, as loud as an earthquake. 
EZK.3.14	The power of the 
EZK.3.15	So I came to Tel Abib beside the Chebar River, where the exiles were living, and for seven days I stayed there, overcome by what I had seen and heard.
EZK.3.16	After the seven days had passed, the 
EZK.3.17	“Mortal man,” he said, “I am making you a lookout for the nation of Israel. You will pass on to them the warnings I give you. 
EZK.3.18	If I announce that someone evil is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, he will die, still a sinner, but I will hold you responsible for his death. 
EZK.3.19	If you do warn an evil man and he doesn't stop sinning, he will die, still a sinner, but your life will be spared.
EZK.3.20	“If someone truly good starts doing evil and I put him in a dangerous situation, he will die if you do not warn him. He will die because of his sins—I will not remember the good he did—and I will hold you responsible for his death. 
EZK.3.21	If you do warn a good man not to sin and he listens to you and doesn't sin, he will stay alive, and your life will also be spared.”
EZK.3.22	I felt the powerful presence of the 
EZK.3.23	So I went out into the valley, and there I saw the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	but God's spirit entered me and raised me to my feet. The 
EZK.3.25	You will be tied with ropes, mortal man, and you will not be able to go out in public. 
EZK.3.26	I will paralyze your tongue so that you won't be able to warn these rebellious people. 
EZK.3.27	Then, when I speak to you again and give you back the power of speech, you will tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.4.1	God said, “Mortal man, get a brick, put it in front of you, and scratch lines on it to represent the city of Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Then, to represent a siege, put trenches, earthworks, camps, and battering rams all around it. 
EZK.4.3	Take an iron pan and set it up like a wall between you and the city. Face the city. It is under siege, and you are the one besieging it. This will be a sign to the nation of Israel.
EZK.4.4+EZK.4.5	“Then lie down on your left side, and I
EZK.4.6	When you finish that, turn over on your right side and suffer for the guilt of Judah for forty days—one day for each year of their punishment.
EZK.4.7	“Fix your eyes on the siege of Jerusalem. Shake your fist at the city and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	I will tie you up so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until the siege is over.
EZK.4.9	“Now take some wheat, barley, beans, peas, millet, and spelt. Mix them all together and make bread. That is what you are to eat during the 390 days you are lying on your left side. 
EZK.4.10	You will be allowed eight ounces of bread a day, and it will have to last until the next day. 
EZK.4.11	You will also have a limited amount of water to drink, two cups a day. 
EZK.4.12	You are to build a fire out of dried human excrement, bake bread on the fire, and eat it where everyone can see you.”
EZK.4.13	The 
EZK.4.14	But I replied, “No, Sovereign 
EZK.4.15	So God said, “Very well. I will let you use cow dung instead, and you can bake your bread on that.”
EZK.4.16	And he added, “Mortal man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread for Jerusalem. The people there will be distressed and anxious as they measure out the food they eat and the water they drink. 
EZK.4.17	They will run out of bread and water; they will be in despair, and they will waste away because of their sins.”
EZK.5.1	The 
EZK.5.2	Burn up a third of it in the city when the siege is over. Take another third and chop it up with your sword as you move around outside the city. Scatter the remaining third to the winds, and I will pursue it with my sword. 
EZK.5.3	Keep back a few hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes. 
EZK.5.4	Then take a few of them out again, throw them in the fire, and let them burn up. From them fire will spread to the whole nation of Israel.”
EZK.5.5	The Sovereign 
EZK.5.6	But Jerusalem rebelled against my commands and showed that she was more wicked than the other nations, more disobedient than the countries around her. Jerusalem rejected my commands and refused to keep my laws. 
EZK.5.7	Now listen, Jerusalem, to what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.5.8	And so I, the Sovereign 
EZK.5.9	Because of all the things you do that I hate, I will punish Jerusalem as I have never done before and will never do again. 
EZK.5.10	 As a result, parents in Jerusalem will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter in every direction any who are left alive.
EZK.5.11	“Therefore, as I am the living God—this is the word of the Sovereign 
EZK.5.12	A third of your people will die from sickness and hunger in the city; a third will be cut down by swords outside the city; and I will scatter the last third to the winds and pursue them with a sword.
EZK.5.13	“You will feel all the force of my anger and rage until I am satisfied. When all this happens, you will be convinced that I, the 
EZK.5.14	Everyone from the nations around you who passes by will sneer at you and keep their distance.
EZK.5.15	“When I am angry and furious with you and punish you, all the nations around you will be terrified. They will look at you with disgust and make fun of you. 
EZK.5.16	I will cut off your supply of food and let you starve. You
EZK.5.17	 I will send hunger and wild animals to kill your children, and will send sickness, violence, and war to kill you. I, the 
EZK.6.1	The 
EZK.6.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “look toward the mountains of Israel and give them my message. 
EZK.6.3	Tell the mountains of Israel to hear the Sovereign 
EZK.6.4	The altars will be torn down and the incense altars broken. All the people there will be killed in front of their idols. 
EZK.6.5	I will scatter the corpses of the people of Israel; I will scatter their bones all around the altars. 
EZK.6.6	All the cities of Israel will be destroyed, so that all their altars and their idols will be smashed to pieces, their incense altars will be shattered, and everything they made will disappear. 
EZK.6.7	People will be killed everywhere, and those who survive will acknowledge that I am the 
EZK.6.8	“I will let some escape the slaughter and be scattered among the nations, 
EZK.6.9	where they will live in exile. There they will remember me and know that I have punished them and disgraced them,
EZK.6.10	They will know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	The Sovereign 
EZK.6.12	Those far away will get sick and die; those nearby will be killed in war; those who survive will starve to death. They will feel all the force of my anger. 
EZK.6.13	Corpses will be scattered among the idols and around the altars, scattered on every high hill, on the top of every mountain, under every green tree and every large oak, in every place where they burned sacrifices to their idols. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	Yes, I will reach out and destroy their country. I will make it a wasteland from the southern desert to the city of Riblah in the north, not sparing any place where the Israelites live. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.7.1	The 
EZK.7.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.7.3	“Israel, the end has come. You will feel my anger, because I am judging you for what you have done. I will pay you back for all your disgusting conduct. 
EZK.7.4	I will not spare you or show you any mercy. I am going to punish you for the disgusting things you have done, so that you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.7.6	It's all over. This is the end. You are finished. 
EZK.7.7	The end is coming for you people who live in the land. The time is near when there will be no more celebrations at the mountain shrines, only confusion.
EZK.7.8	“Very soon now you will feel all the force of my anger. I am judging you for what you have done, and I will pay you back for all your disgusting conduct. 
EZK.7.9	I will not spare you or show you any mercy. I am going to punish you for the disgusting things you have done, so that you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.10	The day of disaster is coming. Violence is flourishing. Pride is at its height.
EZK.7.11	Violence produces more wickedness. Nothing of theirs will remain, nothing of their wealth, their splendor, or their glory.
EZK.7.12	The time is coming. The day is near when buying and selling will have no more meaning, because God's punishment will fall on everyone alike. 
EZK.7.13	No merchants will live long enough to get back what they have lost, because God's anger is on everyone. Those who are evil cannot survive.
EZK.7.14	The trumpet blows, and everyone gets ready. But no one goes off to war, for God's anger will fall on everyone alike.
EZK.7.15	There is fighting in the streets, and sickness and hunger in the houses. Anyone who is out in the country will die in the fighting, and anyone in the city will be a victim of sickness and hunger. 
EZK.7.16	Some will escape to the mountains like doves frightened from the valleys. All of them will moan over their sins.
EZK.7.17	Everyone's hands will be weak, and their knees will shake. 
EZK.7.18	They will put on sackcloth and they will tremble all over. Their heads will be shaved, and they will all be disgraced. 
EZK.7.19	They will throw their gold and silver away in the streets like garbage, because neither silver nor gold can save them when the 
EZK.7.20	Once they were proud of their beautiful jewels, but they used them to make disgusting idols. That is why the 
EZK.7.21	“I will let foreigners rob them,” says the 
EZK.7.22	I will not interfere when my treasured Temple is profaned, when robbers break into it and defile it.
EZK.7.23	“Everything is in confusion
EZK.7.24	I will bring the most evil nations here and let them have your homes. Your strongest men will lose their confidence when I let the nations profane the places where you worship. 
EZK.7.25	Despair is coming. You will look for peace and never find it. 
EZK.7.26	One disaster will follow another, and a steady stream of bad news will pour in. You will beg the prophets to reveal what they foresee. The priests will have nothing to teach the people, and the elders will have no advice to give. 
EZK.7.27	The king will mourn, the prince will give up hope, and the people will shake with fear. I will punish you for all you have done, and will judge you in the same way as you have judged others. This will show you that I am the 
EZK.8.1	On the fifth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of our exile, the leaders of the exiles from Judah were sitting in my house with me. Suddenly the power of the Sovereign 
EZK.8.2	 I looked up and saw a vision of a fiery human form. From the waist down his body looked like fire, and from the waist up he was shining like polished bronze. 
EZK.8.3	He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair. Then in this vision God's spirit lifted me high in the air and took me to Jerusalem. He took me to the inner entrance of the north gate of the Temple, where there was an idol that was an outrage to God.
EZK.8.5	God said to me, “Mortal man, look toward the north.” I looked, and there near the altar by the entrance of the gateway I saw the idol that was an outrage to God.
EZK.8.6	God said to me, “Mortal man, do you see what is happening? Look at the disgusting things the people of Israel are doing here, driving me farther and farther away from my holy place. You will see even more disgraceful things than this.”
EZK.8.7	He took me to the entrance of the outer courtyard and showed me a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said, “Mortal man, break through the wall here.” I broke through it and found a door. 
EZK.8.9	He told me, “Go in and look at the evil, disgusting things they are doing there.” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and looked. The walls were covered with drawings of snakes and other unclean animals,
EZK.8.11	Seventy Israelite leaders were there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one was holding an incense burner, and smoke was rising from the incense. 
EZK.8.12	God asked me, “Mortal man, do you see what the Israelite leaders are doing in secret? They are all worshiping in a room full of images. Their excuse is: ‘The 
EZK.8.13	Then the 
EZK.8.14	So he took me to the north gate of the Temple and showed me women weeping over the death of the god Tammuz.
EZK.8.15	He asked, “Mortal man, do you see that? You will see even more disgusting things.” 
EZK.8.16	So he took me to the inner courtyard of the Temple. There near the entrance of the sanctuary, between the altar and the porch, were about twenty-five men. They had turned their backs to the sanctuary and were bowing low toward the east, worshiping the rising sun.
EZK.8.17	The 
EZK.8.18	They will feel all the force of my anger. I will not spare them or show them any mercy. They will shout prayers to me as loud as they can, but I will not listen to them.”
EZK.9.1	Then I heard God shout, “Come here, you men who are going to punish the city. Bring your weapons with you.” 
EZK.9.2	At once six men came from the outer north gate of the Temple, each one carrying a weapon. With them was a man dressed in linen clothes, carrying something to write with. They all came and stood by the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Then the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel rose up from the winged creatures
EZK.9.4	 “Go through the whole city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the forehead of everyone who is distressed and troubled because of all the disgusting things being done in the city.”
EZK.9.5	And I heard God say to the other men, “Follow him through the city and kill. Spare no one; have mercy on no one. 
EZK.9.6	Kill the old men, young men, young women, mothers, and children. But don't touch anyone who has the mark on his forehead. Start here at my Temple.” So they began with the leaders who were standing there at the Temple.
EZK.9.7	God said to them, “Defile the Temple. Fill its courtyards with corpses. Get to work!” So they began to kill the people in the city.
EZK.9.8	While the killing was going on, I was there alone. I threw myself face downward on the ground and shouted, “Sovereign 
EZK.9.9	God answered, “The people of Israel and Judah are guilty of terrible sins. They have committed murder all over the land and have filled Jerusalem with crime. They say that I, the 
EZK.9.10	But I will not have pity on them; I will do to them what they have done to others.”
EZK.9.11	Then the man wearing linen clothes returned and reported to the 
EZK.10.2	 God said to the man wearing linen clothes, “Go between the wheels under the creatures and fill your hands with burning coals. Then scatter the coals over the city.”
EZK.10.2	I watched him go. 
EZK.10.3	The creatures were standing to the south of the Temple when he went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard. 
EZK.10.4	The dazzling light of the 
EZK.10.5	The noise made by the creatures' wings was heard even in the outer courtyard. It sounded like the voice of Almighty God.
EZK.10.6	When the 
EZK.10.7	One of the creatures reached his hand into the fire that was there among them, picked up some coals, and put them in the hands of the man in linen. The man took the coals and left.
EZK.10.8	I saw that each creature had what looked like a human hand under each of its wings. 
EZK.10.9+EZK.10.10	 I also saw that there were four wheels, all alike, one beside each creature. The wheels shone like precious stones, and each one had another wheel which intersected it at right angles. 
EZK.10.11	When the creatures moved, they could go in any direction without turning. They all moved together in the direction they wanted to go, without having to turn around. 
EZK.10.12	 Their bodies, backs, hands, wings, and wheels were covered with eyes. 
EZK.10.13	I heard a voice calling out, “Whirling wheels.”
EZK.10.15	(They were the same creatures that I had seen by the Chebar River.) When the creatures rose in the air 
EZK.10.16	and moved, the wheels went with them. Whenever they spread their wings to fly, the wheels still went with them. 
EZK.10.17	When the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; and when the creatures flew, the wheels went with them, because the creatures controlled them.
EZK.10.18	Then the dazzling light of the 
EZK.10.19	They spread their wings and flew up from the earth while I was watching, and the wheels went with them. They paused at the east gate of the Temple, and the dazzling light was over them. 
EZK.10.20	I recognized them as the same creatures which I had seen beneath the God of Israel at the Chebar River.
EZK.10.21	Each of them had four faces, four wings, and what looked like a human hand under each wing. 
EZK.10.22	Their faces looked exactly like the faces
EZK.11.1	God's spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the Temple. There near the gate I saw twenty-five men, including Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, two leaders of the nation.
EZK.11.2	God said to me, “Mortal man, these men make evil plans and give bad advice in this city. 
EZK.11.3	They say, ‘We will soon be building houses again.
EZK.11.4	Now then, denounce them, mortal man.”
EZK.11.5	The spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You have murdered so many people here in the city that the streets are full of corpses.
EZK.11.7	“So this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.11.8	Are you afraid of swords? I will bring soldiers with swords to attack you. 
EZK.11.9	I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners. I have sentenced you to death, 
EZK.11.10	and you will be killed in battle in your own country. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This city will not protect you the way a pot protects the meat in it. I will punish you wherever you may be in the land of Israel. 
EZK.11.12	You will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	While I was prophesying, Pelatiah dropped dead. I threw myself face downward on the ground and shouted, “No, Sovereign 
EZK.11.14	The 
EZK.11.15	“Mortal man,” he said, “the people who live in Jerusalem are talking about you and those of your nation who are in exile. They say, ‘The exiles are too far away to worship the 
EZK.11.16	“Now tell your fellow exiles what I am saying. I am the one who sent them to live in far-off nations and scattered them in other countries. Yet, for the time being I will be present with them in the lands where they have gone.
EZK.11.17	“So tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.11.18	When they return, they are to get rid of all the filthy, disgusting idols they find. 
EZK.11.19	 I will give them a new heart and a new mind. I will take away their stubborn heart of stone and will give them an obedient heart. 
EZK.11.20	Then they will keep my laws and faithfully obey all my commands. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But I will punish the people who love to worship filthy, disgusting idols. I will punish them for what they have done.” The Sovereign 
EZK.11.23	Then the dazzling light left the city and moved to the mountain east of it. 
EZK.11.24	In the vision the spirit of God lifted me up and brought me back to the exiles in Babylonia. Then the vision faded, 
EZK.11.25	and I told the exiles everything that the 
EZK.12.1	The 
EZK.12.2	 “Mortal man,” he said, “you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes, but they see nothing; they have ears, but they hear nothing, because they are rebellious.
EZK.12.3	“Now, mortal man, pack a bundle just as a refugee would and start out before nightfall. Let everyone see you leaving and going to another place. Maybe those rebels will notice you.
EZK.12.4	While it is still daylight, pack your bundle for exile, so that they can see you, and then let them watch you leave in the evening as if you were going into exile. 
EZK.12.5	While they are watching, break a hole through the wall of your house and take your pack out through it. 
EZK.12.6	Let them watch you putting your pack on your shoulder and going out into the dark with your eyes covered, so that you can't see where you are going. What you do will be a warning to the Israelites.”
EZK.12.7	I did what the 
EZK.12.8	The next morning the 
EZK.12.9	“Mortal man,” he said, “now that those Israelite rebels are asking you what you're doing, 
EZK.12.10	tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.12.11	Tell them that what you have done is a sign of what will happen to them—they will be refugees and captives. 
EZK.12.12	The prince who is ruling them will shoulder his pack in the dark and escape through a hole that they dig for him in the wall. He will cover his eyes and not see where he is going. 
EZK.12.13	 But I will spread out my net and trap him in it. Then I will take him to the city of Babylon, where he will die without having seen it. 
EZK.12.14	I will scatter in every direction all the members of his court and his advisers and bodyguards, and people will search for them to kill them.
EZK.12.15	“When I scatter them among the other nations and in foreign countries, they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	I will let a few of them survive the war, the famine, and the diseases, so that there among the nations they will realize how disgusting their actions have been and will acknowledge that I am the 
EZK.12.17	The 
EZK.12.18	“Mortal man,” he said, “tremble when you eat, and shake with fear when you drink. 
EZK.12.19	Tell the whole nation that this is the message of the Sovereign 
EZK.12.20	Cities that are now full of people will be destroyed, and the country will be made a wilderness. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	The 
EZK.12.22	“Mortal man,” he said, “why do the people of Israel repeat this proverb: ‘Time goes by, and predictions come to nothing’? 
EZK.12.23	Now tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.12.24	“Among the people of Israel there will be no more false visions or misleading prophecies. 
EZK.12.25	I, the 
EZK.12.26	The 
EZK.12.27	“Mortal man, the Israelites think that your visions and prophecies are about the distant future. 
EZK.12.28	So tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.13.1	The 
EZK.13.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce the prophets of Israel who make up their own prophecies. Tell them to listen to the word of the 
EZK.13.3	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.4	People of Israel, your prophets are as useless as foxes living among the ruins of a city. 
EZK.13.5	They don't guard the places where the walls have crumbled, nor do they rebuild the walls, and so Israel cannot be defended when war comes on the day of the 
EZK.13.6	Their visions are false, and their predictions are lies. They claim that they are speaking my message, but I have not sent them. Yet they expect their words to come true! 
EZK.13.7	I tell them: Those visions you see are false, and the predictions you make are lies. You say that they are my words, but I haven't spoken to you!”
EZK.13.8	So the Sovereign 
EZK.13.9	I am about to punish you prophets who have false visions and make misleading predictions. You will not be there when my people gather to make decisions; your names will not be included in the list of the citizens of Israel; you will never return to your land. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.13.11	Tell the prophets that their wall is going to fall down. I will send a pouring rain. Hailstones will fall on it, and a strong wind will blow against it. 
EZK.13.12	The wall will collapse, and everyone will ask you what good the whitewash did.”
EZK.13.13	Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.14	I intend to break down the wall they whitewashed, to shatter it, and to leave the foundation stones bare. It will collapse and kill you all. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	“The wall and those who covered it with whitewash will feel the force of my anger. Then I will tell you that the wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it— 
EZK.13.16	those prophets who assured Jerusalem that all was well, when all was not well!” The Sovereign 
EZK.13.17	The 
EZK.13.18	and tell them what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.18	“You women are doomed! You sew magic wristbands for everyone and make magic scarves for everyone to wear on their heads, so that they can have power over other people's lives. You want to possess the power of life and death over my people and to use it for your own benefit. 
EZK.13.19	You dishonor me in front of my people in order to get a few handfuls of barley and a few pieces of bread. You kill people who don't deserve to die, and you keep people alive who don't deserve to live. So you tell lies to my people, and they believe you.”
EZK.13.20	Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.21	I will rip off your scarves and let my people escape from your power once and for all. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	“By your lies you discourage good people, whom I do not wish to hurt. You prevent evil people from giving up evil and saving their lives. 
EZK.13.23	So now your false visions and misleading predictions are over. I am rescuing my people from your power, so that you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Some of the leaders of the Israelites came to consult me about the 
EZK.14.2	Then the 
EZK.14.3	“Mortal man,” he said, “these men have given their hearts to idols and are letting idols lead them into sin. Do they think I will give them an answer?
EZK.14.4	“Now speak to them and tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.5	All those idols have turned the Israelites away from me, but by my answer I hope to win back their loyalty.
EZK.14.6	“Now then, tell the Israelites what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.7	“Whenever one of you Israelites or one of you foreigners who live in the Israelite community turn away from me and worship idols, and then go to consult a prophet, I, the 
EZK.14.8	I will oppose you. I will make an example of you. I will remove you from the community of my people, so that all of you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	“If any prophets are deceived into giving a false answer, it is because I, the 
EZK.14.10	Both prophets and anyone who consults them will get the same punishment. 
EZK.14.11	I will do this to keep the Israelites from deserting me and defiling themselves by their sins. They are to be my people, and I will be their God.” The Sovereign 
EZK.14.12	The 
EZK.14.13	“Mortal man,” he said, “if a country sins and is unfaithful to me, I will reach out and destroy its supply of food. I will send a famine and kill people and animals alike. 
EZK.14.14	Even if those three men, Noah, Danel,
EZK.14.15	“Or I might send wild animals to kill the people, making the land so dangerous that no one could travel through it, 
EZK.14.16	and even if those three men lived there—as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.17	“Or I might bring war on that country and send destructive weapons to wipe out people and animals alike, 
EZK.14.18	and even if those three men lived there—as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.19	“If I send an epidemic on that country and in my anger take many lives, killing people and animals, 
EZK.14.20	even if Noah, Danel, and Job lived there—as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.22	If some survive and save their children, look at them when they come to you. See how evil they are, and be convinced that the punishment I am bringing on Jerusalem is justified; 
EZK.14.23	then you will know that there was good reason for everything I did.” The Sovereign 
EZK.15.1	The 
EZK.15.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “how does a vine compare with a tree? What good is a branch of a grapevine compared with the trees of the forest? 
EZK.15.3	Can you use it to make anything? Can you even make a peg out of it to hang things on? 
EZK.15.4	It is only good for building a fire. And when the ends are burned up and the middle is charred, can you make anything out of it? 
EZK.15.5	It was useless even before it was burned. Now that the fire has burned it and charred it, it is even more useless.”
EZK.15.6	Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.15.7	and will punish them. They have escaped one fire, but now fire will burn them up. When I punish them, you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	They have been unfaithful to me, and so I will make the country a wilderness.” The Sovereign 
EZK.16.1	The 
EZK.16.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “point out to Jerusalem what disgusting things she has done. 
EZK.16.3	Tell Jerusalem what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.3	“You were born in the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.
EZK.16.4	When you were born, no one cut your umbilical cord or washed you
EZK.16.5	No one took enough pity on you to do any of these things for you. When you were born, no one loved you. You were thrown out in an open field.
EZK.16.6	“Then I passed by and saw you squirming in your own blood. You were covered with blood, but I wouldn't let you die. 
EZK.16.7	I made you grow like a healthy plant. You grew strong and tall and became a young woman.
EZK.16.8	“As I passed by again, I saw that the time had come for you to fall in love. I covered your naked body with my coat and promised to love you. Yes, I made a marriage covenant with you, and you became mine.” This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.9	“Then I took water and washed the blood off you. I rubbed olive oil on your skin. 
EZK.16.10	I dressed you in embroidered gowns and gave you shoes of the best leather, a linen headband, and a silk cloak. 
EZK.16.11	I put jewels on you—bracelets and necklaces. 
EZK.16.12	I gave you a nose ring and earrings and a beautiful crown to wear. 
EZK.16.13	You had ornaments of gold and silver, and you always wore clothes of embroidered linen and silk. You ate bread made from the best flour, and had honey and olive oil to eat. Your beauty was dazzling, and you became a queen. 
EZK.16.14	You became famous in every nation for your perfect beauty, because I was the one who made you so lovely.” This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.15	“But you took advantage of your beauty and fame to sleep with everyone who came along.
EZK.16.16	You used some of your clothes to decorate your places of worship, and just like a prostitute,
EZK.16.17	You took the silver and gold jewelry that I had given you, used it to make male images, and committed adultery with them. 
EZK.16.18	You took the embroidered clothes I gave you and put them on the images, and you offered to the images the olive oil and incense I had given you. 
EZK.16.19	I gave you food—the best flour, olive oil, and honey—but you offered it as a sacrifice to win the favor of idols.” This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.20	“Then you took the sons and the daughters you had borne me and offered them as sacrifices to idols. Wasn't it bad enough to be unfaithful to me, 
EZK.16.21	without taking my children and sacrificing them to idols? 
EZK.16.22	During your disgusting life as a prostitute you never once remembered your childhood—when you were naked, squirming in your own blood.”
EZK.16.23	The Sovereign 
EZK.16.24	by the side of every road you built places to worship idols and practice prostitution. 
EZK.16.25	You dragged your beauty through the mud. You offered yourself to everyone who came by, and you were more of a prostitute every day. 
EZK.16.26	You let your lustful neighbors, the Egyptians, go to bed with you, and you used your prostitution to make me angry.
EZK.16.27	“Now I have raised my hand to punish you and to take away your share of my blessing. I have handed you over to the Philistines, who hate you and are disgusted with your immoral actions.
EZK.16.28	“Because you were not satisfied by the others, you went running after the Assyrians. You were their prostitute, but they didn't satisfy you either. 
EZK.16.29	You were also a prostitute for the Babylonians, that nation of merchants, but they didn't satisfy you either.”
EZK.16.30	This
EZK.16.31	On every street you built places to worship idols and practice prostitution. But you are not out for money like a common prostitute. 
EZK.16.32	You are like a woman who commits adultery with strangers instead of loving her husband. 
EZK.16.33	A prostitute is paid, but you gave presents to all your lovers and bribed them to come from everywhere to sleep with you. 
EZK.16.34	You are a special kind of prostitute. No one forced you to become one. You didn't get paid; you paid them! Yes, you are different.”
EZK.16.35	Now then, Jerusalem, you whore! Hear what the 
EZK.16.36	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.37	Because of this I will bring all your former lovers together—the ones you liked and the ones you hated. I will bring them around you in a circle, and then I will strip off your clothes and let them see you naked. 
EZK.16.38	I will condemn you for adultery and murder, and in my anger and fury I will punish you with death. 
EZK.16.39	I will put you in their power, and they will tear down the places where you engage in prostitution and worship idols. They will take away your clothes and jewels and leave you completely naked.
EZK.16.40	“They will stir up a crowd to stone you, and they will cut you to pieces with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn your houses down and let crowds of women see your punishment. I will make you stop being a prostitute and make you stop giving gifts to your lovers. 
EZK.16.42	Then my anger will be over, and I will be calm. I will not be angry or jealous any more. 
EZK.16.43	You have forgotten how I treated you when you were young, and you have made me angry by all the things you did. That is why I have made you pay for them all. Why did you add sexual immorality to all the other disgusting things you did?” The Sovereign 
EZK.16.44	The 
EZK.16.45	You really are your mother's daughter. She detested her husband and her children. You are like your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. You and your sister cities had a Hittite mother and an Amorite
EZK.16.46	“Your older sister, with her villages, is Samaria, in the north. Your younger sister, with her villages, is Sodom, in the south. 
EZK.16.47	Were you satisfied to follow in their footsteps and copy their disgusting actions? No, in only a little while you were acting worse than they were in everything you did.
EZK.16.48	“As surely as I am the living God,” the Sovereign 
EZK.16.49	She and her daughters were proud because they had plenty to eat and lived in peace and quiet, but they did not take care of the poor and the underprivileged. 
EZK.16.50	They were proud and stubborn and did the things that I hate, so I destroyed them, as you well know.
EZK.16.51	“Samaria did not sin half as much as you have. You have acted more disgustingly than she ever did. Your corruption makes your sisters look innocent by comparison. 
EZK.16.52	And now you will have to endure your disgrace. Your sins are so much worse than those of your sisters that they look innocent beside you. Now blush and bear your shame, because you make your sisters look pure.”
EZK.16.53	The 
EZK.16.54	You will be ashamed of yourself, and your disgrace will show your sisters how well-off they are. 
EZK.16.55	They will become prosperous again, and you and your villages will also be restored. 
EZK.16.56	Didn't you joke about Sodom in those days when you were proud 
EZK.16.57	and before the evil you did had been exposed? Now you are just like her—a joke to the Edomites, the Philistines, and your other neighbors who hate you. 
EZK.16.58	You must suffer for the obscene, disgusting things you have done.” The 
EZK.16.59	The Sovereign 
EZK.16.60	But I will honor the covenant I made with you when you were young, and I will make a covenant with you that will last forever. 
EZK.16.61	You will remember how you have acted, and be ashamed of it when you get your older sister and your younger sister back. I will let them be like daughters to you, even though this was not part of my covenant with you. 
EZK.16.62	I will renew my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	I will forgive all the wrongs you have done, but you will remember them and be too ashamed to open your mouth.” The Sovereign 
EZK.17.1	The 
EZK.17.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “tell the Israelites a parable 
EZK.17.3	to let them know what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.17.4	which he carried to a land of commerce and placed in a city of merchants. 
EZK.17.5	Then he took a young plant from the land of Israel and planted it in a fertile field,
EZK.17.6	The plant sprouted and became a low, wide-spreading grapevine. The branches grew upward toward the eagle, and the roots grew deep. The vine was covered with branches and leaves.
EZK.17.7	“There was another giant eagle with huge wings and thick plumage. And now the vine sent its roots toward him and turned its leaves toward him, in the hope that he would give it more water than there was in the garden where it was growing.
EZK.17.8	But the vine had already been planted in a fertile, well-watered field so that it could grow leaves and bear grapes and be a magnificent vine.
EZK.17.9	“So I, the Sovereign 
EZK.17.10	Yes, it is planted, but will it live and grow? Won't it wither when the east wind strikes it? Won't it wither there where it is growing?”
EZK.17.11	The 
EZK.17.12	 “Ask these rebels if they know what the parable means. Tell them that the king of Babylonia came to Jerusalem and took the king and his officials back with him to Babylonia. 
EZK.17.13	He took one of the king's family, made a treaty with him, and made him swear to be loyal. He took important men as hostages 
EZK.17.14	to keep the nation from rising again and to make sure that the treaty would be kept. 
EZK.17.15	But the king of Judah rebelled and sent agents to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can he get away with that? He cannot break the treaty and go unpunished!
EZK.17.16	“As surely as I am the living God,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.17.17	Even the powerful army of the king of Egypt will not be able to help him fight when the Babylonians build earthworks and dig trenches in order to kill many people. 
EZK.17.18	He broke his oath and the treaty he had made. He did all these things, and now he will not escape.”
EZK.17.19	The Sovereign 
EZK.17.20	I will spread out a hunter's net and catch him in it. I will take him to Babylonia and punish him there, because he was unfaithful to me. 
EZK.17.21	His best soldiers will be killed in battle, and the survivors will be scattered in every direction. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.17.22	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.17.22	“I will take the top of a tall cedar
EZK.17.22	and break off a tender sprout;
EZK.17.22	I will plant it on a high mountain,
EZK.17.23	on Israel's highest mountain.
EZK.17.23	It will grow branches and bear seed
EZK.17.23	and become a magnificent cedar.
EZK.17.23	Birds of every kind will live there
EZK.17.23	and find shelter in its shade.
EZK.17.24	All the trees in the land will know
EZK.17.24	that I am the 
EZK.17.24	I cut down the tall trees
EZK.17.24	and make small trees grow tall.
EZK.17.24	I wither up the green trees
EZK.17.24	and make the dry trees become green.
EZK.17.24	I, the 
EZK.18.1	The 
EZK.18.2	 and said, “What is this proverb people keep repeating in the land of Israel?
EZK.18.2	‘The parents ate the sour grapes,
EZK.18.2	But the children got the sour taste.’
EZK.18.3	“As surely as I am the living God,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.4	The life of every person belongs to me, the life of the parent as well as that of the child. The person who sins is the one who will die.
EZK.18.5	“Suppose there is a truly good man, righteous and honest. 
EZK.18.6	He doesn't worship the idols of the Israelites or eat the sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines. He doesn't seduce another man's wife or have intercourse with a woman during her period. 
EZK.18.7	He doesn't cheat or rob anyone. He returns what a borrower gives him as security; he feeds the hungry and gives clothing to the naked. 
EZK.18.8	He doesn't lend money for profit. He refuses to do evil and gives an honest decision in any dispute. 
EZK.18.9	 Such a man obeys my commands and carefully keeps my laws. He is righteous, and he will live,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.10	“Then suppose this man has a son who robs and kills, who does any
EZK.18.11	that the father never did. He eats sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines and seduces other men's wives. 
EZK.18.12	He cheats the poor, he robs, he keeps what a borrower gives him as security. He goes to pagan shrines, worships disgusting idols, 
EZK.18.13	and lends money for profit. Will he live? No, he will not. He has done all these disgusting things, and so he will die. He will be to blame for his own death.
EZK.18.14	“Now suppose this second man has a son. He sees all the sins his father practiced, but does not follow his example. 
EZK.18.15	He doesn't worship the idols of the Israelites or eat the sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines. He doesn't seduce another man's wife 
EZK.18.16	or oppress anyone or rob anyone. He returns what a borrower gives him as security. He feeds the hungry and gives clothing to the naked. 
EZK.18.17	He refuses to do evil
EZK.18.18	His father, on the other hand, cheated and robbed
EZK.18.19	“But you ask, ‘Why shouldn't the son suffer because of his father's sins?’ The answer is that the son did what was right and good. He kept my laws and followed them carefully, and so he will certainly live. 
EZK.18.20	 It is the one who sins who will die. A son is not to suffer because of his father's sins, nor a father because of the sins of his son. Good people will be rewarded for doing good, and evil people will suffer for the evil they do.
EZK.18.21	“If someone evil stops sinning and keeps my laws, if he does what is right and good, he will not die; he will certainly live. 
EZK.18.22	All his sins will be forgiven, and he will live, because he did what is right. 
EZK.18.23	Do you think I enjoy seeing evil people die?” asks the Sovereign 
EZK.18.24	“But if a righteous person stops doing good and starts doing all the evil, disgusting things that evil people do, will he go on living? No! None of the good he did will be remembered. He will die because of his unfaithfulness and his sins.
EZK.18.25	“But you say, ‘What the Lord does isn't right.’ Listen to me, you Israelites. Do you think my way of doing things isn't right? It is your way that isn't right. 
EZK.18.26	When a righteous person stops doing good and starts doing evil and then dies, he dies because of the evil he has done. 
EZK.18.27	When someone evil stops sinning and does what is right and good, he saves his life. 
EZK.18.28	He realizes what he is doing and stops sinning, so he will certainly not die, but go on living. 
EZK.18.29	And you Israelites say, ‘What the Lord does isn't right.’ You think my way isn't right, do you? It is your way that isn't right.
EZK.18.30	“Now I, the Sovereign 
EZK.18.31	Give up all the evil you have been doing, and get yourselves new minds and hearts. Why do you Israelites want to die? 
EZK.18.32	 I do not want anyone to die,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.19.1	The 
EZK.19.2	What a lioness your mother was!
EZK.19.2	She raised her cubs among the fierce male lions.
EZK.19.3	She raised a cub and taught him to hunt;
EZK.19.3	he learned to eat people.
EZK.19.4	The nations heard about him
EZK.19.4	and trapped him in a pit.
EZK.19.4	With hooks they dragged him off to Egypt.
EZK.19.5	She waited until she saw all hope was gone.
EZK.19.5	Then she raised another of her cubs,
EZK.19.5	and he grew into a fierce lion.
EZK.19.6	When he was full-grown,
EZK.19.6	he prowled with the other lions.
EZK.19.6	He too learned to hunt and eat people.
EZK.19.7	He wrecked forts,
EZK.19.7	The people of the land were terrified
EZK.19.7	every time he roared.
EZK.19.8	The nations gathered to fight him;
EZK.19.8	people came from everywhere.
EZK.19.8	They spread their hunting nets
EZK.19.8	and caught him in their trap.
EZK.19.9	They put him in a cage
EZK.19.9	and took him to the king of Babylonia.
EZK.19.9	They kept him under guard,
EZK.19.9	so that his roar would never be heard again
EZK.19.9	on the hills of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like a grapevine
EZK.19.10	planted near a stream.
EZK.19.10	Because there was plenty of water,
EZK.19.10	the vine was covered with leaves and fruit.
EZK.19.11	Its branches were strong
EZK.19.11	and grew to be royal scepters.
EZK.19.11	The vine grew tall enough to reach the clouds;
EZK.19.11	everyone saw how leafy and tall it was.
EZK.19.12	But angry hands pulled it up by the roots
EZK.19.12	and threw it to the ground.
EZK.19.12	The east wind dried up its fruit.
EZK.19.12	Its branches were broken off;
EZK.19.12	they dried up and were burned.
EZK.19.13	Now it is planted in the desert,
EZK.19.13	in a dry and waterless land.
EZK.19.14	The stem of the vine caught fire;
EZK.19.14	fire burned up its branches and fruit.
EZK.19.14	The branches will never again be strong,
EZK.19.14	will never be royal scepters.
EZK.19.14	This is a song of sorrow; it has been sung again and again.
EZK.20.1	It was the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year of our exile. Some of the leaders of the Israelite community came to consult me about the 
EZK.20.2	Then the 
EZK.20.3	“Mortal man,” he said, “speak to these leaders and tell them that the Sovereign 
EZK.20.4	“Are you ready to pass sentence on them, mortal man? Then do so. Remind them of the disgusting things their ancestors did. 
EZK.20.5	 Tell them what I am saying. When I chose Israel, I made them a promise. I revealed myself to them in Egypt and told them: I am the 
EZK.20.6	It was then that I promised to take them out of Egypt and lead them to a land I had chosen for them, a rich and fertile land, the finest land of all. 
EZK.20.7	I told them to throw away the disgusting idols they loved and not to make themselves unclean with the false gods of Egypt, because I am the 
EZK.20.8	But they defied me and refused to listen. They did not throw away their disgusting idols or give up the Egyptian gods. I was ready to let them feel the full force of my anger there in Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name, for in the presence of the people among whom they were living I had announced to Israel that I was going to lead them out of Egypt.
EZK.20.10	“And so I led them out of Egypt into the desert. 
EZK.20.11	 I gave them my commands and taught them my laws, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. 
EZK.20.12	 I made the keeping of the Sabbath a sign of the agreement between us, to remind them that I, the 
EZK.20.13	But even in the desert they defied me. They broke my laws and rejected my commands, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. They completely profaned the Sabbath. I was ready to let them feel the force of my anger there in the desert and to destroy them. 
EZK.20.14	But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name among the nations which had seen me lead Israel out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.15	 So I made a vow in the desert that I would not take them to the land I had given them, a rich and fertile land, the finest land of all. 
EZK.20.16	I made the vow because they had rejected my commands, broken my laws, and profaned the Sabbath—they preferred to worship their idols.
EZK.20.17	“But then I took pity on them. I decided not to kill them there in the desert. 
EZK.20.18	Instead, I warned the young people among them: Do not keep the laws your ancestors made; do not follow their customs or defile yourselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	Make the Sabbath a holy day, so that it will be a sign of the covenant we made, and will remind you that I am the 
EZK.20.21	“But that generation also defied me. They broke my laws and did not keep my commands, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. They profaned the Sabbath. I was ready to let them feel the force of my anger there in the desert and to kill them all. 
EZK.20.22	But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name among the nations which had seen me bring Israel out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.23	 So I made another vow in the desert. I vowed that I would scatter them all over the world. 
EZK.20.24	I did this because they had rejected my commands, broken my laws, profaned the Sabbath, and worshiped the same idols their ancestors had served.
EZK.20.25	“Then I gave them laws that are not good and commands that do not bring life. 
EZK.20.26	I let them defile themselves with their own offerings, and I let them sacrifice their first-born sons. This was to punish them and show them that I am the 
EZK.20.27	“Now then, mortal man, tell the Israelites what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.20.28	I brought them to the land I had promised to give them. When they saw the high hills and green trees, they offered sacrifices at all of them. They made me angry by the sacrifices they burned and by the wine they brought as offerings. 
EZK.20.29	I asked them: What are these high places where you go? So they have been called ‘High Places’
EZK.20.30	Now tell the Israelites what I am saying: Why must you commit the same sins your ancestors did and go running after their idols? 
EZK.20.31	Even today you offer the same gifts and defile yourselves with the same idols by sacrificing your children to them in the fire. And then you Israelites still come to ask what my will is! As surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.20.32	You have made up your minds that you want to be like the other nations, like the people who live in other countries and worship trees and rocks. But that will never be.
EZK.20.33	“As surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.20.34	I will show you my power and my anger when I gather you together and bring you back from all the countries where you have been scattered. 
EZK.20.35	I will bring you into the ‘Desert of the Nations,’ and there I will condemn you to your face. 
EZK.20.36	I will now condemn you just as I condemned your ancestors in the Sinai Desert,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.20.37	“I will take firm control of you and make you obey my covenant. 
EZK.20.38	I will take away from among you those who are rebellious and sinful. I will take them out of the lands where they are living now, but I will not let them return to the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	The Sovereign 
EZK.20.40	There in the land, on my holy mountain,
EZK.20.41	After I bring you out of the countries where you have been scattered and gather you together, I will accept the sacrifices that you burn, and the nations will see that I am holy. 
EZK.20.42	When I bring you back to Israel, the land that I promised I would give to your ancestors, then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	Then you will remember all the disgraceful things you did and how you defiled yourselves. You will be disgusted with yourselves because of all the evil things you did. 
EZK.20.44	When I act to protect my honor, you Israelites will know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	The 
EZK.20.46	“Mortal man,” he said, “look toward the south. Speak against the south and prophesy against the forest of the south. 
EZK.20.47	Tell the southern forest to hear what the Sovereign 
EZK.20.48	They will all see that I, the 
EZK.20.49	But I protested, “Sovereign 
EZK.21.1	The 
EZK.21.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce Jerusalem. Denounce the places where people worship. Warn the land of Israel 
EZK.21.3	that I, the 
EZK.21.4	I will use my sword against everyone from south to north. 
EZK.21.5	Everyone will know that I, the 
EZK.21.6	“Mortal man, groan as if your heart is breaking with despair. Groan in sorrow where everyone can watch you. 
EZK.21.7	When they ask you why you are groaning, tell them it is because of the news that is coming. When it comes, their hearts will be filled with fear, their hands will hang limp, their courage will fail, and their knees will tremble. The time has come; it is here.” The Sovereign 
EZK.21.8	The 
EZK.21.9	“Mortal man, prophesy. Tell the people what I, the Lord, am saying:
EZK.21.9	A sword, a sword is sharpened and polished.
EZK.21.10	It is sharpened to kill,
EZK.21.10	polished to flash like lightning.
EZK.21.10	There can be no rejoicing,
EZK.21.10	for my people have disregarded every warning and punishment.
EZK.21.11	The sword is being polished,
EZK.21.11	to make it ready for use.
EZK.21.11	It is sharpened and polished,
EZK.21.11	to be put in the hands of a killer.
EZK.21.12	Howl in grief, mortal man;
EZK.21.12	this sword is meant for my people
EZK.21.12	and for all the leaders of Israel.
EZK.21.12	They are going to be killed
EZK.21.12	with all the rest of my people.
EZK.21.12	Beat your breast in despair!
EZK.21.13	I am testing my people,
EZK.21.13	and if they refuse to repent,
EZK.21.13	all these things will happen to them.
EZK.21.14	“Now, mortal man, prophesy. Clap your hands, and the sword will strike again and again. It is a sword that kills, a sword that terrifies
EZK.21.15	It makes my people lose courage and stumble. I am threatening their city with a sword
EZK.21.16	Cut to the right and the left, you sharp sword! Cut wherever you turn.
EZK.21.17	I also will clap my hands, and my anger will be over. I, the 
EZK.21.18	The 
EZK.21.19	“Mortal man,” he said, “mark out two roads by which the king of Babylonia can come with his sword. Both of them are to start in the same country. Put up a signpost where the roads fork.
EZK.21.20	One will show the king the way to the Ammonite city of Rabbah, and the other the way to Judah, to the fortified city, Jerusalem. 
EZK.21.21	The king of Babylonia stands by the signpost at the fork of the road. To discover which way to go, he shakes the arrows;
EZK.21.22	Now! His right hand holds the arrow marked ‘Jerusalem’! It tells him to go and set up battering rams, to shout the battle cry, to place battering rams against the gates, to throw up earthworks, and to dig trenches. 
EZK.21.23	The people of Jerusalem won't believe this because of the treaties they have made. But this prediction is to remind them of their sins and to warn them that they will be captured. 
EZK.21.24	This then is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.21.25	“You wicked, unholy ruler of Israel, your day, the day of your final punishment, is coming. 
EZK.21.26	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.21.27	Ruin, ruin! Yes, I will make the city a ruin. But this will not happen until the one comes whom I have chosen to punish the city. To him I will give it.
EZK.21.28	‘A sword is ready to destroy;
EZK.21.28	It is polished to kill, to flash like lightning.
EZK.21.29	The visions that you see are false, and the predictions you make are lies. You are wicked and evil, and your day is coming, the day of your final punishment. The sword is going to fall on your necks.
EZK.21.30	“‘Put up the sword! I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land where you were born. 
EZK.21.31	You will feel my anger when I turn it loose on you like a blazing fire. And I will hand you over to brutal men, experts at destruction. 
EZK.21.32	You will be destroyed by fire. Your blood will be shed in your own country, and no one will remember you any more.’” The 
EZK.22.1	The 
EZK.22.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “are you ready to judge the city that is full of murderers? Make clear to her all the disgusting things she has done. 
EZK.22.3	Tell the city what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.22.4	You are guilty of those murders and are defiled by the idols you made, and so your day is coming, your time is up! That is why I have let the nations make fun of you and all the countries sneer at you. 
EZK.22.5	Countries nearby and countries far away sneer at you because of your lawlessness. 
EZK.22.6	All Israel's leaders trust in their own strength and commit murder. 
EZK.22.7	 None of you in the city honor your parents. You cheat foreigners and take advantage of widows and orphans. 
EZK.22.8	 You have no respect for the holy places, and you don't keep the Sabbath. 
EZK.22.9	Some of your people tell lies about others in order to have them put to death. Some of them eat sacrifices offered to idols. Some are always satisfying their lusts. 
EZK.22.10	 Some of them sleep with their father's wife. Some force women to have intercourse with them during their period. 
EZK.22.11	Some commit adultery, and others seduce their daughters-in-law or their half sisters. 
EZK.22.12	 Some of your people murder for pay. Some charge interest on the loans they make to other Israelites and get rich by taking advantage of them. They have forgotten me.” The Sovereign 
EZK.22.13	“I will bring my fist down on your robberies and murders. 
EZK.22.14	Do you think you will have any courage left or have strength enough to lift your hand when I am finished with you? I, the 
EZK.22.15	I will scatter your people to every country and nation and will put an end to your evil actions. 
EZK.22.16	And so the other nations will dishonor you, but you will know that I am the 
EZK.22.17	The 
EZK.22.18	“Mortal man, the Israelites are of no use to me. They are like waste metal—copper, tin, iron, and lead—left over after silver has been refined in a furnace. 
EZK.22.19	So now I, the Sovereign 
EZK.22.20	in the same way that the ore of silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin is put in a refining furnace. My anger and rage will melt them the way fire melts ore. 
EZK.22.21	Yes, I will gather them in Jerusalem, build a fire under them, and melt them with my anger. 
EZK.22.22	They will be melted in Jerusalem the way silver is melted in a furnace, and then they will know that they are feeling the anger of the 
EZK.22.23	The 
EZK.22.24	“Mortal man,” he said, “tell the Israelites that their land is unholy, and so I am punishing it in my anger. 
EZK.22.25	The leaders
EZK.22.26	 The priests break my law and have no respect for what is holy. They make no distinction between what is holy and what is not. They do not teach the difference between clean and unclean things, and they ignore the Sabbath. As a result the people of Israel do not respect me. 
EZK.22.27	The government officials are like wolves tearing apart the animals they have killed. They commit murder in order to get rich. 
EZK.22.28	The prophets have hidden these sins like workers covering a wall with whitewash. They see false visions and make false predictions. They claim to speak the word of the Sovereign 
EZK.22.29	The wealthy cheat and rob. They mistreat the poor and take advantage of foreigners. 
EZK.22.30	I looked for someone who could build a wall, who could stand in the places where the walls have crumbled and defend the land when my anger is about to destroy it, but I could find no one. 
EZK.22.31	So I will turn my anger loose on them, and like a fire I will destroy them for what they have done.” The Sovereign 
EZK.23.1	The 
EZK.23.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “there were once two sisters. 
EZK.23.3	When they were young, living in Egypt, they lost their virginity and became prostitutes. 
EZK.23.4	The older one was named Oholah
EZK.23.5	Although she was mine, Oholah continued to be a prostitute and was full of lust for her lovers from Assyria. 
EZK.23.6	They were soldiers in uniforms of purple, noblemen and high-ranking officers; all of them were handsome young cavalry officers. 
EZK.23.7	She was the whore for all the Assyrian officers, and her lust led her to defile herself by worshiping Assyrian idols. 
EZK.23.8	She continued what she had begun as a prostitute in Egypt, where she lost her virginity. From the time she was a young woman, men slept with her and treated her like a prostitute. 
EZK.23.9	So I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers whom she wanted so much. 
EZK.23.10	They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters, and then killed her with a sword. Women everywhere gossiped about her fate.
EZK.23.11	“Even though her sister Oholibah saw this, she was wilder and more of a prostitute than Oholah had ever been. 
EZK.23.12	She too was full of lust for the Assyrian noblemen and officers—soldiers in bright uniforms—and for the cavalry officers, all of those handsome young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she was completely immoral, that the second sister was as bad as the first.
EZK.23.14+EZK.23.15	“She sank deeper and deeper in her immorality. She was attracted by the images of high Babylonian officials carved into the wall and painted bright red, with sashes around their waists and fancy turbans on their heads. 
EZK.23.16	As soon as she saw them, she was filled with lust and sent messengers to them in Babylonia. 
EZK.23.17	The Babylonians came to have sex with her. They used her and defiled her so much that finally she became disgusted with them. 
EZK.23.18	She exposed herself publicly and let everyone know she was a whore. I was as disgusted with her as I had been with her sister. 
EZK.23.19	She became more of a prostitute than ever, acting the way she did as a young woman, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	She was filled with lust for oversexed men who had all the lustfulness of donkeys or stallions.” ( 
EZK.23.21	Oholibah, you wanted to repeat the immorality you were guilty of as a young woman in Egypt, where men played with your breasts and you lost your virginity.)
EZK.23.22	“Now then, Oholibah, this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.23.23	I will bring all the Babylonians and Chaldeans, men from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians. I will gather all those handsome young noblemen and officers, all those important officials and high-ranking cavalry officers. 
EZK.23.24	They will attack you from the north,
EZK.23.25	Because I am angry with you, I will let them deal with you in their anger. They will cut off your nose and your ears and kill your children. Yes, they will take your sons and daughters from you and burn them alive. 
EZK.23.26	They will tear off your clothes and take your jewels. 
EZK.23.27	I will put a stop to your lust and to the obscenities you have committed ever since you were in Egypt. You won't look at any more idols or think about Egypt any more.”
EZK.23.28	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.29	And because they hate you, they will take away everything you have worked for and leave you stripped naked, exposed like a prostitute. Your lust and your prostitution 
EZK.23.30	have brought this on you. You were a prostitute for the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You followed in your sister's footsteps, and so I will give you the same cup of punishment to drink.”
EZK.23.32	The Sovereign 
EZK.23.32	“You will drink from your sister's cup;
EZK.23.32	it is large and deep.
EZK.23.32	Everyone will scorn and mock you;
EZK.23.32	the cup is full.
EZK.23.33	It will make you miserable and drunk,
EZK.23.33	that cup of fear and ruin,
EZK.23.33	your sister Samaria's cup.
EZK.23.34	You will drink and drain it dry,
EZK.23.34	and with its broken pieces
EZK.23.34	tear your breast.
EZK.23.34	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.23.35	Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	They have committed adultery and murder—adultery with idols and murder of the children they bore me. They sacrificed my children to their idols. 
EZK.23.38	And that is not all they did. They profaned my Temple and broke the Sabbath, which I had established. 
EZK.23.39	The very day that they killed my children as sacrifices to idols, they came to my Temple and profaned it!
EZK.23.40	“Again and again they sent messengers to invite men to come from a great distance, and the men came. The two sisters would bathe and put on eye shadow and jewelry. 
EZK.23.41	They would sit on a beautiful couch, and in front of them they would have a table covered with good things, including the incense and the olive oil that I had given them. 
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree crowd could be heard, a group of men brought in from the desert. They put bracelets on the women's arms and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
EZK.23.43	And I said to myself that they were using as a prostitute a woman worn out by adultery.
EZK.23.44	They went back to these prostitutes again and again. They went back to Oholah and Oholibah, those immoral women. 
EZK.23.45	Righteous men will condemn them on the charge of adultery and murder, because they practice adultery and their hands are stained with blood.”
EZK.23.46	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.47	Let the mob stone them and attack them with swords, kill their children, and burn down their houses. 
EZK.23.48	Throughout the land I will put a stop to immorality, as a warning to every woman not to commit adultery as they did. 
EZK.23.49	And you two sisters—I will punish you for your immorality and your sin of worshiping idols. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.24.1	On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of our exile, the 
EZK.24.2	 “Mortal man,” he said, “write down today's date, because this is the day that the king of Babylonia is beginning the siege of Jerusalem. 
EZK.24.3	Tell my rebellious people this parable that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.24.3	Set the pot on the fire
EZK.24.3	and fill it up with water.
EZK.24.4	Put in the best pieces of meat—
EZK.24.4	the shoulders and the legs—
EZK.24.4	fill it with choice bony pieces too.
EZK.24.5	Use the meat of the finest sheep;
EZK.24.5	pile the wood
EZK.24.5	Let the water boil;
EZK.24.5	boil the bones and the meat.”
EZK.24.6	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.7	There was murder in the city, but the blood was not spilled on the ground where the dust could hide it; it was spilled on a bare rock. 
EZK.24.8	I have left the blood there, where it cannot be hidden, where it demands angry revenge.”
EZK.24.9	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.10	Bring more wood! Fan the flames! Cook the meat! Boil away the broth!
EZK.24.11	Now set the empty bronze pot on the coals and let it get red-hot. Then the pot will be ritually pure again after the corrosion is burned off, 
EZK.24.12	although all that corrosion will not disappear in the flames.
EZK.24.13	Jerusalem, your immoral actions have defiled you. Although I tried to purify you, you remained defiled. You will not be pure again until you have felt the full force of my anger. 
EZK.24.14	I, the 
EZK.24.15	The 
EZK.24.16	“Mortal man,” he said, “with one blow I am going to take away the person you love most. You are not to complain or cry or shed any tears. 
EZK.24.17	Don't let your sobbing be heard. Do not go bareheaded or barefoot as a sign of mourning. Don't cover your face or eat the food that mourners eat.”
EZK.24.18	Early in the day I was talking with the people. That evening my wife died, and the next day I did as I had been told. 
EZK.24.19	The people asked me, “Why are you acting like this?”
EZK.24.20	So I said to them, “The 
EZK.24.21	to give you Israelites this message: You are proud of the strength of the Temple. You like to look at it and to visit it, but the 
EZK.24.22	Then you will do what I have done. You will not cover your faces or eat the food that mourners eat. 
EZK.24.23	You will not go bareheaded or barefoot or mourn or cry. You will waste away because of your sins, and you will groan to one another. 
EZK.24.24	Then I will be a sign to you; you will do everything I have done. The 
EZK.24.25	The 
EZK.24.26	On the day that I do this, some who escape the destruction will come and tell you about it. 
EZK.24.27	That same day you will get back the power of speech which you had lost, and you will talk with them. In this way you will be a sign to the people, and they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce the country of Ammon. 
EZK.25.3	Tell them to listen to what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.25.4	Because you were glad, I will let the tribes from the eastern desert conquer you. They will set up their camps in your country and settle there. They will eat the fruit and drink the milk that should have been yours. 
EZK.25.5	I will turn the city of Rabbah into a place to keep camels, and the whole country of Ammon will become a place to keep sheep, so that you will know I am the 
EZK.25.6	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.7	Because you did, I will hand you over to other nations who will rob you and plunder you. I will destroy you so completely that you will not be a nation any more or have a country of your own. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.25.9	I will let the cities that defend the border of Moab be attacked, including even the finest cities—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim. 
EZK.25.10	I will let the tribes of the eastern desert conquer Moab, together with Ammon, so that Moab
EZK.25.11	I will punish Moab, and they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.13	Now I announce that I will punish Edom and kill every person and animal there. I will make it a wasteland, from the city of Teman to the city of Dedan, and the people will be killed in battle. 
EZK.25.14	My people Israel will take revenge on Edom for me, and they will make Edom feel my furious anger. Edom will know what it means to be the object of my revenge.” The Sovereign 
EZK.25.16	And so I am announcing that I will attack the Philistines and wipe them out. I will destroy everyone left living there on the Philistine Plain. 
EZK.25.17	I will punish them severely and take full revenge on them. They will feel my anger. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.26.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “this is what the people in the city of Tyre are cheering about. They shout, ‘Jerusalem is shattered! Her commercial power is gone! She won't be our rival any more!’
EZK.26.3	“Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.26.4	They will destroy your city walls and tear down your towers. Then I will sweep away all the dust and leave only a bare rock. 
EZK.26.5	Fishermen will dry their nets on it, there where it stands in the sea. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.26.6	and with their swords they will kill those who live in her towns on the mainland. Then Tyre will know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	The Sovereign 
EZK.26.8	Those who live in the towns on the mainland will be killed in the fighting. The enemy will dig trenches, build earthworks, and make a solid wall of shields against you. 
EZK.26.9	They will pound in your walls with battering rams and tear down your towers with iron bars. 
EZK.26.10	The clouds of dust raised by their horses will cover you. The noise of their horses pulling wagons and chariots will shake your walls as they pass through the gates of the ruined city. 
EZK.26.11	Their cavalry will storm through your streets, killing your people with their swords. Your mighty pillars will be thrown to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	Your enemies will help themselves to your wealth and merchandise. They will pull down your walls and shatter your luxurious houses. They will take the stones and wood and all the rubble, and dump them into the sea. 
EZK.26.13	 I will put an end to all your songs, and I will silence the music of your harps. 
EZK.26.14	I will leave only a bare rock where fishermen can dry their nets. The city will never be rebuilt. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.26.15	The Sovereign 
EZK.26.16	 All the kings of the seafaring nations will come down from their thrones. They will take off their robes and their embroidered clothes and sit trembling on the ground. They will be so terrified at your fate that they will not be able to stop trembling. 
EZK.26.17	They will sing this funeral song for you:
EZK.26.17	The famous city is destroyed!
EZK.26.17	Her ships have been swept
EZK.26.17	The people of this city ruled the seas
EZK.26.17	And terrified all who lived on the coast.
EZK.26.18	Now, on the day it has fallen,
EZK.26.18	The islands are trembling,
EZK.26.18	And their people are shocked at such destruction.”
EZK.26.19	The Sovereign 
EZK.26.20	I will send you down to the world of the dead to join the people who lived in ancient times. I will make you stay in that underground world among eternal ruins, keeping company with the dead. As a result you will never again be inhabited and take your place
EZK.26.21	 I will make you a terrifying example, and that will be the end of you. People may look for you, but you will never be found.” The Sovereign 
EZK.27.1	The 
EZK.27.2	“Mortal man, sing a funeral song for Tyre, 
EZK.27.3	that city which stands at the edge of the sea and does business with the people living on every seacoast. Tell her what the Sovereign 
EZK.27.3	“Tyre, you boasted of your perfect beauty.
EZK.27.4	Your home is the sea.
EZK.27.4	Your builders made you like a beautiful ship;
EZK.27.5	They used fir trees from Mount Hermon for timber
EZK.27.5	And a cedar from Lebanon for your mast.
EZK.27.6	They took oak trees from Bashan to make oars;
EZK.27.6	They made your deck out of pine from Cyprus
EZK.27.6	And inlaid it with ivory.
EZK.27.7	Your sails were made of linen,
EZK.27.7	Embroidered linen from Egypt,
EZK.27.7	Easily recognized from afar.
EZK.27.7	Your awnings were made of finest cloth,
EZK.27.7	Of purple from the island of Cyprus.
EZK.27.8	Your oarsmen were from the cities of Sidon and Arvad.
EZK.27.8	Your own skillful men were the sailors.
EZK.27.9	The ship's carpenters
EZK.27.9	Were well-trained men from Byblos.
EZK.27.9	Sailors from every seagoing ship
EZK.27.9	Did business in your shops.
EZK.27.10	“Soldiers from Persia, Lydia, and Libya served in your army. They hung their shields and their helmets in your barracks. They are the men who won glory for you. 
EZK.27.11	Soldiers from Arvad guarded your walls, and troops from Gamad guarded your towers. They hung their shields on your walls. They are the ones who made you beautiful.
EZK.27.12	“You did business in Spain and took silver, iron, tin, and lead in payment for your abundant goods. 
EZK.27.13	You did business in Greece, Tubal, and Meshech and traded your goods for slaves and for articles of bronze. 
EZK.27.14	You sold your goods for workhorses, war-horses, and mules from Beth Togarmah. 
EZK.27.15	The people of Rhodes
EZK.27.16	The people of Syria bought your merchandise and your many products. They gave emeralds, purple cloth, embroidery, fine linen, coral, and rubies in payment for your wares. 
EZK.27.17	Judah and Israel paid for your goods with wheat,
EZK.27.18+EZK.27.19	The people of Damascus bought your merchandise and your products, paying for them with wine from Helbon and wool from Sahar.
EZK.27.20	The people of Dedan traded saddle blankets for your goods. 
EZK.27.21	The Arabians and the rulers of the land of Kedar paid for your merchandise with lambs, sheep, and goats. 
EZK.27.22	For your goods the merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded jewels, gold, and the finest spices. 
EZK.27.23	The cities of Haran, Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, the cities of Asshur and Chilmad—they all traded with you. 
EZK.27.24	They sold you luxurious clothing, purple cloth, and embroidery, brightly colored carpets, and well-made cords and ropes. 
EZK.27.25	 Your merchandise was carried in fleets of the largest cargo ships.
EZK.27.25	“You were like a ship at sea
EZK.27.25	Loaded with heavy cargo.
EZK.27.26	When your oarsmen brought you out to sea,
EZK.27.26	An east wind wrecked you far from land.
EZK.27.27	All your wealth of merchandise,
EZK.27.27	All the sailors in your crew,
EZK.27.27	Your ship's carpenters and your merchants,
EZK.27.27	Every soldier on board the ship—
EZK.27.27	All, all were lost at sea
EZK.27.27	When your ship was wrecked.
EZK.27.28	The shouts of the drowning sailors
EZK.27.28	Echoed on the shore.
EZK.27.29	“Every ship is now deserted,
EZK.27.29	And every sailor has gone ashore.
EZK.27.30	They all mourn bitterly for you,
EZK.27.30	Throwing dust on their heads and rolling in ashes.
EZK.27.31	They shave their heads for you
EZK.27.31	And dress themselves in sackcloth.
EZK.27.31	Their hearts are bitter as they weep.
EZK.27.32	They chant a funeral song for you:
EZK.27.32	‘Who can be compared to Tyre,
EZK.27.32	To Tyre now silent in the sea?
EZK.27.33	When your merchandise went overseas,
EZK.27.33	You filled the needs of every nation.
EZK.27.33	Kings were made rich
EZK.27.33	By the wealth of your goods.
EZK.27.34	Now you are wrecked in the sea;
EZK.27.34	You have sunk to the ocean depths.
EZK.27.34	Your goods and all who worked for you
EZK.27.34	Have vanished with you in the sea.’
EZK.27.35	“Everyone who lives along the coast is shocked at your fate. Even their kings are terrified, and fear is written on their faces. 
EZK.27.36	You are gone, gone forever, and merchants all over the world are terrified, afraid that they will share your fate.”
EZK.28.1	The 
EZK.28.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “tell the ruler of Tyre what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.3	You think you are wiser than Danel,
EZK.28.4	Your wisdom and skill made you rich with treasures of gold and silver. 
EZK.28.5	You made clever business deals and kept on making profits. How proud you are of your wealth!
EZK.28.6	“Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.7	I will bring ruthless enemies to attack you. They will destroy all the beautiful things you have acquired by skill and wisdom. 
EZK.28.8	They will kill you and send you to a watery grave. 
EZK.28.9	When they come to kill you, will you still claim that you are a god? When you face your murderers, you will be mortal and not at all divine. 
EZK.28.10	You will die like a dog at the hand of godless foreigners. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.11	The 
EZK.28.12	“Mortal man,” he said, “grieve for the fate that is waiting for the king of Tyre. Tell him what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.13	You lived in Eden, the garden of God, and wore gems of every kind: rubies and diamonds; topaz, beryl, carnelian, and jasper; sapphires, emeralds, and garnets. You had ornaments of gold. They were made for you
EZK.28.14	I put a terrifying angel there to guard you.
EZK.28.15	Your conduct was perfect from the day you were created until you began to do evil. 
EZK.28.16	You were busy buying and selling, and this led you to violence and sin. So I forced you to leave my holy mountain, and the angel who guarded you drove you away from the sparkling gems. 
EZK.28.17	You were proud of being handsome, and your fame made you act like a fool. Because of this I hurled you to the ground and left you as a warning to other kings. 
EZK.28.18	You did such evil in buying and selling that your places of worship were corrupted. So I set fire to the city and burned it to the ground. All who look at you now see you reduced to ashes. 
EZK.28.19	You are gone, gone forever, and all the nations that had come to know you are terrified, afraid that they will share your fate.”
EZK.28.21	“Mortal man, denounce the city of Sidon. 
EZK.28.22	Tell the people there what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.23	I will send diseases on you and make blood flow in your streets. You will be attacked from every side, and your people will be killed. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	The 
EZK.28.25	The Sovereign 
EZK.28.26	They will live there in safety. They will build houses and plant vineyards. I will punish all their neighbors who treated them with scorn, and Israel will be secure. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.29.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce the king of Egypt. Tell him how he and all the land of Egypt will be punished. 
EZK.29.3	Say that this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.29.4	I am going to put a hook through your jaw and make the fish in your river stick fast to you. Then I will pull you up out of the Nile, with all the fish sticking to you. 
EZK.29.5	I will throw you and all those fish into the desert. Your body will fall on the ground and be left unburied. I will give it to the birds and animals for food. 
EZK.29.6	 Then all the people of Egypt will know that I am the 
EZK.29.6	The 
EZK.29.7	When they leaned on you, you broke, pierced their armpits, and made them wrench their backs.
EZK.29.8	Now then, I, the Sovereign 
EZK.29.9	Egypt will become an empty wasteland. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.29.9	“Because you said that the Nile is yours and you made it, 
EZK.29.10	I am your enemy and the enemy of your Nile. I will make all of Egypt an empty wasteland, from the city of Migdol in the north to the city of Aswan in the south, all the way to the Ethiopian
EZK.29.11	No human being or animal will walk through it. For forty years nothing will live there. 
EZK.29.12	I will make Egypt the most desolate country in the world. For forty years the cities of Egypt will lie in ruins, ruins worse than those of any other city. I will make the Egyptians refugees. They will flee to every country and live among other peoples.”
EZK.29.13	The Sovereign 
EZK.29.14	and I will let them live in southern Egypt, their original home. There they will be a weak kingdom, 
EZK.29.15	the weakest kingdom of all, and they will never again rule other nations. I will make them so unimportant that they will not be able to bend any other nation to their will. 
EZK.29.16	Israel will never again depend on them for help. Egypt's fate will remind Israel how wrong it was to rely on them. Then Israel will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.29.17	On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year of our exile, the 
EZK.29.18	“Mortal man,” he said, “King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia launched an attack on Tyre. He made his soldiers carry such heavy loads that their heads were rubbed bald and their shoulders were worn raw, but neither the king nor his army got anything for all their trouble. 
EZK.29.19	So now this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.29.20	I am giving him Egypt in payment for his services, because his army was working for me. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.29.21	“When that happens, I will make the people of Israel strong and let you, Ezekiel, speak out where everyone can hear you, so that they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.1	The 
EZK.30.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “prophesy and announce what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.30.2	A day of terror is coming!
EZK.30.3	The day is near, the day when the 
EZK.30.3	A day of clouds and trouble for the nations.
EZK.30.4	There will be war in Egypt
EZK.30.4	And great distress in Ethiopia.
EZK.30.4	Many in Egypt will be killed;
EZK.30.4	The country will be plundered
EZK.30.4	And left in ruins.
EZK.30.5	“That war will also kill the soldiers hired from Ethiopia,
EZK.30.6	The 
EZK.30.7	The land will be the most desolate in the world, and its cities will be left totally in ruins. 
EZK.30.8	When I set fire to Egypt and all her defenders are killed, then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	“When that day comes and Egypt is destroyed, I will send messengers in ships to arouse the unsuspecting people of Ethiopia,
EZK.30.10	The Sovereign 
EZK.30.11	He and his ruthless army will come to devastate the land. They will attack Egypt with swords, and the land will be full of corpses. 
EZK.30.12	I will dry up the Nile and put Egypt under the power of evil people. Foreigners will devastate the whole country. I, the 
EZK.30.13	The Sovereign 
EZK.30.14	I will make southern Egypt desolate and set fire to the city of Zoan in the north. I will punish the capital city of Thebes. 
EZK.30.15	I will let the city of Pelusium, Egypt's great fortress, feel my fury. I will destroy the wealth of Thebes. 
EZK.30.16	I will set fire to Egypt, and Pelusium will be in agony. The walls of Thebes will be broken down, and the city will be flooded.
EZK.30.17	The young men of the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis will die in the war, and the other people will be taken prisoner. 
EZK.30.18	Darkness will fall on Tahpanhes when I break the power of Egypt and put an end to the strength they were so proud of. A cloud will cover Egypt, and the people of all her cities will be taken prisoner. 
EZK.30.19	When I punish Egypt in this way, they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	On the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year of our exile, the 
EZK.30.21	“Mortal man,” he said, “I have broken the arm of the king of Egypt. No one has bandaged it or put it in a sling so that it could heal and be strong enough to hold a sword again. 
EZK.30.22	Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.30.23	I am going to scatter the Egyptians throughout the world. 
EZK.30.24	Then I will make the arms of the king of Babylonia strong and put my sword in his hands. But I will break the arms of the king of Egypt, and he will groan and die in front of his enemy. 
EZK.30.25	Yes, I will weaken him and strengthen the king of Babylonia. When I give him my sword and he points it toward Egypt, everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	I will scatter the Egyptians throughout the world. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	On the first day of the third month of the eleventh year of our exile, the 
EZK.31.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “say to the king of Egypt and all his people:
EZK.31.2	How powerful you are!
EZK.31.2	What can I compare you to?
EZK.31.3	You are like
EZK.31.3	With beautiful, shady branches,
EZK.31.3	A tree so tall it reaches the clouds.
EZK.31.4	There was water to make it grow,
EZK.31.4	And underground rivers to feed it.
EZK.31.4	They watered the place where the tree was growing
EZK.31.4	And sent streams to all the trees of the forest.
EZK.31.5	Because it was well-watered,
EZK.31.5	It grew taller than other trees.
EZK.31.5	Its branches grew thick and long.
EZK.31.6	Every kind of bird built nests in its branches;
EZK.31.6	The wild animals bore their young in its shelter;
EZK.31.6	The nations of the world rested in its shade.
EZK.31.7	How beautiful the tree was—
EZK.31.7	So tall, with such long branches.
EZK.31.7	Its roots reached down to the deep-flowing streams.
EZK.31.8	No fir tree ever had such branches,
EZK.31.8	And no plane tree such limbs.
EZK.31.8	No tree in God's own garden was so beautiful.
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful, with spreading branches.
EZK.31.9	It was the envy of every tree in Eden, the garden of God.
EZK.31.10	“Now then, I, the Sovereign 
EZK.31.11	so I have rejected it and will let a foreign ruler have it. He will give that tree what it deserves for its wickedness. 
EZK.31.12	Ruthless foreigners will cut it down and leave it. Its branches and broken limbs will fall on every mountain and valley in the country. All the nations that have been living in its shade will go away. 
EZK.31.13	The birds will come and perch on the fallen tree, and the wild animals will walk over its branches. 
EZK.31.14	And so from now on, no tree, no matter how well-watered it is, will grow that tall again or push its top through the clouds
EZK.31.15	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.31.16	When I send it down to the world of the dead, the noise of its downfall will shake the nations. All the trees of Eden and all the choice, well-watered trees of Lebanon who have gone to the world below will be pleased at its downfall. 
EZK.31.17	They will go with it to the world of the dead to join those that have already fallen. And all who live under its shadow will be scattered among the nations.
EZK.31.18	“The tree is the king of Egypt and all his people. Not even the trees in Eden were so tall and impressive. But now, like the trees of Eden, it will go down to the world of the dead and join the ungodly and those killed in battle. I have spoken,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.32.1	On the first day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of our exile, the 
EZK.32.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “give a solemn warning to the king of Egypt. Give him this message from me: You act like a lion among the nations, but you are more like a crocodile splashing through a river. You muddy the water with your feet and pollute the rivers. 
EZK.32.3	When many nations gather, I will catch you in my net and let them drag the net ashore. 
EZK.32.4	I will throw you out on the ground and bring all the birds and animals of the world to feed on you. 
EZK.32.5	I will cover mountains and valleys with your rotting corpse. 
EZK.32.6	I will pour out your blood until it spreads over the mountains and fills the streams. 
EZK.32.7	 When I destroy you, I will cover the sky and blot out the stars. The sun will hide behind the clouds, and the moon will give no light. 
EZK.32.8	I will put out all the lights of heaven and plunge your world into darkness. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.32.9	“Many nations will be troubled when I spread the news of your destruction through countries you never heard of. 
EZK.32.10	What I do to you will shock many nations. When I swing my sword, kings will shudder with fright. On the day you fall, all of them will tremble in fear for their own lives.”
EZK.32.11	The Sovereign 
EZK.32.12	I will let soldiers from cruel nations draw their swords and kill all your people. All your people and everything else that you are proud of will be destroyed. 
EZK.32.13	I will slaughter your cattle at every water hole. There will be no people or cattle to muddy the water any more. 
EZK.32.14	I will let your waters settle and become clear and let your rivers run calm. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.32.15	When I make Egypt a desolate wasteland and destroy all who live there, they will know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This solemn warning will become a funeral song. The women of the nations will sing it to mourn for Egypt and all its people. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.32.17	On the fifteenth day of the first month
EZK.32.18	“Mortal man,” he said, “mourn for all the many people of Egypt. Send them down with the other powerful nations to the world of the dead. 
EZK.32.19	Say to them:
EZK.32.19	“Do you think you are more beautiful than anyone else?
EZK.32.19	You will go down to the world of the dead
EZK.32.19	and lie there among the ungodly.
EZK.32.20	“The people of Egypt will fall with those who are killed in battle. A sword is ready to kill them all.
EZK.32.21	The greatest heroes and those who fought on the Egyptian side welcome the Egyptians to the world of the dead. They shout: ‘The ungodly who were killed in battle have come down here, and here they lie!’
EZK.32.22	“Assyria is there, with the graves of her soldiers all around. They were all killed in battle, 
EZK.32.23	and their graves are in the deepest parts of the world of the dead. All her soldiers fell in battle, and their graves surround her tomb. Yet once they terrified the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	“Elam is there, with the graves of her soldiers all around. They were all killed in battle, and they went down, uncircumcised, to the world of the dead. In life they spread terror, but now they lie dead and disgraced. 
EZK.32.25	Elam lies down among those killed in battle, and the graves of her soldiers are all around her. They are all uncircumcised, all killed in battle. In life they spread terror, but now they lie dead and disgraced, sharing the fate of those killed in battle.
EZK.32.26	“Meshech and Tubal are there, with the graves of their soldiers all around. They are all uncircumcised, all killed in battle. Yet once they terrified the living. 
EZK.32.27	They were not given honorable burial like the heroes of ancient times,
EZK.32.28	“That is how the Egyptians will lie crushed among the uncircumcised who were killed in battle.
EZK.32.29	“Edom is there with her kings and rulers. They were powerful soldiers, but now they lie in the world of the dead with the uncircumcised who were killed in battle.
EZK.32.30	“All the princes of the north are there, and so are the Sidonians. Their power once spread terror, but now they go down in disgrace with those killed in battle and are laid to rest, uncircumcised. They share the disgrace of those who go down to the world of the dead.
EZK.32.31	“The sight of all these who were killed in battle will be a comfort to the king of Egypt and his army,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.32.32	“I caused the king of Egypt to terrorize the living, but he and all his army will be killed and laid to rest with all the uncircumcised who die in battle.” The Sovereign 
EZK.33.1	The 
EZK.33.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “tell your people what happens when I bring war to a land. The people of that country choose one of their number to be a lookout. 
EZK.33.3	When he sees the enemy approaching, he sounds the alarm to warn everyone. 
EZK.33.4	If someone hears it but pays no attention and the enemy comes and kills him, then he is to blame for his own death. 
EZK.33.5	His death is his own fault, because he paid no attention to the warning. If he had paid attention, he could have escaped. 
EZK.33.6	If, however, the lookout sees the enemy coming and does not sound the alarm, the enemy will come and kill those sinners, but I will hold the lookout responsible for their death.
EZK.33.7	“Now, mortal man, I am making you a lookout for the nation of Israel. You must pass on to them the warnings I give you. 
EZK.33.8	If I announce that an evil person is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, then he will die, still a sinner, and I will hold you responsible for his death. 
EZK.33.9	If you do warn an evil person and he doesn't stop sinning, he will die, still a sinner, but your life will be spared.”
EZK.33.10	The 
EZK.33.11	Tell them that as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.33.12	“Now, mortal man, tell the Israelites that when someone good sins, the good he has done will not save him. If an evil person stops doing evil, he won't be punished, and if a good man starts sinning, his life will not be spared. 
EZK.33.13	I may promise life to someone good, but if he starts thinking that his past goodness is enough and begins to sin, I will not remember any of the good he did. He will die because of his sins. 
EZK.33.14	I may warn someone evil that he is going to die, but if he stops sinning and does what is right and good— 
EZK.33.15	for example, if he returns the security he took for a loan or gives back what he stole—if he stops sinning and follows the laws that give life, he will not die, but live. 
EZK.33.16	I will forgive the sins he has committed, and he will live because he has done what is right and good.
EZK.33.17	“And your people say that what I do isn't right! No, it's their way that isn't right. 
EZK.33.18	When someone righteous stops doing good and starts doing evil, he will die for it. 
EZK.33.19	When someone evil quits sinning and does what is right and good, he has saved his life. 
EZK.33.20	But Israel, you say that what I do isn't right. I am going to judge you by what you do.”
EZK.33.22	The evening before he came, I had felt the powerful presence of the 
EZK.33.23	The 
EZK.33.24	“Mortal man,” he said, “the people who are living in the ruined cities of the land of Israel are saying: ‘Abraham was only one man, and he was given the whole land. There are many of us, so now the land is ours.’
EZK.33.25	“Tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.33.26	You rely on your swords. Your actions are disgusting. Everyone commits adultery. What makes you think that the land is yours?
EZK.33.27	“Tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.33.28	I will make the country a desolate wasteland, and the power they were so proud of will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will be so wild that no one will be able to travel through them. 
EZK.33.29	When I punish the people for their sins and make the country a wasteland, then they will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	The 
EZK.33.31	So my people crowd in to hear what you have to say, but they don't do what you tell them to do. Loving words are on their lips, but they continue their greedy ways. 
EZK.33.32	To them you are nothing more than an entertainer singing love songs or playing a harp. They listen to all your words and don't obey a single one of them. 
EZK.33.33	But when all your words come true—and they will come true—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
EZK.34.1	The 
EZK.34.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce the rulers of Israel. Prophesy to them, and tell them what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.3	You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep. 
EZK.34.4	You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly. 
EZK.34.5	 Because the sheep had no shepherd, they were scattered, and wild animals killed and ate them. 
EZK.34.6	So my sheep wandered over the high hills and the mountains. They were scattered over the face of the earth, and no one looked for them or tried to find them.
EZK.34.7	“Now, you shepherds, listen to what I, the 
EZK.34.8	As surely as I am the living God, you had better listen to me. My sheep have been attacked by wild animals that killed and ate them because there was no shepherd. My shepherds did not try to find the sheep. They were taking care of themselves and not the sheep. 
EZK.34.9	So listen to me, you shepherds. 
EZK.34.10	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.11	“I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.12	in the same way as shepherds take care of their sheep that were scattered and are brought together again. I will bring them back from all the places where they were scattered on that dark, disastrous day. 
EZK.34.13	I will take them out of foreign countries, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. I will lead them back to the mountains and the streams of Israel and will feed them in pleasant pastures. 
EZK.34.14	I will let them graze in safety in the mountain meadows and the valleys and in all the green pastures of the land of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will find them a place to rest. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.16	“I will look for those that are lost, bring back those that wander off, bandage those that are hurt, and heal those that are sick; but those that are fat and strong I will destroy, because I am a shepherd who does what is right.
EZK.34.17	“Now then, my flock, I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.18	Some of you are not satisfied with eating the best grass; you even trample down what you don't eat! You drink the clear water and muddy what you don't drink! 
EZK.34.19	My other sheep have to eat the grass you trample down and drink the water you muddy.
EZK.34.20	“So now, I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.21	You pushed the sick ones aside and butted them away from the flock. 
EZK.34.22	But I will rescue my sheep and not let them be mistreated any more. I will judge each of my sheep and separate the good from the bad. 
EZK.34.23	 I will give them a king like my servant David to be their one shepherd, and he will take care of them. 
EZK.34.24	 I, the 
EZK.34.25	I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security. I will get rid of all the dangerous animals in the land, so that my sheep can live safely in the fields and sleep in the forests.
EZK.34.26	“I will bless them and let them live around my sacred hill.
EZK.34.27	The trees will bear fruit, the fields will produce crops, and everyone will live in safety on his own land. When I break my people's chains and set them free from those who made them slaves, then they will know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	The heathen nations will not plunder them any more, and the wild animals will not kill and eat them. They will live in safety, and no one will terrify them. 
EZK.34.29	I will give them fertile fields and put an end to hunger in the land. The other nations will not sneer at them any more. 
EZK.34.30	Everyone will know that I protect Israel and that they are my people. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.34.31	“You, my sheep, the flock that I feed, are my people, and I am your God,” says the Sovereign 
EZK.35.2	“Mortal man,” he said, “denounce the country of Edom. 
EZK.35.3	Tell the people what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.35.3	“I am your enemy, mountains of Edom!
EZK.35.3	I will make you a desolate wasteland.
EZK.35.4	I will leave your cities in ruins
EZK.35.4	And your land desolate;
EZK.35.4	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	“You were Israel's constant enemy and let her people be slaughtered in the time of her disaster, the time of final punishment for her sins. 
EZK.35.6	So then—as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.35.7	I will make the hill country of Edom a wasteland and kill everyone who travels through it. 
EZK.35.8	I will cover the mountains with corpses, and the bodies of those who are killed in battle will cover the hills and valleys. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you desolate forever, and no one will live in your cities again. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	“You said that the two nations, Judah and Israel, together with their lands, belonged to you and that you would possess them, even though I, the 
EZK.35.11	So then, as surely as I, the Sovereign 
EZK.35.12	Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.35.13	I have heard the wild, boastful way you have talked against me.”
EZK.35.14	The Sovereign 
EZK.35.15	just as you rejoiced at the devastation of Israel, my own possession. The mountains of Seir, yes, all the land of Edom, will be desolate. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	The 
EZK.36.2	the Sovereign 
EZK.36.3	“Prophesy, then, and announce what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.4	So now listen to what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.5	“I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.6	“So prophesy to the land of Israel; tell the mountains, hills, brooks, and valleys what I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.7	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.8	But on the mountains of Israel the trees will again grow leaves and bear fruit for you, my people Israel. You are going to come home soon. 
EZK.36.9	I am on your side, and I will make sure that your land is plowed again and crops are planted on it. 
EZK.36.10	I will make your population grow. You will live in the cities and rebuild everything that was left in ruins. 
EZK.36.11	I will make people and cattle increase in number. There will be more of you than ever before, and you will have many children. I will let you live there as you used to live, and I will make you more prosperous than ever. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	I will bring you, my people Israel, back to live again in the land. It will be your own land, and it will never again let your children starve.
EZK.36.13	“I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.14	But from now on it will no longer eat people and rob you of your children. I, the Sovereign

EZK.36.17	“Mortal man,” he said, “when the Israelites were living in their land, they defiled it by the way they lived and acted. I regarded their behavior as being as ritually unclean as a woman is during her monthly period.
EZK.36.18	I let them feel the force of my anger because of the murders they had committed in the land and because of the idols by which they had defiled it. 
EZK.36.19	I condemned them for the way they lived and acted, and I scattered them through foreign countries. 
EZK.36.20	Wherever they went, they brought disgrace on my holy name, because people would say, ‘These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	That made me concerned for my holy name, since the Israelites brought disgrace on it everywhere they went.
EZK.36.22	“Now then, give the Israelites the message that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.23	When I demonstrate to the nations the holiness of my great name—the name you disgraced among them—then they will know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	I will take you from every nation and country and bring you back to your own land. 
EZK.36.25	I will sprinkle clean water on you and make you clean from all your idols and everything else that has defiled you. 
EZK.36.26	 I will give you a new heart and a new mind. I will take away your stubborn heart of stone and give you an obedient heart. 
EZK.36.27	I will put my spirit in you and will see to it that you follow my laws and keep all the commands I have given you. 
EZK.36.28	Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I will save you from everything that defiles you. I will command the grain to be plentiful, so that you will not have any more famines. 
EZK.36.30	I will increase the yield of your fruit trees and your fields, so that there will be no more famines to disgrace you among the nations. 
EZK.36.31	You will remember your evil conduct and the wrongs that you committed, and you will be disgusted with yourselves because of your sins and your iniquities. 
EZK.36.32	Israel, I want you to know that I am not doing all this for your sake. I want you to feel the shame and disgrace of what you are doing. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.36.33	The Sovereign 
EZK.36.34	Everyone who used to walk by your fields saw how overgrown and wild they were, but I will let you farm them again. 
EZK.36.35	Everyone will talk about how this land, which was once a wilderness, has become like the Garden of Eden, and how the cities which were torn down, looted, and left in ruins, are now inhabited and fortified. 
EZK.36.36	Then the neighboring nations that have survived will know that I, the 
EZK.36.37	The Sovereign 
EZK.36.38	The cities that are now in ruins will then be as full of people as Jerusalem was once full of the sheep which were offered as sacrifices at a festival. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	I felt the powerful presence of the 
EZK.37.2	He led me all around the valley, and I could see that there were very many bones and that they were very dry. 
EZK.37.3	He said to me, “Mortal man, can these bones come back to life?”
EZK.37.3	I replied, “Sovereign 
EZK.37.4	He said, “Prophesy to the bones. Tell these dry bones to listen to the word of the 
EZK.37.5	Tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.37.6	I will give you sinews and muscles, and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you and bring you back to life. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I had been told. While I was speaking, I heard a rattling noise, and the bones began to join together. 
EZK.37.8	While I watched, the bones were covered with sinews and muscles, and then with skin. But there was no breath in the bodies.
EZK.37.9	God said to me, “Mortal man, prophesy to the wind.
EZK.37.11	God said to me, “Mortal man, the people of Israel are like these bones. They say that they are dried up, without any hope and with no future. 
EZK.37.12	So prophesy to my people Israel and tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.37.13	When I open the graves where my people are buried and bring them out, they will know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	I will put my breath in them, bring them back to life, and let them live in their own land. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.37.15	The 
EZK.37.16	“Mortal man,” he said, “take a wooden stick and write on it the words, ‘The kingdom of Judah.’ Then take another stick and write on it the words, ‘The kingdom of Israel.’ 
EZK.37.17	Then hold the two sticks end to end in your hand so that they look like one stick. 
EZK.37.18	When your people ask you to tell them what this means, 
EZK.37.19	tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.37.20	“Hold in your hand the two sticks and let the people see them. 
EZK.37.21	Then tell them that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.37.22	I will unite them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. They will have one king to rule over them, and they will no longer be divided into two nations or split into two kingdoms. 
EZK.37.23	They will not defile themselves with disgusting idols any more or corrupt themselves with sin. I will free them from all the ways in which they sin and betray me. I will purify them; they will be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.37.24	 A king like my servant David will be their king. They will all be united under one ruler and will obey my laws faithfully. 
EZK.37.25	They will live on the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where their ancestors lived. They will live there forever, and so will their children and all their descendants. A king like my servant David will rule them forever. 
EZK.37.26	I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security forever. I will establish them and increase their population, and will see to it that my Temple stands forever in their land. 
EZK.37.27	 I will live there with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
EZK.37.28	When I place my Temple there to be among them forever, then the nations will know that I, the 
EZK.38.1	The 
EZK.38.2	 “Mortal man,” he said, “denounce Gog, chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal in the land of Magog. Denounce him 
EZK.38.3	and tell him that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.38.4	I will turn him around, put hooks in his jaws, and drag him and all his troops away. His army, with its horses and uniformed riders, is enormous, and every soldier carries a shield and is armed with a sword. 
EZK.38.5	Troops from Persia, Ethiopia,
EZK.38.6	All the fighting men of the lands of Gomer and Beth Togarmah in the north are with him, and so are men from many other nations. 
EZK.38.7	Tell him to get ready and have all his troops ready at his command. 
EZK.38.8	After many years I will order him to invade a country where the people were brought back together from many nations and have lived without fear of war. He will invade the mountains of Israel, which were desolate and deserted so long, but where all the people now live in safety. 
EZK.38.9	He and his army and the many nations with him will attack like a storm and cover the land like a cloud.”
EZK.38.10	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.38.11	You will decide to invade a helpless country where the people live in peace and security in unwalled towns that have no defenses. 
EZK.38.12	You will plunder and loot the people who live in cities that were once in ruins. They have been gathered from the nations, and now they have livestock and property and live at the crossroads of the world. 
EZK.38.13	The people of Sheba and Dedan and the merchants from the towns of Spain will ask you, ‘Have you assembled your army and attacked in order to loot and plunder? Do you intend to get silver and gold, livestock and property, and march off with all those spoils?’”
EZK.38.14	So the Sovereign 
EZK.38.15	to come from your place in the far north, leading a large, powerful army of soldiers from many nations, all of them on horseback. 
EZK.38.16	You will attack my people Israel like a storm moving across the land. When the time comes, I will send you to invade my land in order to show the nations who I am, to show my holiness by what I do through you. 
EZK.38.17	You are the one I was talking about long ago, when I announced through my servants, the prophets of Israel, that in days to come I would bring someone to attack Israel.” The Sovereign 
EZK.38.18	The Sovereign 
EZK.38.19	I declare in the heat of my anger that on that day there will be a severe earthquake in the land of Israel. 
EZK.38.20	Every fish and bird, every animal large and small, and every human being on the face of the earth will tremble for fear of me. Mountains will fall, cliffs will crumble, and every wall will collapse. 
EZK.38.21	I will terrify Gog with all sorts of calamities.
EZK.38.22	I will punish him with disease and bloodshed. Torrents of rain and hail, together with fire and sulfur, will pour down on him and his army and on the many nations that are on his side. 
EZK.38.23	In this way I will show all the nations that I am great and that I am holy. They will know then that I am the 
EZK.39.1	The Sovereign 
EZK.39.2	I will turn him in a new direction and lead him out of the far north until he comes to the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.39.3	Then I will knock his bow out of his left hand and his arrows out of his right hand. 
EZK.39.4	Gog and his army and his allies will fall dead on the mountains of Israel, and I will let their bodies be food for all the birds and wild animals. 
EZK.39.5	They will fall dead in the open field. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.39.6	I will start a fire in the land of Magog and along all the seacoasts where people live undisturbed, and everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	I will make sure that my people Israel know my holy name, and I will not let my name be disgraced any more. Then the nations will know that I, the 
EZK.39.8	The Sovereign 
EZK.39.9	The people who live in the cities of Israel will go out and collect the abandoned weapons for firewood. They will build fires with the shields, bows, arrows, spears, and clubs, and have enough to last for seven years. 
EZK.39.10	They will not have to gather firewood in the fields or cut down trees in the forest, because they will have the abandoned weapons to burn. They will loot and plunder those who looted and plundered them.” The Sovereign 
EZK.39.11	The 
EZK.39.12	It will take the Israelites seven months to bury all the corpses and make the land clean again. 
EZK.39.13	Everyone in the land will help bury them, and they will be honored for this on the day of my victory. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.39.14	After the seven months are over, men will be chosen to travel through the land in order to find and bury those bodies
EZK.39.15	As they go up and down the country, every time they find a human bone, they will put a marker beside it so that the gravediggers can come and bury it in the Valley of Gog's Army. 
EZK.39.16	(There will be a town nearby named after the army.) And so the land will be made clean again.”
EZK.39.18	They are to eat the bodies of soldiers and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, all of whom will be killed like rams or lambs or goats or fat bulls. 
EZK.39.19	When I kill these people like sacrifices, the birds and animals are to eat all the fat they can hold and to drink blood until they are drunk. 
EZK.39.20	At my table they will eat all they can hold of horses and their riders and of soldiers and fighting men. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.39.21	The 
EZK.39.22	The Israelites will know from then on that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the nations will know that the Israelites went into exile because of the sins which they committed against me. I turned away from them and let their enemies defeat them and kill them in battle. 
EZK.39.24	I gave them what they deserved for their uncleanness and their wickedness, and I turned away from them.”
EZK.39.25	The Sovereign 
EZK.39.26	When they are once more living in safety in their own land, with no one to threaten them, they will be able to forget how they were disgraced for having betrayed me. 
EZK.39.27	In order to show to the many nations that I am holy, I will bring my people back from all the countries where their enemies live. 
EZK.39.28	Then my people will know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	I will pour out my spirit on the people of Israel and never again turn away from them. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.40.1	It was the tenth day of the new year, which was the twenty-fifth year after we had been taken into exile and the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was captured. On that day I felt the powerful presence of the 
EZK.40.2	 In a vision God took me to the land of Israel and put me on a high mountain. I saw in front of me
EZK.40.3	 He took me closer, and I saw a man who shone like bronze. He was holding a linen tape measure and a measuring rod and was standing by a gateway.
EZK.40.4	He said to me, “Watch, mortal man. Listen carefully and pay close attention to everything I show you, because this is why you were brought here. You are to tell the people of Israel everything you see.”
EZK.40.6	Then he went to the gateway that faced east. He went up the steps, and at the top he measured the entrance; it was 10 feet deep.
EZK.40.7	Beyond it there was a passageway, which had three guardrooms on each side. Each of the rooms was square, 10 feet on each side, and the walls between them were 8 feet thick. Beyond the guardrooms there was a passageway 10 feet long that led to an entrance room which faced the Temple. 
EZK.40.8+EZK.40.9	He measured this room and found it was 14 feet deep. It formed that end of the gateway which was nearest the Temple, and at its far end the walls were 4 feet thick. ( 
EZK.40.10	These guardrooms on each side of the passageway were all the same size, and the walls between them were all of the same thickness.)
EZK.40.11	Next, the man measured the width of the passageway in the gateway. It was 22 feet altogether, and the space between the open gates was 16 feet. 
EZK.40.12	In front of each of the guardrooms there was a low wall 20 inches high and 20 inches thick. (The rooms were 10 feet square.) 
EZK.40.13	Then he measured the distance from the back wall
EZK.40.14	The room at the far end led out to a courtyard. He measured that room and found it was 34 feet wide.
EZK.40.15	The total length of the gateway from the outside wall of the gate to the far side of the last room was 84 feet. 
EZK.40.16	There were small openings in the outside walls of all the rooms and also in the inner walls between the rooms. There were palm trees carved on the inner walls that faced the passageway.
EZK.40.17	The man took me through the gateway into the courtyard. There were thirty rooms built against the outer wall, and in front of them there was an area paved with stones, 
EZK.40.18	which extended around the courtyard. This outer courtyard was at a lower level than the inner courtyard.
EZK.40.19	There was a gateway at a higher level that led to the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance between the two gateways, and it was 168 feet.
EZK.40.20	Then the man measured the gateway on the north side that led into the outer courtyard. 
EZK.40.21	The three guardrooms on each side of the passageway, the walls between them, and the entrance room all had the same measurements as those in the east gateway. The total length of the gateway was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
EZK.40.22	The entrance room, the windows, and the carved palm trees were like those in the east gate. Here seven steps led up to the gate, and the entrance room was at the end facing the courtyard. 
EZK.40.23	Across the courtyard from this north gateway was another gateway leading to the inner courtyard, just as there was on the east side. The man measured the distance between these two gateways, and it was 168 feet.
EZK.40.24	Next, the man took me to the south side, and there we saw another gateway. He measured its inner walls and its entrance room, and they were the same as the others. 
EZK.40.25	There were windows in the rooms of this gateway just as in the others. The total length of the gateway was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
EZK.40.26	Seven steps led up to it, and its entrance room was also at the end facing the courtyard. There were palm trees carved on the inner walls that faced the passageway. 
EZK.40.27	Here, too, there was a gateway leading to the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance to this second gateway, and it was 168 feet.
EZK.40.28	The man took me through the south gateway into the inner courtyard. He measured the gateway, and it was the same size as the gateways in the outer wall. 
EZK.40.29+EZK.40.30	Its guardrooms, its entrance room, and its inner walls were the same size as those in the other gateways. There were also windows in the rooms of this gateway. The total length was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
EZK.40.31	Its entrance room faced the other courtyard, and palm trees were carved on the walls along the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate.
EZK.40.32	The man took me through the east gateway into the inner courtyard. He measured the gateway, and it was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.33	Its guardrooms, its entrance room, and its inner walls measured the same as those in the other gateways. There were windows all around, and in the entrance room also. The total length was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
EZK.40.34	The entrance room faced the outer courtyard. Palm trees were carved on the walls along the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate.
EZK.40.35	Then the man took me to the north gateway. He measured it, and it was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.36	Like them, it also had guardrooms, decorated inner walls, an entrance room, and windows all around. Its total length was 84 feet and its width 42 feet. 
EZK.40.37	The entrance room
EZK.40.38	In the outer courtyard there was an annex attached to the inner gateway on the north side. It opened into the entrance room that faced the courtyard, and there they washed the carcasses of the animals to be burned whole as sacrifices. 
EZK.40.39	In this entrance room there were four tables, two on each side of the room. It was on these tables that they killed the animals to be offered as sacrifices, either to be burned whole or to be sacrifices for sin or as repayment offerings. 
EZK.40.40	Outside the room there were four similar tables, two on either side of the entrance of the north gate. 
EZK.40.41	Altogether there were eight tables on which the animals to be sacrificed were killed: four inside the room and four out in the courtyard. 
EZK.40.42	The four tables in the annex, used to prepare the offerings to be burned whole, were of cut stone. They were 20 inches high, and their tops were 30 inches square. All the equipment used in killing the sacrificial animals was kept on these tables. 
EZK.40.43	Ledges 3 inches wide ran around the edge of the tables. All the meat to be offered in sacrifice was placed on the tables.
EZK.40.44	Then he brought me into the inner court. There were two rooms opening on the inner court, one facing south beside the north gateway and the other facing north beside the south gateway.
EZK.40.45	The man told me that the room which faced south was for the priests who served in the Temple, 
EZK.40.46	and the room which faced north was for the priests who served at the altar. All the priests are descended from Zadok; they are the only members of the tribe of Levi who are permitted to go into the 
EZK.40.47	The man measured the inner courtyard, and it was 168 feet square. The Temple was on the west side, and in front of it was an altar. 
EZK.40.48	Then he took me into the entrance room of the Temple. He measured the entranceway: it was 9 feet deep and 24 feet wide,
EZK.40.49	Steps led up to the entrance room, which was 34 feet wide and 20 feet deep.
EZK.41.1	Next, the man took me into the central room, the Holy Place. He measured the passageway into it: it was 10 feet deep
EZK.41.2	and 18 feet wide, with walls 8 feet thick on either side. He measured the room itself: it was 68 feet long and 34 feet wide.
EZK.41.3	Then he went to the innermost room. He measured the passageway into it: it was 3 feet deep and 10 feet wide, with walls on either side 12 feet thick.
EZK.41.4	He measured the room itself, and it was 34 feet square. This room was beyond the central room. Then he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”
EZK.41.5	The man measured the thickness of the inner wall of the Temple building, and it was 10 feet. Against this wall, all around the Temple, was a series of small rooms 7 feet wide. 
EZK.41.6	These rooms were in three stories, with thirty rooms on each floor. The Temple's outer wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without being anchored into it. 
EZK.41.7	And so the Temple walls, when seen from the outside, seemed to have the same thickness all the way to the top. Against the Temple's outer wall, on the outside of the rooms, two wide stairways were built, so that it was possible to go from the lower story to the middle and the upper stories.
EZK.41.8+EZK.41.9+EZK.41.10+EZK.41.11	The outside wall of these rooms was 8 feet thick; there was one door into the rooms on the north side of the Temple, and one into those on the south side. I saw that there was a terrace 8 feet wide around the Temple; it was 10 feet above the ground and it was level with the foundation of the rooms by the Temple walls. Between the terrace and the buildings used by the priests there was an open space 34 feet across, along the sides of the Temple.
EZK.41.12	At the far end of the open space on the west side of the Temple there was a building 150 feet long and 116 feet wide; its walls were 9 feet thick all around.
EZK.41.13	The man measured the outside of the Temple, and it was 168 feet long. And from the back of the Temple, across the open space to the far side of the building to the west, the distance was also 168 feet. 
EZK.41.14	The distance across the front of the Temple, including the open space on either side, was also 168 feet. 
EZK.41.15	He measured the length of the building to the west, including its galleries on both sides, and it was also 168 feet.
EZK.41.15	The entrance room of the Temple, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place 
EZK.41.16	were all paneled with wood from the floor to the windows. These windows could be covered.
EZK.41.17	The inside walls of the Temple, up as high as above the doors, were completely covered with carvings
EZK.41.18	of palm trees and winged creatures. Palm trees alternated with creatures, one following the other, all the way around the room. Each creature had two faces: 
EZK.41.19	a human face that was turned toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion's face that was turned toward the tree on the other side. It was like this all around the wall, 
EZK.41.20	from the floor to above the doors. 
EZK.41.21	The doorposts of the Holy Place were square.
EZK.41.21	In front of the entrance of the Most Holy Place there was something that looked like 
EZK.41.22	a wooden altar. It was 5 feet high and 4 feet wide. Its corner posts, its base,
EZK.41.23	There was a door at the end of the passageway to the Holy Place and one also at the end of the passageway to the Most Holy Place. 
EZK.41.24	They were double doors that swung open in the middle. 
EZK.41.25	There were palm trees and winged creatures carved on the doors of the Holy Place, just as there were on the walls. And there was a wooden covering over the outside of the doorway of the entrance room. 
EZK.41.26	At the sides of this room there were windows, and the walls were decorated with palm trees.
EZK.42.1	Then the man took me into the outer courtyard and led me to a building on the north side of the Temple, not far from the building at the west end of the Temple. 
EZK.42.2	This building was 168 feet long and 84 feet wide. 
EZK.42.3	On one side it faced the space 34 feet wide which was alongside the Temple, and on the other side it faced the pavement of the outer courtyard. It was built on three levels, each one set further back than the one below it. 
EZK.42.4	Along the north side of this building was a passageway 16 feet wide and 168 feet long,
EZK.42.5	The rooms at the upper level of the building were narrower than those at the middle and lower levels because they were set further back. 
EZK.42.6	The rooms at all three levels were on terraces and were not supported by columns like the other buildings in the courtyard. 
EZK.42.7+EZK.42.8	At the lower level the outer wall of the building was solid for 84 feet, half its length; and there were rooms in the remaining 84 feet. At the top level there were rooms in the entire length of the building. 
EZK.42.9+EZK.42.10	Below these rooms at the east end of the building, where the wall of the courtyard began,
EZK.42.9+EZK.42.10	At the south
EZK.42.11	In front of the rooms there was a passageway just like the one on the north side. It had the same measurements, the same design, and the same kind of entrances. 
EZK.42.12	There was a door under the rooms on the south side of the building, at the east end where the wall began.
EZK.42.13	The man said to me, “Both these buildings are holy. In them the priests who enter the 
EZK.42.14	When priests have been in the Temple and want to go to the outer courtyard, they must leave in these rooms the holy clothing they wore while serving the 
EZK.42.15	When the man had finished measuring inside the Temple area, he took me out through the east gate and then measured the outside of the area. 
EZK.42.16	He took the measuring rod and measured the east side, and it was 840 feet. 
EZK.42.17+EZK.42.18+EZK.42.19	Then he measured the north side, the south side, and the west side; each side had the same length, 840 feet,
EZK.42.20	so that the wall enclosed a square 840 feet on each side. The wall served to separate what was holy from what was not.
EZK.43.1	The man took me to the gate that faces east, 
EZK.43.2	 and there I saw coming from the east the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel. God's voice sounded like the roar of the sea, and the earth shone with the dazzling light. 
EZK.43.3	This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem, and the one I saw by the Chebar River. Then I threw myself face downward on the ground. 
EZK.43.4	The dazzling light passed through the east gate and went into the Temple.
EZK.43.5	The 
EZK.43.6	The man stood beside me there, and I heard the 
EZK.43.7	“Mortal man, here is my throne. I will live here among the people of Israel and rule them forever. Neither the people of Israel nor their kings will ever again disgrace my holy name by worshiping other gods or by burying the corpses of
EZK.43.8	The kings built the doorsills and doorposts of their palace right against the doorsills and doorposts of my Temple, so that there was only a wall between us. They disgraced my holy name by all the disgusting things they did, and so in my anger I destroyed them. 
EZK.43.9	Now they must stop worshiping other gods and remove the corpses of
EZK.43.10	And the 
EZK.43.11	Then if they are ashamed of what they have done, explain the plan of the Temple to them: its design, its entrances and exits, its shape, the arrangement of everything, and all its rules and regulations. Write all this down for them so that they can see how everything is arranged and can carry out all the rules. 
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the Temple: All the area surrounding it on the top of the mountain is sacred and holy.”
EZK.43.14	The lowest section of the altar, from the top of the base, was 4 feet high. The next section was set back from the edge 20 inches all around, and was 7 feet high. The section after that was also set back from the edge 20 inches all around. 
EZK.43.15	This top section, on which the sacrifices were burned, was also 7 feet high. The projections on the four corners were higher than the rest of the top. 
EZK.43.16	The top of the altar was a square, 20 feet on each side. 
EZK.43.17	The middle section was also a square, 24 feet on each side, with a rim at the outside edge 10 inches high. (The gutter was 20 inches wide.) The steps going up the altar were on the east side.
EZK.43.19	Those priests belonging to the tribe of Levi who are descended from Zadok are the only ones who are to come into my presence to serve me. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.43.20	You are to take some of its blood and put it on the projections on the top corners of the altar, on the corners of the middle section of the altar, and all around its edges. In this way you will purify the altar and consecrate it. 
EZK.43.21	You are to take the bull that is offered as a sacrifice for sin and burn it at the specified place outside the Temple area. 
EZK.43.22	The next day you are to take a male goat without any defects and offer it as a sacrifice for sin. Purify the altar with its blood the same way you did with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished doing that, take a young bull and a young ram, both of them without any defects, 
EZK.43.24	and bring them to me. The priests will sprinkle salt on them and burn them as an offering to me. 
EZK.43.25	Each day for seven days you are to offer a goat, a bull, and a ram as sacrifices for sin. All of them must be without any defects. 
EZK.43.26	For seven days the priests are to consecrate the altar and make it ready for use. 
EZK.43.27	When the week is over, the priests are to begin offering on the altar the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings of the people. Then I will be pleased with all of you. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.1	The man led me to the outer gate at the east side of the Temple area. The gate was closed, 
EZK.44.2	and the 
EZK.44.3	The ruling prince, however, may go there to eat a holy meal in my presence. He is to enter and leave the gateway through the entrance room at the inner end.”
EZK.44.4	Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. As I looked, I saw that the Temple of the 
EZK.44.5	and the 
EZK.44.6	“Tell those rebellious people of Israel that I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.7	They have profaned my Temple by letting uncircumcised foreigners, people who do not obey me, enter the Temple when the fat and the blood of the sacrifices are being offered to me. So my people have broken my covenant by all the disgusting things they have done. 
EZK.44.8	They have not taken charge of the sacred rituals in my Temple, but instead have put foreigners in charge.
EZK.44.9	“I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.10	The 
EZK.44.11	They may serve me in the Temple by taking charge of the gates and by performing the work of the Temple. They may kill the animals which the people offer for burnt offerings and for sacrifices, and they are to be on duty to serve the people. 
EZK.44.12	But because they conducted the worship of idols for the people of Israel and in this way led the people into sin, I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.13	They are not to serve me as priests or to go near anything that is holy to me or to enter the Most Holy Place. This is the punishment for the disgusting things they have done. 
EZK.44.14	I am assigning to them the menial work that is to be done in the Temple.”
EZK.44.15	The Sovereign 
EZK.44.16	They alone will enter my Temple, serve at my altar, and conduct the Temple worship. 
EZK.44.17	 When they enter the gateway to the inner courtyard of the Temple, they are to put on linen clothing. They must not wear anything made of wool when they are on duty in the inner courtyard or in the Temple. 
EZK.44.18	So that they won't perspire, they are to wear linen turbans and linen trousers, but no belt. 
EZK.44.19	 Before they go to the outer courtyard where the people are, they must first take off the clothes they wore on duty in the Temple and leave them in the holy rooms. They are to put on other clothing in order to keep their sacred clothing from harming the people.
EZK.44.21	 Priests must not drink any wine before going into the inner courtyard. 
EZK.44.22	 No priest may marry a divorced woman; he is to marry only an Israelite virgin or the widow of another priest.
EZK.44.24	When a legal dispute arises, the priests are to decide the case according to my laws. They are to keep the religious festivals according to my rules and regulations, and they are to keep the Sabbaths holy.
EZK.44.26	After he has become clean again, he must wait seven days 
EZK.44.27	and then go into the inner courtyard of the Temple and offer a sacrifice for his purification, so that he can serve in the Temple again. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.29	 The grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the repayment offerings will be the priests' food, and they are to receive everything in Israel that is set apart for me. 
EZK.44.30	The priests are to have the best of all the first harvest and of everything else that is offered to me. Each time the people bake bread, they are to give the priests the first loaf as an offering, and my blessing will rest on their homes. 
EZK.44.31	 The priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies a natural death or is killed by another animal.”
EZK.45.1	When the land is divided to give each tribe a share, one part is to be dedicated to the 
EZK.45.2	In this area there is to be a square plot of land for the Temple, 840 feet on each side, entirely surrounded by an open space 84 feet wide. 
EZK.45.3	Half of this area, a section 10 miles by 4 miles, is to be measured off; it will contain the Temple, the holiest place of all. 
EZK.45.4	It will be a holy part of the country, set aside for the priests who serve the 
EZK.45.5	The other half of the area is to be set aside as the possession of the Levites, who do the work in the Temple. There will be towns there for them to live in.
EZK.45.6	Next to the holy area, another section, 10 miles long and 2 miles wide, is to be set aside for a city where any of the people of Israel may live.
EZK.45.7	Land is also to be set aside for the ruling prince. From the west boundary of the holy area it will extend west to the Mediterranean Sea; and from the east boundary it will extend to the eastern border of the country, so that its length will be the same as the length of one of the areas allotted to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.45.8	This area will be the share the ruling prince will have in the land of Israel, so that he will no longer oppress the people, but will let the rest of the country belong to the tribes of Israel.

EZK.45.17	It will be his duty to provide the animals to be burned whole, the grain offerings, and the wine offerings for the whole nation of Israel at the New Moon Festivals, the Sabbaths, and the other festivals. He is to provide the sin offerings, the grain offerings, the offerings to be burned whole, and the fellowship offerings, to take away the sins of the people of Israel.”
EZK.45.18	The Sovereign 
EZK.45.19	The priest will take some of the blood of this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, on the four corners of the altar, and on the posts of the gateways to the inner courtyard. 
EZK.45.20	On the seventh day of the month you are to do the same thing on behalf of anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. In this way you will keep the Temple holy.
EZK.45.22	On the first day of the festival the ruling prince must offer a bull as a sacrifice for his sins and for those of all the people. 
EZK.45.23	On each of the seven days of the festival he is to sacrifice to the 
EZK.45.24	For each bull and each ram that is sacrificed, there is to be an offering of half a bushel of grain and three quarts of olive oil.
EZK.46.1	The Sovereign 
EZK.46.2	The ruling prince will go from the outer courtyard into the entrance room of the gateway and stand beside the posts of the gate while the priests burn his sacrifices whole and offer his fellowship offerings. There at the gate he must worship and then go back out. The gate must not be shut until evening. 
EZK.46.3	Each Sabbath and each New Moon Festival all the people are also to bow down and worship the 
EZK.46.4	On the Sabbath the prince is to bring to the 
EZK.46.5	With each ram he is to bring an offering of half a bushel of grain, and with each lamb he is to bring whatever he wants to give. For each half-bushel of grain offering he is to bring three quarts of olive oil. 
EZK.46.6	At the New Moon Festival he will offer a young bull, six lambs, and a ram, all without any defects. 
EZK.46.7	With each bull and each ram the offering is to be half a bushel of grain, and with each lamb the offering is to be whatever the prince wants to give. Three quarts of olive oil are to be offered with each half-bushel of grain. 
EZK.46.8	The prince must leave the entrance room of the gateway and go out by the same way he went in.
EZK.46.9	“When the people come to worship the 
EZK.46.10	The prince is to come in when the people come, and leave when they leave. 
EZK.46.11	On the feast days and at the festivals the grain offering will be half a bushel with each bull or ram, and whatever the worshiper wants to give with each lamb. Three quarts of olive oil are to be offered with each half-bushel of grain.
EZK.46.12	“When the ruling prince wants to make a voluntary offering to the 
EZK.46.13	The 
EZK.46.14	Also an offering of five pounds of flour is to be made every morning, along with one quart of olive oil for mixing with the flour. The rules for this offering to the

EZK.46.18	The ruling prince must not take any of the people's property away from them. Any land he gives to his sons must be from the land that is assigned to him, so that he will not oppress any of my people by taking their land.”
EZK.46.19	Then the man took me to the entrance of the rooms facing north near the gate on the south side of the inner courtyard. These are holy rooms for the priests. He pointed out a place on the west side of the rooms 
EZK.46.20	and said, “This is the place where the priests are to boil the meat offered as sacrifices for sin or as repayment offerings, and to bake the offerings of flour, so that nothing holy is carried to the outer courtyard, where it might harm the people.”
EZK.46.21+EZK.46.22	Then he led me to the outer courtyard and showed me that in each of its four corners there was a smaller
EZK.46.23	Each one had a stone wall around it, with fireplaces built against the wall. 
EZK.46.24	The man told me, “These are the kitchens where the Temple servants are to boil the sacrifices the people offer.”
EZK.47.2	The man then took me out of the Temple area by way of the north gate and led me around to the gate that faces east. A small stream of water was flowing out at the south side of the gate. 
EZK.47.3	With his measuring rod the man measured 560 yards downstream to the east and told me to wade through the stream there. The water came only to my ankles. 
EZK.47.4	Then he measured another 560 yards, and the water came up to my knees. Another 560 yards farther down, the water was up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	He measured 560 yards more, and there the stream was so deep I could not wade through it. It was too deep to cross except by swimming. 
EZK.47.6	He said to me, “Mortal man, note all this carefully.”
EZK.47.6	Then the man took me back to the riverbank, 
EZK.47.7	and when I got there, I saw that there were very many trees on each bank. 
EZK.47.8	He said to me, “This water flows through the land to the east and down into the Jordan Valley and to the Dead Sea. When it flows into the Dead Sea, it replaces the salt water of that sea with fresh water. 
EZK.47.9	Wherever the stream flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish. The stream will make the water of the Dead Sea fresh, and wherever it flows, it will bring life. 
EZK.47.10	From the Springs of Engedi all the way to the Springs of Eneglaim, there will be fishermen on the shore of the sea, and they will spread out their nets there to dry. There will be as many different kinds of fish there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But the water in the marshes and ponds along the shore will not be made fresh. They will remain there as a source of salt. 
EZK.47.12	 On each bank of the stream all kinds of trees will grow to provide food. Their leaves will never wither, and they will never stop bearing fruit. They will have fresh fruit every month, because they are watered by the stream that flows from the Temple. The trees will provide food, and their leaves will be used for healing people.”
EZK.47.13	The Sovereign 
EZK.47.14	I solemnly promised your ancestors that I would give them possession of this land; now divide it equally among you.
EZK.47.15	“The northern boundary runs eastward from the Mediterranean Sea to the city of Hethlon, to Hamath Pass, to the city of Zedad,
EZK.47.16	to the cities of Berothah and Sibraim (they are located between the territory of the kingdom of Damascus and that of the kingdom of Hamath), and to the city of Ticon (located by the border of the district of Hauran). 
EZK.47.17	So the northern boundary runs from the Mediterranean eastward to Enon City, with the border regions of Damascus and Hamath to the north of it.
EZK.47.18	“The eastern boundary runs south from a point between the territory of Damascus and that of Hauran, with the Jordan River forming the boundary between the land of Israel on the west and Gilead on the east, as far as Tamar
EZK.47.19	“The southern boundary runs southwest from Tamar to the oasis of Kadesh Meribah and then northwest along the Egyptian border to the Mediterranean Sea.
EZK.47.20	“The western boundary is formed by the Mediterranean and runs north to a point west of Hamath Pass.
EZK.47.21	“Divide this land among your tribes; 
EZK.47.22	it is to be your permanent possession. The foreigners who are living among you and who have had children born here are also to receive their share of the land when you divide it. They are to be treated like full Israelite citizens and are to draw lots for shares of the land along with the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	All foreign residents will receive their share with the people of the tribe among whom they are living. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.48.1+EZK.48.2+EZK.48.3+EZK.48.4+EZK.48.5+EZK.48.6+EZK.48.7	The northern boundary of the land runs eastward from the Mediterranean Sea to the city of Hethlon, to Hamath Pass, to Enon City, to the boundary between the kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath. Each tribe is to receive one section of land extending from the eastern boundary west to the Mediterranean Sea,

EZK.48.8	The next section of the land is to be set apart for special use. It is to be 10 miles wide from north to south, and the same length from east to west as the sections given to the tribes. The Temple will be located within this section.
EZK.48.9	In the center of this section, a special area 10 miles by 8 miles
EZK.48.10	The priests are to have a portion of this holy area. From east to west their portion is to measure 10 miles, and from north to south, 4 miles. The Temple of the 
EZK.48.11	This holy area is to be for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They served me faithfully and did not join the rest of the Israelites in doing wrong, as the other members of the tribe of Levi did. 
EZK.48.12	So they are to have a special area next to the area belonging to the Levites, and it will be the holiest of all. 
EZK.48.13	The Levites also are to have a special area, south of that of the priests. It too is to be 10 miles from east to west, by 4 miles from north to south. 
EZK.48.14	The area dedicated to the 
EZK.48.15	The part of the special area that is left, 10 miles by 2 miles, is not holy, but is for the general use of the people. They may live there and use the land. The city is to be in the center of it, 
EZK.48.16	and it will be a square, 2,520 yards on each side. 
EZK.48.17	All around the city on each side there will be an open space 140 yards across. 
EZK.48.18	The land that is left after the city has been built in the area immediately to the south of the holy area—4 miles by 2 miles on the east and 4 miles by 2 miles on the west—is to be used as farmland by the people who live in the city. 
EZK.48.19	Anyone who lives in the city, no matter which tribe he comes from, may farm that land.
EZK.48.20	And so the total area in the center of the section which was set apart will be a square measuring 10 miles on each side, and it will include the area occupied by the city.
EZK.48.21+EZK.48.22	To the east and to the west of this area which contains the Temple, the priests' land, the Levites' land, and the city, the remaining land belongs to the ruling prince. It reaches east to the eastern boundary and west to the Mediterranean Sea, and is bounded on the north by the section belonging to Judah and on the south by the one belonging to Benjamin.
EZK.48.23+EZK.48.24+EZK.48.25+EZK.48.26+EZK.48.27	South of this special section, each of the remaining tribes is to receive one section of land running from the eastern boundary west to the Mediterranean Sea, in the following order from north to south:
EZK.48.23+EZK.48.24+EZK.48.25+EZK.48.26+EZK.48.27	Benjamin

EZK.48.35	The total length of the wall on all four sides of the city is 10,080 yards. The name of the city from now on will be “The-
DAN.1.2	 The Lord let him capture King Jehoiakim and seize some of the Temple treasures. He took some prisoners back with him to the temple of his gods in Babylon, and put the captured treasures in the temple storerooms.
DAN.1.3	The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief official, to select from among the Israelite exiles some young men of the royal family and of the noble families. 
DAN.1.4	They had to be handsome, intelligent, well-trained, quick to learn, and free from physical defects, so that they would be qualified to serve in the royal court. Ashpenaz was to teach them to read and write the Babylonian language. 
DAN.1.5	The king also gave orders that every day they were to be given the same food and wine as the members of the royal court. After three years of this training they were to appear before the king. 
DAN.1.6	Among those chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah. 
DAN.1.7	The chief official gave them new names: Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
DAN.1.8	Daniel made up his mind not to let himself become ritually unclean by eating the food and drinking the wine of the royal court, so he asked Ashpenaz to help him, 
DAN.1.9	and God made Ashpenaz sympathetic to Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	Ashpenaz, however, was afraid of the king, so he said to Daniel, “The king has decided what you are to eat and drink, and if you don't look as fit as the other young men, he may kill me.”
DAN.1.11	So Daniel went to the guard whom Ashpenaz had placed in charge of him and his three friends. 
DAN.1.12	“Test us for ten days,” he said. “Give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then compare us with the young men who are eating the food of the royal court, and base your decision on how we look.”
DAN.1.14	He agreed to let them try it for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	When the time was up, they looked healthier and stronger than all those who had been eating the royal food. 
DAN.1.16	So from then on the guard let them continue to eat vegetables instead of what the king provided.
DAN.1.17	God gave the four young men knowledge and skill in literature and philosophy. In addition, he gave Daniel skill in interpreting visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	At the end of the three years set by the king, Ashpenaz took all the young men to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with them all, and Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah impressed him more than any of the others. So they became members of the king's court. 
DAN.1.20	No matter what question the king asked or what problem he raised, these four knew ten times more than any fortuneteller or magician in his whole kingdom. 
DAN.1.21	Daniel remained at the royal court until Cyrus, the emperor of Persia, conquered Babylonia.
DAN.2.1	In the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had a dream. It worried him so much that he couldn't sleep, 
DAN.2.2	so he sent for his fortunetellers, magicians, sorcerers, and wizards to come and explain the dream to him. When they came and stood before the king, 
DAN.2.3	he said to them, “I'm worried about a dream I've had. I want to know what it means.”
DAN.2.4	They answered the king in Aramaic,
DAN.2.5	The king said to them, “I have made up my mind that you must tell me the dream and then tell me what it means. If you can't, I'll have you torn limb from limb and make your houses a pile of ruins. 
DAN.2.6	But if you can tell me both the dream and its meaning, I will reward you with gifts and great honor. Now then, tell me what the dream was and what it means.”
DAN.2.7	They answered the king again, “If Your Majesty will only tell us what the dream was, we will explain it.”
DAN.2.8	At that, the king exclaimed, “Just as I thought! You are trying to gain time, because you see that I have made up my mind 
DAN.2.9	to give all of you the same punishment if you don't tell me the dream. You have agreed among yourselves to go on telling me lies because you hope that in time things will change. Tell me what the dream was, and then I will know that you can also tell me what it means.”
DAN.2.10	The advisers replied, “There is no one on the face of the earth who can tell Your Majesty what you want to know. No king, not even the greatest and most powerful, has ever made such a demand of his fortunetellers, magicians, and wizards. 
DAN.2.11	What Your Majesty is asking for is so difficult that no one can do it for you except the gods, and they do not live among human beings.”
DAN.2.12	At that, the king flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the royal advisers in Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the order was issued for all of them to be killed, including Daniel and his friends.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel went to Arioch, commander of the king's bodyguard, who had been ordered to carry out the execution. Choosing his words carefully, 
DAN.2.15	he asked Arioch why the king had issued such a harsh order. So Arioch told Daniel what had happened.
DAN.2.16	Daniel went at once and obtained royal permission for more time, so that he could tell the king what the dream meant. 
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened. 
DAN.2.18	He told them to pray to the God of heaven for mercy and to ask him to explain the mystery to them so that they would not be killed along with the other advisers in Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	Then that same night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision, and he praised the God of heaven:
DAN.2.20	“God is wise and powerful!
DAN.2.20	Praise him forever and ever.
DAN.2.21	He controls the times and the seasons;
DAN.2.21	he makes and unmakes kings;
DAN.2.21	it is he who gives wisdom and understanding.
DAN.2.22	He reveals things that are deep and secret;
DAN.2.22	he knows what is hidden in darkness,
DAN.2.22	and he himself is surrounded by light.
DAN.2.23	I praise you and honor you, God of my ancestors.
DAN.2.23	You have given me wisdom and strength;
DAN.2.23	you have answered my prayer
DAN.2.23	and shown us what to tell the king.”
DAN.2.24	So Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had commanded to execute the royal advisers. He said to him, “Don't put them to death. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”
DAN.2.25	At once Arioch took Daniel into King Nebuchadnezzar's presence and told the king, “I have found one of the Jewish exiles who can tell Your Majesty the meaning of your dream.”
DAN.2.26	The king said to Daniel (who was also called Belteshazzar), “Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”
DAN.2.27	Daniel replied, “Your Majesty, there is no wizard, magician, fortuneteller, or astrologer who can tell you that. 
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven, who reveals mysteries. He has informed Your Majesty what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you the dream, the vision you had while you were asleep.
DAN.2.29	“While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about the future; and God, who reveals mysteries, showed you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	Now, this mystery was revealed to me, not because I am wiser than anyone else, but so that Your Majesty may learn the meaning of your dream and understand the thoughts that have come to you.
DAN.2.31	“Your Majesty, in your vision you saw standing before you a giant statue, bright and shining, and terrifying to look at. 
DAN.2.32	Its head was made of the finest gold; its chest and arms were made of silver; its waist and hips of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 
DAN.2.34	While you were looking at it, a great stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it, struck the iron and clay feet of the statue, and shattered them. 
DAN.2.35	At once the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold crumbled and became like the dust on a threshing place in summer. The wind carried it all away, leaving not a trace. But the stone grew to be a mountain that covered the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream. Now I will tell Your Majesty what it means. 
DAN.2.37	Your Majesty, you are the greatest of all kings. The God of heaven has made you emperor and given you power, might, and honor. 
DAN.2.38	He has made you ruler of all the inhabited earth and ruler over all the animals and birds. You are the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	After you there will be another empire, not as great as yours, and after that a third, an empire of bronze, which will rule the whole earth. 
DAN.2.40	And then there will be a fourth empire, as strong as iron, which shatters and breaks everything. And just as iron shatters everything, it will shatter and crush all the earlier empires. 
DAN.2.41	You also saw that the feet and the toes were partly clay and partly iron. This means that it will be a divided empire. It will have something of the strength of iron, because there was iron mixed with the clay. 
DAN.2.42	The toes—partly iron and partly clay—mean that part of the empire will be strong and part of it weak. 
DAN.2.43	You also saw that the iron was mixed with the clay. This means that the rulers of that empire will try to unite their families by intermarriage, but they will not be able to, any more than iron can mix with clay. 
DAN.2.44	At the time of those rulers the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. It will never be conquered, but will completely destroy all those empires and then last forever. 
DAN.2.45	You saw how a stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it and how it struck the statue made of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God is telling Your Majesty what will happen in the future. I have told you exactly what you dreamed, and have given you its true meaning.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed to the ground and gave orders for sacrifices and offerings to be made to Daniel. 
DAN.2.47	The king said, “Your God is the greatest of all gods, the Lord over kings, and the one who reveals mysteries. I know this because you have been able to explain this mystery.” 
DAN.2.48	Then he gave Daniel a high position, presented him with many splendid gifts, put him in charge of the province of Babylon, and made him the head of all the royal advisers. 
DAN.2.49	At Daniel's request the king put Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the affairs of the province of Babylon; Daniel, however, remained at the royal court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and he had it set up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then the king gave orders for all his officials to come together—the princes, governors, lieutenant governors, commissioners, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces. They were to attend the dedication of the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.3	When all these officials gathered for the dedication and stood in front of the statue, 
DAN.3.4	a herald announced in a loud voice, “People of all nations, races, and languages! 
DAN.3.5	You will hear the sound of the trumpets, followed by the playing of oboes, lyres, zithers, and harps; and then all the other instruments will join in. As soon as the music starts, you are to bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Anyone who does not bow down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.” 
DAN.3.7	And so, as soon as they heard the sound of the instruments, the people of all the nations, races, and languages bowed down and worshiped the gold statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	It was then that some Babylonians took the opportunity to denounce the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May Your Majesty live forever! 
DAN.3.10	Your Majesty has issued an order that as soon as the music starts, everyone is to bow down and worship the gold statue, 
DAN.3.11	and that anyone who does not bow down and worship it is to be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.12	There are some Jews whom you put in charge of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who are disobeying Your Majesty's orders. They do not worship your god or bow down to the statue you set up.”
DAN.3.13	At that, the king flew into a rage and ordered the three men to be brought before him. 
DAN.3.14	He said to them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you refuse to worship my god and to bow down to the gold statue I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now then, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, oboes, lyres, zithers, harps, and all the other instruments, bow down and worship the statue. If you do not, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. Do you think there is any god who can save you?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered, “Your Majesty, we will not try to defend ourselves. 
DAN.3.17	If the God whom we serve is able to save us from the blazing furnace and from your power, then he will.
DAN.3.18	But even if he doesn't, Your Majesty may be sure that we will not worship your god, and we will not bow down to the gold statue that you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar lost his temper, and his face turned red with anger at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the strongest men in his army to tie the three men up and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.21	So they tied them up, fully dressed—shirts, robes, caps, and all—and threw them into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.22	Now because the king had given strict orders for the furnace to be made extremely hot, the flames burned up the guards who took the men to the furnace. 
DAN.3.23	 Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, still tied up, fell into the heart of the blazing fire.
DAN.3.24	Suddenly Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement. He asked his officials, “Didn't we tie up three men and throw them into the blazing furnace?”
DAN.3.24	They answered, “Yes, we did, Your Majesty.”
DAN.3.25	“Then why do I see four men walking around in the fire?” he asked. “They are not tied up, and they show no sign of being hurt—and the fourth one looks like an angel.”
DAN.3.26	So Nebuchadnezzar went up to the door of the blazing furnace and called out, “Shadrach! Meshach! Abednego! Servants of the Supreme God! Come out!” And they came out at once. 
DAN.3.27	All the princes, governors, lieutenant governors, and other officials of the king gathered to look at the three men, who had not been harmed by the fire. Their hair was not singed, their clothes were not burned, and there was no smell of smoke on them.
DAN.3.28	The king said, “Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and rescued these men who serve and trust him. They disobeyed my orders and risked their lives rather than bow down and worship any god except their own.
DAN.3.29	“And now I command that if anyone of any nation, race, or language speaks disrespectfully of the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, he is to be torn limb from limb, and his house is to be made a pile of ruins. There is no other god who can rescue like this.”
DAN.3.30	And the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to higher positions in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following message to the people of all nations, races, and languages in the world:
DAN.4.1	“Greetings! 
DAN.4.2	Listen to my account of the wonders and miracles which the Supreme God has shown me.
DAN.4.3	“How great are the wonders God shows us!
DAN.4.3	How powerful are the miracles he performs!
DAN.4.3	God is king forever; he will rule for all time.
DAN.4.4	“I was living comfortably in my palace, enjoying great prosperity. 
DAN.4.5	But I had a frightening dream and saw terrifying visions while I was asleep. 
DAN.4.6	I ordered all the royal advisers in Babylon to be brought to me so that they could tell me what the dream meant. 
DAN.4.7	Then all the fortunetellers, magicians, wizards, and astrologers were brought in, and I told them my dream, but they could not explain it to me. 
DAN.4.8	Then Daniel came in. (He is also called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god.) The spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.9	Belteshazzar, chief of the fortunetellers, I know that the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.10	“While I was asleep, I had a vision of a huge tree in the middle of the earth. 
DAN.4.11	It grew bigger and bigger until it reached the sky and could be seen by everyone in the world. 
DAN.4.12	Its leaves were beautiful, and it was loaded down with fruit—enough for the whole world to eat. Wild animals rested in its shade, birds built nests in its branches, and every kind of living being ate its fruit.
DAN.4.13	“While I was thinking about the vision, I saw coming down from heaven an angel, alert and watchful. 
DAN.4.14	He proclaimed in a loud voice, ‘Cut the tree down and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Drive the animals from under it and the birds out of its branches. 
DAN.4.15	But leave the stump in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it. Leave it there in the field with the grass.
DAN.4.15	“‘Now let the dew fall on this man, and let him live with the animals and the plants. 
DAN.4.16	For seven years he will not have a human mind, but the mind of an animal. 
DAN.4.17	This is the decision of the alert and watchful angels. So then, let all people everywhere know that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses—even to those who are least important.’
DAN.4.18	“This is the dream I had,” said King Nebuchadnezzar. “Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means. None of my royal advisers could tell me, but you can, because the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.19	At this, Daniel, who is also called Belteshazzar, was so alarmed that he could not say anything. The king said to him, “Belteshazzar, don't let the dream and its message alarm you.”
DAN.4.19	Belteshazzar replied, “Your Majesty, I wish that the dream and its explanation applied to your enemies and not to you. 
DAN.4.20	The tree, so tall that it reached the sky, could be seen by everyone in the world. 
DAN.4.21	Its leaves were beautiful, and it had enough fruit on it to feed the whole world. Wild animals rested under it, and birds made their nests in its branches.
DAN.4.22	“Your Majesty, you are the tree, tall and strong. You have grown so great that you reach the sky, and your power extends over the whole world. 
DAN.4.23	While Your Majesty was watching, an angel came down from heaven and said, ‘Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave the stump in the ground. Wrap a band of iron and bronze around it, and leave it there in the field with the grass. Let the dew fall on this man, and let him live there with the animals for seven years.’
DAN.4.24	“This, then, is what it means, Your Majesty, and this is what the Supreme God has declared will happen to you. 
DAN.4.25	You will be driven away from human society and will live with wild animals. For seven years you will eat grass like an ox and sleep in the open air, where the dew will fall on you. Then you will admit that the Supreme God controls all human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses. 
DAN.4.26	The angel ordered the stump to be left in the ground. This means that you will become king again when you acknowledge that God rules all the world. 
DAN.4.27	 So then, Your Majesty, follow my advice. Stop sinning, do what is right, and be merciful to the poor.
DAN.4.28	All this did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	Only twelve months later, while he was walking around on the roof of his royal palace in Babylon, 
DAN.4.30	he said, “Look how great Babylon is! I built it as my capital city to display my power and might, my glory and majesty.”
DAN.4.31	Before the words were out of his mouth, a voice spoke from heaven, “King Nebuchadnezzar, listen to what I say! Your royal power is now taken away from you. 
DAN.4.32	You will be driven away from human society, live with wild animals, and eat grass like an ox for seven years. Then you will acknowledge that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses.”
DAN.4.33	The words came true immediately. Nebuchadnezzar was driven out of human society and ate grass like an ox. The dew fell on his body, and his hair grew as long as eagle feathers and his nails as long as bird claws.
DAN.4.34	“He will rule forever,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom will last for all time.
DAN.4.35	He looks on the people of the earth as nothing;
DAN.4.35	angels in heaven and people on earth
DAN.4.35	are under his control.
DAN.4.35	No one can oppose his will
DAN.4.35	or question what he does.
DAN.4.36	“When my sanity returned, my honor, my majesty, and the glory of my kingdom were given back to me. My officials and my noblemen welcomed me, and I was given back my royal power with even greater honor than before.
DAN.4.37	“And now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, honor, and glorify the King of Heaven. Everything he does is right and just, and he can humble anyone who acts proudly.”
DAN.5.1	One night King Belshazzar invited a thousand noblemen to a great banquet, and they drank wine together. 
DAN.5.2	While they were drinking, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups and bowls which his father
DAN.5.3	At once the gold cups and bowls were brought in, and they all drank wine out of them 
DAN.5.4	and praised gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster wall of the palace, where the light from the lamps was shining most brightly. And the king saw the hand as it was writing. 
DAN.5.6	He turned pale and was so frightened that his knees began to shake. 
DAN.5.7	He shouted for someone to bring in the magicians, wizards, and astrologers. When they came in, the king said to them, “Anyone who can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in robes of royal purple, wear a gold chain of honor around his neck, and be the third in power in the kingdom.” 
DAN.5.8	The royal advisers came forward, but none of them could read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 
DAN.5.9	In his distress King Belshazzar grew even paler, and his noblemen had no idea what to do.
DAN.5.10	The queen mother heard the noise made by the king and his noblemen and entered the banquet hall. She said, “May Your Majesty live forever! Please do not be so disturbed and look so pale. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.5.12	He has unusual ability and is wise and skillful in interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining mysteries; so send for this man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, and he will tell you what all this means.”
DAN.5.13	Daniel was brought at once into the king's presence, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, that Jewish exile whom my father the king brought here from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard that the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.5.15	The advisers and magicians were brought in to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not discover the meaning. 
DAN.5.16	Now I have heard that you can find hidden meanings and explain mysteries. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be dressed in robes of royal purple, wear a gold chain of honor around your neck, and be the third in power in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Daniel replied, “Keep your gifts for yourself or give them to someone else. I will read for Your Majesty what has been written and tell you what it means.
DAN.5.18	“The Supreme God made your father Nebuchadnezzar a great king and gave him dignity and majesty. 
DAN.5.19	He was so great that people of all nations, races, and languages were afraid of him and trembled. If he wanted to kill someone, he did; if he wanted to keep someone alive, he did. He honored or disgraced anyone he wanted to. 
DAN.5.20	But because he became proud, stubborn, and cruel, he was removed from his royal throne and lost his place of honor. 
DAN.5.21	He was driven away from human society, and his mind became like that of an animal. He lived with wild donkeys, ate grass like an ox, and slept in the open air with nothing to protect him from the dew. Finally he admitted that the Supreme God controls all human kingdoms and can give them to anyone he chooses.
DAN.5.22	“But you, his son, have not humbled yourself, even though you knew all this. 
DAN.5.23	You acted against the Lord of heaven and brought in the cups and bowls taken from his Temple. You, your noblemen, your wives, and your concubines drank wine out of them and praised gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone—gods that cannot see or hear and that do not know anything. But you did not honor the God who determines whether you live or die and who controls everything you do. 
DAN.5.24	That is why God has sent the hand to write these words.
DAN.5.25	“This is what was written: ‘Number, number, weight, divisions.’ 
DAN.5.26	And this is what it means: 
DAN.5.27	 you have been weighed on the scales and found to be too light; 
DAN.5.28	 your kingdom is divided up and given to the Medes and Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Immediately Belshazzar ordered his servants to dress Daniel in a robe of royal purple and to hang a gold chain of honor around his neck. And he made him the third in power in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.30	That same night Belshazzar, the king of Babylonia, was killed; 
DAN.5.31	and Darius the Mede, who was then sixty-two years old, seized the royal power.
DAN.6.1	Darius decided to appoint a hundred and twenty governors to hold office throughout his empire. 
DAN.6.2	In addition, he chose Daniel and two others to supervise the governors and to look after the king's interests. 
DAN.6.3	Daniel soon showed that he could do better work than the other supervisors or the governors. Because he was so outstanding, the king considered putting him in charge of the whole empire. 
DAN.6.4	Then the other supervisors and the governors tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel administered the empire, but they couldn't, because Daniel was reliable and did not do anything wrong or dishonest. 
DAN.6.5	They said to each other, “We are not going to find anything of which to accuse Daniel unless it is something in connection with his religion.”
DAN.6.6	So they went to see the king and said, “King Darius, may Your Majesty live forever! 
DAN.6.7	All of us who administer your empire—the supervisors, the governors, the lieutenant governors, and the other officials—have agreed that Your Majesty should issue an order and enforce it strictly. Give orders that for thirty days no one be permitted to request anything from any god or from any human being except from Your Majesty. Anyone who violates this order is to be thrown into a pit filled with lions. 
DAN.6.8	So let Your Majesty issue this order and sign it, and it will be in force, a law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.” 
DAN.6.9	And so King Darius signed the order. 
DAN.6.10	When Daniel learned that the order had been signed, he went home. In an upstairs room of his house there were windows that faced toward Jerusalem. There, just as he had always done, he knelt down at the open windows and prayed to God three times a day.
DAN.6.11	When Daniel's enemies observed him praying to God, 
DAN.6.12	all of them went together to the king to accuse Daniel. They said, “Your Majesty, you signed an order that for the next thirty days anyone who requested anything from any god or from any human being except you, would be thrown into a pit filled with lions.”
DAN.6.12	The king replied, “Yes, that is a strict order, a law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.”
DAN.6.13	Then they said to the king, “Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, does not respect Your Majesty or obey the order you issued. He prays regularly three times a day.”
DAN.6.14	When the king heard this, he was upset and did his best to find some way to rescue Daniel. He kept trying until sunset. 
DAN.6.15	Then Daniel's enemies came back to the king and said to him, “Your Majesty knows that according to the laws of the Medes and Persians no order which the king issues can be changed.”
DAN.6.17	A stone was put over the mouth of the pit, and the king placed his own royal seal and the seal of his noblemen on the stone, so that no one could rescue Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king returned to the palace and spent a sleepless night, without food or any form of entertainment.
DAN.6.19	At dawn the king got up and hurried to the pit. 
DAN.6.20	When he got there, he called out anxiously, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Was the God you serve so loyally able to save you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Daniel answered, “May Your Majesty live forever! 
DAN.6.22	 God sent his angel to shut the mouths of the lions so that they would not hurt me. He did this because he knew that I was innocent and because I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.”
DAN.6.23	The king was overjoyed and gave orders for Daniel to be pulled up out of the pit. So they pulled him up and saw that he had not been hurt at all, for he trusted God. 
DAN.6.24	Then the king gave orders to arrest all those who had accused Daniel, and he had them thrown, together with their wives and children, into the pit filled with lions. Before they even reached the bottom of the pit, the lions pounced on them and broke all their bones.
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote to the people of all nations, races, and languages on earth:
DAN.6.25	“Greetings! 
DAN.6.26	I command that throughout my empire everyone should fear and respect Daniel's God.
DAN.6.26	“He is a living God,
DAN.6.26	and he will rule forever.
DAN.6.26	His kingdom will never be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	and his power will never come to an end.
DAN.6.27	He saves and rescues;
DAN.6.27	he performs wonders and miracles
DAN.6.27	in heaven and on earth.
DAN.6.27	He saved Daniel from being killed by the lions.”
DAN.6.28	Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylonia, I had a dream and saw a vision in the night. I wrote the dream down, and this is the record 
DAN.7.2	of what I saw that night:
DAN.7.2	Winds were blowing from all directions and lashing the surface of the ocean. 
DAN.7.3	 Four huge beasts came up out of the ocean, each one different from the others. 
DAN.7.4	 The first one looked like a lion, but had wings like an eagle. While I was watching, the wings were torn off. The beast was lifted up and made to stand up straight. And then a human mind was given to it.
DAN.7.5	The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs. It was holding three ribs between its teeth, and a voice said to it, “Go on, eat as much meat as you can!”
DAN.7.6	While I was watching, another beast appeared. It looked like a leopard, but on its back there were four wings, like the wings of a bird, and it had four heads. It had a look of authority about it.
DAN.7.8	 While I was staring at the horns, I saw a little horn coming up among the others. It tore out three of the horns that were already there. This horn had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting proudly.
DAN.7.10	 and a stream of fire was pouring out from it. There were many thousands of people there to serve him, and millions of people stood before him. The court began its session, and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	While I was looking, I could still hear the little horn bragging and boasting. As I watched, the fourth beast was killed, and its body was thrown into the flames and destroyed. 
DAN.7.12	The other beasts had their power taken away, but they were permitted to go on living for a limited time.
DAN.7.14	 He was given authority, honor, and royal power, so that the people of all nations, races, and languages would serve him. His authority would last forever, and his kingdom would never end.
DAN.7.15	The visions I saw alarmed me, and I was deeply disturbed.
DAN.7.16	I went up to one of those standing there and asked him to explain it all. So he told me the meaning. 
DAN.7.17	He said, “These four huge beasts are four empires which will arise on earth. 
DAN.7.18	 And the people of the Supreme God will receive royal power and keep it forever and ever.”
DAN.7.19	Then I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, which was not like any of the others—the terrifying beast which crushed its victims with its bronze claws and iron teeth and then trampled on them. 
DAN.7.20	And I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the horn that had come up afterward and had made three of the horns fall. It had eyes and a mouth and was boasting proudly. It was more terrifying than any of the others.
DAN.7.22	 Then the one who had been living forever came and pronounced judgment in favor of
DAN.7.23	This is the explanation I was given: “The fourth beast is a fourth empire that will be on the earth and will be different from all other empires. It will crush the whole earth and trample it down. 
DAN.7.24	 The ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will appear; he will be very different from the earlier ones and will overthrow three kings. 
DAN.7.25	 He will speak against the Supreme God and oppress God's people. He will try to change their religious laws and festivals, and God's people will be under his power for three and a half years. 
DAN.7.26	Then the heavenly court will sit in judgment, take away his power, and destroy him completely. 
DAN.7.27	 The power and greatness of all the kingdoms on earth will be given to the people of the Supreme God. Their royal power will never end, and all rulers on earth will serve and obey them.”
DAN.7.28	This is the end of the account. I was so frightened that I turned pale, and I kept everything to myself.
DAN.8.1	In the third year that Belshazzar was king, I saw a second vision.
DAN.8.2	In the vision I suddenly found myself in the walled city of Susa in the province of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai River, 
DAN.8.3	and there beside the river I saw a ram that had two long horns, one of which was longer and newer than the other. 
DAN.8.4	I watched the ram butting with his horns to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stop him or escape his power. He did as he pleased and grew arrogant.
DAN.8.5	While I was wondering what this meant, a goat came rushing out of the west, moving so fast that his feet didn't touch the ground. He had one prominent horn between his eyes. 
DAN.8.6	He came toward the ram, which I had seen standing beside the river, and rushed at him with all his force. 
DAN.8.7	I watched him attack the ram. He was so angry that he smashed into him and broke the two horns. The ram had no strength to resist. He was thrown to the ground and trampled on, and there was no one who could save him.
DAN.8.8	The goat grew more and more arrogant, but at the height of his power his horn was broken. In its place four prominent horns came up, each pointing in a different direction. 
DAN.8.9	Out of one of these four horns grew a little horn, whose power extended toward the south and the east and toward the Promised Land. 
DAN.8.10	 It grew strong enough to attack the army of heaven, the stars themselves, and it threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them. 
DAN.8.11	It even defied the Prince of the heavenly army, stopped the daily sacrifices offered to him, and ruined the Temple. 
DAN.8.12	People sinned there instead of offering the proper daily sacrifices,
DAN.8.13	Then I heard one angel ask another, “How long will these things that were seen in the vision continue? How long will an awful sin replace the daily sacrifices? How long will the army of heaven and the Temple be trampled on?”
DAN.8.14	I heard the other angel answer, “It will continue for 2,300 evenings and mornings, during which sacrifices will not be offered. Then the Temple will be restored.”
DAN.8.15	I was trying to understand what the vision meant, when suddenly someone was standing in front of me. 
DAN.8.16	 I heard a voice call out over the Ulai River, “Gabriel, explain to him the meaning of what he saw.” 
DAN.8.17	Gabriel came and stood beside me, and I was so terrified that I fell to the ground.
DAN.8.17	He said to me, “Mortal man, understand the meaning. The vision has to do with the end of the world.” 
DAN.8.18	While he was talking, I fell to the ground unconscious. But he took hold of me, raised me to my feet, 
DAN.8.19	and said, “I am showing you what the result of God's anger will be. The vision refers to the time of the end.
DAN.8.20	“The ram you saw that had two horns represents the kingdoms of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the prominent horn between his eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	The four horns that came up when the first horn was broken represent the four kingdoms into which that nation will be divided and which will not be as strong as the first kingdom.
DAN.8.23	“When the end of those kingdoms is near and they have become so wicked that they must be punished, there will be a stubborn, vicious, and deceitful king. 
DAN.8.24	He will grow strong—but not by his own power. He will cause terrible destruction and be successful in everything he does. He will bring destruction on powerful men and on God's own people. 
DAN.8.25	Because he is cunning, he will succeed in his deceitful ways. He will be proud of himself and destroy many people without warning. He will even defy the greatest King of all, but he will be destroyed without the use of any human power. 
DAN.8.26	This vision about the evening and morning sacrifices which has been explained to you will come true. But keep it secret now, because it will be a long time before it does come true.”
DAN.8.27	I was depressed and ill for several days. Then I got up and went back to the work that the king had assigned to me, but I was puzzled by the vision and could not understand it.
DAN.9.1	Darius the Mede, who was the son of Xerxes, ruled over the kingdom of Babylonia. 
DAN.9.2	 In the first year of his reign I was studying the sacred books and thinking about the seventy years that Jerusalem would be in ruins, according to what the 
DAN.9.3	And I prayed earnestly to the Lord God, pleading with him, fasting, wearing sackcloth, and sitting in ashes. 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	I said, “Lord God, you are great, and we honor you. You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love to those who love you and do what you command.
DAN.9.5	“We have sinned, we have been evil, we have done wrong. We have rejected what you commanded us to do and have turned away from what you showed us was right. 
DAN.9.6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our rulers, our ancestors, and our whole nation. 
DAN.9.7	 You, Lord, always do what is right, but we have always brought disgrace on ourselves. This is true of all of us who live in Judea and in Jerusalem and of all the Israelites whom you scattered in countries near and far because they were unfaithful to you. 
DAN.9.8	Our kings, our rulers, and our ancestors have acted shamefully and sinned against you, Lord. 
DAN.9.9	You are merciful and forgiving, although we have rebelled against you. 
DAN.9.10	We did not listen to you, O 
DAN.9.11	 All Israel broke your laws and refused to listen to what you said. We sinned against you, and so you brought on us the curses that are written in the Law of Moses, your servant. 
DAN.9.12	You did what you said you would do to us and our rulers. You punished Jerusalem more severely than any other city on earth, 
DAN.9.13	giving us all the punishment described in the Law of Moses. But even now, O 
DAN.9.14	You, O 
DAN.9.16	You have defended us in the past, so do not be angry with Jerusalem any longer. It is your city, your sacred hill.
DAN.9.17	 O God, hear my prayer and pleading. Restore your Temple, which has been destroyed; restore it so that everyone will know that you are God. 
DAN.9.18	 Listen to us, O God; look at us and see the trouble we are in and the suffering of the city that bears your name. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done right. 
DAN.9.19	Lord, hear us. Lord, forgive us. Lord, listen to us, and act! In order that everyone will know that you are God, do not delay! This city and these people are yours.”
DAN.9.20	I went on praying, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel and pleading with the 
DAN.9.21	 While I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came flying down to where I was. It was the time for the evening sacrifice to be offered. 
DAN.9.22	He explained, “Daniel, I have come here to help you understand the prophecy. 
DAN.9.23	When you began to plead with God, he answered you. He loves you, and so I have come to tell you the answer. Now pay attention while I explain the vision.
DAN.9.24	“Seven times seventy years is the length of time God has set for freeing your people and your holy city from sin and evil. Sin will be forgiven and eternal justice established, so that the vision and the prophecy will come true, and the holy Temple
DAN.9.25	Note this and understand it: From the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until God's chosen leader comes, seven times seven years will pass. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses, and will stand for seven times sixty-two years, but this will be a time of troubles. 
DAN.9.26	And at the end of that time God's chosen leader will be killed unjustly.
DAN.9.27	 That ruler will have a firm agreement with many people for seven years, and when half this time is past, he will put an end to sacrifices and offerings. The Awful Horror
DAN.10.1	In the third year that Cyrus was emperor of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who is also called Belteshazzar. The message was true but extremely hard to understand.
DAN.10.2	At that time I was mourning for three weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I did not eat any rich food or any meat, drink any wine, or comb my hair until the three weeks were past.
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month of the year I was standing on the bank of the mighty Tigris River. 
DAN.10.5	 I looked up and saw someone who was wearing linen clothes and a belt of fine gold. 
DAN.10.6	His body shone like a jewel. His face was as bright as a flash of lightning, and his eyes blazed like fire. His arms and legs shone like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a great crowd.
DAN.10.7	I was the only one who saw the vision. Those who were with me did not see anything, but they were terrified and ran and hid. 
DAN.10.8	I was left there alone, watching this amazing vision. I had no strength left, and my face was so changed that no one could have recognized me. 
DAN.10.9	When I heard his voice, I fell to the ground unconscious and lay there face downward. 
DAN.10.10	Then a hand took hold of me and raised me to my hands and knees; I was still trembling.
DAN.10.11	The angel said to me, “Daniel, God loves you. Stand up and listen carefully to what I am going to say. I have been sent to you.” When he had said this, I stood up, still trembling.
DAN.10.12	Then he said, “Daniel, don't be afraid. God has heard your prayers ever since the first day you decided to humble yourself in order to gain understanding. I have come in answer to your prayer. 
DAN.10.13	 The angel prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief angels, came to help me, because I had been left there alone in Persia. 
DAN.10.14	I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the future. This is a vision about the future.”
DAN.10.15	When he said this, I stared at the ground, speechless. 
DAN.10.16	Then the angel, who looked like a human being, reached out and touched my lips. I said to him, “Sir, this vision makes me so weak that I can't stop trembling. 
DAN.10.17	I am like a slave standing before his master. How can I talk to you? I have no strength or breath left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Once more he took hold of me, and I felt stronger. 
DAN.10.19	He said, “God loves you, so don't let anything worry you or frighten you.”
DAN.10.19	When he had said this, I felt even stronger and said, “Sir, tell me what you have to say. You have made me feel better.”
DAN.10.20+DAN.10.21	He said, “Do you know why I came to you? It is to reveal to you what is written in the Book of Truth. Now I have to go back and fight the guardian angel of Persia. After that the guardian angel of Greece will appear. There is no one to help me except Michael, Israel's guardian angel.
DAN.11.1	He is
DAN.11.2	And what I am now going to tell you is true.”
DAN.11.2	The angel said, “Three more kings will rule over Persia, followed by a fourth, who will be richer than all the others. At the height of his power and wealth he will challenge the kingdom of Greece.
DAN.11.3	“Then a heroic king will appear. He will rule over a huge empire and do whatever he wants. 
DAN.11.4	But at the height of his power his empire will break up and be divided into four parts. Kings not descended from him will rule in his place, but they will not have the power that he had.
DAN.11.5	“The king of Egypt will be strong. One of his generals, however, will be even stronger and rule a greater kingdom. 
DAN.11.6	After a number of years the king of Egypt will make an alliance with the king of Syria and give him his daughter in marriage. But the alliance will not last, and she, her husband, her child,
DAN.11.7	Soon afterward one of her relatives will become king. He will attack the army of the king of Syria, enter their fortress, and defeat them. 
DAN.11.8	He will carry back to Egypt the images of their gods and the articles of gold and silver dedicated to those gods. After several years of peace 
DAN.11.9	the king of Syria will invade Egypt, but he will be forced to retreat.
DAN.11.10	“The sons of the king of Syria will prepare for war and gather a large army. One of them will sweep on like a flood and attack an enemy fortress. 
DAN.11.11	In his anger the king of Egypt will go to war against the king of Syria and capture his huge army. 
DAN.11.12	He will be proud of his victory and of the many soldiers he has killed, but he will not continue to be victorious.
DAN.11.13	“The king of Syria will go back and gather a larger army than he had before. When the proper time comes, he will return with a large, well-equipped army. 
DAN.11.14	Then many people will rebel against the king of Egypt. And some violent people from your nation, Daniel, will rebel because of a vision they have seen, but they will be defeated. 
DAN.11.15	So the king of Syria will lay siege to a fortified city and capture it. The soldiers of Egypt will not continue to fight; even the best of them will not have enough strength. 
DAN.11.16	The Syrian invader will do with them as he pleases, without opposition. He will stand in the Promised Land and have it completely in his power.
DAN.11.17	“The king of Syria will plan an expedition, using his whole army. Then, in order to destroy his enemy's kingdom, he will make an alliance with him and offer him his daughter
DAN.11.18	After that he will attack the nations by the sea and conquer many of them. But a foreign leader will defeat him and put an end to his arrogance; indeed he will turn the arrogance of Syria's king back on him.
DAN.11.19	The king will return to the fortresses of his own land, but he will be defeated, and that will be the end of him.
DAN.11.20	“He will be followed by another king, who will send an officer to oppress the people with taxes in order to increase the wealth of his kingdom. In a short time that king will be killed, but not publicly and not in battle.”
DAN.11.21	The angel went on to explain: “The next king of Syria will be an evil man who has no right to be king, but he will come unexpectedly and seize power by trickery. 
DAN.11.22	Anyone who opposes him, even God's High Priest, will be swept away and wiped out. 
DAN.11.23	By making treaties, he will deceive other nations, and he will grow stronger and stronger, even though he rules only a small nation. 
DAN.11.24	He will invade a wealthy province without warning and will do things that none of his ancestors ever did. Then he will divide among his followers the goods and property he has captured in war. He will make plans to attack fortresses, but his time will soon run out.
DAN.11.25	“He will boldly raise a large army to attack the king of Egypt, who will prepare to fight back with a huge and powerful army. But the king of Egypt will be deceived and will not be successful. 
DAN.11.26	His closest advisers will ruin him. Many of his soldiers will be killed, and his army will be wiped out. 
DAN.11.27	Then the two kings will sit down to eat at the same table, but their motives will be evil, and they will lie to each other. They will not get what they want, because the time for it has not yet come. 
DAN.11.28	The king of Syria will return home with all the loot he has captured, determined to destroy the religion of God's people. He will do as he pleases and then return to his own land.
DAN.11.29	“Later on he will invade Egypt again, but this time things will turn out differently. 
DAN.11.30	 The Romans will come in ships and oppose him, and he will be frightened.
DAN.11.30	“Then he will turn back in a rage and try to destroy the religion of God's people. He will follow the advice of those who have abandoned that religion. 
DAN.11.31	 Some of his soldiers will make the Temple ritually unclean. They will stop the daily sacrifices and set up The Awful Horror.
DAN.11.32	By deceit the king will win the support of those who have already abandoned their religion, but those who follow God will fight back. 
DAN.11.33	Wise leaders of the people will share their wisdom with many others. But for a while some of them will be killed in battle or be burned to death, and some will be robbed and made prisoners. 
DAN.11.34	While the killing is going on, God's people will receive a little help, even though many who join them will do so for selfish reasons. 
DAN.11.35	Some of those wise leaders will be killed, but as a result of this the people will be purified. This will continue until the end comes, the time that God has set.
DAN.11.37	The king will ignore the god his ancestors served, and also the god that women love. In fact, he will ignore every god, because he will think he is greater than any of them. 
DAN.11.38	Instead, he will honor the god who protects fortresses. He will offer gold, silver, jewels, and other rich gifts to a god his ancestors never worshiped. 
DAN.11.39	To defend his fortresses, he will use people who worship a foreign god. He will give great honor to those who accept him as ruler, put them into high offices, and give them land as a reward.
DAN.11.40	“When the king of Syria's final hour has almost come, the king of Egypt will attack him, and the king of Syria will fight back with all his power, using chariots, horses, and many ships. He will invade many countries, like the waters of a flood. 
DAN.11.41	He will even invade the Promised Land and kill tens of thousands, but the countries of Edom, Moab, and what is left of Ammon will escape. 
DAN.11.42	When he invades all those countries, even Egypt will not be spared. 
DAN.11.43	He will take away Egypt's hidden treasures of gold and silver and its other prized possessions. He will conquer Libya and Ethiopia.
DAN.11.44	Then news that comes from the east and the north will frighten him, and he will fight furiously, killing many people. 
DAN.11.45	He will even set up his huge royal tents between the sea and the mountain on which the Temple stands. But he will die, with no one there to help him.”
DAN.12.2	 Many of those who have already died will live again: some will enjoy eternal life, and some will suffer eternal disgrace. 
DAN.12.3	 The wise leaders will shine with all the brightness of the sky. And those who have taught many people to do what is right will shine like the stars forever.”
DAN.12.5	Then I saw two men standing by a river, one on each bank. 
DAN.12.6	One of them asked the angel who was standing further upstream, “How long will it be until these amazing events come to an end?”
DAN.12.8	I heard what he said, but I did not understand it. So I asked, “But, sir, how will it all end?”
DAN.12.9	He answered, “You must go now, Daniel, because these words are to be kept secret and hidden until the end comes. 
DAN.12.10	 Many people will be purified. Those who are wicked will not understand but will go on being wicked; only those who are wise will understand.
DAN.12.12	Happy are those who remain faithful until 1,335 days are over!
DAN.12.13	“And you, Daniel, be faithful to the end. Then you will die, but you will rise to receive your reward at the end of time.”
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.3	So Hosea married a woman named Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. After the birth of their first child, a son, 
HOS.1.4	 the 
HOS.1.5	And in Jezreel Valley I will at that time destroy Israel's military power.”
HOS.1.6	Gomer had a second child—this time it was a daughter. The 
HOS.1.7	But to the people of Judah I will show love. I, the 
HOS.1.8	After Gomer had weaned her daughter, she became pregnant again and had another son. 
HOS.1.9	The 
HOS.1.11	The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited. They will choose for themselves a single leader, and once again they will grow and prosper in their land. Yes, the day of Jezreel
HOS.2.1	So call your fellow Israelites “God's People” and “Loved-by-the-Lord.”
HOS.2.2	My children, plead with your mother—though she is no longer a wife to me, and I am no longer her husband. Plead with her to stop her adultery and prostitution. 
HOS.2.3	If she does not, I will strip her as naked as she was on the day she was born. I will make her like a dry and barren land, and she will die of thirst. 
HOS.2.4+HOS.2.5	I will not show mercy to her children; they are the children of a shameless prostitute.
HOS.2.6	So I am going to fence her in with thorn bushes and build a wall to block her way. 
HOS.2.7	She will run after her lovers but will not catch them. She will look for them but will not find them. Then she will say, “I am going back to my first husband—I was better off then than I am now.”
HOS.2.8	She would never acknowledge that I am the one who gave her the grain, the wine, the olive oil, and all the silver and gold that she used in the worship of Baal. 
HOS.2.9	So at harvest time I will take back my gifts of grain and wine, and will take away the wool and the linen I gave her for clothing. 
HOS.2.10	I will strip her naked in front of her lovers, and no one will be able to save her from my power. 
HOS.2.11	I will put an end to all her festivities—her annual and monthly festivals and her Sabbath celebrations—all her religious meetings. 
HOS.2.12	I will destroy her grapevines and her fig trees, which she said her lovers gave her for serving them. I will turn her vineyards and orchards into a wilderness; wild animals will destroy them. 
HOS.2.13	I will punish her for the times that she forgot me, when she burned incense to Baal and put on her jewelry to go chasing after her lovers. The 
HOS.2.14	So I am going to take her into the desert again; there I will win her back with words of love. 
HOS.2.15	 I will give back to her the vineyards she had and make Trouble Valley a door of hope. She will respond to me there as she did when she was young, when she came from Egypt. 
HOS.2.16	Then once again she will call me her husband—she will no longer call me her Baal.
HOS.2.17	I will never let her speak the name of Baal again.
HOS.2.18	At that time I will make a covenant with all the wild animals and birds, so that they will not harm my people. I will also remove all weapons of war from the land, all swords and bows, and will let my people live in peace and safety.
HOS.2.19	Israel, I will make you my wife;
HOS.2.19	I will be true and faithful;
HOS.2.19	I will show you constant love and mercy
HOS.2.19	and make you mine forever.
HOS.2.20	I will keep my promise and make you mine,
HOS.2.20	and you will acknowledge me as 
HOS.2.21+HOS.2.22	At that time I will answer the prayers of my people Israel.
HOS.2.21+HOS.2.22	I will make rain fall on the earth,
HOS.2.21+HOS.2.22	and the earth will produce grain and grapes and olives.
HOS.2.23	I will show love to those who were called “Unloved,”
HOS.2.23	and to those who were called “Not-My-People”
HOS.2.23	I will say, “You are my people,”
HOS.2.23	and they will answer, “You are our God.”
HOS.3.1	The 
HOS.3.2	So I paid fifteen pieces of silver and seven bushels of barley to buy her. 
HOS.3.3	I told her that for a long time she would have to wait for me without being a prostitute or committing adultery; and during this time I would wait for her. 
HOS.3.4	In just this way the people of Israel will have to live for a long time without kings or leaders, without sacrifices or sacred stone pillars, without idols or images to use for divination. 
HOS.3.5	But the time will come when the people of Israel will once again turn to the 
HOS.4.1	The 
HOS.4.2	They make promises and break them; they lie, murder, steal, and commit adultery. Crimes increase, and there is one murder after another. 
HOS.4.3	And so the land will dry up, and everything that lives on it will die. All the animals and birds, and even the fish, will die.”
HOS.4.4	The 
HOS.4.5	Night and day you blunder on, and the prophets do no better than you. I am going to destroy Israel, your mother. 
HOS.4.6	My people are doomed because they do not acknowledge me. You priests have refused to acknowledge me and have rejected my teaching, and so I reject you and will not acknowledge your sons as my priests.
HOS.4.7	“The more of you priests there are, the more you sin against me, and so I will turn your honor into disgrace. 
HOS.4.8	You grow rich from the sins of my people, and so you want them to sin more and more. 
HOS.4.9	You will suffer the same punishment as the people! I will punish you and make you pay for the evil you do. 
HOS.4.10	You will eat your share of the sacrifices, but still be hungry. You will worship the fertility gods, but still have no children, because you have turned away from me to follow other gods.”
HOS.4.11	The 
HOS.4.12	They ask for revelations from a piece of wood! A stick tells them what they want to know! They have left me. Like a woman who becomes a prostitute, they have given themselves to other gods. 
HOS.4.13	At sacred places on the mountaintops they offer sacrifices, and on the hills they burn incense under tall, spreading trees, because the shade is so pleasant!
HOS.4.13	“As a result, your daughters serve as prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 
HOS.4.14	Yet I will not punish them for this, because you yourselves go off with temple prostitutes,
HOS.4.15	“Even though you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, may Judah not be guilty of the same thing. Don't worship at Gilgal or Bethaven,
HOS.4.16	The people of Israel are as stubborn as mules. How can I feed them like lambs in a meadow? 
HOS.4.17	The people of Israel are under the spell of idols. Let them go their own way. 
HOS.4.18	After drinking much wine, they delight in their prostitution, preferring disgrace to honor. 
HOS.4.19	They will be carried away as by the wind, and they will be ashamed of their pagan sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	“Listen to this, you priests! Pay attention, people of Israel! Listen, you that belong to the royal family! You are supposed to judge with justice—so judgment will fall on you! You have become a trap at Mizpah, a net spread on Mount Tabor, 
HOS.5.2	a deep pit at Acacia City,
HOS.5.3	I know what Israel is like—she cannot hide from me. She has been unfaithful, and her people are unfit to worship me.”
HOS.5.4	The evil that the people have done keeps them from returning to their God. Idolatry has a powerful hold on them, and they do not acknowledge the 
HOS.5.5	The arrogance of the people of Israel cries out against them. Their sins make them stumble and fall, and the people of Judah fall with them. 
HOS.5.6	They take their sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the 
HOS.5.7	They have been unfaithful to the 
HOS.5.8	Blow the war trumpets in Gibeah! Sound the alarm in Ramah! Raise the war cry at Bethaven!
HOS.5.9	The day of punishment is coming, and Israel will be ruined. People of Israel, this will surely happen!
HOS.5.10	The 
HOS.5.11	Israel is suffering oppression; she has lost land that was rightfully hers, because she insisted on going for help to those who had none to give.
HOS.5.12	I will bring destruction on Israel and ruin on the people of Judah.
HOS.5.13	“When Israel saw how sick she was and when Judah saw her own wounds, then Israel went to Assyria to ask the great emperor for help, but he could not cure them or heal their wounds. 
HOS.5.14	I will attack the people of Israel and Judah like a lion. I myself will tear them to pieces and then leave them. When I drag them off, no one will be able to save them.
HOS.5.15	“I will abandon my people until they have suffered enough for their sins and come looking for me. Perhaps in their suffering they will try to find me.”
HOS.6.1	The people say, “Let's return to the 
HOS.6.2	In two or three days he will revive us, and we will live in his presence. 
HOS.6.3	Let us try to know the 
HOS.6.4	But the 
HOS.6.5	That is why I have sent my prophets to you with my message of judgment and destruction. What I want from you is plain and clear: 
HOS.6.6	 I want your constant love, not your animal sacrifices. I would rather have my people know me than burn offerings to me.
HOS.6.7	“But as soon as they entered the land at Adam,
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city full of evil people and murderers. 
HOS.6.9	The priests are like a gang of robbers who wait in ambush for someone. Even on the road to the holy place at Shechem they commit murder. And they do all this evil deliberately! 
HOS.6.10	I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: my people have defiled themselves by worshiping idols.
HOS.6.11	“And as for you, people of Judah, I have set a time to punish you also for what you are doing.
HOS.7.1	“Whenever I want to heal my people Israel and make them prosperous again, all I can see is their wickedness and the evil they do. They cheat one another; they break into houses and steal; they rob people in the streets. 
HOS.7.2	It never enters their heads that I will remember all this evil; but their sins surround them, and I cannot avoid seeing them.”
HOS.7.3	The 
HOS.7.4	They are all treacherous and disloyal. Their hatred smolders like the fire in an oven, which is not stirred by the baker until the dough is ready to bake. 
HOS.7.5	On the day of the king's celebration they made the king and his officials drunk and foolish with wine. 
HOS.7.6	Yes, they burned
HOS.7.7	“In the heat of their anger they murdered their rulers. Their kings have been assassinated one after another, but no one prays to me for help.”
HOS.7.8	The 
HOS.7.9	and do not realize that this reliance on foreigners has robbed them of their strength. Their days are numbered, but they don't even know it. 
HOS.7.10	The arrogance of the people of Israel cries out against them. In spite of everything that has happened, they have not returned to me, the 
HOS.7.11	Israel flits around like a silly pigeon; first her people call on Egypt for help, and then they run to Assyria! 
HOS.7.12	But I will spread out a net and catch them like birds as they go by. I will punish them for the evil they have done.
HOS.7.13	“They are doomed! They have left me and rebelled against me. They will be destroyed. I wanted to save them, but their worship of me was false. 
HOS.7.14	They have not prayed to me sincerely, but instead they throw themselves down and wail as the heathen do. When they pray for grain and wine, they gash themselves like pagans. What rebels they are! 
HOS.7.15	Even though I was the one who brought them up and made them strong, they plotted against me. 
HOS.7.16	They keep on turning away from me to a god that is powerless.
HOS.8.1	The 
HOS.8.2	Even though they call me their God and claim that they are my people and that they know me, 
HOS.8.3	they have rejected what is good. Because of this their enemies will pursue them.
HOS.8.4	“My people chose kings, but they did it on their own. They appointed leaders, but without my approval. They took their silver and gold and made idols—for their own destruction. 
HOS.8.5	I hate the gold bull worshiped by the people of the city of Samaria. I am furious with them. How long will it be before they give up their idolatry? 
HOS.8.6	An Israelite craftsman made the idol, and it is not a god at all! The gold bull worshiped in Samaria will be smashed to pieces! 
HOS.8.7	When they sow the wind, they will reap a storm! A field of grain that doesn't ripen can never produce any bread. But even if it did, foreigners would eat it up. 
HOS.8.8	Israel has become like any other nation and is as useless as a broken pot. 
HOS.8.9	Stubborn as wild donkeys, the people of Israel go their own way. They have gone off to seek help from Assyria and have paid other nations to protect them. 
HOS.8.10	But now I am going to gather them together and punish them. Soon they will writhe in pain when the emperor of Assyria oppresses them.
HOS.8.11	“The more altars the people of Israel build for removing sin, the more places they have for sinning! 
HOS.8.12	I write down countless teachings for the people, but they reject them as strange and foreign. 
HOS.8.13	They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of the sacrifices.
HOS.8.14	“The people of Israel have built palaces, but they have forgotten their own Maker. The people of Judah have built fortified cities. But I will send fire that will burn down their palaces and their cities.”
HOS.9.1	People of Israel, stop celebrating your festivals like pagans. You have turned away from your God and have been unfaithful to him. All over the land you have sold yourselves like prostitutes to the god Baal and have loved the grain you thought he paid you with! 
HOS.9.2	But soon you will not have enough grain and olive oil, and there will be no wine. 
HOS.9.3	The people of Israel will not remain in the 
HOS.9.4	In those foreign lands they will not be able to make wine offerings to the

HOS.9.6	When the disaster comes and the people are scattered, the Egyptians will gather them up—gather them for burial there at Memphis! Their treasures of silver and the places where their homes once stood will be overgrown with weeds and thorn bushes.
HOS.9.8	God has sent me as a prophet to warn his people Israel. Yet wherever I go, you try to trap me like a bird. Even in God's Temple the people are the prophet's enemies. 
HOS.9.9	 They are hopelessly evil in what they do, just as they were at Gibeah.
HOS.9.11	Israel's greatness will fly away like a bird, and there will be no more children born to them, no more women pregnant, no more children conceived. 
HOS.9.12	But even if they did bring up children, I would take them away and not leave one alive. When I abandon these people, terrible things will happen to them.”
HOS.9.14	What shall I ask you to do to these people? Make their women barren! Make them unable to nurse their babies!
HOS.9.15	The 
HOS.9.16	The people of Israel are like a plant whose roots have dried up and which bears no fruit. They will have no children, but even if they did, I would kill the children so dear to them.”
HOS.9.17	The God I serve will reject his people, because they have not listened to him. They will become wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	The people of Israel were like a grapevine that was full of grapes. The more prosperous they were, the more altars they built. The more productive their land was, the more beautiful they made the sacred stone pillars they worship. 
HOS.10.2	The people whose hearts are deceitful must now suffer for their sins. God will break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars.
HOS.10.3	These people will soon be saying, “We have no king because we did not fear the 
HOS.10.4	They utter empty words and make false promises and useless treaties. Justice has become injustice, growing like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.
HOS.10.5	The people who live in the city of Samaria will be afraid and will mourn the loss of the gold bull
HOS.10.6	The idol will be carried off to Assyria as tribute to the great emperor. The people of Israel will be disgraced and put to shame because of the advice they followed. 
HOS.10.7	Their king will be carried off, like a chip of wood on water. 
HOS.10.8	 The hilltop shrines of Aven,
HOS.10.10	I will attack
HOS.10.11	“Israel was once like a well-trained young cow, ready and willing to thresh grain. But I decided to put a yoke
HOS.10.12	 I said, ‘Plow new ground for yourselves, plant righteousness, and reap the blessings that your devotion to me will produce. It is time for you to turn to me, your 
HOS.10.13	But instead you planted evil and reaped its harvest. You have eaten the fruit produced by your lies.
HOS.10.13	“Because you trusted in your chariots
HOS.10.14	war will come to your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed. It will be like the day when King Shalman destroyed the city of Betharbel in battle, and mothers and their children were crushed to death. 
HOS.10.15	That is what will happen to you, people of Bethel, because of the terrible evil that you have done. As soon as the battle begins, the king of Israel will die.”

HOS.11.2	My people sacrificed to Baal;
HOS.11.2	they burned incense to idols.
HOS.11.3	Yet I was the one who taught Israel to walk.
HOS.11.3	I took my people up in my arms,
HOS.11.3	but they did not acknowledge that I took care of them.
HOS.11.4	I drew them to me with affection and love.
HOS.11.4	I picked them up and held them to my cheek;
HOS.11.4	I bent down to them and fed them.
HOS.11.5	“They refuse to return to me, and so they must return to Egypt, and Assyria will rule them. 
HOS.11.6	War will sweep through their cities and break down the city gates. It will destroy my people because they do what they themselves think best. 
HOS.11.7	They insist on turning away from me. They will cry out because of the yoke that is on them, but no one will lift it from them.
HOS.11.8	How can I abandon you?
HOS.11.8	Could I ever destroy you as I did Admah,
HOS.11.8	or treat you as I did Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	My heart will not let me do it!
HOS.11.8	My love for you is too strong.
HOS.11.9	I will not punish you in my anger;
HOS.11.9	I will not destroy Israel again.
HOS.11.9	For I am God and not a mere human being.
HOS.11.9	I, the Holy One, am with you.
HOS.11.9	I will not come to you in anger.
HOS.11.10	“My people will follow me when I roar like a lion at their enemies. They will hurry to me from the west. 
HOS.11.11	They will come from Egypt, as swiftly as birds, and from Assyria, like doves. I will bring them to their homes again. I, the 
HOS.11.12	The 
HOS.12.1	Everything that the people of Israel do from morning to night is useless and destructive. Treachery and acts of violence increase among them. They make treaties with Assyria and do business with Egypt.”
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.4	 he fought against an angel and won. He wept and asked for a blessing. And at Bethel God came to our ancestor Jacob and spoke with him.
HOS.12.5	This was the 
HOS.12.6	So now, descendants of Jacob, trust in your God and return to him. Be loyal and just, and wait patiently for your God to act.
HOS.12.7	The 
HOS.12.8	‘We are rich,’ they say. ‘We've made a fortune. And no one can accuse us of getting rich dishonestly.’ 
HOS.12.9	 But I, the 
HOS.12.10	“I spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions, and through the prophets I gave my people warnings. 
HOS.12.11	Yet idols are worshiped in Gilead, and those who worship them will die. Bulls are sacrificed in Gilgal, and the altars there will become piles of stone in the open fields.”
HOS.12.13	 The 
HOS.12.14	The people of Israel have made the 
HOS.13.1	In the past, when the tribe of Ephraim spoke, the other tribes of Israel were afraid; they looked up to Ephraim. But the people sinned by worshiping Baal, and for this they will die. 
HOS.13.2	They still keep on sinning by making metal images to worship—idols of silver, designed by human minds, made by human hands. And then they say, “Offer sacrifices to them!” How can anyone kiss those idols—idols in the shape of bulls!
HOS.13.3	And so these people will disappear like morning mist, like the dew that vanishes early in the day. They will be like chaff which the wind blows from the threshing place, like smoke from a chimney.
HOS.13.4	The 
HOS.13.5	 I took care of you in a dry, desert land. 
HOS.13.6	But when you entered the good land, you became full and satisfied, and then you grew proud and forgot me. 
HOS.13.7	So I will attack you like a lion. Like a leopard I will lie in wait along your path. 
HOS.13.8	I will attack you like a bear that has lost her cubs, and I will tear you open. Like a lion I will devour you on the spot, and will tear you to pieces like a wild animal.
HOS.13.9	“I will destroy you, people of Israel! Then who can help you?
HOS.13.10	 You asked for a king and for leaders, but how can they save the nation?
HOS.13.11	 In my anger I have given you kings, and in my fury I have taken them away.
HOS.13.12	“Israel's sin and guilt are on record, and the records are safely stored away. 
HOS.13.13	Israel has a chance to live, but is too foolish to take it—like a child about to be born, who refuses to come out of the womb. 
HOS.13.14	 I will not save this people from the world of the dead or rescue them from the power of death. Bring on
HOS.13.15	Even though Israel flourishes like weeds,
HOS.13.16	Samaria must be punished for rebelling against me. Her people will die in war; babies will be dashed to the ground, and pregnant women will be ripped open.”
HOS.14.1	Return to the 
HOS.14.2	Return to the 
HOS.14.3	Assyria can never save us, and war horses cannot protect us. We will never again say to our idols that they are our God. O

HOS.14.5	They will blossom like flowers;
HOS.14.5	they will be firmly rooted
HOS.14.5	like the trees of Lebanon.

HOS.14.6	They will be fragrant
HOS.14.6	like the cedars of Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	Once again they will live under my protection.
HOS.14.7	They will grow crops of grain
HOS.14.7	and be fruitful like a vineyard.
HOS.14.7	They will be as famous as the wine of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	The people of Israel
HOS.14.8	I will answer their prayers and take care of them.
HOS.14.8	Like an evergreen tree I will shelter them;

JOL.1.2	everyone in Judah, listen.
JOL.1.2	Has anything like this ever happened
JOL.1.2	in your time or the time of your ancestors?
JOL.1.3	Tell your children about it;
JOL.1.3	they will tell their children,
JOL.1.3	who in turn will tell the next generation.
JOL.1.4	Swarm after swarm of locusts settled on the crops;
JOL.1.4	what one swarm left, the next swarm devoured.
JOL.1.5	Wake up and weep, you drunkards;
JOL.1.5	cry, you wine-drinkers;
JOL.1.5	the grapes for making new wine have been destroyed.
JOL.1.6	they are powerful and too many to count;
JOL.1.6	their teeth are as sharp as those of a lion.
JOL.1.7	They have destroyed our grapevines
JOL.1.7	and chewed up our fig trees.
JOL.1.7	They have stripped off the bark,
JOL.1.7	till the branches are white.
JOL.1.8	Cry, you people, like a young woman who mourns the death
JOL.1.8	of the man she was going to marry.
JOL.1.9	There is no grain or wine to offer in the Temple;
JOL.1.9	the priests mourn because they have no offerings for the

JOL.1.10	the ground mourns
JOL.1.10	because the grain is destroyed,
JOL.1.10	the grapes are dried up,
JOL.1.10	and the olive trees are withered.
JOL.1.11	Grieve, you farmers;
JOL.1.11	cry, you that take care of the vineyards,
JOL.1.11	because the wheat, the barley,
JOL.1.11	yes all the crops are destroyed.
JOL.1.12	The grapevines and fig trees have withered;
JOL.1.12	all the fruit trees have wilted and died.
JOL.1.12	The joy of the people is gone.
JOL.1.13	Put on sackcloth and weep,
JOL.1.13	you priests who serve at the altar!
JOL.1.13	Go into the Temple and mourn all night!
JOL.1.13	There is no grain or wine to offer your God.
JOL.1.14	Give orders for a fast;

JOL.1.17	The seeds die in the dry earth.
JOL.1.17	There is no grain to be stored,
JOL.1.17	and so the empty granaries are in ruins.
JOL.1.18	The cattle are bellowing in distress
JOL.1.18	because there is no pasture for them;
JOL.1.18	the flocks of sheep also suffer.
JOL.1.19	I cry out to you, 
JOL.1.19	because the pastures and trees are dried up,
JOL.1.19	as though a fire had burned them.
JOL.1.20	Even the wild animals cry out to you
JOL.1.20	because the streams have become dry.
JOL.2.1	Blow the trumpet; sound the alarm
JOL.2.1	on Zion, God's sacred hill.
JOL.2.1	Tremble, people of Judah!

JOL.2.3	In front of them the land is like the Garden of Eden,

JOL.2.3	Nothing escapes them.
JOL.2.4	they run like war-horses.
JOL.2.5	As they leap on the tops of the mountains,
JOL.2.5	they rattle like chariots;
JOL.2.5	they crackle like dry grass on fire.
JOL.2.5	They are lined up like a great army ready for battle.
JOL.2.6	As they approach, everyone is terrified;
JOL.2.6	every face turns pale.
JOL.2.7	They attack like warriors;
JOL.2.7	they climb the walls like soldiers.
JOL.2.7	They all keep marching straight ahead
JOL.2.7	and do not change direction
JOL.2.8	or get in each other's way.
JOL.2.8	They swarm through defenses,
JOL.2.8	and nothing can stop them.
JOL.2.9	They rush against the city;
JOL.2.9	they run over the walls;
JOL.2.9	they climb up the houses
JOL.2.9	and go in through the windows like thieves.

JOL.2.12	with fasting and weeping and mourning.
JOL.2.13	Let your broken heart show your sorrow;
JOL.2.13	tearing your clothes is not enough.”
JOL.2.13	Come back to the 
JOL.2.13	He is kind and full of mercy;

JOL.2.16	Gather the people together;
JOL.2.16	prepare them for a sacred meeting;
JOL.2.16	bring the old people;
JOL.2.16	gather the children
JOL.2.16	and the babies too.
JOL.2.16	Even newly married couples
JOL.2.16	must leave their homes and come.
JOL.2.17	between the altar and the entrance of the Temple,
JOL.2.17	must weep and pray:

JOL.2.17	Do not let other nations despise us and mock us
JOL.2.17	by saying, ‘Where is your God?’”
JOL.2.18	Then the

JOL.2.19	He answered them:

JOL.2.19	grain and wine and olive oil,

JOL.2.20	and will drive some of them into the desert.
JOL.2.20	Their front ranks will be driven into the Dead Sea,
JOL.2.20	their rear ranks into the Mediterranean.
JOL.2.20	Their dead bodies will stink.

JOL.2.25	in the years when swarms of locusts ate your crops.
JOL.2.25	It was I who sent this army against you.
JOL.2.26	Now you will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied.
JOL.2.26	You will praise the

AMO.2.14	Not even fast runners will escape; strong men will lose their strength, and soldiers will not be able to save their own lives. 
AMO.2.15	Archers will not stand their ground, fast runners will not get away, and men on horses will not escape with their lives. 
AMO.2.16	On that day even the bravest soldiers will drop their weapons and run.” The 
AMO.3.1	People of Israel, listen to this message which the 
AMO.3.2	“Of all the nations on earth, you are the only one I have known and cared for. That is what makes your sins so terrible, and that is why I must punish you for them.”
AMO.3.3	Do two people start traveling together without arranging to meet?
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar in the forest unless he has found a victim?
AMO.3.4	Does a young lion growl in his den unless he has caught something?
AMO.3.5	Does a bird get caught in a trap if the trap has not been baited?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring unless something sets it off?
AMO.3.6	Does the war trumpet sound in a city without making the people afraid?
AMO.3.6	Does disaster strike a city unless the 
AMO.3.7	The Sovereign 
AMO.3.8	When a lion roars, who can keep from being afraid?
AMO.3.8	When the Sovereign 
AMO.3.9	Announce to those who live in the palaces of Egypt and Ashdod: “Gather together in the hills around Samaria and see the great disorder and the crimes being committed there.”
AMO.3.10	The 
AMO.3.11	And so an enemy will surround their land, destroy their defenses, and plunder their mansions.”
AMO.3.12	The 
AMO.3.13	Listen now, and warn the descendants of Jacob,” says the Sovereign 
AMO.3.14	 “On the day when I punish the people of Israel for their sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel. The corners of every altar will be broken off and will fall to the ground. 
AMO.3.15	I will destroy winter houses and summer houses. The houses decorated with ivory will fall in ruins; every large house will be destroyed.”
AMO.4.1	Listen to this, you women of Samaria, who grow fat like the well-fed cows of Bashan, who mistreat the weak, oppress the poor, and demand that your husbands keep you supplied with liquor! 
AMO.4.2	As the Sovereign 
AMO.4.3	You will be dragged to the nearest break in the wall and thrown out.”
AMO.4.4	The Sovereign 
AMO.4.5	Go on and offer your bread in thanksgiving to God, and brag about the extra offerings you bring! This is the kind of thing you love to do.
AMO.4.7	I kept it from raining when your crops needed it most. I sent rain on one city, but not on another. Rain fell on one field, but another field dried up. 
AMO.4.8	Weak with thirst, the people of several cities went to a city where they hoped to find water, but there was not enough to drink. Still you did not come back to me.
AMO.4.9	“I sent a scorching wind to dry up your crops. The locusts ate up all your gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees. Still you did not come back to me.
AMO.4.10	“I sent a plague on you like the one I sent on Egypt. I killed your young men in battle and took your horses away. I filled your nostrils with the stink of dead bodies in your camps. Still you did not come back to me.
AMO.4.12	“So then, people of Israel, I am going to punish you. And because I am going to do this, get ready to face my judgment!”
AMO.4.13	God is the one who made the mountains
AMO.4.13	and created the winds.
AMO.4.13	He makes his thoughts known to people;
AMO.4.13	he changes day into night.
AMO.4.13	He walks on the heights of the earth.
AMO.4.13	This is his name: the 
AMO.5.1	Listen, people of Israel, to this funeral song which I sing over you:
AMO.5.2	Virgin Israel has fallen,
AMO.5.2	Never to rise again!
AMO.5.2	She lies abandoned on the ground,
AMO.5.2	And no one helps her up.
AMO.5.3	The Sovereign 
AMO.5.4	The 
AMO.5.5	Do not go to Beersheba to worship. Do not try to find me at Bethel—Bethel will come to nothing. Do not go to Gilgal—her people are doomed to exile.”
AMO.5.6	Go to the 
AMO.5.7	You are doomed, you that twist justice and cheat people out of their rights!
AMO.5.8	the Pleiades and Orion.
AMO.5.8	He turns darkness into daylight
AMO.5.8	and day into night.
AMO.5.8	He calls for the waters of the sea
AMO.5.8	and pours them out on the earth.
AMO.5.8	His name is the 
AMO.5.9	He brings destruction on the mighty and their strongholds.
AMO.5.10	You people hate anyone who challenges injustice and speaks the whole truth in court. 
AMO.5.11	You have oppressed the poor and robbed them of their grain. And so you will not live in the fine stone houses you build or drink wine from the beautiful vineyards you plant. 
AMO.5.12	I know how terrible your sins are and how many crimes you have committed. You persecute good people, take bribes, and prevent the poor from getting justice in the courts. 
AMO.5.13	And so, keeping quiet in such evil times is the smart thing to do!
AMO.5.14	Make it your aim to do what is right, not what is evil, so that you may live. Then the 
AMO.5.15	Hate what is evil, love what is right, and see that justice prevails in the courts. Perhaps the 
AMO.5.16	And so the Sovereign 
AMO.5.17	There will be wailing in all the vineyards. All this will take place because I am coming to punish you.” The 
AMO.5.18	How terrible it will be for you who long for the day of the 
AMO.5.19	It will be like someone who runs from a lion and meets a bear! Or like someone who comes home and puts his hand on the wall—only to be bitten by a snake! 
AMO.5.20	The day of the 
AMO.5.22	When you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; I will not accept the animals you have fattened to bring me as offerings. 
AMO.5.23	Stop your noisy songs; I do not want to listen to your harps. 
AMO.5.24	Instead, let justice flow like a stream, and righteousness like a river that never goes dry.
AMO.5.26	But now, because you have worshiped images of Sakkuth, your king god, and of Kaiwan, your star god, you will have to carry those images 
AMO.5.27	when I take you into exile in a land beyond Damascus,” says the 
AMO.6.1	How terrible it will be for you that have such an easy life in Zion and for you that feel safe in Samaria—you great leaders of this great nation Israel, you to whom the people go for help! 
AMO.6.2	Go and look at the city of Calneh. Then go on to the great city of Hamath and on down to the Philistine city of Gath. Were they any better than the kingdoms of Judah and Israel? Was their territory larger than yours? 
AMO.6.3	You refuse to admit that a day of disaster is coming, but what you do only brings that day closer. 
AMO.6.4	How terrible it will be for you that stretch out on your luxurious couches, feasting on veal and lamb! 
AMO.6.5	You like to compose songs, as David did, and play them on harps. 
AMO.6.6	You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest perfumes, but you do not mourn over the ruin of Israel. 
AMO.6.7	So you will be the first to go into exile. Your feasts and banquets will come to an end.
AMO.6.8	The Sovereign 
AMO.6.9	If there are ten men left in a family, they will die. 
AMO.6.10	The dead man's relative, the one in charge of the funeral, will take the body out of the house. The relative will call to whoever is still left in the house, “Is anyone else there with you?”
AMO.6.10	The person will answer, “No!”
AMO.6.10	Then the relative will say, “Be quiet! We must be careful not even to mention the 
AMO.6.11	When the 
AMO.6.12	Do horses gallop on rocks? Does anyone plow the sea with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison, and right into wrong.
AMO.6.13	You brag about capturing the town of Lodebar.
AMO.6.14	The 
AMO.7.1	I had a vision from the Sovereign 
AMO.7.2	In my vision I saw the locusts eat up every green thing in the land, and then I said, “Sovereign 
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	I had another vision from the Sovereign 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “Stop, O Sovereign 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	I had another vision from the 
AMO.7.8	He asked me, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.7.8	“A plumb line,” I answered.
AMO.7.8	Then he said, “I am using it to show that my people are like a wall that is out of line. I will not change my mind again about punishing them. 
AMO.7.9	The places where Isaac's descendants worship will be destroyed. The holy places of Israel will be left in ruins. I will bring the dynasty of King Jeroboam to an end.”
AMO.7.10	Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, then sent a report to King Jeroboam of Israel: “Amos is plotting against you among the people. His speeches will destroy the country. 
AMO.7.11	This is what he says: ‘Jeroboam will die in battle, and the people of Israel will be taken away from their land into exile.’”
AMO.7.12	Amaziah then said to Amos, “That's enough, prophet! Go on back to Judah and do your preaching there. Let 
AMO.7.13	Don't prophesy here at Bethel any more. This is the king's place of worship, the national temple.”
AMO.7.14	Amos answered, “I am not the kind of prophet who prophesies for pay. I am a herdsman, and I take care of fig trees. 
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	So now listen to what the 
AMO.7.17	And so, Amaziah, the 
AMO.8.1	I had another vision from the Sovereign 
AMO.8.2	The 
AMO.8.2	“A basket of fruit,” I answered.
AMO.8.2	The 
AMO.8.3	On that day the songs in the palace will become cries of mourning. There will be dead bodies everywhere. They will be cast out in silence.”
AMO.8.4	Listen to this, you that trample on the needy and try to destroy the poor of the country. 
AMO.8.5	You say to yourselves, “We can hardly wait for the holy days to be over so that we can sell our grain. When will the Sabbath end, so that we can start selling again? Then we can overcharge, use false measures, and fix the scales to cheat our customers. 
AMO.8.6	We can sell worthless wheat at a high price. We'll find someone poor who can't pay his debts, not even the price of a pair of sandals, and we'll buy him as a slave.”
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	And so the earth will quake, and everyone in the land will be in distress. The whole country will be shaken; it will rise and fall like the Nile River. 
AMO.8.9	The time is coming when I will make the sun go down at noon and the earth grow dark in daytime. I, the Sovereign 
AMO.8.10	I will turn your festivals into funerals and change your glad songs into cries of grief. I will make you shave your heads and wear sackcloth, and you will be like parents mourning for their only child. That day will be bitter to the end.
AMO.8.11	“The time is coming when I will send famine on the land. People will be hungry, but not for bread; they will be thirsty, but not for water. They will hunger and thirst for a message from the 
AMO.8.12	People will wander from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean and then on around from the north to the east. They will look everywhere for a message from the 
AMO.8.13	On that day even healthy young men and women will collapse from thirst. 
AMO.8.14	Those who swear by the idols of Samaria, who say, ‘By the god of Dan’ or ‘By the god of Beersheba’—those people will fall and not rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing by the altar. He gave the command: “Strike the tops of the Temple columns so hard that the foundation will shake. Break them off and let them fall on the heads of the people. I will kill the rest of the people in war. No one will get away; not one will escape. 
AMO.9.2	Even if they dig their way down to the world of the dead, I will catch them. Even if they climb up to heaven, I will bring them down. 
AMO.9.3	If they hide on the top of Mount Carmel, I will search for them and catch them. If they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, I will command the sea monster
AMO.9.4	If they are taken away into captivity by their enemies, I will order them to be put to death. I am determined to destroy them, not to help them.”
AMO.9.5	The Sovereign 
AMO.9.5	and it quakes;
AMO.9.5	all who live there mourn.
AMO.9.5	The whole world rises and falls like the Nile River.
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.6	and over the earth he puts the dome of the sky.
AMO.9.6	He calls for the waters of the sea
AMO.9.6	and pours them out on the earth.
AMO.9.6	His name is the 
AMO.9.7	The 
AMO.9.8	I, the Sovereign 
AMO.9.9	“I will give the command and shake the people of Israel like grain in a sieve. I will shake them among the nations to remove all who are worthless. 
AMO.9.10	The sinners among my people will be killed in war—all those who say, ‘God will not let any harm come near us.’”
AMO.9.12	And so the people of Israel will conquer what is left of the land of Edom and all the nations that were once mine,” says the 
AMO.9.13	“The days are coming,” says the 
AMO.9.13	“when grain will grow faster than it can be harvested,
AMO.9.13	and grapes will grow faster than the wine can be made.
AMO.9.13	The mountains will drip with sweet wine,
AMO.9.13	and the hills will flow with it.
AMO.9.14	I will bring my people back to their land.
AMO.9.14	They will rebuild their ruined cities and live there;
AMO.9.14	they will plant vineyards and drink the wine;
AMO.9.14	they will plant gardens and eat what they grow.
AMO.9.15	I will plant my people on the land I gave them,
AMO.9.15	and they will not be pulled up again.”
AMO.9.15	The 
OBA.1.1	The 
OBA.1.1	and we have heard his message:
OBA.1.1	“Get ready! Let us go to war against Edom!”
OBA.1.2	The 
OBA.1.2	“I will make you weak;
OBA.1.2	everyone will despise you.
OBA.1.3	Your pride has deceived you.
OBA.1.3	Your capital is a fortress of solid rock;
OBA.1.3	your home is high in the mountains,
OBA.1.3	and so you say to yourself,
OBA.1.3	‘Who can ever pull me down?’
OBA.1.4	Even though you make your home
OBA.1.4	as high as an eagle's nest,
OBA.1.4	so that it seems to be among the stars,
OBA.1.4	yet I will pull you down.
OBA.1.5	“When thieves come at night,
OBA.1.5	they take only what they want.
OBA.1.5	When people gather grapes,
OBA.1.5	they always leave a few.
OBA.1.5	But your enemies have wiped you out completely.
OBA.1.6	Descendants of Esau, your treasures have been looted.
OBA.1.7	Your allies have deceived you;
OBA.1.7	they have driven you from your country.
OBA.1.7	People who were at peace with you have now conquered you.
OBA.1.7	Those friends who ate with you have laid a trap for you;
OBA.1.7	they say of you, ‘Where is all that cleverness he had?’
OBA.1.8	“On the day I punish Edom,
OBA.1.8	I will destroy their clever men
OBA.1.8	and wipe out all their wisdom.
OBA.1.9	The fighting men of Teman will be terrified,
OBA.1.9	and every soldier in Edom will be killed.
OBA.1.10	“Because you robbed and killed
OBA.1.10	your relatives,
OBA.1.10	you will be destroyed and dishonored forever.
OBA.1.11	You stood aside on that day
OBA.1.11	when enemies broke down their gates.
OBA.1.11	You were as bad as those strangers
OBA.1.11	who carried off Jerusalem's wealth
OBA.1.11	and divided it among themselves.
OBA.1.12	You should not have gloated
OBA.1.12	over the misfortune of your relatives in Judah.
OBA.1.12	You should not have been glad
OBA.1.12	on the day of their ruin.
OBA.1.12	You should not have laughed at them
OBA.1.12	in their distress.
OBA.1.13	You should not have entered the city of my people
OBA.1.13	to gloat over their suffering
OBA.1.13	and to seize their riches
OBA.1.13	on the day of their disaster.
OBA.1.14	You should not have stood at the crossroads
OBA.1.14	to catch those trying to escape.
OBA.1.14	You should not have handed them over to the enemy
OBA.1.14	on the day of their distress.
OBA.1.15	“The day is near when I, the 
OBA.1.15	will judge all nations.
OBA.1.15	Edom, what you have done
OBA.1.15	will be done to you.
OBA.1.15	You will get back what you have given.
OBA.1.16	My people have drunk a bitter cup of punishment
OBA.1.16	on my sacred hill.
OBA.1.16	But all the surrounding nations will drink
OBA.1.16	a still more bitter cup of punishment;
OBA.1.16	they will drink it all and vanish away.
OBA.1.17	“But on Mount Zion some will escape,
OBA.1.17	and it will be a sacred place.
OBA.1.17	The people of Jacob will possess
OBA.1.17	the land that is theirs by right.
OBA.1.18	The people of Jacob and of Joseph will be like fire;
OBA.1.18	they will destroy the people of Esau
OBA.1.18	as fire burns stubble.
OBA.1.18	No descendant of Esau will survive.
OBA.1.18	I, the 
OBA.1.19	“People from southern Judah will occupy Edom;
OBA.1.19	those from the western foothills will capture Philistia.
OBA.1.19	Israelites will possess the territory of Ephraim and Samaria;
OBA.1.19	the people of Benjamin will take Gilead.
OBA.1.20	The army of exiles from northern Israel
OBA.1.20	will return and conquer Phoenicia as far north as Zarephath.
OBA.1.20	The exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sardis
OBA.1.20	will capture the towns of southern Judah.
OBA.1.21	The victorious men of Jerusalem
OBA.1.21	will attack Edom and rule over it.
OBA.1.21	And the 
JON.1.2	He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it; I am aware of how wicked its people are.” 
JON.1.3	Jonah, however, set out in the opposite direction in order to get away from the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	The sailors were terrified and cried out for help, each one to his own god. Then, in order to lessen the danger,
JON.1.6	The captain found him there and said to him, “What are you doing asleep? Get up and pray to your god for help. Maybe he will feel sorry for us and spare our lives.”
JON.1.7	The sailors said to each other, “Let's draw lots and find out who is to blame for getting us into this danger.” They did so, and Jonah's name was drawn. 
JON.1.8	So they said to him, “Now, then, tell us! Who is to blame for this? What are you doing here? What country do you come from? What is your nationality?”
JON.1.9	“I am a Hebrew,” Jonah answered. “I worship the 
JON.1.10	Jonah went on to tell them that he was running away from the 
JON.1.10	The sailors were terrified, and said to him, “That was an awful thing to do!”
JON.1.11	The storm was getting worse all the time, so the sailors asked him, “What should we do to you to stop the storm?”
JON.1.12	Jonah answered, “Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I know it is my fault that you are caught in this violent storm.”
JON.1.13	Instead, the sailors tried to get the ship to shore, rowing with all their might. But the storm was becoming worse and worse, and they got nowhere. 
JON.1.14	So they cried out to the 
JON.1.15	Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and it calmed down at once. 
JON.1.16	This made the sailors so afraid of the 
JON.2.1	From deep inside the fish Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	“In my distress, O 
JON.2.2	and you answered me.
JON.2.2	From deep in the world of the dead
JON.2.2	I cried for help, and you heard me.
JON.2.3	You threw me down into the depths,
JON.2.3	to the very bottom of the sea,
JON.2.3	where the waters were all around me,
JON.2.3	and all your mighty waves rolled over me.
JON.2.4	I thought I had been banished from your presence
JON.2.4	and would never see your holy Temple again.
JON.2.5	The water came over me and choked me;
JON.2.5	the sea covered me completely,
JON.2.5	and seaweed wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	I went down to the very roots of the mountains,
JON.2.6	into the land whose gates lock shut forever.
JON.2.6	But you, O 
JON.2.6	brought me back from the depths alive.
JON.2.7	When I felt my life slipping away,
JON.2.7	then, O 
JON.2.7	and in your holy Temple you heard me.
JON.2.8	Those who worship worthless idols
JON.2.8	have abandoned their loyalty to you.
JON.2.9	But I will sing praises to you;
JON.2.9	I will offer you a sacrifice
JON.2.9	and do what I have promised.
JON.2.9	Salvation comes from the 
JON.2.10	Then the 
JON.3.1	Once again the 
JON.3.2	He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to the people the message I have given you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah obeyed the 
JON.3.4	 Jonah started through the city, and after walking a whole day, he proclaimed, “In forty days Nineveh will be destroyed!”
JON.3.5	The people of Nineveh believed God's message. So they decided that everyone should fast, and all the people, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth to show that they had repented.
JON.3.6	When the king of Nineveh heard about it, he got up from his throne, took off his robe, put on sackcloth, and sat down in ashes. 
JON.3.7	He sent out a proclamation to the people of Nineveh: “This is an order from the king and his officials: No one is to eat anything; all persons, cattle, and sheep are forbidden to eat or drink. 
JON.3.8	All persons and animals must wear sackcloth. Everyone must pray earnestly to God and must give up their wicked behavior and their evil actions. 
JON.3.9	Perhaps God will change his mind; perhaps he will stop being angry, and we will not die!”
JON.3.10	God saw what they did; he saw that they had given up their wicked behavior. So he changed his mind and did not punish them as he had said he would.
JON.4.1	Jonah was very unhappy about this and became angry. 
JON.4.2	 So he prayed, “
JON.4.3	 Now then, 
JON.4.4	The 
JON.4.5	Jonah went out east of the city and sat down. He made a shelter for himself and sat in its shade, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh. 
JON.4.6	Then the 
JON.4.7	But at dawn the next day, at God's command, a worm attacked the plant, and it died. 
JON.4.8	After the sun had risen, God sent a hot east wind, and Jonah was about to faint from the heat of the sun beating down on his head. So he wished he were dead.
JON.4.9	But God said to him, “What right do you have to be angry about the plant?”
JON.4.9	Jonah replied, “I have every right to be angry—angry enough to die!”
JON.4.10	The 
JON.4.11	How much more, then, should I have pity on Nineveh, that great city. After all, it has more than 120,000 innocent children in it, as well as many animals!”
MIC.1.2	Hear this, all you nations;
MIC.1.2	listen to this, all who live on earth!
MIC.1.2	The Sovereign 
MIC.1.2	Listen! He speaks from his heavenly temple.
MIC.1.3	The 
MIC.1.3	he will come down and walk on the tops of the mountains.
MIC.1.4	Then the mountains will melt under him
MIC.1.4	like wax in a fire;
MIC.1.4	they will pour down into the valleys
MIC.1.4	like water pouring down a hill.
MIC.1.5	All this will happen because the people of Israel have sinned and rebelled against God. Who is to blame for Israel's rebellion? Samaria, the capital city itself! Who is guilty of idolatry in Judah? Jerusalem itself! 
MIC.1.6	So the 
MIC.1.7	All its precious idols will be smashed to pieces, everything given to its temple prostitutes will be destroyed by fire, and all its images will become a desolate heap. Samaria acquired these things for its fertility rites, and now her enemies will carry them off for temple prostitutes elsewhere.”
MIC.1.8	Then Micah said, “Because of this I will mourn and lament. To show my sorrow, I will walk around barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and wail like an ostrich. 
MIC.1.9	Samaria's wounds cannot be healed, and Judah is about to suffer in the same way; destruction has reached the gates of Jerusalem itself, where my people live.”
MIC.1.10	Don't tell our enemies in Gath about our defeat; don't let them see you weeping. People of Beth Leaphrah,
MIC.1.11	You people of Shaphir, go into exile, naked and ashamed. Those who live in Zaanan do not dare to come out of their city. When you hear the people of Bethezel mourn, you will know that there is no refuge there. 
MIC.1.12	The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief, because the 
MIC.1.13	You that live in Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots. You imitated the sins of Israel and so caused Jerusalem to sin. 
MIC.1.14	And now, people of Judah, say good-bye to the town of Moresheth Gath. The kings of Israel will get no help from the town of Achzib.
MIC.1.15	People of Mareshah, the 
MIC.1.16	People of Judah, cut off your hair in mourning for the children you love. Make yourselves as bald as vultures, because your children will be taken away from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	How terrible it will be for those who lie awake and plan evil! When morning comes, as soon as they have the chance, they do the evil they planned. 
MIC.2.2	When they want fields, they seize them; when they want houses, they take them. No one's family or property is safe.
MIC.2.3	And so the 
MIC.2.4	When that time comes, people will use the story about you as an example of disaster, and they will sing this song of despair about your experience:
MIC.2.4	We are completely ruined!
MIC.2.4	The 
MIC.2.4	And given it to those who took us captive.”
MIC.2.5	So then, when the time comes for the land to be given back to the 
MIC.2.6	The people preach at me and say, “Don't preach at us. Don't preach about all that. God is not going to disgrace us. 
MIC.2.7	Do you think the people of Israel are under a curse?
MIC.2.8	The 
MIC.2.9	You drive the women of my people out of the homes they love, and you have robbed their children of my blessings forever. 
MIC.2.10	Get up and go; there is no safety here any more. Your sins have doomed this place to destruction.
MIC.2.11	“These people want the kind of prophet who goes around full of lies and deceit and says, ‘I prophesy that wine and liquor will flow for you.’
MIC.2.12	“But I will gather you together, all you people of Israel that are left. I will bring you together like sheep returning to the fold. Like a pasture full of sheep, your land will once again be filled with many people.”
MIC.2.13	God will open the way for them and lead them out of exile. They will break out of the city gates and go free. Their king, the 
MIC.3.1	Listen, you rulers of Israel! You are supposed to be concerned about justice, 
MIC.3.2	yet you hate what is good and you love what is evil. You skin my people alive and tear the flesh off their bones. 
MIC.3.3	You eat my people up. You strip off their skin, break their bones, and chop them up like meat for the pot. 
MIC.3.4	The time is coming when you will cry out to the 
MIC.3.5	My people are deceived by prophets who promise peace to those who pay them, but threaten war for those who don't. To these prophets the 
MIC.3.6	“Prophets, your day is almost over; the sun is going down on you. Because you mislead my people, you will have no more prophetic visions, and you will not be able to predict anything.” 
MIC.3.7	Those who predict the future will be disgraced by their failure. They will all be humiliated because God does not answer them.
MIC.3.8	But as for me, the 
MIC.3.9	Listen to me, you rulers of Israel, you that hate justice and turn right into wrong. 
MIC.3.10	You are building God's city, Jerusalem, on a foundation of murder and injustice. 
MIC.3.11	The city's rulers govern for bribes, the priests interpret the Law for pay, the prophets give their revelations for money—and they all claim that the 
MIC.4.1	In days to come
MIC.4.1	the mountain where the Temple stands
MIC.4.1	will be the highest one of all,
MIC.4.1	towering above all the hills.
MIC.4.1	Many nations will come streaming to it,
MIC.4.2	and their people will say,
MIC.4.2	“Let us go up the hill of the 
MIC.4.2	to the Temple of Israel's God.
MIC.4.2	He will teach us what he wants us to do;
MIC.4.2	we will walk in the paths he has chosen.
MIC.4.2	For the 
MIC.4.2	from Zion he speaks to his people.”
MIC.4.3	among the great powers near and far.
MIC.4.3	They will hammer their swords into plows
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning knives.
MIC.4.3	Nations will never again go to war,
MIC.4.3	never prepare for battle again.
MIC.4.4	among their own vineyards and fig trees,
MIC.4.4	and no one will make them afraid.
MIC.4.4	The 
MIC.4.5	Each nation worships and obeys its own god, but we will worship and obey the 
MIC.4.6	“The time is coming,” says the 
MIC.4.7	They are crippled and far from home, but I will make a new beginning with those who are left, and they will become a great nation. I will rule over them on Mount Zion from that time on and forever.”
MIC.4.8	And you, Jerusalem, where God, like a shepherd from his lookout tower, watches over his people, will once again be the capital of the kingdom that was yours. 
MIC.4.9	Why do you cry out so loudly? Why are you suffering like a woman in labor? Is it because you have no king, and your counselors are dead? 
MIC.4.10	Twist and groan,
MIC.4.11	Many nations have gathered to attack you. They say, “Jerusalem must be destroyed! We will see this city in ruins!” 
MIC.4.12	But these nations do not know what is in the 
MIC.4.13	The 
MIC.5.1	People of Jerusalem, gather your forces!
MIC.5.3	So the 
MIC.5.4	When he comes, he will rule his people with the strength that comes from the 
MIC.5.5	and he will bring peace.
MIC.5.5	When the Assyrians invade our country and break through our defenses, we will send our strongest leaders to fight them. 
MIC.5.6	 By force of arms they will conquer Assyria, the land of Nimrod, and they
MIC.5.7	The people of Israel who survive will be like refreshing dew sent by the 
MIC.5.8	Those who are left among the nations will be like a lion hunting for food in a forest or a pasture: it gets in among the sheep, pounces on them, and tears them to pieces—and there is no hope of rescue. 
MIC.5.9	Israel will conquer her enemies and destroy them all.
MIC.5.10	The 
MIC.5.11	I will destroy the cities in your land and tear down all your defenses. 
MIC.5.12	I will destroy the magic charms you use and leave you without any fortunetellers. 
MIC.5.13	I will destroy your idols and sacred stone pillars; no longer will you worship the things that you yourselves have made. 
MIC.5.14	I will pull down the images of the goddess Asherah in your land and destroy your cities. 
MIC.5.15	And in my great anger I will take revenge on all nations that have not obeyed me.”
MIC.6.1	Listen to the 
MIC.6.1	Arise, O 
MIC.6.2	You mountains, you everlasting foundations of the earth, listen to the 
MIC.6.3	The 
MIC.6.4	 I brought you out of Egypt; I rescued you from slavery; I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you. 
MIC.6.5	 My people, remember what King Balak of Moab planned to do to you and how Balaam son of Beor answered him. Remember the things that happened on the way from the camp at Acacia to Gilgal. Remember these things and you will realize what I did in order to save you.”
MIC.6.6	What shall I bring to the 
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.8	No, the 
MIC.6.9	It is wise to fear the 
MIC.6.10	In the houses of evil people are treasures which they got dishonestly. They use false measures, a thing that I hate.
MIC.6.11	How can I forgive those who use false scales and weights? 
MIC.6.12	Your rich people exploit the poor, and all of you are liars. 
MIC.6.13	So I have already begun
MIC.6.14	You will eat, but not be satisfied—in fact you will still be hungry. You will carry things off, but you will not be able to save them; anything you do save I will destroy in war. 
MIC.6.15	You will sow grain, but not harvest the crop. You will press oil from olives, but never get to use it. You will make wine, but never drink it. 
MIC.6.16	 This will happen because you have followed the evil practices of King Omri and of his son, King Ahab. You have continued their policies, and so I will bring you to ruin, and everyone will despise you. People
MIC.7.1	It's hopeless! I am like a hungry person who finds no fruit left on the trees and no grapes on the vines. All the grapes and all the tasty figs have been picked. 
MIC.7.2	There is not an honest person left in the land, no one loyal to God. Everyone is waiting for a chance to commit murder. Everyone hunts down their own people. 
MIC.7.3	They are all experts at doing evil. Officials and judges ask for bribes. The influential people tell them what they want, and so they scheme together.
MIC.7.4	Even the best and most honest of them are as worthless as weeds.
MIC.7.4	The day has come when God will punish the people, as he warned them through their watchmen, the prophets. Now they are in confusion. 
MIC.7.5	Don't believe your neighbor or trust your friend. Be careful what you say even to your husband or wife. 
MIC.7.6	 In these times sons treat their fathers like fools, daughters oppose their mothers, and young women quarrel with their mothers-in-law; your enemies are the members of your own family.
MIC.7.7	But I will watch for the 
MIC.7.8	Our enemies have no reason to gloat over us. We have fallen, but we will rise again. We are in darkness now, but the 
MIC.7.9	We have sinned against the 
MIC.7.10	Then our enemies will see this and be disgraced—the same enemies who taunted us by asking, “Where is the 
MIC.7.11	People of Jerusalem, the time to rebuild the city walls is coming. At that time your territory will be enlarged. 
MIC.7.12	Your people will return to you from everywhere—from Assyria in the east, from Egypt in the south, from the region of the Euphrates River, from distant seas and far-off mountains. 
MIC.7.13	But the earth will become a desert because of the wickedness of those who live on it.
MIC.7.14	Be a shepherd to your people, 
MIC.7.15	Work miracles for us,
MIC.7.16	The nations will see this and be frustrated in spite of all their strength. In dismay they will close their mouths and cover their ears. 
MIC.7.17	They will crawl in the dust like snakes; they will come from their fortresses, trembling and afraid. They will turn in fear to the 
MIC.7.18	There is no other god like you, O 
MIC.7.19	You will be merciful to us once again. You will trample our sins underfoot and send them to the bottom of the sea! 
MIC.7.20	You will show your faithfulness and constant love to your people, the descendants of Abraham and of Jacob, as you promised our ancestors long ago.

NAM.2.4	Chariots dash wildly through the streets,
NAM.2.4	rushing back and forth in the city squares.
NAM.2.4	They flash like torches
NAM.2.4	and dart about like lightning.
NAM.2.5	The officers are summoned;
NAM.2.5	they stumble as they press forward.
NAM.2.5	The attackers rush to the wall
NAM.2.5	and set up the shield for the battering ram.
NAM.2.6	The gates by the river burst open;

NAM.2.13	“I am your enemy!” says the

NAM.3.8	Nineveh, are you any better than Thebes, the capital of Egypt? She too had a river to protect her like a wall—the Nile was her defense. 
NAM.3.9	She ruled Ethiopia
NAM.3.10	Yet the people of Thebes were carried off into exile. At every street corner their children were beaten to death. Their leading men were carried off in chains and divided among their captors.

NAM.3.12	All your fortresses will be like fig trees with ripe figs: shake the trees, and the fruit falls right into your mouth!

NAM.3.16	You produced more merchants than there are stars in the sky! But now they are gone, like locusts that spread their wings and fly away. 
NAM.3.17	Your officials are like a swarm of locusts that stay in the walls on a cold day. But when the sun comes out, they fly away, and no one knows where they have gone!
NAM.3.18	Emperor of Assyria, your governors are dead, and your noblemen are asleep forever! Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to bring them home again. 
NAM.3.19	There is no remedy for your injuries, and your wounds cannot be healed. All those who hear the news of your destruction clap their hands for joy. Did anyone escape your endless cruelty?
HAB.1.1	This is the message that the 
HAB.1.2	O 
HAB.1.3	Why do you make me see such trouble? How can you stand to look on such wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are all around me, and there is fighting and quarreling everywhere. 
HAB.1.4	The law is weak and useless, and justice is never done. Evil people get the better of the righteous, and so justice is perverted.
HAB.1.6	 I am bringing the Babylonians to power, those fierce, restless people. They are marching out across the world to conquer other lands. 
HAB.1.7	They spread fear and terror, and in their pride they are a law to themselves.
HAB.1.8	“Their horses are faster than leopards, fiercer than hungry wolves. Their cavalry troops come riding from distant lands; their horses paw the ground. They come swooping down like eagles attacking their prey.
HAB.1.9	“Their armies advance in violent conquest, and everyone is terrified as they approach.
HAB.1.10	They treat kings with contempt and laugh at high officials. No fortress can stop them—they pile up earth against it and capture it. 
HAB.1.11	Then they sweep on like the wind and are gone, these men whose power is their god.”
HAB.1.13	But how can you stand these treacherous, evil men? Your eyes are too holy to look at evil, and you cannot stand the sight of people doing wrong. So why are you silent while they destroy people who are more righteous than they are?
HAB.1.14	How can you treat people like fish or like a swarm of insects that have no ruler to direct them? 
HAB.1.15	The Babylonians catch people with hooks, as though they were fish. They drag them off in nets and shout for joy over their catch! 
HAB.1.16	They even worship their nets and offer sacrifices to them, because their nets provide them with the best of everything.
HAB.1.17	Are they going to use their swords forever and keep on destroying nations without mercy?
HAB.2.1	I will climb my watchtower and wait to see what the 
HAB.2.2	The 
HAB.2.3	 Put it in writing, because it is not yet time for it to come true. But the time is coming quickly, and what I show you will come true. It may seem slow in coming, but wait for it; it will certainly take place, and it will not be delayed. 
HAB.2.4	 And this is the message: ‘Those who are evil will not survive,
HAB.2.5	Wealth is deceitful. Greedy people are proud and restless—like death itself they are never satisfied. That is why they conquer nation after nation for themselves. 
HAB.2.6	The conquered people will taunt their conquerors and show their scorn for them. They will say, “You take what isn't yours, but you are doomed! How long will you go on getting rich by forcing your debtors to pay up?”
HAB.2.7	But before you know it, you that have conquered others will be in debt yourselves and be forced to pay interest. Enemies will come and make you tremble. They will plunder you! 
HAB.2.8	You have plundered the people of many nations, but now those who have survived will plunder you because of the murders you have committed and because of your violence against the people of the world and its cities.
HAB.2.9	You are doomed! You have made your family rich with what you took by violence, and have tried to make your own home safe from harm and danger! 
HAB.2.10	But your schemes have brought shame on your family; by destroying many nations you have only brought ruin on yourself. 
HAB.2.11	Even the stones of the walls cry out against you, and the rafters echo the cry.
HAB.2.12	You are doomed! You founded a city on crime and built it up by murder. 
HAB.2.13	 The nations you conquered wore themselves out in useless labor, and all they have built goes up in flames. The 
HAB.2.14	 But the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the 
HAB.2.15	You are doomed! In your fury you humiliated and disgraced your neighbors; you made them stagger as though they were drunk. 
HAB.2.16	You in turn will be covered with shame instead of honor. You yourself will drink and stagger. The 
HAB.2.17	You have cut down the forests of Lebanon; now you will be cut down. You killed its animals; now animals will terrify you. This will happen because of the murders you have committed and because of your violence against the people of the world and its cities.
HAB.2.18	What's the use of an idol? It is only something that a human being has made, and it tells you nothing but lies. What good does it do for its maker to trust it—a god that can't even talk! 
HAB.2.19	You are doomed! You say to a piece of wood, “Wake up!” or to a block of stone, “Get up!” Can an idol reveal anything to you? It may be covered with silver and gold, but there is no life in it.
HAB.2.20	The 
HAB.3.1	This is a prayer of the prophet Habakkuk:
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	and I am filled with awe.
HAB.3.2	Now do again in our times
HAB.3.2	the great deeds you used to do.
HAB.3.2	Be merciful, even when you are angry.
HAB.3.3	God is coming again from Edom;
HAB.3.3	the holy God is coming from the hills of Paran.
HAB.3.3	His splendor covers the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and the earth is full of his praise.
HAB.3.4	He comes with the brightness of lightning;
HAB.3.4	light flashes from his hand,
HAB.3.4	there where his power is hidden.
HAB.3.5	He sends disease before him
HAB.3.5	and commands death to follow him.
HAB.3.6	When he stops, the earth shakes;
HAB.3.6	at his glance the nations tremble.
HAB.3.6	The eternal mountains are shattered;
HAB.3.6	the everlasting hills sink down,
HAB.3.6	the hills where he walked in ancient times.
HAB.3.7	I saw the people of Cushan afraid
HAB.3.7	and the people of Midian tremble.
HAB.3.8	Was it the rivers that made you angry, 
HAB.3.8	Was it the sea that made you furious?
HAB.3.8	You rode upon the clouds;
HAB.3.8	the storm cloud was your chariot,
HAB.3.8	as you brought victory to your people.
HAB.3.9	You got ready to use your bow,
HAB.3.9	ready to shoot your arrows.
HAB.3.9	Your lightning split open the earth.
HAB.3.10	When the mountains saw you, they trembled;
HAB.3.10	water poured down from the skies.
HAB.3.10	The waters under the earth roared,
HAB.3.10	and their waves rose high.
HAB.3.11	At the flash of your speeding arrows
HAB.3.11	and the gleam of your shining spear,
HAB.3.11	the sun and the moon stood still.
HAB.3.12	You marched across the earth in anger;
HAB.3.12	in fury you trampled the nations.
HAB.3.13	You went out to save your people,
HAB.3.13	to save your chosen king.
HAB.3.13	You struck down the leader of the wicked
HAB.3.13	and completely destroyed his followers.
HAB.3.14	Your arrows pierced the commander of his army
HAB.3.14	when it came like a storm to scatter us,
HAB.3.14	gloating like those who secretly oppress the poor.
HAB.3.15	You trampled the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	and the mighty waters foamed.
HAB.3.16	I hear all this, and I tremble;
HAB.3.16	my lips quiver with fear.
HAB.3.16	My body goes limp,
HAB.3.16	and my feet stumble
HAB.3.16	I will quietly wait for the time to come
HAB.3.16	when God will punish those who attack us.
HAB.3.17	Even though the fig trees have no fruit
HAB.3.17	and no grapes grow on the vines,
HAB.3.17	even though the olive crop fails
HAB.3.17	and the fields produce no grain,
HAB.3.17	even though the sheep all die
HAB.3.17	and the cattle stalls are empty,
HAB.3.18	I will still be joyful and glad,
HAB.3.18	because the 
HAB.3.19	He makes me sure-footed as a deer
HAB.3.19	and keeps me safe on the mountains.
ZEP.1.2	The 
ZEP.1.3	all human beings and animals, birds and fish. I will bring about the downfall of
ZEP.1.4	“I will punish the people of Jerusalem and of all Judah. I will destroy the last trace of the worship of Baal there, and no one will even remember the pagan priests who serve him. 
ZEP.1.5	I will destroy anyone who goes up on the roof and worships the sun, the moon, and the stars. I will also destroy those who worship me and swear loyalty to me, but then take oaths in the name of the god Molech. 
ZEP.1.6	I will destroy those who have turned back and no longer follow me, those who do not come to me or ask me to guide them.”
ZEP.1.7	The day is near when the 
ZEP.1.8	“On that day of slaughter,” says the 
ZEP.1.9	I will punish all who worship like pagans and who steal and kill in order to fill their master's house
ZEP.1.10	“On that day,” says the 
ZEP.1.11	Wail and cry when you hear this, you that live in the lower part of the city, because all the merchants will be dead!
ZEP.1.12	“At that time I will take a lamp and search Jerusalem. I will punish the people who are self-satisfied and confident, who say to themselves, ‘The 
ZEP.1.13	Their wealth will be looted and their houses destroyed. They will never live in the houses they are building or drink wine from the vineyards they are planting.”
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	It will be a day of fury, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and destruction, a day of darkness and gloom, a black and cloudy day, 
ZEP.1.16	a day filled with the sound of war trumpets and the battle cry of soldiers attacking fortified cities and high towers.
ZEP.1.17	The 
ZEP.1.18	On the day when the 
ZEP.2.1	Shameless nation, come to your senses 
ZEP.2.2	before you are driven away like chaff blown by the wind, before the burning anger of the 
ZEP.2.3	Turn to the 
ZEP.2.5	You Philistines are doomed, you people who live along the coast. The 
ZEP.2.6	Your land by the sea will become open fields with shepherd's huts and sheep pens. 
ZEP.2.7	The people of Judah who survive will occupy your land. They will pasture their flocks there and sleep in the houses of Ashkelon. The 
ZEP.2.9	 As surely as I am the living 
ZEP.2.10	That is how the people of Moab and Ammon will be punished for their pride and arrogance and for insulting the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.14	It will be a place where flocks, herds, and animals of every kind will lie down. Owls will live among its ruins and hoot from the windows. Crows
ZEP.2.15	That is what will happen to the city that is so proud of its own power and thinks it is safe. Its people think that their city is the greatest in the world. What a desolate place it will become, a place where wild animals will rest! Everyone who passes by will shrink back in horror.
ZEP.3.1	Jerusalem is doomed, that corrupt, rebellious city that oppresses its own people. 
ZEP.3.2	It has not listened to the 
ZEP.3.3	Its officials are like roaring lions; its judges are like hungry wolves, too greedy to leave a bone until morning. 
ZEP.3.4	The prophets are irresponsible and treacherous; the priests defile what is sacred, and twist the law of God to their own advantage. 
ZEP.3.5	But the 
ZEP.3.6	The 
ZEP.3.7	I thought that then my people would have reverence for me and accept my discipline, that they would never forget
ZEP.3.8	“Just wait,” the 
ZEP.3.9	“Then I will change the people of the nations, and they will pray to me alone and not to other gods. They will all obey me. 
ZEP.3.10	Even from distant Ethiopia
ZEP.3.11	At that time you, my people, will no longer need to be ashamed that you rebelled against me. I will remove everyone who is proud and arrogant, and you will never again rebel against me on my sacred hill.
ZEP.3.12	I will leave there a humble and lowly people, who will come to me for help.

ZEP.3.14	Sing and shout for joy, people of Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Rejoice with all your heart, Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	he has removed all your enemies.
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	there is no reason now to be afraid.
ZEP.3.16	The time is coming when they will say to Jerusalem,
ZEP.3.16	“Do not be afraid, city of Zion!
ZEP.3.16	Do not let your hands hang limp!
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	his power gives you victory.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	and in his love he will give you new life.
ZEP.3.17	He will sing and be joyful over you,
ZEP.3.18	as joyful as people at a festival.”
ZEP.3.18	The 
ZEP.3.18	“I have ended the threat of doom
ZEP.3.18	and taken away your disgrace.
ZEP.3.19	The time is coming!
ZEP.3.19	I will punish your oppressors;
ZEP.3.19	I will rescue all the lame
ZEP.3.19	and bring the exiles home.
ZEP.3.19	I will turn their shame to honor,
ZEP.3.19	and all the world will praise them.
ZEP.3.20	The time is coming!
ZEP.3.20	I will bring your scattered people home;
ZEP.3.20	I will make you famous throughout the world
ZEP.3.20	and make you prosperous once again.”
ZEP.3.20	The 
HAG.1.2	The 
HAG.1.3	The 
HAG.1.4	“My people, why should you be living in well-built houses while my Temple lies in ruins? 
HAG.1.5	Don't you see what is happening to you? 
HAG.1.6	You have planted much grain, but have harvested very little. You have food to eat, but not enough to make you full. You have wine to drink, but not enough to get drunk on! You have clothing, but not enough to keep you warm. And workers cannot earn enough to live on. 
HAG.1.7	Can't you see why this has happened? 
HAG.1.8	Now go up into the hills, get lumber, and rebuild the Temple; then I will be pleased and will be worshiped as I should be.
HAG.1.9	“You hoped for large harvests, but they turned out to be small. And when you brought the harvest home, I blew it away.
HAG.1.10	That is why there is no rain and nothing can grow. 
HAG.1.11	I have brought drought on the land—on its hills, grainfields, vineyards, and olive orchards—on every crop the ground produces, on people and animals, on everything you try to grow.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel and Joshua and all the people who had returned from the exile
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai gave the 
HAG.1.14	The 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was emperor.
HAG.2.1	On the twenty-first day of the seventh month of that same year, the 
HAG.2.2	He told Haggai to speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, to Joshua, the High Priest, and to the people, and to say to them, 
HAG.2.3	 “Is there anyone among you who can still remember how splendid the Temple used to be? How does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all. 
HAG.2.4	But now don't be discouraged, any of you. Do the work, for I am with you. 
HAG.2.5	 When you came out of Egypt, I promised that I would always be with you. I am still with you, so do not be afraid.
HAG.2.7	I will overthrow all the nations, and their treasures will be brought here, and the Temple will be filled with wealth. 
HAG.2.8	All the silver and gold of the world is mine. 
HAG.2.9	The new Temple will be more splendid than the old one, and there I will give my people prosperity and peace.” The 
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year that Darius was emperor, the 
HAG.2.11	He said, “Ask the priests for a ruling on this question: 
HAG.2.12	Suppose someone takes a piece of consecrated meat from a sacrifice and carries it in a fold of his robe. If he then lets his robe touch any bread, cooked food, wine, olive oil, or any kind of food at all, will it make that food consecrated also?”
HAG.2.12	When the question was asked, the priests answered, “No.”
HAG.2.13	The priests answered, “Yes.”
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai said, “The 
HAG.2.15	The 
HAG.2.16	you would go to a pile of grain expecting to find twenty bushels, but there would be only ten. You would go to draw fifty gallons of wine from a vat, but find only twenty. 
HAG.2.17	I sent scorching winds and hail to ruin everything you tried to grow, but still you did not repent. 
HAG.2.18	Today is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day that the foundation of the Temple has been completed. See what is going to happen from now on. 
HAG.2.19	Although there is no grain left, and the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not yet produced, yet from now on I will bless you.”
HAG.2.20	On that same day, the twenty-fourth of the month, the 
HAG.2.21	for Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah: “I am about to shake heaven and earth 
HAG.2.22	and overthrow kingdoms and end their power. I will overturn chariots and their drivers; the horses will die, and their riders will kill one another. 
HAG.2.23	On that day I will take you, Zerubbabel my servant, and I will appoint you to rule in my name. You are the one I have chosen.” The 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	but now I say to you, ‘Return to me, and I will return to you. 
ZEC.1.4	Do not be like your ancestors. Long ago the prophets gave them my message, telling them not to live evil, sinful lives any longer. But they would not listen to me or obey me. 
ZEC.1.5	Your ancestors and those prophets are no longer alive. 
ZEC.1.6	Through my servants the prophets I gave your ancestors commands and warnings, but they disregarded them and suffered the consequences. Then they repented and acknowledged that I, the 
ZEC.1.7	In the second year that Darius was emperor, on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month (the month of Shebat), the 
ZEC.1.8	 I saw someone riding a red horse. He had stopped among some myrtle trees in a valley, and behind him were other horses—red, dappled, and white. 
ZEC.1.9	I asked him, “Sir, what do these horses mean?”
ZEC.1.9	He answered, “I will show you what they mean. 
ZEC.1.10	The 
ZEC.1.11	They reported to the angel: “We have been all over the world and have found that the whole world lies helpless and subdued.”
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel said, “Almighty 
ZEC.1.13	The 
ZEC.1.14	and the angel told me to proclaim what the 
ZEC.1.15	and I am very angry with the nations that enjoy quiet and peace. For while I was holding back my anger against my people, those nations made the sufferings of my people worse. 
ZEC.1.16	So I have come back to Jerusalem to show mercy to the city. My Temple will be restored, and the city will be rebuilt.”
ZEC.1.17	The angel also told me to proclaim: “The 
ZEC.1.18	In another vision I saw four ox horns. 
ZEC.1.19	I asked the angel that had been speaking to me, “What do these horns mean?”
ZEC.1.19	He answered, “They stand for the world powers that have scattered the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	Then the 
ZEC.1.21	I asked, “What have they come to do?”
ZEC.1.21	He answered, “They have come to terrify and overthrow the nations that completely crushed the land of Judah and scattered its people.”
ZEC.2.1	In another vision I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	“Where are you going?” I asked.
ZEC.2.2	“To measure Jerusalem,” he answered, “to see how long and how wide it is.”
ZEC.2.3	Then I saw the angel who had been speaking to me step forward, and another angel came to meet him. 
ZEC.2.4	The first one said to the other, “Run and tell that young man with the measuring line that there are going to be so many people and so much livestock in Jerusalem that it will be too big to have walls. 
ZEC.2.5	The 
ZEC.2.6+ZEC.2.7	The 
ZEC.2.8	Anyone who strikes you strikes what is most precious to me.”
ZEC.2.8	So the 
ZEC.2.9	“The 
ZEC.2.9	When this happens, everyone will know that the 
ZEC.2.10	The 
ZEC.2.11	At that time many nations will come to the 
ZEC.2.12	Once again Judah will be the special possession of the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the 
ZEC.3.2	 The angel of the 
ZEC.3.3	Joshua was standing there, wearing filthy clothes. 
ZEC.3.4	The angel said to his heavenly attendants, “Take away the filthy clothes this man is wearing.” Then he said to Joshua, “I have taken away your sin and will give you new clothes to wear.”
ZEC.3.5	He commanded the attendants to put
ZEC.3.6	Then the angel told Joshua that 
ZEC.3.7	the 
ZEC.3.8	 Listen then, Joshua, you who are the High Priest; and listen, you fellow priests of his, you that are the sign of a good future: I will reveal my servant, who is called The Branch! 
ZEC.3.9	I am placing in front of Joshua a single stone with seven facets. I will engrave an inscription on it, and in a single day I will take away the sin of this land. 
ZEC.3.10	 When that day comes, each of you will invite your neighbor to come and enjoy peace and security, surrounded by your vineyards and fig trees.”
ZEC.4.1	The angel who had been speaking to me came again and roused me as if I had been sleeping. 
ZEC.4.2	“What do you see?” he asked.
ZEC.4.2	“A lampstand made of gold,” I answered. “At the top is a bowl for the oil. On the lampstand are seven lamps, each one with places for seven wicks. 
ZEC.4.3	 There are two olive trees beside the lampstand, one on each side of it.” 
ZEC.4.4	Then I asked the angel, “What do these things stand for, sir?”
ZEC.4.5	“Don't you know?” he asked me.
ZEC.4.5	“No, I don't, sir,” I replied.
ZEC.4.12	And what is the meaning of the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the olive oil pours?”
ZEC.4.13	He asked me, “Don't you know?”
ZEC.4.13	“No, I don't, sir,” I answered.
ZEC.4.14	Then he said, “These are the two men whom God has chosen and anointed to serve him, the Lord of the whole earth.”
ZEC.4.7	Obstacles as great as mountains will disappear before you. You will rebuild the Temple, and as you put the last stone in place, the people will shout, ‘Beautiful, beautiful!’”
ZEC.4.8	Another message came to me from the 
ZEC.4.9	He said, “Zerubbabel has laid the foundation of the Temple, and he will finish the building. When this happens, my people will know that it is I who sent you to them. 
ZEC.4.10	They are disappointed because so little progress is being made. But they will see Zerubbabel continuing to build the Temple, and they will be glad.”
ZEC.5.1	I looked again, and this time I saw a scroll flying through the air. 
ZEC.5.2	The angel asked me what I saw. I answered, “A scroll flying through the air; it is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.”
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “On it is written the curse that is to go out over the whole land. On one side of the scroll it says that every thief will be removed from the land; and on the other side it says that everyone who tells lies under oath will also be taken away. 
ZEC.5.4	The 
ZEC.5.5	The angel appeared again and said, “Look! Something else is coming!”
ZEC.5.6	“What is it?” I asked.
ZEC.5.6	He replied, “It is a basket, and it stands for the sin
ZEC.5.7	The basket had a lid made of lead. As I watched, the lid was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
ZEC.5.8	The angel said, “This represents wickedness.” Then he pushed her down into the basket and put the lid back down. 
ZEC.5.9	I looked up and saw two women flying toward me with powerful wings like those of a stork. They picked up the basket and flew off with it.
ZEC.5.10	I asked the angel, “Where are they taking it?”
ZEC.5.11	He answered, “To Babylonia, where they will build a temple for it. When the temple is finished, the basket will be placed there to be worshiped.”
ZEC.6.1	I had another vision. This time I saw four chariots coming out from between two bronze mountains. 
ZEC.6.2	 The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses, 
ZEC.6.3	 the third by white horses, and the fourth by dappled horses. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I asked the angel, “Sir, what do these chariots mean?”
ZEC.6.6	The chariot pulled by the black horses was going north to Babylonia, the white horses were going to the west, and the dappled horses were going to the country in the south. 
ZEC.6.7	As the dappled horses came out, they were impatient to go and inspect the earth. The angel said, “Go and inspect the earth!”—and they did. 
ZEC.6.8	Then the angel cried out to me, “The horses that went north to Babylonia have quieted the 
ZEC.6.9	The 
ZEC.6.10	He said, “Take the gifts given by the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, and go at once to the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah. All of them have returned from exile in Babylonia. 
ZEC.6.11	Make a crown out of the silver and gold they have given, and put it on the head of the High Priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. 
ZEC.6.12	 Tell him that the 
ZEC.6.13	He is the one who will build it and receive the honor due a king, and he will rule his people. A priest will stand by his throne, and they will work together in peace and harmony.’ 
ZEC.6.14	The crown will be a memorial in the 
ZEC.6.15	Men who live far away will come and help to rebuild the Temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	In the fourth year that Darius was emperor, on the fourth day of the ninth month (the month of Kislev), the 
ZEC.7.2	The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to the Temple of the 
ZEC.7.3	and to ask the priests and the prophets this question: “Should we continue to mourn because of the destruction of the Temple, by fasting in the fifth month as we have done for so many years now?”
ZEC.7.4	This is the message of the 
ZEC.7.5	He said, “Tell the people of the land and the priests that when they fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months during these seventy years, it was not in honor of me. 
ZEC.7.6	And when they ate and drank, it was for their own satisfaction.”
ZEC.7.7	This is what the 
ZEC.7.8	The 
ZEC.7.9	“Long ago I gave these commands to my people: ‘You must see that justice is done, and must show kindness and mercy to one another. 
ZEC.7.10	Do not oppress widows, orphans, foreigners who live among you, or anyone else in need. And do not plan ways of harming one another.’
ZEC.7.11	“But my people stubbornly refused to listen. They closed their minds 
ZEC.7.12	and made their hearts as hard as rock. Because they would not listen to the teaching which I sent through the prophets who lived long ago, I became very angry. 
ZEC.7.13	Because they did not listen when I spoke, I did not answer when they prayed. 
ZEC.7.14	Like a storm I swept them away to live in foreign countries. This good land was left a desolate place, with no one living in it.”
ZEC.8.1	The 
ZEC.8.2	“I have longed to help Jerusalem because of my deep love for her people, a love which has made me angry with her enemies. 
ZEC.8.3	I will return to Jerusalem, my holy city, and live there. It will be known as the faithful city, and the hill of the 
ZEC.8.4	Once again old men and women, so old that they use canes when they walk, will be sitting in the city squares. 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets will again be full of boys and girls playing.
ZEC.8.6	“This may seem impossible to those of the nation who are now left, but it's not impossible for me. 
ZEC.8.7	I will rescue my people from the lands where they have been taken, 
ZEC.8.8	and will bring them back from east and west to live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, ruling over them faithfully and justly.
ZEC.8.9	“Have courage! You are now hearing the same words the prophets spoke at the time the foundation was being laid for rebuilding my Temple. 
ZEC.8.10	Before that time no one could afford to hire either men or animals, and no one was safe from enemies. I turned people against one another. 
ZEC.8.11	But now I am treating the survivors of this nation differently. 
ZEC.8.12	They will plant their crops in peace. Their vines will bear grapes, the earth will produce crops, and there will be plenty of rain. I will give all these blessings to the people of my nation who survive. 
ZEC.8.13	People of Judah and Israel! In the past foreigners have cursed one another by saying, ‘May the same disasters fall on you that fell on Judah and Israel!’ But I will save you, and then those foreigners will say to one another, ‘May you receive the same blessings that came to Judah and Israel!’ So have courage and don't be afraid.”
ZEC.8.14	The 
ZEC.8.15	But now I am planning to bless the people of Jerusalem and Judah. So don't be afraid. 
ZEC.8.16	 These are the things you should do: Speak the truth to one another. In the courts give real justice—the kind that brings peace. 
ZEC.8.17	Do not plan ways of harming one another. Do not give false testimony under oath. I hate lying, injustice, and violence.”
ZEC.8.18	The 
ZEC.8.19	“The fasts held in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become festivals of joy and gladness for the people of Judah. You must love truth and peace.”
ZEC.8.20	The 
ZEC.8.21	Those from one city will say to those from another, ‘We are going to worship the 
ZEC.8.22	Many
ZEC.8.23	In those days ten foreigners will come to one Jew and say, ‘We want to share in your destiny, because we have heard that God is with you.’”
ZEC.9.1	He has decreed punishment for the land of Hadrach and for the city of Damascus. Not only the tribes of Israel but also the capital of Syria belong to the 
ZEC.9.2	Hamath, which borders on Hadrach, also belongs to him, and so do the cities of Tyre and Sidon, with all their skill. 
ZEC.9.3	Tyre has built fortifications for herself and has piled up so much silver and gold that it is as common as dirt! 
ZEC.9.4	But the Lord will take away everything she has. He will throw her wealth into the sea, and the city will be burned to the ground.
ZEC.9.6	People of mixed race will live in Ashdod. The 
ZEC.9.7	They will no longer eat meat with blood in it, or other forbidden food. All the survivors will become part of my people and be like a clan in the tribe of Judah. Ekron will become part of my people, as the Jebusites
ZEC.9.8	I will guard my land and keep armies from passing through it. I will not allow tyrants to oppress my people any more. I have seen how my people have suffered.”
ZEC.9.9	Shout for joy, you people of Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Look, your king is coming to you!
ZEC.9.9	He comes triumphant and victorious,
ZEC.9.9	but humble and riding on a donkey—
ZEC.9.9	on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
ZEC.9.10	“I will remove the war chariots from Israel
ZEC.9.10	and take the horses from Jerusalem;
ZEC.9.10	the bows used in battle will be destroyed.
ZEC.9.10	Your king will make peace among the nations;
ZEC.9.10	he will rule from sea to sea,
ZEC.9.10	from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.”
ZEC.9.11	“Because of my covenant with you
ZEC.9.11	that was sealed by the blood of sacrifices,
ZEC.9.11	I will set your people free—
ZEC.9.11	free from the waterless pit of exile.
ZEC.9.12	Return, you exiles who now have hope;
ZEC.9.12	return to your place of safety.
ZEC.9.12	Now I tell you that I will repay you twice over
ZEC.9.12	with blessing for all you have suffered.
ZEC.9.13	I will use Judah like a soldier's bow
ZEC.9.13	and Israel like the arrows.
ZEC.9.13	I will use the men of Zion like a sword,
ZEC.9.13	to fight the men of Greece.”
ZEC.9.14	The 
ZEC.9.14	he will shoot his arrows like lightning.
ZEC.9.14	The Sovereign 
ZEC.9.14	he will march in the storms from the south.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	and they will destroy their enemies.
ZEC.9.15	They will shout in battle like drunk men
ZEC.9.15	and will shed the blood of their enemies;
ZEC.9.15	it will flow like the blood of a sacrifice
ZEC.9.15	poured on the altar from a bowl.
ZEC.9.16	When that day comes, the 
ZEC.9.16	as a shepherd saves his flock from danger.
ZEC.9.16	They will shine in his land
ZEC.9.16	like the jewels of a crown.
ZEC.9.17	How good and beautiful the land will be!
ZEC.9.17	The young people will grow strong on its grain and wine.
ZEC.10.1	Ask the 
ZEC.10.2	 People consult idols and fortunetellers, but the answers they get are lies and nonsense. Some interpret dreams, but only mislead you; the comfort they give is useless. So the people wander about like lost sheep. They are in trouble because they have no leader.
ZEC.10.3	The 
ZEC.10.4	From among them will come rulers, leaders, and commanders to govern my people.
ZEC.10.5	The people of Judah will be victorious like soldiers who trample their enemies in the mud of the streets. They will fight because the 
ZEC.10.6	“I will make the people of Judah strong;
ZEC.10.6	I will rescue the people of Israel.
ZEC.10.6	I will have compassion on them
ZEC.10.6	and bring them all back home.
ZEC.10.6	They will be as though I had never rejected them.
ZEC.10.6	I am the 
ZEC.10.7	The people of Israel will be strong like soldiers,
ZEC.10.7	happy like those who have been drinking wine.
ZEC.10.7	Their descendants will remember this victory
ZEC.10.7	and be glad because of what the 
ZEC.10.8	“I will call my people
ZEC.10.8	and gather them together.
ZEC.10.8	I will rescue them
ZEC.10.8	and make them as numerous as they used to be.
ZEC.10.9	yet in far-off places they will remember me.
ZEC.10.9	They and their children will survive
ZEC.10.9	and return home together.
ZEC.10.10	From Egypt and Assyria I will bring them home
ZEC.10.10	and settle them in their own country.
ZEC.10.10	I will settle them in Gilead and Lebanon also;
ZEC.10.10	the whole land will be filled with people.
ZEC.10.11	When they pass through their sea of trouble,
ZEC.10.11	I, the 
ZEC.10.11	and the depths of the Nile will go dry.
ZEC.10.11	Proud Assyria will be humbled,
ZEC.10.11	and mighty Egypt will lose her power.
ZEC.10.12	I will make my people strong;
ZEC.10.12	they will worship and obey me.”
ZEC.10.12	The 
ZEC.11.1	Open your doors, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	so that fire can burn down your cedar trees!
ZEC.11.2	Weep and wail, cypress trees—
ZEC.11.2	the cedars have fallen;
ZEC.11.2	those glorious trees have been destroyed!
ZEC.11.2	Weep and wail, oaks of Bashan—
ZEC.11.2	the dense forest has been cut down!
ZEC.11.3	The rulers cry out in grief;
ZEC.11.3	their glory is gone!
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the roaring of the lions;
ZEC.11.3	their forest home along the Jordan is destroyed!
ZEC.11.4	The 
ZEC.11.5	Their owners kill them and go unpunished. They sell the meat and say, ‘Praise the 
ZEC.11.5	( 
ZEC.11.6	The 
ZEC.11.7	Those who bought and sold the sheep hired me, and I became the shepherd of the sheep that were going to be butchered. I took two sticks: one I called “Favor” and the other “Unity.” And I took care of the flock. 
ZEC.11.8	I lost patience with three other shepherds, who hated me, and I got rid of them all in a single month. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said to the flock, “I will not be your shepherd any longer. Let those die who are to die. Let those be destroyed who are to be destroyed. Those who are left will destroy one another.” 
ZEC.11.10	Then I took the stick called “Favor” and broke it, to cancel the covenant which the 
ZEC.11.11	So the covenant was canceled on that day. Those who bought and sold the sheep were watching me, and they knew that the 
ZEC.11.13	The 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke the second stick, the one called “Unity,” and the unity of Judah and Israel was shattered.
ZEC.11.15	Then the 
ZEC.11.16	I have put a shepherd in charge of my flock, but he does not help the sheep that are threatened by destruction; nor does he look for the lost, or heal those that are hurt, or feed the healthy. Instead, he eats the meat of the fattest sheep and tears off their hoofs. 
ZEC.11.17	That worthless shepherd is doomed! He has abandoned his flock. War will totally destroy his power. His arm will wither, and his right eye will go blind.”
ZEC.12.1	This is a message about Israel from the 
ZEC.12.2	“I will make Jerusalem like a cup of wine; the nations around her will drink and stagger like drunks. And when they besiege Jerusalem, the cities of the rest of Judah will also be besieged. 
ZEC.12.3	But when that time comes, I will make Jerusalem like a heavy stone—any nation that tries to lift it will be hurt. All the nations of the world will join forces to attack her. 
ZEC.12.4	At that time I will terrify all their horses and make all their riders go crazy. I will watch over the people of Judah, but I will make the horses of their enemies blind. 
ZEC.12.5	Then the clans of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The 
ZEC.12.6	“At that time I will make the clans of Judah like a fire in a forest or in a field of ripe grain—they will destroy all the surrounding nations. The people of Jerusalem will remain safe in the city.
ZEC.12.7	“I, the 
ZEC.12.8	At that time the 
ZEC.12.9	At that time I will destroy every nation that tries to attack Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.11	At that time the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad Rimmon
ZEC.12.12+ZEC.12.13+ZEC.12.14	Each family in the land will mourn by itself: the family descended from David, the family descended from Nathan, the family descended from Levi, the family descended from Shimei, and all the other families.

ZEC.14.5	You will escape through this valley that divides the mountain in two.

MAL.2.3	I will punish your children and rub your faces in the dung of the animals you sacrifice—and you will be taken out to the dung heap.

TOB.1.1	I am Tobit and this is the story of my life. My father was Tobiel, my grandfather was Ananiel, and my great-grandfather was Aduel. Aduel's father was Gabael; his grandfather was Raphael; and his great-grandfather was Raguel, who belonged to the clan of Asiel, a part of the tribe of Naphtali. 
TOB.1.2	 During the time that Shalmaneser was emperor of Assyria, I was taken captive in my hometown of Thisbe, located in northern Galilee, south of Kadesh in Naphtali, northwest of Hazor, and north of Phogor.
TOB.1.3	All my life I have been honest and have tried to do what was right. I often gave money to help needy relatives and other Jews who had been deported with me to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.
TOB.1.4	When I was young, I lived in northern Israel. All the tribes in Israel were supposed to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem. It was the one city that God had chosen from among all the Israelite cities as the place where his Temple was to be built for his holy and eternal home. But my entire tribe of Naphtali rejected the city of Jerusalem and the kings descended from David. 
TOB.1.5	 Like everyone else in this tribe, my own family used to go to the city of Dan in the mountains of northern Galilee to offer sacrifices to the gold bull-calf which King Jeroboam of Israel had set up there.
TOB.1.7	I would give a tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruits to the Levites who served God in Jerusalem. Every year, except the seventh year when the land was at rest,
TOB.1.8	But every third year, I would give a third tithe
TOB.1.9	When I grew up, I married Anna, a member of my own tribe. We had a son and named him Tobias. 
TOB.1.10	Later, I was taken captive and deported to Assyria, and that is how I came to live in Nineveh.
TOB.1.10	While we lived in Nineveh, all my relatives and the other Jews used to eat the same kind of food as the other people who lived there, 
TOB.1.11	but I refused to do so. 
TOB.1.12	Since I took seriously the commands of the Most High God, 
TOB.1.13	he made Emperor Shalmaneser respect me, and I was placed in charge of purchasing all the emperor's supplies.
TOB.1.14	Before the emperor died, I made regular trips to the land of Media to buy things for him there. Once, when I was in the city of Rages in Media, I left some bags of money there with Gabael, Gabrias' brother, and asked him to keep them for me. There were more than 600 pounds of silver coins in those bags. 
TOB.1.15	When Shalmaneser died, his son Sennacherib succeeded him as emperor. It soon became so dangerous to travel on the roads in Media that I could no longer go there.
TOB.1.16	While Shalmaneser was still emperor, I took good care of my own people whenever they were in need. 
TOB.1.17	 If they were hungry, I shared my food with them; if they needed clothes, I gave them some of my own. Whenever I saw that the dead body of one of my people had been thrown outside the city wall, I gave it a decent burial.
TOB.1.18	One day Sennacherib cursed God, the King of Heaven; God punished him, and Sennacherib had to retreat from Judah. On his way back to Media he was so furious that he killed many Israelites. But I secretly removed the bodies and buried them; and when Sennacherib later searched for the bodies, he could not find them.
TOB.1.19	Then someone from Nineveh told the emperor that I was the one who had been burying his victims. As soon as I realized that the emperor knew all about me and that my life was in danger, I became frightened. So I ran away and hid. 
TOB.1.20	Everything I owned was seized and put in the royal treasury. My wife Anna and my son Tobias were all I had left.
TOB.1.21	About six weeks later, two of Sennacherib's sons assassinated him and then escaped to the mountains of Ararat. Another son, Esarhaddon, became emperor and put Ahikar, my brother Anael's son, in charge of all the financial affairs of the empire. 
TOB.1.22	This was actually the second time Ahikar was appointed to this position, for when Sennacherib was emperor of Assyria, Ahikar had been wine steward, treasurer, and accountant, and had been in charge of the official seal. Since Ahikar was my nephew, he put in a good word for me with the emperor, and I was allowed to return to Nineveh.
TOB.2.2	When I saw how much food there was on the table, I said to Tobias, “Son, go out and find one of our people who is living in poverty here in exile, someone who takes God's commands seriously. Bring him back with you, so that he can share this festival meal with us. I won't start eating until you come back.”
TOB.2.3	So Tobias went out to look for such a person. But he quickly returned, shouting, “Father! Father!”
TOB.2.3	“Yes, what is it?” I asked.
TOB.2.3	“One of our people has just been murdered! Someone strangled him and threw his body into the marketplace.”
TOB.2.4	I jumped up and left the table without even touching my food. I removed the body from the street and carried it to a little shed, where I left it until sunset, when I could bury it. 
TOB.2.5	 Then I returned home and washed, so as to purify myself. In deep sorrow I ate my dinner. 
TOB.2.6	 I was reminded of what the prophet Amos had said to the people of Bethel,
TOB.2.6	“Your festivals will be turned into funerals,
TOB.2.6	and your glad songs will become cries of grief.”
TOB.2.6	I began to weep.
TOB.2.7	After sunset I went out, dug a grave, and buried the man. 
TOB.2.8	My neighbors thought I was crazy. “Haven't you learned anything?” they asked. “You have already been hunted down once for burying the dead, and you would have been killed if you had not run away. But here you are doing the same thing all over again.”
TOB.2.9	That night I washed, so as to purify myself, and went out into my courtyard to sleep by the wall. It was a hot night, and I did not pull the cover up over my head. 
TOB.2.10	Sparrows were on the wall right above me, but I did not know it. Their warm droppings fell into my eyes, causing a white film to form on them. I went to one doctor after another, but the more they treated me with their medicines, the worse my eyes became, until finally I was completely blind.
TOB.2.10	For four years I could see nothing. My relatives were deeply concerned about my condition, and Ahikar supported me for two years before he went to the land of Elam.
TOB.2.11	After Ahikar left, my wife Anna had to go to work, so she took up weaving, like many other women. 
TOB.2.12	The people she worked for would pay her when she delivered the cloth. One spring day, she cut a finished piece of cloth from the loom and took it to the people who had ordered it. They paid her the full price and also gave her a goat.
TOB.2.13	When Anna came home with the goat, it began to bleat. I called out, “Where did that goat come from? You stole it, didn't you? Take it straight back to its owners. It's not right to eat stolen food!”
TOB.2.14	“No!” she replied. “It was given to me as a gift in addition to what I got for the cloth.” But I didn't believe her, and I blushed for shame for what she had done. I ordered her to return the goat to its owners, but she had the last word. “Now I see what you are really like!” she shouted. “Where is all that concern of yours for others? What about all those good deeds you used to do?”
TOB.3.1	I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I sighed and began to cry. Then, as I choked back my tears, I prayed:
TOB.3.2	“You are righteous, O Lord!
TOB.3.2	You are merciful
TOB.3.2	faithful in all your ways.
TOB.3.2	You are the judge of this world.
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	I beg you, treat me with kindness.
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	Do not punish me for my sins,
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	not even for sins of which I am unaware.
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	My ancestors rebelled and disobeyed
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	but do not punish me for their sins.
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	You let our people be plundered,
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	taken captive and killed.
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	You made an example of our people,
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	an object of contempt and disgrace
TOB.3.3+TOB.3.4	in all the nations where you scattered us.
TOB.3.5	You have often judged my ancestors for their sins
TOB.3.5	and punished me for mine.
TOB.3.5	We were disloyal and rejected your commands,
TOB.3.5	so our punishment has always been just.
TOB.3.6	“Now treat me as you please.
TOB.3.6	Take my life away and free me from this world;
TOB.3.6	let my body return to the earth.
TOB.3.6	I would be better off dead.
TOB.3.6	I am tormented by insults I don't deserve,
TOB.3.6	and weighed down with despair.
TOB.3.6	Lord, give the command—
TOB.3.6	bring all my troubles to an end,
TOB.3.6	take me to my eternal rest.
TOB.3.6	Don't reject my prayer.
TOB.3.6	I would rather die than live in misery
TOB.3.6	and face such cruel insults.”
TOB.3.7	That same day in the city of Ecbatana in Media, it happened that Sarah, the daughter of a man named Raguel, was insulted by one of her father's servant women. 
TOB.3.8	Sarah had been married seven times, but the evil demon, Asmodeus, killed each husband before the marriage could be consummated. The servant woman said to Sarah, “You husband killer! Look at you! You've already had seven husbands, but not one of them lived long enough to give you a son.
TOB.3.9	Why should you take it out on us? Why don't you go and join your dead husbands? I hope we never see a child of yours!”
TOB.3.10	Sarah was so depressed that she burst into tears and went upstairs determined to hang herself. But when she thought it over, she said to herself, “No, I won't do it! People would insult my father and say, ‘You had only one child, a daughter whom you loved dearly, but she hanged herself because she felt so miserable.’ Such grief would bring my gray-haired father to his grave, and I would be responsible. I won't kill myself; I'll just beg the Lord to let me die. Then I won't have to listen to those insults any longer!”
TOB.3.11	Then Sarah stood by the window, raised her arms in prayer, and said,
TOB.3.11	“God of mercy, worthy of our praise,
TOB.3.11	may your name always be honored,
TOB.3.11	may all your creation praise you forever.
TOB.3.12	“Lord, I look to you for help.
TOB.3.13	Speak the word and set me free from this life;
TOB.3.13	then I will no longer have to hear these insults.
TOB.3.14	You know, O Lord, that I'm still a virgin;
TOB.3.14	I have never been defiled by a man.
TOB.3.15	Never have I disgraced myself or my father's name,
TOB.3.15	as long as we have lived in this land of exile.
TOB.3.15	My father has no other child to be his heir,
TOB.3.15	and there is no relative
TOB.3.15	I have already lost seven husbands,
TOB.3.15	so why should I live any longer?
TOB.3.15	But if it is not your will to take my life,
TOB.3.15	at least show mercy to me.
TOB.3.15	Don't let me hear those insults again!”
TOB.3.16	As Tobit and Sarah were praying, God in heaven heard their prayers 
TOB.3.17	 and sent his angel Raphael to help them. He was sent to remove the white film from Tobit's eyes, so that he could see again, and to arrange a marriage between Sarah and Tobit's son Tobias, who, as her cousin, had the right to marry her. Raphael was also ordered to expel the demon Asmodeus from Sarah. At the very moment that Tobit went back into his house from the courtyard, Sarah, in her house in Ecbatana, was coming downstairs.
TOB.4.1	That same day, Tobit remembered the money that he had left with Gabael at Rages in Media. 
TOB.4.2	He thought to himself, “Now that I have asked God to let me die, I should call my son Tobias and tell him about the money.”
TOB.4.3+TOB.4.4	So Tobit called Tobias and said to him, “Son, when I die, give me a proper burial. And after I'm gone, show respect to your mother. Take care of her for the rest of her life, and when she dies, bury her beside me. Remember, she risked her life to bring you into this world, so try to make her happy and never do anything that would worry her.
TOB.4.5	“Every day of your life, keep the Lord our God in mind. Never sin deliberately or disobey any of his commands. Always do what is right and never get involved in anything evil. 
TOB.4.6	Be honest, and you will succeed in whatever you do.
TOB.4.8	Give according to what you have. The more you have, the more you should give. Even if you have only a little, be sure to give something. 
TOB.4.9	This is as good as money saved. You will have your reward in a time of trouble. 
TOB.4.10+TOB.4.11	Taking care of the poor is the kind of offering that pleases God in heaven. Do this, and you will be kept safe from the dark world of the dead.
TOB.4.12	“Son, be on your guard against prostitutes. Above all, marry a woman of our tribe, because we are descendants of the prophets. Do not marry anyone who is not related to us. Remember that Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our earliest ancestors, all married relatives. God blessed them with children, and so their descendants will inherit the land of Israel. 
TOB.4.13	Son, be loyal to your own relatives. Don't be too proud to marry one of them. Such pride leads to terrible frustration and ruin, just as laziness brings on severe poverty and causes starvation.
TOB.4.14	“Pay your workers each day; never keep back their wages overnight. Honor God in this way, and he will reward you. Behave properly at all times. 
TOB.4.15	 Never do to anyone else anything that you would not want someone to do to you.
TOB.4.15	“Do not drink so much wine that you get drunk, and do not let drinking become a habit.
TOB.4.16	“Give food to the hungry and clothes to people in need. If you are prosperous, give generously, and do it gladly!
TOB.4.18	“Take the advice of sensible people, and never treat any useful advice lightly.
TOB.4.19	“Take advantage of every opportunity to praise the Lord your God. Ask him to make you prosper in whatever you set out to do. He does not give his wisdom to the people of any other nation. He is the source of all good things, but he can also destroy you and bring you to certain death, if he wishes.
TOB.4.19	“Remember all my instructions. Don't forget them for one minute.
TOB.4.20	“Tobias, I want you to know that I once left a large sum of money with Gabrias' son, Gabael, at Rages in Media. 
TOB.4.21	 We're poor now, but don't worry. If you obey God and avoid sin, he will be pleased with you and make you prosperous.”
TOB.5.1	Then Tobias answered his father, “I'll do everything you told me. 
TOB.5.2	But how can I get the money back from Gabael? We have never even met each other. How can I prove to him who I am, so that he will trust me and give me the money? Besides that, I don't know how to get to Media.”
TOB.5.3	Tobit replied, “Gabael and I both signed a document. I then tore it in two, and we each took a half. I put his half with the money. That was twenty years ago! Now, go and find a reliable person to travel with you to Media and back, and we will pay him when you return. But you must get the money that I left with Gabael.”
TOB.5.5	so he asked him where he was from.
TOB.5.5	“I am an Israelite,” Raphael answered, “one of your distant relatives, and I have come here to Nineveh to find work.”
TOB.5.5	“Do you know the way to Media?” Tobias asked.
TOB.5.6	“Yes, I do,” Raphael replied. “I have been there many times, and I know all the roads well. I used to stay with our relative Gabael, who lives there in the town of Rages.
TOB.5.7	Then Tobias said to Raphael, “Wait here for me, my friend, while I go in and tell my father. I would like for you to travel with me, and I will pay you for the journey.”
TOB.5.8	“All right,” Raphael said, “I'll wait, but don't take too long.”
TOB.5.9	Tobias went in and told his father, “I have found an Israelite to travel with me.”
TOB.5.9	“Call the man in,” Tobit replied. “I would like to know what family and tribe he belongs to, and whether he is a reliable traveling companion for you.”
TOB.5.9	So Tobias went out and called to Raphael, “My father would like to meet you.” When Raphael came in, Tobit greeted him first.
TOB.5.9	Then Raphael returned the greeting, “I hope all is well with you.”
TOB.5.9	But Tobit replied, “How can all be well with me? I'm blind and can't see a thing. It's like being dead and no longer able to see the light. I might as well be dead! I can hear people talking, but I can't see them.”
TOB.5.9	“Cheer up!” Raphael said to him. “God is going to cure you soon, so don't worry!”
TOB.5.9	Tobit then said, “My son Tobias wants to go to Media. Can you go with him and show him the way? I will pay you, of course.”
TOB.5.9	Raphael replied, “Certainly I can go with him. I have traveled there many times and I know all the roads in the mountains and on the plains.”
TOB.5.10	Tobit questioned him further, “Tell me, my friend, what family and tribe do you belong to?”
TOB.5.11	But Raphael asked, “Why do you need to know that?”
TOB.5.11	“Tell me the truth,” said Tobit. “What is your name, and who are you?”
TOB.5.12	Raphael replied, “My name is Azarias, and I am the son of the older Ananias, one of your relatives.”
TOB.5.13	Then Tobit said to him, “Welcome to our home! God bless you, my son. Please don't be offended because I wanted to know the truth about you and your family. As it turns out, you are from a good family and a relative at that! I knew Ananias and Nathan, the two sons of the older Shemaiah. They were always loyal to their religion. We used to travel together to Jerusalem and worship there. Your relatives are fine people, and you come from good stock. Have a safe journey.”
TOB.5.14	Tobit continued, “I will pay the normal daily wage plus expenses for both of you. 
TOB.5.15	Be a good companion to Tobias, and I will add a bonus to your wages.”
TOB.5.16	“God be with you!” Tobit replied. Then he called Tobias and said to him, “Son, get everything ready that you need for the journey, so that the two of you can be on your way. May God and his angel watch over you both and bring you back to me safe and sound.”
TOB.5.16	Before leaving for Media, Tobias kissed his father and mother good-bye. Tobit said again, “Have a safe journey!”
TOB.5.17	Then his mother began to cry. “How could you send my son away like this?” she complained. “He's our only means of support. Who will take care of us now? 
TOB.5.18	Is that money so important to you that you are willing to risk your own son's life to get it back? 
TOB.5.19	Why can't we be content to live on what the Lord has given us?”
TOB.5.20	“Calm down,” Tobit said to her. “He will get there and back safely, and with your own eyes you will see him return home safe and sound. 
TOB.5.21	Now stop worrying about them, dear. A good angel will go with Tobias. He will have a successful journey and will come back in good health.” At that, Anna calmed down and stopped crying.
TOB.6.1	So Tobias and the angel started out toward Media, taking Tobias' dog along with them. They walked on until sunset, then camped by the Tigris River. 
TOB.6.2	Tobias had gone down to wash his feet in the river, when suddenly a huge fish jumped up out of the water and tried to swallow one of his feet. Tobias let out a yell, 
TOB.6.3	and the angel called to him, “Grab that fish! Don't let it get away.”
TOB.6.3	Then Tobias grabbed the fish and dragged it up on the bank.
TOB.6.4	“Cut the fish open,” the angel instructed, “and take out its gall bladder, heart, and liver. Keep these with you; they can be used for medicine, but throw away the guts.”
TOB.6.5	Tobias did as the angel had told him. Then he cooked the fish, ate part of it, and salted the rest to take along with him.
TOB.6.5	The two continued on together until they were near Media. 
TOB.6.6	Then Tobias asked, “Azarias, my friend, what diseases can be cured by this gall bladder, heart, and liver?”
TOB.6.7	The angel answered, “The heart and liver can be burned and used to chase away a demon or an evil spirit that is tormenting someone. The attacks will stop immediately, and the person will never be troubled again. 
TOB.6.8	You can use the gall bladder to treat someone whose eyes are covered with a white film. Just rub it on his eyes and blow on the film, and he will be able to see again.”
TOB.6.9	When they had reached Media and were approaching the city of Ecbatana, 
TOB.6.10	Raphael said, “Tobias, my friend.”
TOB.6.10	“Yes, what is it?” Tobias asked.
TOB.6.10	Raphael continued, “Tonight we will stay at the home of your relative Raguel. He has only one child, a daughter named Sarah, 
TOB.6.11	and since you are her closest relative, you have the right to marry her. You also have the right to inherit all her father's property. 
TOB.6.12	She is sensible, brave, and very beautiful; and her father is a good man. Tonight I'll discuss the marriage proposal with her father, and he will consent to give her to you as your bride. Then, when we return home from the town of Rages, we will celebrate the marriage. Raguel cannot refuse to let you marry her, and he cannot let any other man have her. If he did, then according to the Law of Moses he would deserve the death penalty. He knows that you are the only man who has the right to marry his daughter and receive the inheritance, so follow my advice. Raguel and I will discuss the matter tonight and arrange your engagement to Sarah. When we get back from the city of Rages, we will take her home with us.”
TOB.6.13	Tobias then said to Raphael, “Azarias, my friend, I have already heard about Sarah's seven former husbands, and how each one dropped dead on his wedding night, even before he could get to bed. 
TOB.6.14	According to the story I heard, a demon killed them. He doesn't harm Sarah, but he kills every man who tries to get near her. I am afraid of this demon. I am an only child, and if I were to die, the sorrow would send my parents to their graves. They don't even have another son to bury them.”
TOB.6.15	The angel replied, “Have you already forgotten your father's instructions? He told you to marry a woman from your own tribe. So, listen carefully to what I say. Don't worry about the demon. Marry Sarah! I know that tonight Raguel will let Sarah marry you. 
TOB.6.16	When you go into the bedroom, take the fish's heart and liver with you and place them on the burning incense, 
TOB.6.17	so that the odor will spread throughout the room. When the demon smells it, he will leave and never come near Sarah again. But before you consummate the marriage, both of you must get up and pray for the Lord in heaven to be merciful to you and to protect you. Don't be afraid. Sarah was meant to be yours from the beginning of creation. You will rescue her from the demon, and she will go with you to your home. You and Sarah will have many children, whom you will love very much. So don't worry!”
TOB.6.17	Tobias listened very carefully to what Raphael had to say. He knew that Sarah was a relative on his father's side of the family. He began to fall in love with her and looked forward to marrying her.
TOB.7.1	When Tobias and the angel Raphael had entered the city of Ecbatana, Tobias said, “Azarias, my friend, take me to see Raguel as quickly as you can.” The angel brought him to Raguel's house, where they found him sitting at the entrance to his courtyard. Raphael and Tobias greeted him first; then he replied, “Come in, my friends. You are welcome in my home.”
TOB.7.1	Raguel brought them into his house 
TOB.7.2	and said to his wife Edna, “Doesn't this young man look just like my cousin Tobit?”
TOB.7.3	Edna asked them, “Where do you come from?”
TOB.7.3	“We are Israelites of the tribe of Naphtali,” Tobias and Raphael answered, “but we are now living in exile in the city of Nineveh in Assyria.”
TOB.7.4	Edna said, “Do you know our cousin Tobit?”
TOB.7.4	“We certainly do know him,” they answered.
TOB.7.4	“How is he?” she asked.
TOB.7.5	“He is alive and well,” they replied.
TOB.7.5	Then Tobias added, “Tobit is my father.” 
TOB.7.6	 At that Raguel got up, and with tears of joy in his eyes he kissed Tobias. 
TOB.7.7	Then he said, “God bless you, my child. Your father is a good and noble man. What a terrible tragedy that such an honest and generous man should have lost his sight!” He threw his arms around Tobias' neck and wept on his shoulder. 
TOB.7.8	His wife Edna and his daughter Sarah also wept for Tobit.
TOB.7.8	Raguel gave Tobias and Raphael a warm welcome and had one of his rams slaughtered. After the guests had bathed and were about to sit down to eat, Tobias said to Raphael, “Azarias, my friend, when are you going to ask Raguel to let me marry Sarah?”
TOB.7.9	But Raguel overheard the question and said to Tobias, 
TOB.7.10	“Eat and drink something first and enjoy yourself this evening. You have the right to marry Sarah, and I cannot let anyone else marry her, because you are my closest relative. But I must tell you the truth, my son. 
TOB.7.11	I have already given her to seven men, all of them relatives. Each one died on his wedding night, as soon as he entered the bedroom. But now, my son, have something to eat and drink. The Lord will take care of you both.”
TOB.7.11	Tobias replied, “I won't eat or drink until you give me your word.”
TOB.7.12	Raguel agreed. “Certainly I will,” he said. “I will give her to you just as the Law of Moses commands. God in heaven has arranged this marriage, so take her as your wife. From now on, you belong to each other. Sarah is yours today and forever. May the Lord of heaven keep both of you safe tonight. May he be merciful and kind to you.”
TOB.7.13	Then Raguel called his daughter. When she came in, he took her by the hand and gave her to Tobias with his blessing, “Take her to be your wife according to the teachings in the Law of Moses. Take her safely with you to your father's house. May the God of heaven give you a happy life together.”
TOB.7.14	Raguel asked his wife to bring him a blank scroll so that he could write out the marriage contract. Edna brought him the scroll, and Raguel wrote out the agreement, saying that Sarah was given to Tobias according to the teachings in the Law of Moses. 
TOB.7.15	After the ceremony they began the meal.
TOB.7.16	Raguel called his wife and said, “Get the spare room ready, my dear, and take Sarah there.”
TOB.7.17	Edna made up the bed as Raguel had told her. Then she took Sarah into the room with her, and Sarah began to cry.
TOB.7.18	“Don't worry, Sarah. I'm sure the Lord of heaven will make you happy this time and not sad. So cheer up, my dear.” Then Edna left the room.
TOB.8.1	When they had finished the meal, and it was time to go to bed, Sarah's parents led young Tobias to the bedroom. 
TOB.8.2	He remembered Raphael's instructions, so he took the fish's liver and heart out of the bag where he had been keeping them. Then he placed them on the burning incense. 
TOB.8.3	 The smell drove the demon away from them, and he fled to Egypt.
TOB.8.4	When Tobias and Sarah were alone behind closed doors, Tobias got up from the bed and said to his wife, “Get up, dear. Let's pray for the Lord to be merciful and to protect us.” 
TOB.8.5	 Sarah got up so that they could pray together and ask God for his protection. Then Tobias prayed:
TOB.8.5	“God of our ancestors, you are worthy of praise.
TOB.8.5	May your name be honored forever and ever
TOB.8.5	by all your creatures in heaven and on earth.
TOB.8.6	to be his helper and support.
TOB.8.6	They became the parents of the whole human race.
TOB.8.6	You said, ‘It is not good for man to live alone.
TOB.8.6	I will make a suitable helper for him.’
TOB.8.7	Lord, I have chosen Sarah because it is right,
TOB.8.7	not because I lusted for her.
TOB.8.7	Please be merciful to us
TOB.8.7	and grant that we may grow old together.”
TOB.8.8	Then they both said “Amen” 
TOB.8.9	and went to bed for the night.
TOB.8.9	Later that night, Raguel called his servants, and together they went out to dig a grave, 
TOB.8.10	because Raguel thought, “Tobias will probably die too, and people will laugh and make fun of us.” 
TOB.8.11	When they finished digging the grave, Raguel went back into the house and said to his wife, 
TOB.8.12	“Send one of the servant women to find out if Tobias is still alive. If he isn't, then we will bury him before anyone finds out.” 
TOB.8.13	They then sent a servant woman to take a lamp and see if he was still alive. As she opened the door, she could see that both of them were sound asleep. 
TOB.8.14	So she went back and told Raguel and Edna that Tobias was alive and unharmed. 
TOB.8.15	Then Raguel
TOB.8.15	“You are worthy of our praise, O God.
TOB.8.15	May your people praise you forever,
TOB.8.15	may they praise you with pure hearts.
TOB.8.16	I praise you because you have made me glad;
TOB.8.16	you have been merciful to us,
TOB.8.16	and my worst fears did not come true.
TOB.8.17	You deserve our praise, O Lord;
TOB.8.17	you were merciful to this young couple,
TOB.8.17	the only children of their parents.
TOB.8.17	Now, grant them your mercy and protection.
TOB.8.17	Let them live out their lives in happiness and love.”
TOB.8.18	Then Raguel ordered his servants to fill in the grave before dawn.
TOB.8.19	Raguel told his wife to bake enough bread for a big feast. Then he went out to the herd and brought back two oxen and four rams, which he ordered his servants to slaughter in preparation for the wedding feast. 
TOB.8.20	 He called for Tobias and vowed
TOB.8.21	Then you may take half of what I own and go back to your parents safe and sound. You will inherit the other half when Edna and I die. Have no doubts about our love for you; from now on you are as much our son as Sarah is our daughter. You can be sure of that, my son.”
TOB.9.1	Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him, 
TOB.9.2	“Azarias, take four of the servants with you, and two camels, and go to Gabael's house in the town of Rages. Give him the signed document, so that he will give you the money. Then bring him back with you for the wedding feast. 
TOB.9.3+TOB.9.4	You know that my father is counting the days until I come home, and he will be very upset if I am even one day late. You know, too, how Raguel insists that I must stay, and I cannot disappoint him.”
TOB.9.5	So Raphael and the four servants went to Rages in Media, where they stayed at Gabael's house. Raphael gave him the signed document and told him that Tobit's son Tobias had recently married, and that Gabael was invited to the wedding feast. At once Gabael counted out the bags of money, which were still sealed, and they loaded them on the camels.
TOB.9.6	Very early the next morning, they set out for the wedding feast. When Raphael and Gabael came to Raguel's house, they found Tobias at dinner. Tobias immediately got up and greeted Gabael. With tears in his eyes Gabael returned the greeting and added, “You are just like your honest and generous father. May the Lord in heaven bless you and your wife, your mother-in-law, and your father. Praise God! He has let me live to see my cousin Tobias, who looks so much like his father.”
TOB.10.1	Meanwhile, every day Tobit was keeping count of the time needed to travel to Rages and back. When the time was up and his son had not returned, Tobit said to his wife, 
TOB.10.2	“What can be keeping him? Do you suppose Gabael has died? Maybe there is no one to give him the money.” 
TOB.10.3	Tobit was very worried.
TOB.10.4	Then Anna said, “My son is dead. I'm sure of it.” She began to weep and to mourn for Tobias, 
TOB.10.5	“Oh, my son, the joy of my life, why did I ever let you leave home?”
TOB.10.6	Tobit tried to comfort her. “Calm down, my dear,” he said. “Don't worry. He will be all right. Something unexpected is probably keeping them there longer than we counted on. Besides, his companion is a reliable man and a relative at that. Don't let yourself get so upset over him, dear. I'm sure he is already on his way home.”
TOB.10.7	But she replied, “Be quiet and leave me alone! Don't try to fool me. My son is dead.” Each day she would rush out of the house to the road which Tobias had taken and would watch for him until sunset. She would let no one comfort her,
TOB.10.7	The two-week wedding feast which Raguel had promised to hold for his daughter Sarah came to an end. So Tobias went to him and asked, “Please let me go home now. I'm certain my parents have given up all hope of ever seeing me again. Please, Raguel, let me go home to my father. I have already told you the condition he was in when I left.”
TOB.10.8	But Raguel answered, “Stay, my son. Stay here with me. I will send messengers to your father to tell him that you are all right.”
TOB.10.9	But Tobias insisted, “No, I can't! Please let me go back to my father.”
TOB.10.10	So Raguel gave Tobias his bride Sarah without further delay. He also gave Tobias half of everything he owned: slaves, cattle, sheep, donkeys, camels, clothes, money, and furniture. 
TOB.10.11	Raguel embraced Tobias and sent them on their way with his blessing, “Good-bye, my son. Have a safe journey. May the Lord of heaven protect you and Sarah. And may I live to see your children.” 
TOB.10.12	Raguel then said to Sarah, “Go with your husband and live in his parents' house. From now on they are as much your parents as your own mother and I are. Let me hear only good things about you as long as I live.” After saying good-bye he sent them on their way.
TOB.10.12	Then Edna said to Tobias, “Tobias my dear child, may the Lord bring you safely home. And may he let me live to see your children. The Lord is my witness; I am placing my daughter in your care. Never, at any time in your life, do anything that would break her heart. Have a safe journey, Tobias. From now on, Sarah is your wife and I am your mother. May we all prosper as long as we live.” Then Edna kissed them both and sent them safely on their way.
TOB.11.1	When Tobias left, he was as happy as could be. He praised the Lord of heaven and earth, the King of all the world, because his journey had been so successful, and he promised to honor Raguel and his wife as long as they lived.
TOB.11.1	As they came near the city of Kaserin, just outside Nineveh, 
TOB.11.2	Raphael said, “Tobias, you know the condition your father was in when we left him. 
TOB.11.3	We should go on ahead of your wife and get the house ready before everyone else arrives. 
TOB.11.4	Be sure to bring the fish's gall bladder with you.” So they went on ahead, and Tobias' dog ran along with
TOB.11.5	Meanwhile, Anna sat looking down the road for her son. 
TOB.11.6	Suddenly she saw him coming and she shouted out to Tobit, “Look! Our son is coming, and his friend is with him!”
TOB.11.7	Before they reached Tobit, Raphael said to Tobias, “Your father will be able to see again. 
TOB.11.8	Just put the fish's gall bladder on his eyes like a plaster. The medicine will make the white film shrivel up so that you can peel it off, and your father will then regain his eyesight.”
TOB.11.9	Anna ran to her son, threw her arms around him, and exclaimed, “Now that I have seen you alive, my child, I can die in peace!” And she wept for joy.
TOB.11.10	Tobit got up and stumbled out through the entrance of the courtyard. 
TOB.11.11	Tobias went up to him, holding the fish's gall bladder in his hand. He blew on his father's eyes and steadied him. “Don't worry now, father,” he said. 
TOB.11.12+TOB.11.13	 Tobias then applied the gall, and beginning from the corners of Tobit's eyes, he peeled away the white film. 
TOB.11.14	Tobit threw his arms around Tobias' neck and wept for joy. Then he exclaimed, “I can see you! My son, the light of my eyes!
TOB.11.14	“Praise God. Praise him for his greatness.
TOB.11.14	Praise all his holy angels.
TOB.11.14	May he continue to bless us.
TOB.11.14	Praise all his angels forever.
TOB.11.15	He brought this illness upon me,
TOB.11.15	but now I can see my son Tobias!”
TOB.11.15	Then Tobias went happily into the house, praising God at the top of his voice. He told his father how successful he had been, that he had not only brought back the money, but had married Raguel's daughter Sarah, who was on her way and would soon arrive.
TOB.11.16	Tobit was excited and praised God as he went out to meet his son's bride at the city gate. When the people of Nineveh saw him, they were amazed, because he was walking on his own, with no one leading him by the hand. 
TOB.11.17	Tobit praised God and told everyone how God in his mercy had restored his sight.
TOB.11.17	When Tobit met Sarah, he greeted her, “Welcome, daughter! Praise God for bringing you to us, my daughter. May God bless your father, as well as you and my son Tobias. Welcome to your new home. May you always be blessed with good health and happiness. Come in, daughter!”
TOB.11.17	It was a day of great joy for all the Jews of Nineveh. 
TOB.11.18	Tobit's nephews Ahikar and Nadab came by to share Tobit's happiness with him.
TOB.12.1	When the wedding feast was over, Tobit called his son Tobias and said to him, “Son, be sure to pay your traveling companion, and don't forget to give him a bonus.”
TOB.12.2	Tobias asked him, “Father, how much do you think I should pay him? I wouldn't mind giving him half of everything we brought back with us. 
TOB.12.3	He brought me back home safe and sound; he went to get the money for me from Gabael; he rid my wife of a demon; and he cured your blindness. How much of a bonus should I give him?”
TOB.12.4	Tobit answered, “Give him half of what he helped you bring back. He well deserves that.”
TOB.12.5	Tobias then called Raphael and said to him, “Here is half of what you helped me bring back. You have earned it; have a safe journey home.”
TOB.12.6	Then Raphael called the two men aside and said to them, “Praise God and tell everyone about the good things he has done for you, so that they too will honor him and sing his praises. Let everyone know what God has done. Never stop praising him.
TOB.12.7	“It's a good idea to keep a king's secret, but what God does should be told everywhere, so that he may be praised and honored.
TOB.12.7	“If you do good, no harm will come to you.
TOB.12.9	 Such generosity will save you from death and will wash away all your sins. Those who give to the poor will live full lives, 
TOB.12.10	but those who live a life of sin and wickedness are their own worst enemies.
TOB.12.11	“I have already told you that a king's secret ought to be kept, but the things God does should be told to everyone. Now I will reveal to you the full truth and keep nothing back. 
TOB.12.12	 Tobit, when you and Sarah prayed to the Lord, I was the one who brought your prayers into his glorious presence. I did the same thing each time you buried the dead. 
TOB.12.13	On the day you got up from the table without eating your meal in order to bury that corpse, God sent me to test you. 
TOB.12.14	But he also sent me to cure you and to rescue your daughter-in-law, Sarah, from her troubles. 
TOB.12.15	 I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand in the glorious presence of the Lord, ready to serve him.”
TOB.12.16	Tobit and Tobias were terrified and fell to the ground, trembling with fear. 
TOB.12.17	But Raphael said to them, “Don't be afraid; everything is all right. Always remember to praise God. 
TOB.12.18	He wanted me to come and help you; I did not come on my own. So sing God's praises as long as you live. 
TOB.12.19	When you thought you saw me eating, I did not really eat anything; it only seemed so. 
TOB.12.20	While you are on this earth, you must praise the Lord God and give him thanks. Now I must go back to him who sent me. Write down everything that has happened to you.”
TOB.12.21	Then Raphael disappeared into the sky. Tobit and Tobias stood up, but they could no longer see him. 
TOB.12.22	They began to sing hymns of praise, giving thanks for all the mighty deeds God had done while his angel Raphael had been with them.
TOB.13.1	Then Tobit prayed:
TOB.13.1	“Praise the eternal God,
TOB.13.1	praise the one who rules.
TOB.13.2	He punishes us; then he shows us mercy.
TOB.13.2	He sends us down to the world of the dead,
TOB.13.2	then he brings us up from the grave.
TOB.13.2	No one can escape his power.
TOB.13.3	“People of Israel, give thanks among the nations,
TOB.13.3	where he sent you into exile;
TOB.13.4	Let all who live hear your praise.
TOB.13.4	The Lord is our God and father forever.
TOB.13.5	“Though he punished you for your wickedness,
TOB.13.5	he will be merciful and bring you home
TOB.13.5	from among the nations where he scattered you.
TOB.13.6	“Turn to him with all your heart and soul,
TOB.13.6	live in loyal obedience to him.
TOB.13.6	Then he will turn to you to help you
TOB.13.6	and will no longer hide himself.
TOB.13.6	Remember what God has done for you,
TOB.13.6	and give thanks with all your heart.
TOB.13.6	Praise the righteous Lord;
TOB.13.6	honor the eternal King.
TOB.13.6	“Although I live in exile in a foreign land,
TOB.13.6	I will give thanks to the Lord
TOB.13.6	and will speak of his great strength to a nation of sinners.
TOB.13.6	‘Turn away from your sins, and do what pleases God!
TOB.13.6	Perhaps he will be gracious
TOB.13.6	and show you his mercy.’
TOB.13.7	“I praise my God and rejoice in his greatness;
TOB.13.7	my whole being honors the King of heaven.
TOB.13.8	“Let everyone tell of his greatness
TOB.13.8	and sing his praises in Jerusalem.
TOB.13.9	he will punish you for the sins of your people,
TOB.13.9	but he will be merciful to all who do right.
TOB.13.10	So give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
TOB.13.10	Praise the eternal King.
TOB.13.10	Your Temple will be rebuilt,
TOB.13.10	and your people will be happy again.
TOB.13.10	“May the Lord make all your exiles glad,
TOB.13.10	may he take care of your suffering people
TOB.13.10	for as long as time shall last.
TOB.13.11	“Jerusalem, your light will shine brightly for all the world,
TOB.13.11	and from far away many nations will come to you.
TOB.13.11	Their people will come to honor the Lord your God,
TOB.13.11	they will bring gifts for the King of heaven.
TOB.13.11	In your streets many generations will sing joyful praise,
TOB.13.11	your name will endure forever as God's chosen city.
TOB.13.12	A curse will be on all who make threats against you,
TOB.13.12	on all who destroy you and tear down your walls,
TOB.13.12	on all who demolish your towers and burn your homes.
TOB.13.12	But all who honor you will be blessed forever.
TOB.13.13	“Rejoice, Jerusalem, because of your righteous people;
TOB.13.13	they will be gathered together from exile
TOB.13.13	to praise the Lord of the ages.
TOB.13.14	“Happy are all who love you
TOB.13.14	and are pleased to see you prosper.
TOB.13.14	Those who mourn over your suffering now
TOB.13.14	will one day be happy;
TOB.13.14	your happiness will bring them joy forever.
TOB.13.15	“I praise the Lord, the great King;
TOB.13.16	Jerusalem will be rebuilt
TOB.13.16	and will be his home forever.
TOB.13.16	“Jerusalem, how happy I will be
TOB.13.16	when my descendants can see your splendor
TOB.13.16	and give thanks to the King of heaven.
TOB.13.16	“Your gates will be built with sapphires and emeralds,
TOB.13.16	and all your walls with precious stones.
TOB.13.16	Your towers will be made of gold,
TOB.13.16	and their fortifications of pure gold.
TOB.13.17	Your streets will be paved with rubies and precious jewels.
TOB.13.18	Joyful songs will ring out from your gates,
TOB.13.18	and from all your houses people will shout,
TOB.13.18	‘Praise the Lord! Praise the God of Israel!’
TOB.13.18	“Jerusalem, God will bless your people,
TOB.13.18	and they will praise his holy name forever.”
TOB.13.18	With these words Tobit ended his song of praise.
TOB.14.1+TOB.14.2	Tobit was 62 years old when he became blind, but after his sight had been restored, he lived a very full life. Once again he gave generously to the poor, and he continued to praise God and tell of his greatness. Tobit died a peaceful death at the age of 112, and was given an honorable burial in Nineveh.
TOB.14.3	But just before Tobit died, he sent for his son Tobias and told him, 
TOB.14.4	 “My son, take your children and go at once to Media. I believe that God's judgment which his prophet Nahum announced against Nineveh is about to take place. Everything that God's prophets told Israel about Nineveh and Assyria will happen. It will all come true, every word of it, when the right time comes. I am absolutely convinced that everything God has said is sure to come true. God does not break his promises. It will be safer for you in Media than in Assyria or Babylon.
TOB.14.4	“Those Jews who live in Israel will all be scattered and taken from that good land into exile. All Israel will become a wasteland; Samaria and Jerusalem will be abandoned cities. God's Temple will be burned to the ground and will lie in complete ruin for a while. 
TOB.14.5	But God will have mercy on his people again, and he will bring them back to the land of Israel. They will rebuild the Temple, but it will not be as splendid as the first Temple, not until the proper time has come. But when that time does come, all the people of Israel will return from exile, and they will rebuild the city of Jerusalem in all its former splendor. They will rebuild God's Temple in Jerusalem, just as Israel's prophets have foretold.
TOB.14.6	“Then all the nations in the world will come back to God. They will worship him as the only true God and give up the idols that led them into false worship. 
TOB.14.7	The nations of the world will praise the everlasting God by doing what he demands.
TOB.14.7	“At that time God will save all the people of Israel who have been faithful to him. He will bring them together to Jerusalem, and let them take possession of the land of Abraham, and there they will live securely forever. All who love God with their heart and soul will rejoice, but all sinners and evil people will be wiped off the face of the earth.
TOB.14.8	“Now, my children, follow my instructions. Worship God sincerely and do what is pleasing to him. 
TOB.14.9	Bring up your children to do what is right. Teach them that they must give to the poor and must always remember to praise God with all sincerity.
TOB.14.10	“Tobias, my son, leave Nineveh now. Do not stay here. As soon as you bury your mother beside me, leave; do not stay another night within the city limits. It is a wicked city and full of immorality; the people here have no sense of shame. Remember what Nadab did to Ahikar his own uncle who had brought him up. He tried to kill Ahikar and forced him to go into hiding in a tomb. Ahikar came back into the light of day, but God sent Nadab down into everlasting darkness for what he had done. Ahikar escaped the deadly trap which Nadab had set for him, because Ahikar
TOB.14.11	So now, my children, you see what happens to those who show their concern for others, and how death awaits those who treat others unjustly. But now I am very weak.”
TOB.14.11	Then they laid Tobit on his bed. He died and was given an honorable burial. 
TOB.14.12	Later on, Tobit's wife died and was buried beside her husband. Then Tobias and his wife moved to Ecbatana in Media, where they lived with Raguel, Tobias' father-in-law. 
TOB.14.13	Tobias took care of Edna and Raguel in their old age and showed them great respect. When at last they died, he buried them at Ecbatana. Tobias inherited Raguel's estate, as he had inherited the estate of his father Tobit.
TOB.14.14	At the ripe old age of 117 Tobias died, 
TOB.14.15	having lived long enough to hear about the destruction of Nineveh and to see King Cyaxares
JDT.1.1	While King Nebuchadnezzar was ruling over the Assyrians from his capital city of Nineveh, King Arphaxad ruled over the Medes from his capital city of Ecbatana. 
JDT.1.2	Around Ecbatana King Arphaxad built a wall 105 feet high and 75 feet thick of cut stones; each stone was 4½ feet thick and 9 feet long. 
JDT.1.3	At each gate he built a tower 150 feet high, with a foundation 90 feet thick. 
JDT.1.4	Each gateway was 105 feet high and 60 feet wide—wide enough for his whole army to march through, with the infantry in formation.
JDT.1.5	In the twelfth year of his reign King Nebuchadnezzar went to war against King Arphaxad in the large plain around the city of Rages. 
JDT.1.6	Many nations joined forces with King Arphaxad—all the people who lived in the mountains, those who lived along the Tigris, Euphrates, and Hydaspes rivers, as well as those who lived in the plain ruled by King Arioch of Elam. Many nations joined this Chelodite alliance.
JDT.1.7	Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Assyria sent a message to the Persians and to the people to the west, in the regions of Cilicia, Damascus, Lebanon, Antilebanon, to those along the coast, 
JDT.1.8	and in the regions of Carmel, Gilead, northern Galilee, and Jezreel Valley. 
JDT.1.9+JDT.1.10	The message also went to the people living in Samaria and the nearby towns, to those in the area west of the Jordan River as far as the cities of Jerusalem, Bethany, Chelous, and Kadesh, and to the district of Goshen. The message was also taken to the Egyptian cities of Tahpanhes, Rameses, Tanis, and Memphis, and the district up the Nile River to the Ethiopian
JDT.1.11	But everyone in this whole region ignored King Nebuchadnezzar's appeal and refused to take part in the war. They thought that he had no chance of winning the war, so they were not afraid of him and sent his messengers back disgraced and empty-handed.
JDT.1.12	This made Nebuchadnezzar so furious that he vowed he would risk his entire kingdom to take revenge on all those people. He vowed that he would put to death the entire population of Cilicia, Damascus, Syria, Moab, Ammon, Judah, and Egypt—everyone from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf.
JDT.1.13	In the seventeenth year of his reign King Nebuchadnezzar led his army into battle against King Arphaxad. He defeated all of Arphaxad's forces, including his entire cavalry, and all his charioteers. 
JDT.1.14	Then Nebuchadnezzar occupied all the towns in the land of Media and advanced against the city of Ecbatana. He captured the city's towers, looted its markets, and made that beautiful city a ruin. 
JDT.1.15	He captured King Arphaxad in the mountains around Rages and killed him. After Arphaxad's death, 
JDT.1.16	Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army returned to Nineveh with all the loot taken in battle. There they relaxed and feasted for four months.
JDT.2.1	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, on the twenty-second day of the first month of that year, he and his advisers decided to carry out his threat to take revenge on all those countries that had refused to help him. 
JDT.2.2+JDT.2.3	The king called his general staff and senior officers together and reported in detail how those countries had betrayed him. He and his officers agreed that everyone who had refused to help him in the war should be put to death. Then he described to them his plan of attack.
JDT.2.4	At the close of the meeting, Nebuchadnezzar gave the following command to Holofernes, who was the general in command of his armies and second in command to the king: 
JDT.2.5	“I, Nebuchadnezzar, the great king and ruler of all the earth, command you to choose some experienced soldiers: 120,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry. 
JDT.2.6	Then attack the lands to the west because they refused to respond to my appeal for help. 
JDT.2.7	Warn them that they must prepare their offerings of earth and water to show that they have surrendered unconditionally. I will make them feel the full force of my anger and completely destroy them. My armies will march over every foot of their land and plunder it as they go. 
JDT.2.8	I will fill the valleys with their dead bodies and will choke up every stream and river with so many corpses that they will all overflow. 
JDT.2.9	I will take captive all those who are left alive and carry them off to the ends of the earth.
JDT.2.10	“But you, Holofernes, are ordered to go ahead of me and occupy all their territories in advance. If they surrender to you, hold them for me until I come to punish them. 
JDT.2.11	But if they resist, do not spare them. Kill them and loot the entire region under your control. 
JDT.2.12	I have taken a solemn vow, and at the risk of my life and my royal power I am determined to do what I have vowed to do. 
JDT.2.13	Do not disobey me in any way. I am your king; remember that, and carry out without delay every order that I have given you.”
JDT.2.14	So Holofernes left the king and called together all the commanders, generals, and officers of the Assyrian army. 
JDT.2.15	Just as the king had ordered, he chose 120,000 of the best infantrymen and 12,000 of the best mounted archers 
JDT.2.16	and arranged them in battle formation. 
JDT.2.17	He also took along a very large number of camels, donkeys, and mules to carry the equipment, as well as many sheep, cattle, and goats for food. 
JDT.2.18	Every soldier received plenty of rations and a large payment of gold and silver from the royal treasury.
JDT.2.19	Then Holofernes and his entire army set out, advancing ahead of King Nebuchadnezzar. The chariots, the cavalry, and the infantry marched out to overrun the entire western region. 
JDT.2.20	 Other troops went with them. There were so many that it was impossible to count them—they were like a swarm of locusts or like grains of sand in the desert.
JDT.2.21	Three days after they had left the city of Nineveh, they reached the plains around Bectileth near the mountains north of Cilicia, where they set up camp. 
JDT.2.22	From there Holofernes advanced into the hill country with his entire army, his infantry, cavalry, and chariots. 
JDT.2.23	He totally destroyed the countries of Libya and Lydia, then plundered all the people of Rassis and the Ishmaelites who lived on the edge of the desert, south of the land of the Chelleans.
JDT.2.24	Then Holofernes crossed the Euphrates River and marched through the land of Mesopotamia, completely destroying all the walled towns along the Abron River as far as the sea. 
JDT.2.25	He seized the territory of Cilicia, killing everyone who resisted him, and went as far as the southern borders of the land of Japheth, near Arabia. 
JDT.2.26	He surrounded the Midianites, burned down their tents, and slaughtered their sheep.
JDT.2.27	Holofernes went down into the plains around Damascus during the wheat harvest, burned all the fields, slaughtered the flocks and herds, looted the towns, devastated the entire countryside, and killed all the young men. 
JDT.2.28	Panic seized all the people who lived along the Mediterranean Sea, and they shook with fear. Everyone in the towns of Tyre, Sidon, Sur, Ocina, Jamnia, Ashdod, and Ashkelon was terrified.
JDT.3.1	All these nations sent a peace delegation to King Nebuchadnezzar with this message: 
JDT.3.2	“We remain loyal to you, great King Nebuchadnezzar; we are ready to serve you and obey any command that you may wish to give us. 
JDT.3.3	Our buildings, all our land, our wheat fields, our livestock, and our tents are at your disposal; use them in any way you wish. 
JDT.3.4	Our people will be your slaves, and you may use our towns as you please.”
JDT.3.5	After the peace delegation had brought this message, 
JDT.3.6	Holofernes led Nebuchadnezzar's army down to the Mediterranean coast. He stationed guards in all the walled towns and selected certain local men in each of the towns as reserve troops. 
JDT.3.7	The people in the towns and in the surrounding countryside welcomed Holofernes by wearing wreaths of flowers and dancing to the beat of drums. 
JDT.3.8	 But Holofernes destroyed all their places of worship
JDT.3.9	Then Holofernes passed through Jezreel Valley near Dothan, which faces the main ridge of the mountains of Judah, 
JDT.3.10	and set up camp between Geba and Scythopolis. He stayed there for a month in order to get supplies for his army.
JDT.4.1	The people of Judah heard what Holofernes, the commander of King Nebuchadnezzar's armies, had done to the other nations. They heard how he had looted and destroyed all their temples, 
JDT.4.2	and they were terrified of him and afraid of what he might do to Jerusalem and to the Temple of the Lord their God. 
JDT.4.3	They had only recently returned home to Judah from exile and had just rededicated the Temple and its utensils and its altar after they had been defiled. 
JDT.4.4	So they sent a warning to the whole region of Samaria and to the towns of Kona, Beth Horon, Belmain, Jericho, Choba, and Aesora, and to Salem Valley. 
JDT.4.5	They immediately occupied the mountaintops, fortified the villages on the mountains, and stored up food in preparation for war. It was fortunate that they had recently harvested their fields.
JDT.4.6	The High Priest Joakim, who was in Jerusalem at that time, wrote to the people in the towns of Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which face Jezreel Valley near Dothan. 
JDT.4.7	He ordered them to occupy the mountain passes which led into the land of Judah, where it would be easy to withstand an attack, since the approach was only wide enough for two people at a time to pass. 
JDT.4.8	The Israelites carried out the orders given to them by the High Priest Joakim and the Council which met in Jerusalem.
JDT.4.9	The leaders of Israel prayed earnestly to God and fasted. 
JDT.4.10	 They put on sackcloth—they and their wives, their children, their livestock, and every resident foreigner, every slave and hired laborer. 
JDT.4.11+JDT.4.12	They also covered the altar with sackcloth. Then all the men, women, and children in Jerusalem lay face down on the ground in front of the Temple; they lay there in the Lord's presence, all in sackcloth, their heads covered with ashes. They joined together in earnest prayer to the God of Israel, begging him not to let their children be captured, their wives carried off, or their home towns destroyed. They pleaded with him not to give the Gentiles the satisfaction of destroying the Temple and dishonoring it. 
JDT.4.13	 The Lord heard their prayers and saw their distress. For many days the people of Judah and Jerusalem continued their fast in front of the Temple of the Lord Almighty. 
JDT.4.14	 The High Priest Joakim, the priests, and all the others who served in the Lord's Temple, wore sackcloth when they offered the daily burnt offering, the freewill offerings of the people, and the offerings made to fulfill a vow. 
JDT.4.15	They put ashes on their turbans and cried out in prayer to the Lord, begging him to have mercy on the whole nation.
JDT.5.1	When Holofernes, the Assyrian general, heard that the Israelites had prepared for war, blocked the mountain passes, fortified the mountaintops, and set up roadblocks in the plains, 
JDT.5.2	he boiled over with anger. He called together all the Moabite rulers, all the Ammonite generals, and all the governors of the region along the Mediterranean coast 
JDT.5.3	and said to them, “You live in Canaan, so tell me about the people who live in these mountains. Which cities do they occupy? How large is their army? What is the source of their power and strength? Who is the king who leads their army? 
JDT.5.4	Why have they alone, of all the people in the west, refused to come out and surrender to me?”
JDT.5.5	Then Achior, the leader of all the Ammonites, answered Holofernes, “Sir, if you will please be so kind as to listen to me, I will tell you the truth about these people who live in the mountains near your camp. I will not lie to you. 
JDT.5.6	These people are the descendants of some Babylonians 
JDT.5.7+JDT.5.8	who abandoned the ways of their ancestors in order to worship the God of heaven. Finally, they were driven out of their land because they refused to worship their ancestors' gods. Then they fled to Mesopotamia, where they settled and lived for a long time.
JDT.5.10	 Later, when a famine struck all the land of Canaan, these Israelites, as they were later called, went down to Egypt and stayed there as long as there was enough food. While they were there, they became a large nation with so many people that they could not be counted. 
JDT.5.11	 So the king of Egypt turned against them. He took advantage of them and put them to work making bricks. He oppressed them and made them slaves. 
JDT.5.12	 But they prayed to their god, and he sent disasters that left the Egyptians helpless. When the Egyptians drove them out of the country, 
JDT.5.13	 their god dried up the Red Sea in front of them, 
JDT.5.14	and then led them along the way to Sinai and Kadesh Barnea.
JDT.5.14	“The Israelites drove out all the people who lived in the southern part of Canaan, 
JDT.5.15	occupied the land of the Amorites, wiped out the people of Heshbon, crossed the Jordan River, and took possession of the entire mountain region. 
JDT.5.16	They drove out the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Shechemites, and all the Girgashites. The Israelites have now lived in these mountains for a long time.
JDT.5.18	But when they disobeyed him, they suffered heavy losses in many wars and were finally taken away as captives to a foreign country. The temple of their god was leveled and their cities were occupied by their enemies. 
JDT.5.19	But now that they have returned to their god, they have come back home from the countries where they had been scattered. They have again taken possession of the city of Jerusalem, where their temple is, and have resettled in the mountains that had remained uninhabited.
JDT.5.20	“Sir, if these people are now sinning against their god, even unknowingly, and if we can be sure that they are guilty of some offense, we can successfully attack them. 
JDT.5.21	But if they have not disobeyed the law of their god, then you should leave them alone, or he will defend them, and we will be disgraced before the whole world.”
JDT.5.22	When Achior had finished his speech, all the people standing around the tent began to protest. Holofernes' own senior officers, as well as the Moabites and those from the Mediterranean coast, demanded that Achior be put to death.
JDT.5.23	“Why should we be afraid of these Israelites?” they asked. “They are weak; they can't put up a strong defense. 
JDT.5.24	Let's go ahead! General Holofernes, your great army will slaughter them easily.”
JDT.6.1	When the noise of the crowd around the council had subsided, Holofernes spoke to Achior in front of the entire group, those from the Mediterranean coast, the Moabites, and the Ammonite mercenaries.
JDT.6.2	“Achior,
JDT.6.3	But we serve Nebuchadnezzar, and we will beat them as easily as if their whole army were one man. They will not be able to hold their ground against our cavalry; 
JDT.6.4	it will overwhelm them. The mountains will be soaked with their blood, and the valleys will be filled with their corpses. After our attack, they will be completely wiped out; not a trace of them will be left. This is the command of Nebuchadnezzar, the lord of the whole earth, and he doesn't speak idle words. 
JDT.6.5	Achior, you are nothing but an Ammonite mercenary, and you talk like a traitor. You will not see me again until I come and punish this race of runaway slaves. 
JDT.6.6	And when I do, my soldiers will put you to death. You will be just another name on the casualty list.
JDT.6.7	“Now my men will take you into the mountains and leave you in one of the Israelite towns, 
JDT.6.8	and you will die with the people there. 
JDT.6.9	Why look so worried, Achior? Don't you think the town can stand against me? I will carry out all my threats; you can be sure of that!”
JDT.6.10	Then Holofernes ordered his men, who were waiting in his tent, to seize Achior, take him to Bethulia, and hand him over to the Israelites. 
JDT.6.11	So the men seized Achior and took him out of the camp into the valley. From there they led him into the mountains, as far as the spring which was below Bethulia.
JDT.6.12	When the men of that town saw them approaching, they picked up their weapons and ran to the top of the hill. Every man who used a sling as a weapon rained stones down on Holofernes' soldiers, and this stopped them from coming any farther up the mountain. 
JDT.6.13	The Assyrians were forced to take cover along the mountainside, where they tied Achior up and left him lying at the foot of the mountain. Then they returned to Holofernes.
JDT.6.14	Later, when the Israelites came down from Bethulia, they untied Achior, brought him into the town, and took him before the town officials, 
JDT.6.15	who at that time were Uzziah son of Micah, of the tribe of Simeon, Chabris son of Gothoniel, and Charmis son of Melchiel. 
JDT.6.16	The officials called together the town elders, and all the women and the young men also ran to the assembly. Achior was brought before the people, and Uzziah began questioning him. 
JDT.6.17	Achior told them what had been said at Holofernes' war council, what he himself had said to the Assyrian officers, and how Holofernes had boasted about what he would do to the Israelites. 
JDT.6.18	When the people heard this, they fell on their knees and worshiped God. They prayed: 
JDT.6.19	“O Lord God of heaven, look how our boastful enemies have humiliated your people! Have pity on us and help us.” 
JDT.6.20	Then they reassured Achior and praised him for what he had done. 
JDT.6.21	After the assembly was over, Uzziah took Achior home with him, and gave a banquet there for the elders. All that night they prayed to the God of Israel for help.
JDT.7.1+JDT.7.2	The next day Holofernes gathered his whole army together, as well as his allied forces. It was an immense army, consisting of 170,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, not counting the support troops who took care of the equipment. He ordered them to march on Bethulia, seize the mountain passes, and attack the Israelites. So they moved out 
JDT.7.3	and set up camp beside the spring in the valley near Bethulia. The camp was so wide that it spread out toward the town of Dothan as far as Balbaim, and so long that it stretched from Bethulia to Cyamon, which faces Jezreel Valley.
JDT.7.4	When the Israelites saw the size of the army, they were terrified and said to one another, “Those soldiers are going to eat up everything in sight. There's not enough food in the mountains, valleys, and hills put together to feed an army like that.” 
JDT.7.5	 But in spite of their fear, all the Israelites took up their weapons, lighted signal fires on the towers, and remained on guard duty all night. 
JDT.7.6	The next day Holofernes led out his entire cavalry so that the Israelites in Bethulia could see them. 
JDT.7.7	He inspected the approaches to the town and the springs that supplied its water. He seized the springs and stationed guards there, before returning to camp.
JDT.7.8	All the leaders of the Edomite and Moabite forces, along with the commanders of the troops from the Mediterranean coast, came to Holofernes and said, 
JDT.7.9	“Sir, if you listen to our advice, your troops will not suffer heavy losses. 
JDT.7.10	These Israelites do not rely on their weapons for defense but rather on the height of the mountains where they live, since the mountains are not easy to climb. 
JDT.7.11	So then, General Holofernes, if you do not make a direct attack on them, your whole army will suffer no casualties. 
JDT.7.12	Stay in your camp and keep your soldiers in their quarters. Just command your men to blockade the springs at the foot of the mountains, 
JDT.7.13	because that's where the people of Bethulia come to draw their water. Then, when they are dying of thirst, they will surrender their town to you. Meanwhile, we and our men will go up to the tops of the surrounding mountains, where we will set up camp and keep anyone from leaving the town. 
JDT.7.14	Everyone will starve to death—men, women, and children. Even before we attack, the streets will be littered with their corpses. 
JDT.7.15	In this way you can make them pay for their rebellion and for refusing to surrender peacefully to you.”
JDT.7.16	Holofernes and his entire staff were pleased with this suggestion, so he gave orders to put the plan into action. 
JDT.7.17	The Moabites and 5,000 Assyrians moved their camp into the valley to control the source of the town's water. 
JDT.7.18	The Edomites and the Ammonites went up into the mountains and set up their camp opposite the town of Dothan. They sent some of their men to the southeast in the direction of Acraba, near Chusi, which is beside the Mochmur River. The rest of the Assyrian army set up camp in the valley. Their camp was spread out over the whole countryside, because the number of tents and the amount of equipment needed for such a large army were immense.
JDT.7.19	Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord their God for help. They had lost their courage, for with the enemy all around them there was no way to escape. 
JDT.7.20	The entire Assyrian army—infantry, chariots, and cavalry—blockaded Bethulia for thirty-four days until the town ran out of water. 
JDT.7.21	All the reservoirs and cisterns went dry, so that the drinking water had to be rationed, and not a day passed when there was enough water to go around. 
JDT.7.22	Children were becoming weak; everywhere throughout the town women and young people were collapsing. No one had any strength left.
JDT.7.23	All the people of the town—men, women, and children alike—gathered around Uzziah and the town officials and shouted in protest, 
JDT.7.24	“God will punish you for what you have done to us! You are to blame for what is happening, because you did not make peace with the Assyrians. 
JDT.7.25	There is no one to help us now! God has put us in their power. We are exhausted and dying of thirst. 
JDT.7.26	Call the Assyrians now and surrender to them, and let Holofernes and his army take the town and loot it. 
JDT.7.27	We are better off as prisoners of war. They will make us slaves, but at least we will be alive, and we won't have to watch our wives and children dying before our eyes. 
JDT.7.28	Heaven and earth are witnesses against you, and so is our God, the Lord of our ancestors, who is punishing us for their sins as well as ours. We can only hope and pray that he will not let these terrible things happen to us today.”
JDT.7.29	Everyone there began to weep loudly and to pray to the Lord their God. 
JDT.7.30	Then Uzziah said to them, “Don't give up, my friends! Let's wait five more days to see if the Lord our God will be merciful to us. Surely he will not abandon us completely. 
JDT.7.31	But if no help comes after five days, then I will do as you say.” 
JDT.7.32	So Uzziah dismissed the people. All the men returned to their guard posts on the walls and towers, while the women and children went back to their homes. The morale of the entire town was very low.
JDT.8.1	At that time, Judith heard about Uzziah's decision. She was the daughter of Merari, the granddaughter of Ox and the great-granddaughter of Joseph. Joseph's ancestors were Oziel, Elkiah, Ananias, Gideon, Raphaim, Ahitub, Elijah, Hilkiah, Eliab, Nathanael, Salamiel, Sarasadai, and Israel. 
JDT.8.2	Judith's husband Manasseh, who belonged to the same tribe and clan, had died during the barley harvest. 
JDT.8.3	He had suffered a sunstroke while in the fields supervising the farm workers and later died in bed at home in Bethulia. He was buried in the family tomb in the field between Dothan and Balamon.
JDT.8.4	For three years and four months, Judith had lived as a widow. 
JDT.8.5	 In her grief she built a little shelter on the roof of her house and lived there, wearing sackcloth. 
JDT.8.6	She fasted during that entire period except when fasting was forbidden: the day before the Sabbath and the Sabbath itself, the eve of the New Moon Festival and the Festival itself, and all the festivals and holidays observed by the people of Israel. 
JDT.8.7	Judith was a very beautiful woman. Her husband had left her gold and silver, servants and slaves, livestock and fields. She continued to supervise the estate, 
JDT.8.8	and no one ever said anything bad about Judith. She was a very religious woman.
JDT.8.9	Judith heard how the people were complaining bitterly against Uzziah, now that the water shortage had broken their morale. She learned that in answer to their complaints he had promised to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days. 
JDT.8.10	Judith sent a slave, the woman who managed her business affairs, to invite Uzziah,
JDT.8.11	When the officials arrived, Judith said to them, “Please listen to me. You are the leaders of the people of Bethulia, but you were wrong to speak to the people as you did today. You should not have made a solemn promise before God that you would surrender the town to our enemies if the Lord did not come to our aid within a few days. 
JDT.8.12	 What right do you have to put God to the test as you have done today? Who are you to put yourselves in God's place in dealing with human affairs? 
JDT.8.13	It is the Lord Almighty that you are putting to the test! Will you never learn? 
JDT.8.14	 There is no way that you can understand what is in the depths of a human heart or find out what a person is thinking. Yet you dare to read God's mind and interpret his thoughts! How can you claim to understand God, the Creator? No, my friends, you must stop arousing the anger of the Lord our God! 
JDT.8.15	If he decides not to come to our aid within five days, he still may rescue us at any time he chooses. Or he may let our enemies destroy us. 
JDT.8.16	But you must not lay down conditions for the Lord our God! Do you think that he is like one of us? Do you think you can bargain with him or force him to make a decision? 
JDT.8.17	No! Instead, we should ask God for his help and wait patiently for him to rescue us. If he wants to, he will answer our cry for help. 
JDT.8.18	We do not worship gods made with human hands. Not one of our clans, tribes, towns, or cities has ever done that, even though our ancestors used to do so. 
JDT.8.19	That is why God let their enemies kill them and take everything they had. It was a great defeat! 
JDT.8.20	But since we worship no other God but the Lord, we can hope that he will not reject us or any of our people.
JDT.8.21	“If our town is taken by the enemy, the entire region of Judah will then fall, and our Temple in Jerusalem will be looted. And God will make us pay with our lives for allowing the Temple to be defiled. 
JDT.8.22	He will hold us responsible for the slaughter and captivity of our people and for the destruction of the land we have inherited. We will be despised and mocked by the people in those nations to which we will be taken as slaves. 
JDT.8.23	We are not going to win the favor of our enemies by surrendering to them now.
JDT.8.24	“No, my friends, we should set an example for our own people. Not only their lives, but the fate of the Temple and the altar depend on us. 
JDT.8.25	The Lord our God is putting us to the test, just as he tested our ancestors, and we should be thankful for that. 
JDT.8.26	 Remember how he put Abraham and Isaac to the test, and what happened to Jacob while he was working as a shepherd for his uncle Laban in Mesopotamia. 
JDT.8.27	God is not testing our loyalty as severely as he did theirs. God is not sending this punishment on us as revenge, but as a warning to us who worship him.”
JDT.8.28	Then Uzziah answered Judith, “Everything you have said makes good sense, and no one can argue with it. 
JDT.8.29	This is not the first time you have shown wisdom. Ever since you were a child, all of us have recognized the soundness and maturity of your judgment. 
JDT.8.30	But our people are dying of thirst. They forced us to say what we did and to make a solemn promise, which we cannot break. 
JDT.8.31	So now, since you are a deeply religious woman, pray for our people; ask the Lord to send rain to fill our cisterns, so that we can get our strength back.”
JDT.8.32	“All right,” Judith replied, “I am going to do something which our Jewish people will never forget. 
JDT.8.33	Tonight, the three of you must stand guard at the gate so that my slave woman and I can leave the town. And before the day comes on which you have promised to surrender, the Lord will use me to rescue the people of Israel. 
JDT.8.34	But you must not ask me what I am going to do; I will explain it to you when it is all over.”
JDT.8.35	Uzziah and the other officials said to her, “You have our blessing. May the Lord our God guide you as you take revenge on our enemies.” 
JDT.8.36	Then they left Judith's rooftop shelter and returned to their posts.
JDT.9.1	Then Judith put ashes on her head, opened her robe to reveal the sackcloth she was wearing under her clothes, and bowed down with her face to the floor. It was the time that the evening incense was being offered in the Temple in Jerusalem, and Judith prayed in a loud voice: 
JDT.9.2	 “O Lord, the God of my ancestor Simeon, remember how you armed Simeon with a sword to take revenge on those foreigners who seized Dinah, who was a virgin, tore off her clothes,
JDT.9.3	That is why you let their leaders be killed—put to death on the same bed where they had raped the woman.
JDT.9.4	You let their wives be carried off, their daughters taken captive, and their possessions plundered by the Israelites, your chosen people, who were eager to do your will. Dinah's brothers were furious because of this disgrace to their family, so they called on you for help.
JDT.9.4	“O my God, listen to my prayer, the prayer of a widow. 
JDT.9.5	Your hand guided all that happened then, and all that happened before and after. You have planned it all—what is happening now, and what is yet to be. Your plans have always been carried out. 
JDT.9.6	Whatever you want to be done is as good as done. You know in advance all that you will do and what decisions you will make. 
JDT.9.7	Now the Assyrians are stronger than ever; they take pride in their cavalry and their infantry. They rely on their weapons, but they do not know that you, O Lord, are a warrior who ends war. The Lord is your name. 
JDT.9.8	In your anger, use your power to shatter their mighty army. They plan to defile your Temple, where you are worshiped, and to hack off the corners of your altar with their swords. 
JDT.9.9	Look how proud and boastful they are! Pour out your fury upon them! I am only a widow, but give me the strength to carry out my plan. 
JDT.9.10	Use my deceitful words to strike them all dead, master and slave alike. Let a woman's strength break their pride. 
JDT.9.11	Your power does not depend on the size and strength of an army. You are a God who cares for the humble and helps the oppressed. You give support and protection to people who are weak and helpless; you save those who have lost hope. 
JDT.9.12	Now hear my prayer, O God of my ancestor Simeon, the God in whom Israel trusts, ruler of heaven and earth, creator of the rivers and the seas, king of all creation. Hear my prayer and 
JDT.9.13	 let my deceitful words wound and kill those who have planned such cruelty against your covenant and your holy Temple, against Mount Zion and the land you have given your people. 
JDT.9.14	Make your whole nation and every tribe recognize that you are God, almighty and all-powerful, and that you alone protect the people of Israel!”
JDT.10.1	When Judith had finished her prayer to the God of Israel, 
JDT.10.2	she stood up, called her slave woman, and went down into the house as she always did on Sabbaths and festival days. 
JDT.10.3	She took off the sackcloth and her widow's clothes, took a bath, and put on rich perfumes. She brushed her hair, tied a ribbon around it, and dressed herself in the fine clothes she used to wear on joyful occasions when her husband Manasseh was still alive. 
JDT.10.4	She put on sandals and all her finest jewelry: rings and earrings, and bracelets on her wrists and ankles. She made herself so beautiful that she was sure to attract the attention of any man who saw her. 
JDT.10.5	Judith gave her slave woman a leather bag of wine and a jar of oil to carry. She filled a bag with roasted barley, cakes of dried figs, and several loaves of bread baked according to Jewish food laws. She carefully wrapped all the food and dishes and gave them to her slave. 
JDT.10.6	Then the two women left the house and went to the gates of Bethulia, where they found Uzziah and the town officials, Chabris and Charmis, standing guard. 
JDT.10.7	When the men saw Judith after she had changed clothes and put on make-up, they were struck by her beauty and said to her, 
JDT.10.8	“May the God of our ancestors bless you and make your plan successful, so that you may bring glory to Jerusalem and victory to Israel.”
JDT.10.8	Judith prayed 
JDT.10.9	and then said, “Order the gates to be opened for me. I am on my way to do what we were talking about.” Then they ordered the young men to open the gates for her, 
JDT.10.10	and Judith and her slave left the city. The men watched her as she went down the mountain into the valley, until she was out of sight.
JDT.10.11	As the two women were walking through the valley, an Assyrian patrol met them. 
JDT.10.12	They arrested Judith and questioned her, “What is your nationality? Where did you come from, and where are you going?”
JDT.10.12	“I am a Hebrew,” she answered, “but I am running away from the Israelites because God is going to let you destroy them. 
JDT.10.13	I am on my way to see Holofernes, the general in command of your army, to give him some reliable information. I can show him how to advance into the mountains and take control of the entire region without a single casualty.”
JDT.10.14	The men stared at her because she was so beautiful. They listened to her story and said, 
JDT.10.15	“You have saved your life by coming down here to see our general. Some of us will take you to his headquarters and present you to him. 
JDT.10.16	Do not be afraid of him. Just tell him what you have told us, and he will treat you well.” 
JDT.10.17	They assigned a hundred men to escort Judith and her slave to the headquarters of Holofernes.
JDT.10.18	There was great commotion in the Assyrian camp as news of Judith's arrival spread from tent to tent. While she stood outside the tent of Holofernes waiting to be presented to him, many Assyrian soldiers came and stood around her. 
JDT.10.19	They were greatly impressed by her beauty and wondered what kind of people the Israelites were. “Who can have contempt for people whose women are so beautiful?” they asked one another. “We had better kill all the men, or else these Jews will be able to charm the whole world.”
JDT.10.20	Then Holofernes' bodyguard and his personal servants came out and led Judith into the tent. 
JDT.10.21	Holofernes was resting on his bed under a mosquito net woven of purple and gold thread and decorated with emeralds and other precious stones. 
JDT.10.22	When the men told him that Judith had arrived, he came to the outer part of the tent. Silver lamps were carried ahead of him. 
JDT.10.23	When Judith came near him and his servants, they were all astonished at her beauty. She bowed down to the ground before Holofernes, but his servants helped her to her feet.
JDT.11.1	Holofernes said to Judith, “Don't worry; there's no need for you to be afraid. I have never hurt anyone who was willing to serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of the whole world. 
JDT.11.2	Even now, if your people up in the mountains had not insulted me, I would not have declared war on them. They have brought all this trouble on themselves. 
JDT.11.3	But tell me, why have you left them and come to us? You will be safe here. No need to be afraid! We have spared your life tonight, and you are in no danger for the future. 
JDT.11.4	No one here will harm you; everyone will treat you well, like all other servants of my master, Nebuchadnezzar.”
JDT.11.5	Then Judith said to Holofernes, “Allow me to speak to you, my lord, and please listen to what I have to say. I will tell you the truth. 
JDT.11.6	If you follow my advice, God will do something great with you, and my lord will not fail in his plan. 
JDT.11.7	 For I swear to you by the life and strength of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the whole world, who sent you to bring order to all the subjects of his kingdom, that not only have you made people serve him, but because of you even the wild animals, the livestock, and the birds obey him. Because of you, Nebuchadnezzar and his entire kingdom will prosper.
JDT.11.8	We have heard how wise and clever you are. The whole world knows that you are the most competent, skilled, and accomplished general in the whole Assyrian Empire. 
JDT.11.9	Achior was rescued by the men of Bethulia, and has told us what he said at your war council. 
JDT.11.10	Please, sir, do not dismiss lightly what Achior told you, but take it seriously, because it is true. No one can harm or conquer our people unless they sin against their God.
JDT.11.11	“But you will not suffer any setbacks, nor will you fail to achieve your goal. When the Israelites sin and make their God angry, they will die. 
JDT.11.12	Their food supply has already run out, and the water shortage has become serious, so they have decided to kill their livestock and eat foods that God's Law clearly forbids them to eat. 
JDT.11.13	 They have decided to eat the wheat set aside from the early harvest and the tithes of wine and oil, which are holy and are reserved for the priests who serve God in Jerusalem. The rest of us are forbidden even to touch this sacred food, 
JDT.11.14	but since the people in Jerusalem have already broken this law, the people of our town have sent messengers to the Council there requesting permission to do the same. 
JDT.11.15	On the day that they receive permission and actually eat the food, you will be able to destroy them. 
JDT.11.16	As soon as I learned about this, I ran away from my people. God has sent me to do something with you that will amaze everyone in the entire world who hears about it. 
JDT.11.17	Sir, I am a religious woman; I worship the God of heaven day and night. I will stay here in your camp, and each night I will go out into the valley to pray to God, and he will tell me when the Israelites have sinned. 
JDT.11.18	As soon as I find out, I will come and tell you, and you can march out with your whole army. The Israelites will not be able to defend themselves against you. 
JDT.11.19	I will guide you through the central part of the land of Judah until we come to Jerusalem, where I will crown you king in the center of the city. You will scatter the people of Jerusalem like sheep without a shepherd. Not even a dog will dare to growl at you. God has revealed these things to me in advance and has sent me to report them to you.”
JDT.11.20	Holofernes and his personal servants were pleased with what Judith had said, and they admired her wisdom. 
JDT.11.21	“She must be the wisest and most beautiful woman in the world,” they commented one to another.
JDT.11.22	Then Holofernes said to her, “It's a good thing that God has sent you here to bring us victory and to destroy those who have insulted King Nebuchadnezzar. 
JDT.11.23	Not only are you beautiful, but you know how to make a speech. If you do as you have promised, your God will be my God. You will live in King Nebuchadnezzar's palace and will be famous throughout the world.”
JDT.12.1	Holofernes commanded his men to take Judith to the table which was set with his silverware and to serve her some of his own special food and wine. 
JDT.12.2	 But Judith refused. “I cannot eat your food,” she said, “for I would be breaking the laws of my God. I will eat only what I have brought with me.”
JDT.12.3	“But what will you do when your food and wine are gone?” Holofernes asked. “Where will we get more food for you? There are no Israelites here in our camp.”
JDT.12.4	“Sir,” Judith answered, “as surely as you live, I have more than enough food to last until the Lord has used me to carry out his plan.”
JDT.12.5	Then Holofernes' personal servants led Judith to a tent. She slept there until the time of the morning watch just before dawn, when she got up 
JDT.12.6	and sent a message to Holofernes requesting permission to go out into the valley to pray. 
JDT.12.7	Holofernes ordered his guards to let Judith leave the camp. So for three days Judith lived in the camp, and each night she would go out to the valley near Bethulia and bathe at the spring. 
JDT.12.8	After she had bathed, she would pray to the Lord God to guide her in her plan to bring victory to Israel. 
JDT.12.9	Then she would return to the camp ritually pure and remain in her tent until after the evening meal.
JDT.12.10	On the fourth day of Judith's stay in the camp, Holofernes gave a banquet for his highest ranking officers, but he did not invite any of the officers who were on duty. 
JDT.12.11	He said to Bagoas, the eunuch who was in charge of his personal affairs, “Go and persuade the Hebrew woman, who is in your care, to come to my tent to eat and drink with us. 
JDT.12.12	It would be a shame to pass up an opportunity to make love to a woman like that. If I don't try to seduce her, she will laugh at me.”
JDT.12.13	So Bagoas left Holofernes and went to Judith. “Lovely lady,” he said, “the general invites you to his tent for some drinks. Come and enjoy yourself like the Assyrian women who serve in Nebuchadnezzar's palace. This is a great honor.”
JDT.12.14	“I shall be glad to accept,” Judith answered. “How could I refuse? I'll remember this happy night as long as I live.”
JDT.12.15	So Judith got up and put on her prettiest clothes. Her slave woman went ahead of her and placed on the ground in front of Holofernes the lamb skins that Bagoas had given Judith to sit on when she ate. 
JDT.12.16	Judith came into the tent and sat down there. Holofernes was aroused when he saw her and had an uncontrollable desire to make love to her. From the first day he had seen her, he had been waiting for a chance to seduce her. 
JDT.12.17	“Join us for a drink and enjoy yourself,” he said to her.
JDT.12.18	“I'll be glad to, sir,” Judith replied; “this is the happiest day of my life.” 
JDT.12.19	But even then Judith ate and drank only what her slave had prepared. 
JDT.12.20	Holofernes was so charmed by her that he drank more wine than he had ever drunk at one time in his whole life.
JDT.13.1	Finally, when it got late, the guests excused themselves and left. Bagoas then closed up the tent from the outside and prevented Holofernes' servants from going in. So they all went to bed; everyone was very tired because the banquet had lasted so long. 
JDT.13.2	Judith was left alone in the tent with Holofernes who was lying drunk on his bed. 
JDT.13.3	Judith's slave woman was waiting outside the tent for Judith to go and pray, as she had done each night. Judith had also told Bagoas that she would be going out to pray as usual.
JDT.13.4	All the guests and servants were now gone, and Judith and Holofernes were alone in the tent. Judith stood by Holofernes' bed and prayed silently, “O Lord, God Almighty, help me with what I am about to do for the glory of Jerusalem. 
JDT.13.5	Now is the time to rescue your chosen people and to help me carry out my plan to destroy the enemies who are threatening us.” 
JDT.13.6	Judith went to the bedpost by Holofernes' head and took down his sword. 
JDT.13.7	She came closer, seized Holofernes by the hair of his head, and said, “O Lord, God of Israel, give me strength now.” 
JDT.13.8	Then Judith raised the sword and struck him twice in the neck as hard as she could, chopping off his head. 
JDT.13.9	She rolled his body off the bed and took down the mosquito net from the bedposts. Then she came out and gave Holofernes' head to her slave, 
JDT.13.10	who put it in the food bag.
JDT.13.10	Then the two women left together, as they always did when they went to pray. After they had walked through the Assyrian camp, they crossed the valley and went up the mountainside until they came to the gates of Bethulia. 
JDT.13.11	When they were a short distance away, Judith called out to the guards at the gate, “Open the gate! Open the gate! Our God is still with us. Today he has once again shown his strength in Israel and used his power against our enemies.”
JDT.13.12	When the men heard her voice, they hurried down to the gates and called for the town officials. 
JDT.13.13	Everyone, young and old, ran together to the gate. No one could believe that Judith had come back. They opened the gate for her and her slave and welcomed them. Then, when they had lit a fire to give some light and had gathered around the two women, 
JDT.13.14	Judith shouted, “Praise God, give him praise! Praise God, who has not held back his mercy from the people of Israel. Tonight he has used me to destroy our enemies.” 
JDT.13.15	She then took the head out of the food bag and showed it to the people. “Here,” she said, “is the head of Holofernes, the general of the Assyrian army, and here is the mosquito net from his bed, where he lay in a drunken stupor. The Lord used a woman to kill him. 
JDT.13.16	As the Lord lives, I swear that Holofernes never touched me, although my beauty deceived him and brought him to his ruin. I was not defiled or disgraced; the Lord took care of me through it all.”
JDT.13.17	Everyone in the city was utterly amazed. They bowed down and worshiped God, praying together, “Our God, you are worthy of great praise. Today you have triumphed over the enemies of your people.”
JDT.13.19	Your trust in God will never be forgotten by those who tell of God's power. 
JDT.13.20	May God give you everlasting honor for what you have done. May he reward you with blessings, because you remained faithful to him and did not hesitate to risk your own life to relieve the oppression of your people.”
JDT.13.20	All the people replied, “Amen, amen!”
JDT.14.1	Then Judith said to them, “My friends, please follow my advice. In the morning, take this head and hang it on the town wall. 
JDT.14.2	Appoint a leader for yourselves, and at sunrise have all your able-bodied men take their weapons and march out of the town with him, as if they were going down into the valley to attack the Assyrian outpost. 
JDT.14.3	The Assyrian guards will grab their weapons and rush back to camp to wake up their officers. The officers will run to Holofernes' tent but will not find him, and the whole army will be terrified and retreat as you advance against them. 
JDT.14.4	Then you and all the other Israelites will be able to follow them and kill them as they retreat. 
JDT.14.5	But before you do any of this, send Achior the Ammonite to me. I want to see if he recognizes Holofernes, the man who spoke of Israel with contempt and sent Achior to us, thinking he would be killed along with the rest of us.”
JDT.14.6	So they called Achior from Uzziah's house. But when he came and saw the head of Holofernes in the hands of one of the men, Achior fainted and fell to the floor. 
JDT.14.7	When they had helped him up, Achior bowed at Judith's feet in respect. “May every family in the land of Judah praise you,” he said, “and may every nation tremble with terror when they hear your name. 
JDT.14.8	Please tell me how you managed to do this.”
JDT.14.8	While all the people were gathered around, Judith told him everything that she had done from the day she left the town until that moment. 
JDT.14.9	When she had finished her story, the people cheered so loudly that the whole town echoed with sounds of joy. 
JDT.14.10	When Achior heard all that the God of Israel had done, he became a firm believer. He was circumcised and made a member of the Israelite community, as his descendants are to the present day.
JDT.14.11	The next morning the Israelites hung the head of Holofernes on the wall of the town. All of them took up their weapons and went out in companies to the slopes in front of the town. 
JDT.14.12	When the Assyrians saw what was happening, they sent word to their officers, and these reported the matter to their superiors. 
JDT.14.13	These men then went to Holofernes' tent and said to Bagoas, “Wake up the general! Those worthless Israelites have dared to come down from the mountain to attack us; they are just asking to be destroyed.”
JDT.14.14	Bagoas went in and clapped his hands in front of the sleeping quarters of the tent, thinking that Holofernes was in bed with Judith. 
JDT.14.15	When there was no answer, he drew the curtain aside and went in, and there he found the headless body sprawled over a footstool. 
JDT.14.16	Bagoas let out a yell. He screamed, tore his clothes, and started groaning and weeping. 
JDT.14.17	He went into the tent where Judith had stayed, but of course he did not find her. He rushed out and shouted to the officers, 
JDT.14.18	“They have tricked us! One Israelite woman has disgraced Nebuchadnezzar's whole kingdom. Look in there! Holofernes is lying dead on the ground and his head is gone!” 
JDT.14.19	When the officers heard this, they tore their clothes in grief; and as the panic spread, wild cries and shouts were heard throughout the camp.
JDT.15.1	When the soldiers heard what had happened, they were horrified 
JDT.15.2	and began to tremble with fear. They all scattered in different directions from the camp, making no effort to stay together as they tried to escape along the paths in the mountains and valleys. 
JDT.15.3	The soldiers who had camped in the mountains around Bethulia also began to retreat. Then all the Israelite soldiers came charging down on them.
JDT.15.4	Uzziah sent messengers to the towns of Betomesthaim, Bebai, Choba, and Kola, and throughout the land of Israel to tell everyone what had happened and to urge them to join in pursuing and destroying the enemy. 
JDT.15.5	When they received the message, they all attacked the Assyrians and chased them as far as Choba, slaughtering them as they went. Even the people of Jerusalem and others living in the mountains joined the attack when the messengers told them what had happened in the Assyrian camp. The people of the regions of Gilead and Galilee blocked the path of the retreating Assyrians and inflicted heavy losses on them. They pursued them as far as the region around Damascus.
JDT.15.6	The rest of the people in Bethulia went down to the Assyrian camp, plundered it and carried away enough loot to make themselves very rich. 
JDT.15.7	When the Israelite soldiers returned from the slaughter, they helped themselves to what was left. There was so much of it that the people of the towns and villages in the hill country also shared in the loot.
JDT.15.8	The High Priest Joakim and the Council of Israel came from Jerusalem to see for themselves what great things the Lord had done for his people and to meet Judith and congratulate her. 
JDT.15.9	When they arrived, they all praised her, “You are Jerusalem's crowning glory, the heroine of Israel, the pride and joy of our people! 
JDT.15.10	You have won this great victory for Israel by yourself. God, the Almighty, is pleased with what you have done. May he bless you as long as you live.”
JDT.15.10	All the people responded, “Amen.”
JDT.15.11	It took the people thirty days to finish looting the camp of the Assyrians. Judith was given Holofernes' tent, all his silver, his bowls, his couches, and all his furniture. She took them and loaded as much as she could on her mule; then she brought her wagons and loaded them too. 
JDT.15.12	All the Israelite women came to see her; they sang her praises and danced in her honor. On this joyful occasion Judith and the other women waved ivy-covered branches 
JDT.15.13	and wore wreaths of olive leaves on their heads. Judith took her place at the head of the procession to lead the women as they danced. All the men of Israel followed, wearing wreaths of flowers on their heads, carrying their weapons, and singing songs of praise.
JDT.16.1	Then Judith sang a song of thanksgiving there with all Israel present, and the people joined in this song of praise. 
JDT.16.2	She sang,
JDT.16.2	“Praise my God and sing to him;
JDT.16.2	praise the Lord with drums and cymbals;
JDT.16.2	play a new song for him.
JDT.16.2	Praise him and call on him for help.
JDT.16.3	The Lord is a warrior who ends war.
JDT.16.3	He rescued me from my pursuers
JDT.16.3	and brought me back to his people's camp.
JDT.16.4	Down from the mountains of the north came the Assyrians,
JDT.16.4	with their tens of thousands of soldiers.
JDT.16.4	Their troops blocked the rivers in the valleys;
JDT.16.4	their cavalry covered the mountains.
JDT.16.5	They threatened to set fire to our country,
JDT.16.5	slaughter our young men,
JDT.16.5	dash our babies to the ground,
JDT.16.5	take our children away as captives,
JDT.16.5	and carry off all our young women.
JDT.16.6	But the Lord Almighty tricked them;
JDT.16.6	he used a woman to stop them.
JDT.16.7	Their hero was not slain by young soldiers
JDT.16.7	or attacked and killed by mighty giants.
JDT.16.7	It was Judith, the daughter of Merari,
JDT.16.7	who brought him down with her beauty.
JDT.16.8	She gave victory to the oppressed people of Israel,
JDT.16.8	when she took off her widow's clothes,
JDT.16.8	and put on a linen dress to entice him.
JDT.16.8	She put on her rich perfumes
JDT.16.8	and tied a ribbon around her hair.
JDT.16.9	Her dainty sandal caught his eye;
JDT.16.9	her beauty captured his heart.
JDT.16.9	Then the sword slashed through his neck.
JDT.16.10	The Persians trembled at her daring;
JDT.16.10	the Medes were amazed at her bravery.
JDT.16.11	Then our people shouted in victory.
JDT.16.11	They had been weak and oppressed,
JDT.16.11	but they forced the enemy to retreat in panic and fear.
JDT.16.12	We are the descendants of slaves,
JDT.16.12	but our enemies turned and ran;
JDT.16.12	we killed them like runaway slaves.
JDT.16.12	They were destroyed by the army of the Lord.
JDT.16.13	O Lord, you are strong and glorious!
JDT.16.13	You have never been defeated.
JDT.16.14	Let all your creatures serve you.
JDT.16.14	You gave the command,
JDT.16.14	and all of them came into being;
JDT.16.14	you breathed on them,
JDT.16.14	and all of them were created.
JDT.16.14	No one can oppose your command.
JDT.16.15	The mountains and the seas tremble,
JDT.16.15	and rocks melt like wax when you come near.
JDT.16.15	But there is mercy for all who obey you.
JDT.16.16	than with all the choice meat on the altar,
JDT.16.16	or with all the most fragrant sacrifices.
JDT.16.17	The nations who rise up against my people are doomed.
JDT.16.17	The Lord Almighty will punish them on Judgment Day.
JDT.16.17	He will send fire and worms to devour their bodies,
JDT.16.17	and they will weep in pain forever.”
JDT.16.18	When the people arrived in Jerusalem, they purified themselves and worshiped God. They presented their burnt offerings, freewill offerings, and gifts. 
JDT.16.19	Judith dedicated to God all of Holofernes' property, which the people had given to her. And as a special offering in fulfillment of a vow, she presented to the Lord the mosquito net which she had taken from Holofernes' bed. 
JDT.16.20	For three months the people continued to celebrate in front of the Temple in Jerusalem, and Judith stayed there with them.
JDT.16.21	When the celebrations had ended, everyone returned home, and Judith went back to Bethulia to live on her own estate. For the rest of her life she was famous throughout the land of Israel. 
JDT.16.22	Many men wanted to marry her, but she never remarried after the death of her husband Manasseh. 
JDT.16.23+JDT.16.24	Her fame continued to spread, and she lived in the house her husband had left her. Before she died, Judith divided her property among her husband's and her own close relatives and set her slave woman free. When she died in Bethulia at the age of 105, she was buried beside her husband, and the people of Israel mourned her death for seven days. 
JDT.16.25	As long as Judith lived, and for many years after her death, no one dared to threaten the people of Israel.
ESG.1_1.1+ESG.1_1.2+ESG.1_1.3	 Mordecai, a Jew who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, was taken into exile, along with King Jehoiachin of Judah, when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia captured Jerusalem. Mordecai was the son of Jair, a descendant of Kish and Shimei. He now lived in the Persian city of Susa, where he was an important official in the royal court of Xerxes the great king.
ESG.1_1.1+ESG.1_1.2+ESG.1_1.3	During the second year of Xerxes' reign, on the first day of the month of Nisan, Mordecai had a dream. 
ESG.1_1.4	He dreamed that there was great noise and confusion, loud thunder, and an earthquake, with terrible turmoil on the earth. 
ESG.1_1.5	Then two huge dragons appeared, ready to fight each other. 
ESG.1_1.6	They made a dreadful noise, and all the nations got ready to make war against God's nation of righteous people. 
ESG.1_1.7	For the world it was a day of darkness and gloom, trouble and distress, destruction and ruin. 
ESG.1_1.8	All of God's righteous people were troubled, in great fear of what was about to happen to them. They prepared for death, 
ESG.1_1.9	but they cried out to God for help. In the dream their prayer was answered by a great river which came flowing out of a small spring. 
ESG.1_1.10	The day dawned, the sun rose, and the humble people were made strong and destroyed their arrogant enemies.
ESG.1_1.11	Mordecai woke up from this dream in which he saw what God planned to do. He thought about it all day and tried to understand what it meant.
ESG.1_1.12	While Mordecai was resting in the courtyard of the palace, where two of the king's eunuchs, Gabatha and Tharra, were on guard, 
ESG.1_1.13	he overheard them plotting together. He listened carefully to what they were saying and learned that they were making plans to kill the king. So Mordecai went to King Xerxes and told him about the plot of the two eunuchs. 
ESG.1_1.14	The king had them questioned, and when they confessed, they were led away and executed.
ESG.1_1.15	The king had an account of this written in the official records, and Mordecai also wrote an account of it. 
ESG.1_1.16	Then the king appointed Mordecai to a position at court and gave him many gifts as a reward for what he had done.
ESG.1_1.17	But Haman son of Hammedatha, a Bougaean who was respected by the king, tried to cause trouble for Mordecai and his people the Jews, because Mordecai had been responsible for the death of the two eunuchs.
ESG.1_2.20	 In the third year of his reign, the king gave a banquet for all his advisers, the representatives of the other countries, the noblemen from Persia and Media, and the governors of the provinces. 
ESG.1_2.21	 For six whole months he made a show of the riches of the imperial court with magnificent and expensive celebrations.
ESG.1_2.22	 After the feast
ESG.1_2.23	 which was decorated with linen and cotton curtains, held by cords of purple linen attached to silver and gold blocks on marble and stone columns. Couches made of gold and silver had been placed in the courtyard, which was paved with green and white marble and mother-of-pearl. The couches were spread with a fine, thin fabric of many colors, with roses around the edges. 
ESG.1_2.24	 There were gold and silver cups, and one of them, decorated with jewels worth more than a thousand tons of silver, had been set out for display. There was plenty of good wine from the king's own supply. 
ESG.1_2.25	 There were no limits on the drinks. The king had given orders to the palace servants that they should provide him and his guests with as much as they wanted.
ESG.1_2.26	 Meanwhile, inside the royal palace Queen Vashti was giving a banquet for the women.
ESG.1_2.27	 On the seventh day of his banquet the king was feeling happy, so he called in the seven eunuchs who were his personal servants, Haman, Bazan, Tharra, Boraze, Zatholta, Abataza, and Tharaba. 
ESG.1_2.28	 He ordered them to bring in the queen, so that he could place the royal crown on her head and show her off to the officials and all his guests, for she was a beautiful woman. 
ESG.1_2.29	 But Queen Vashti refused to obey and would not come with the servants. This embarrassed the king and made him furious.
ESG.1_2.30	 He told his advisers about Vashti's reply and asked them to give a legal opinion about what he should do. 
ESG.1_2.31+ESG.1_2.32	 Three of them, who were closest to the king and held the highest offices, came and told him what the law required and what should be done to Queen Vashti for disobeying the command he had given her through his servants. They were Arkesaeus, Sarsathaeus, and Malesear, officials of Persia and Media.
ESG.1_2.33	 Then the king told his officials and the governors of Media and Persia how the queen had defied him. So Muchaeus said to the king and everyone present: “Queen Vashti has insulted not only you but all of us as well. 
ESG.1_2.34+ESG.1_2.35	 As soon as our wives hear what the queen has done, they will be bold enough to defy their husbands and treat them with disrespect in the same way that Vashti has treated you. 
ESG.1_2.36	 If, then, it please Your Majesty, issue a royal proclamation that Vashti may never again appear before the king. Have it written into the laws of Media and Persia. Then give her place as queen to some better woman. There is no other way. 
ESG.1_2.37	 When your proclamation is made known all over this empire, then every woman will treat her husband with proper respect, whether he is rich or poor.”
ESG.1_2.38	 The king and his officials liked this idea, and the king did as Muchaeus suggested. 
ESG.1_2.39	 To each of the royal provinces he sent a message in the language of that province, saying that every husband must be respected in his own home.
ESG.2.1	Later the king's anger cooled down. Although he no longer mentioned Vashti, he kept thinking about how he had condemned her. 
ESG.2.2	So some of the king's advisers suggested, “Why don't you make a search to find some beautiful young women of good character? 
ESG.2.3	You can appoint officials in every province of the empire and have them bring all these beautiful young virgins to your harem here in Susa. Put them in the care of Hegai, the eunuch who is in charge of your women, and let them be given cosmetics and whatever else they may need. 
ESG.2.4	Then take the young woman you like best and make her queen in Vashti's place.”
ESG.2.4	The king thought this was good advice, so he followed it.
ESG.2.5	There in Susa lived a Jew named Mordecai son of Jair; he was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei. 
ESG.2.6	 He was among the captives whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had taken into exile from Jerusalem. 
ESG.2.7	Mordecai was the guardian of Esther, the daughter of his uncle Aminadab. She was a beautiful young woman, and after the death of her parents, Mordecai brought her up until she was grown.
ESG.2.8	When the king had issued his new proclamation, many young women were being brought to Susa, and Esther was among them. She too was put in the royal palace in the care of Hegai, who had charge of the harem. 
ESG.2.9	Hegai liked Esther, and she won his favor. He lost no time in beginning her beauty treatment of massage and special diet. He assigned seven young women specially chosen from the royal palace to serve her, and he treated her and her servants well.
ESG.2.10	Now, on the advice of Mordecai, Esther had kept secret the fact that she was Jewish. 
ESG.2.11	Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard of the harem, watching to see what was going to happen to her.
ESG.2.12	The regular beauty treatment for the young women lasted a year: massages with oil of myrrh for six months and with beauty creams and cosmetics for six more. 
ESG.2.13	After that, each young woman was handed over to the person appointed to conduct her from the harem to the palace, and she was taken to the king. 
ESG.2.14	She would go there in the evening, and the next morning she would be taken to another harem and put in the care of Hegai, the eunuch in charge. She would not go to the king again unless he asked for her by name.
ESG.2.15	The time came for Esther, the daughter of Aminadab the uncle of Mordecai, to go to the king. She had done everything that Hegai had advised, and she was admired by everyone who saw her. 
ESG.2.16	So in Xerxes' seventh year as king, in the twelfth month, the month of Adar, she was brought to the king. 
ESG.2.17	He fell in love with Esther, who pleased him more than any of the others, and he placed the queen's crown on her head. 
ESG.2.18	Then the king gave a week-long banquet for all his advisers and administrators to celebrate his marriage to Esther. He also granted a reduction of taxes for the whole empire.
ESG.2.19	Meanwhile Mordecai had been appointed to a high administrative position. 
ESG.2.20	As for Esther, she had still not let it be known that she was Jewish. Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone, and she obeyed him in this, just as she had obeyed him when she was a little girl under his care. She continued to worship God and carry out God's commands, without abandoning her Jewish ways.
ESG.2.21	When the king promoted Mordecai to a higher position, the two palace eunuchs who were officers of the king's bodyguard became angry and plotted to assassinate the king. 
ESG.2.22	Mordecai learned about it and told Queen Esther, who then told the king the details of the plot. 
ESG.2.23	The king had the two men questioned, and both men were hanged. To honor Mordecai, the king ordered an account of this to be written down in the royal records, so that his valuable service would be remembered.
ESG.3.1	Some time later King Xerxes honored a man named Haman son of Hammedatha, a Bougaean, by promoting him to the position of prime minister. 
ESG.3.2	The king ordered all the officials in his service to show their respect for Haman by bowing to him. They all did so, except Mordecai, who refused to bow to Haman. 
ESG.3.3	The other officials in the royal service asked him why he was disobeying the king's command. 
ESG.3.4	Day after day they urged him to give in, but he would not listen to them. “I am a Jew,” he explained, “and I cannot bow to Haman.” So they told Haman how Mordecai was defying the king's orders. 
ESG.3.5	Haman was furious when he realized that Mordecai was not going to bow to him, 
ESG.3.6	and so he made plans to kill every Jew in the whole Persian Empire.
ESG.3.7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes' reign, Haman ordered the lots to be cast to find out the right day and month to destroy the Jews, all in a single day. The fourteenth day of the month of Adar was the date chosen.
ESG.3.8	So Haman told the king, “There is a certain race of people scattered among the nations all over your empire. They observe customs that are not like those of any other people. Moreover, they do not obey the laws of the empire, so it is not in your best interests to tolerate them. 
ESG.3.9	If it please Your Majesty, issue a decree that they are to be put to death. If you do this, I promise to put 375 tons of silver into the royal treasury.”
ESG.3.10	The king took off his ring, which was used to stamp official proclamations, and gave it to Haman to seal the decree that was to be written against the Jews. 
ESG.3.11	The king told him, “Keep the money, and do whatever you want with that race of people.”
ESG.3.12	So on the thirteenth day of the first month, Haman called the king's secretaries and dictated a proclamation to be translated into every language in the empire and to be sent to all the rulers and governors. It was issued in the name of King Xerxes and sent to all the 127 provinces, which stretched from India to Ethiopia.
ESG.3.13	Runners took this proclamation to every province of the empire. It contained the instructions that on a single day in the twelfth month, the month of Adar, all Jews were to be killed and their belongings confiscated.
ESG.3_1.14	 This is a copy of the decree:
ESG.3_1.14	“King Xerxes the Great sends the following decree to the governors of his 127 provinces, from India to Ethiopia,
ESG.3_1.15	 “After I became ruler of many nations and master of the whole world, I resolved that my subjects should always live at peace. I wanted this, not because of pride in my power but because I was always reasonable and governed my subjects with kindness. I determined to renew the peace that everyone longs for and to do what was necessary to create a civilized kingdom, safe for travel from one border to another.
ESG.3_1.16	 “I asked my advisers how to accomplish this goal, and Haman made a suggestion. He is distinguished among us as a man of great wisdom, and at all times he has demonstrated his concern for the welfare of the kingdom. Because of his unfailing loyalty, he has been raised to the second highest position in the empire. 
ESG.3_1.17	 Recently Haman told us about a certain unruly people scattered among all the other peoples of the empire. He explained to us that these people have their own laws, are opposed to every other nation, and constantly ignore royal commands. As a result of their attitude, we are not able to establish the kind of unified government which we earnestly intend for the empire.
ESG.3_1.18	 “These people are hostile to our government and commit terrible crimes which threaten the security of the empire. They follow strange customs, obey their own laws, and stand alone in their constant opposition to all people. 
ESG.3_1.19	 In the light of these facts, we recommend the slaughter of the people referred to by Haman, our prime minister. All of them, including women and children, must be put to death; no one is to be spared. They are our enemies; we will show them no pity. This order is to be carried out this year on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 
ESG.3_1.20	 These people, who have caused so much trouble for so long, will all die a violent death in a single day. From then on, our government will be secure and stable.”
ESG.3_2.21	 The contents of the proclamation were made public in every province, and everyone was ordered to be prepared for that day.
ESG.3_2.22	 The decree was also rapidly made public in the capital city of Susa. And while the king and Haman got drunk, the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.
ESG.4.1	When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes in anguish. Then he dressed in sackcloth, covered his head with ashes, and ran through the city crying loudly, “An innocent nation is being destroyed!” 
ESG.4.2	When he came to the entrance of the palace, he stopped. He did not go in because no one in sackcloth and ashes was allowed inside. 
ESG.4.3	Throughout all the provinces, wherever the king's proclamation was made known, there was loud mourning among the Jews. They wept, wailed, and put on sackcloth and ashes.
ESG.4.4	When Esther's servant women and eunuchs told her what Mordecai was doing, she was deeply disturbed. She sent Mordecai some clothes to put on instead of the sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
ESG.4.5	Then she called Hathach, one of the palace eunuchs appointed as her servant, and told him to go to Mordecai and get the details of what was happening.
ESG.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened and how Haman had promised to put 375 tons of silver into the royal treasury if all the Jews were killed. 
ESG.4.8	He gave Hathach a copy of the proclamation that had been issued in Susa, ordering the destruction of the Jews. Mordecai asked him to take it to Esther so that she might go and plead with the king and beg him to have mercy on her people. “Tell her,” he said, “to remember the days when she was just an ordinary person being brought up under my care. Now, since Haman, the king's prime minister, has spoken against us and demands our death, she must pray to the Lord and then speak to the king about us. She must save us from death.”
ESG.4.9	So Hathach did this, 
ESG.4.10	and Esther gave him this message to take back to Mordecai: 
ESG.4.11	“If anyone, man or woman, goes to the inner courtyard and sees the king without being summoned, that person will be sentenced to death. Everyone in the empire knows that. Only if the king holds out his gold scepter to him can his life be spared. But it has been a month now since the king has sent for me.”
ESG.4.12	When Mordecai received Esther's message, 
ESG.4.13	he sent her this warning: “Esther, don't imagine that you are safer than any of the other Jews in the empire. 
ESG.4.14	If you keep quiet at a time like this, help will come to the Jews in some other way and they will be saved, but you will die and your father's family will come to an end. Yet, who knows? Maybe it was for a time like this that you were made queen!”
ESG.4.15	Esther sent Mordecai this reply: 
ESG.4.16	“Go and gather all the Jews in Susa together; hold a fast and pray for me. Don't eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My servant women and I will be doing the same. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. If I must die for doing it, I will die.”
ESG.4.17	Mordecai then left and did everything that Esther had told him to do.
ESG.4_1.18	 Mordecai prayed to the Lord, calling to mind what the Lord had done in the past: 
ESG.4_1.19	 “O Lord, you are the Lord and King of all creation, and everything obeys your commands. If you wish to save Israel, no one can stop you. 
ESG.4_1.20	 You made heaven and earth and all the wonderful things on earth. 
ESG.4_1.21	 You are the Lord of all, and there is no one who can stand against you. 
ESG.4_1.22	 You know all things. You know, Lord, that when I refused to bow to that arrogant Haman, it was not because I was arrogant or trying to impress people. 
ESG.4_1.23+ESG.4_1.24	 I simply did not want to honor any human being more than I honor God. I refuse to bow to anyone but you, my Lord; and this is not because of pride. If it would help to save Israel, I would be willing even to kiss the soles of his feet.
ESG.4_1.27	 We are your chosen people, so listen to my prayer and be gracious to us. Turn our misfortune into joy so that we may live to sing your praises. Save us from death so that we can keep on praising you.”
ESG.4_1.28	 And all the people of Israel prayed loudly and earnestly because they were sure that they were going to die.
ESG.4_1.29	 Queen Esther, in deep agony, turned to the Lord. 
ESG.4_1.30	 She took off her splendid robes and put on garments of mourning and grief. Instead of her rich perfumes, she put ashes and dung on her head. She did all she could to destroy any dignity in her appearance. She let her tangled and uncombed hair hang down over her body that she had always taken such care to beautify. 
ESG.4_1.31	 She prayed to the Lord God of Israel, “My Lord and King, only you are God. I am all alone, and I have no one to turn to but you. Help me! 
ESG.4_1.32	 I am about to risk my life. 
ESG.4_1.33	 O Lord, as long as I can remember, my family has told me how you chose Israel from all the nations and how in ancient times you singled out our ancestors to be your people forever. You have kept all your promises to them.
ESG.4_1.34	 “But we sinned against you. You handed us over to our enemies because we worshiped their gods. 
ESG.4_1.35	 We deserved your punishment, O Lord. 
ESG.4_1.36	 But our enemies are no longer satisfied just to see us in slavery. They have made a solemn promise to their idols 
ESG.4_1.37	 not only to destroy the people who praise you, but to do away with your Law and to remove forever the glory of your house and altar. 
ESG.4_1.38	 They want the whole world to praise worthless idols and stand in awe of mortal kings forever.
ESG.4_1.39	 “Lord, these gods are nothing; do not surrender your power to them or give our enemies the chance to laugh at our downfall. Instead, turn their evil plans against them, and make an example of that man who first planned our destruction.
ESG.4_1.40	 “Remember us, O Lord. Come to us in this time of trouble. Give me courage, King of all gods and Ruler over all earthly powers. 
ESG.4_1.42	 Come to our rescue, O Lord. Help me; I am all alone, and I have no one to turn to but you.
ESG.4_1.43	 “You know everything, Lord. You know that I hate the honor I receive from these Gentiles. I detest the thought of having sex with any of these uncircumcised heathen. 
ESG.4_1.44	 But you know that I have no choice. I hate the crown I have to wear as queen on official occasions. I never wear it unless I have to; it's as disgusting as last month's rag. 
ESG.4_1.46	 Since I came here, the only thing that has brought me joy is my worship of you, Lord God of Abraham.
ESG.4_1.47	 “Almighty God, listen to the prayer of your people. Rescue us from these evildoers, and take away my fear.”
ESG.5_1.1	Queen Esther prayed for three days. Then she took off the clothes she had been wearing and put on her splendid robes again. 
ESG.5_1.2+ESG.5_1.3	In all her royal splendor, she prayed again to her God and savior, who sees everything. Walking like a queen, she left her room accompanied by two servant women, one of them escorting her by the arm and 
ESG.5_1.4	the other holding up the train of her robe. 
ESG.5_1.5	Queen Esther's face was radiantly beautiful. She looked as cheerful as she was lovely, but in her heart she was terror-stricken. 
ESG.5_1.6	She passed through all the doors and entered the throne room, where she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, dressed in his glorious robes, which were covered with gold and precious jewels. It was an awe-inspiring sight. 
ESG.5_1.7	His face glowed with splendor, but when he saw Esther, he stared at her with fierce anger. She grew weak and turned pale; she almost fainted and had to lean her head on her attendant's shoulder.
ESG.5_1.8	But God changed the king's anger into tender concern. He quickly rose from his throne and took her in his arms until she was able to stand. He calmed her with comforting words. 
ESG.5_1.9	“What is it, Esther?” he said to her. “I am your husband. There's no need to be afraid. 
ESG.5_1.10	Our law applies only to ordinary people; you will not die. 
ESG.5_1.11	Come here to me.” 
ESG.5_1.12	He lifted his gold scepter and touched her on the neck with it. Then he kissed her and said, “Tell me what you want.”
ESG.5_1.13	“When I looked at you, my lord, I thought I was seeing an angel of God,” the queen answered, “and I was overcome by your awesome majesty. 
ESG.5_1.14	You are so marvelous and your face is so full of kindness.”
ESG.5_1.15	But while she was speaking, she fainted again. 
ESG.5_1.16	The king was concerned about her, and all his attendants tried to revive her.
ESG.5_2.18	 Esther replied, “Today is a special day for me. If it please my lord, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tonight at a banquet I am preparing for you.”
ESG.5_2.19	 The king then ordered Haman to come quickly, so that they could be Esther's guests. So the king and Haman went to Esther's banquet. 
ESG.5_2.20	 Over the wine the king again said to her, “Tell me what you want, Queen Esther.”
ESG.5_2.21	 Esther replied, 
ESG.5_2.22	 “If my lord is kind enough to grant my request, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tomorrow at another banquet that I will prepare for you. It will be just like this one.”
ESG.5_2.23	 When Haman left the king he was happy and in a good mood, until he saw Mordecai the Jew in the courtyard of the palace. That made him furious, 
ESG.5_2.24	 but he went on home. Then he invited his friends to his house and asked his wife Zeresh to join them. 
ESG.5_2.25	 He boasted to them about how rich he was and about the honor the king had paid him when he promoted him to high office and made him prime minister. 
ESG.5_2.26	 “What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther gave a banquet for no one but the king and me, and we are invited back tomorrow. 
ESG.5_2.27	 But none of this means a thing to me as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting in the courtyard of the palace.”
ESG.5_2.28	 Then his wife and all his friends suggested, “Why don't you have a gallows put up, seventy-five feet high? Tomorrow morning you can ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it, and then you can go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself.” Haman thought it was a good idea, so he had the gallows built.
ESG.6.1	That night the Lord kept the king from sleeping, so the king ordered his private secretary to bring the official records of the empire and read them to him. 
ESG.6.2	He read the account of how Mordecai had uncovered a plot to assassinate the king—the plot made by the two eunuchs who served as palace guards. 
ESG.6.3	The king asked, “How have we honored and rewarded Mordecai for this?”
ESG.6.3	His servants answered, “You have done nothing for him.”
ESG.6.4	Now just as the king was inquiring about Mordecai's good deed, Haman entered the courtyard. He had come to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows that was now ready.
ESG.6.4	“Who is that in the courtyard?” the king asked.
ESG.6.5	The servants answered, “It is Haman; he is waiting to see you.”
ESG.6.5	“Show him in,” said the king.
ESG.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “There is someone I wish very much to honor. What should I do for this man?”
ESG.6.6	Haman thought to himself, “Now who could the king want to honor so much? Me, of course.”
ESG.6.7+ESG.6.8	So he answered the king, “Let the royal servants bring a fine linen robe for this man—one that you yourself wear. And let them bring a horse that you yourself ride. 
ESG.6.9	Then put that robe on the man you like so much and then have the nobleman lead him, mounted on the horse, through the city square. Have the nobleman announce as they go: ‘See how the king rewards a man whom he wishes to honor!’”
ESG.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Fine! Do all that for Mordecai the Jew, who holds a high position in the palace; don't leave out a thing.”
ESG.6.11	So Haman got the robe and the horse, and he put the robe on Mordecai. Mordecai got on the horse, and Haman led him through the city square, announcing to the people as they went: “See how the king rewards a man whom he wishes to honor!”
ESG.6.12	Mordecai then went back to the courtyard while Haman hurried home, covering his face in embarrassment. 
ESG.6.13	He told his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then they all said to him, “You are beginning to lose power to Mordecai. He is a Jew, and you cannot overcome him. He will certainly defeat you, for the living God is with him!”
ESG.6.14	While they were still talking, the palace eunuchs arrived to take Haman to Esther's banquet.
ESG.7.1	And so the king and Haman went to eat with Esther 
ESG.7.2	for a second time. Over the wine the king asked her again, “Now, Queen Esther, what do you want? Tell me and you shall have it. I'll even give you half the empire.”
ESG.7.3	Queen Esther answered, “If it please Your Majesty to grant my humble request, my wish is that I may live and that my people may live. 
ESG.7.4	My people and I have been sold into slavery; our possessions have been plundered, and now we are to be destroyed—all of us, including our children, will be slaves—and so far I have kept quiet. It isn't right that our enemy should be a member of the royal court.”
ESG.7.5	Then King Xerxes asked Esther, “Who dares to do such a thing?”
ESG.7.6	Esther answered, “Our enemy is this evil man Haman!”
ESG.7.6	In terror Haman faced the king and queen. 
ESG.7.7	The king got up from the table and went outside to the palace gardens. Haman could see that he was in a dangerous situation, so he stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 
ESG.7.8	He had just thrown himself down on Esther's couch to beg for mercy, when the king came back into the room from the gardens. Seeing this, the king cried out, “Are you going to rape my wife here in my own palace?”
ESG.7.8	When Haman heard this, he turned away in despair. 
ESG.7.9	Then one of the eunuchs, whose name was Bougathan, said, “Haman has even gone so far as to build a gallows at his house so that he can hang Mordecai, who warned Your Majesty about the plot. And it's seventy-five feet high!”
ESG.7.9	“Hang Haman on it!” the king commanded.
ESG.7.10	So Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had built for Mordecai. Then the king's anger cooled down.
ESG.8.1	That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther all the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was related to her, and Mordecai was invited to enter the king's presence. 
ESG.8.2	The king took off his ring with his seal on it (which he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
ESG.8.3	Then Esther spoke to the king again, throwing herself at his feet. She begged him to do something to stop the evil plot that Haman had made against the Jews. 
ESG.8.4	The king held out the gold scepter to her, so she stood up 
ESG.8.5	and said, “If it please Your Majesty and if you care about me, please issue a proclamation to keep Haman's orders from being carried out—those orders he gave for the destruction of all the Jews in the empire. 
ESG.8.6	How can I endure it if this disaster comes on my people? How can I go on living if my whole nation is destroyed?”
ESG.8.7	Then the king said to Esther, “I have hanged Haman for his plot against the Jews, and I have given you his property. If that is not enough, 
ESG.8.8	 you may write to the Jews whatever you like; and you may write it in my name and stamp it with the royal seal, for a proclamation issued in the king's name and stamped with the royal seal cannot be revoked.”
ESG.8.9	On the twenty-third day of the first month, the month of Nisan, the king's secretaries were called and letters were written to the Jews and to the governors and administrators of all 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia.
ESG.8.10	They were written in the name of the king and stamped with the royal seal and they were delivered by runners.
ESG.8.11	These letters explained that the king would allow the Jews in every city of the empire to live by their own laws and organize for self-defense. They were permitted to treat their opponents and enemies in any way they liked. 
ESG.8.12	This decree was to take effect throughout the Persian Empire on the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month.
ESG.8_1.13	 This is a copy of the decree:
ESG.8_1.13	“Greetings from King Xerxes the Great to the governors of the 127 provinces, which extend from India to Ethiopia,
ESG.8_1.14	 “Many people become increasingly arrogant when honors are given to them and favors are done for them. 
ESG.8_1.15	 They do not know what to do with so much good fortune, so they not only try to harm our subjects, but they even scheme against those who grant them favors. 
ESG.8_1.16	 They are never grateful for what people do for them, and they even think they can escape the judgment of God, who hates evil and sees everything. In their arrogance they listen to the flattery of ignorant, sinful people.
ESG.8_1.17	 “It often happens also that friends who have been entrusted with administrative responsibilities exert pressure on those in authority. They make their leaders their partners in killing people and bring about misfortunes that can never be remedied. 
ESG.8_1.18	 These friends, by their lies and deceitful ways, take advantage of the good will of their rulers.
ESG.8_1.19	 “You can see examples of this misuse of power not only in the stories that have been handed down to us from the past, but in the more recent outrageous things which have happened among you.
ESG.8_1.20	 “I intend to make sure that in the future my kingdom will remain untroubled and peaceful for all people. 
ESG.8_1.21	 This can be done by changing certain policies and by judging fairly each situation that comes to my attention.
ESG.8_1.22	 “Consider, for example, the case of Haman son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian. He is a foreigner with no Persian blood and with no trace of my generosity; but I welcomed him, 
ESG.8_1.23	 and he received the benefit of my concern and love for all people. He was, in fact, proclaimed ‘Father’ of the empire and received more honor than anyone else, except the king.
ESG.8_1.24	 “But his arrogance knew no limits, and he tried to murder me and take over the empire. 
ESG.8_1.25	 In his crafty and deceitful way, he asked that Mordecai be put to death—Mordecai, who once saved my life and who has always supported me. He even asked for the death of Esther, our blameless queen, and in fact, the death of all the Jewish people. 
ESG.8_1.26	 His purpose was to leave us helpless and to allow the Macedonians to take over the Persian Empire. 
ESG.8_1.27	 Even though this wicked criminal plotted to wipe out the Jews, I find that they are not traitors at all but are governed by very just laws. 
ESG.8_1.28	 They worship the living God, the highest and greatest God, who has kept our empire in its excellent condition from the time of our ancestors until our own day.
ESG.8_1.29	 “Therefore I advise you not to carry out the instructions issued in the letters sent out by Haman. 
ESG.8_1.30	 He is the person responsible for all of this, and he has been hanged, along with his entire family, at the gates of Susa. God, who governs all things, has given him the speedy punishment that he deserved.
ESG.8_1.31	 “I order you to post copies of this decree in every public place. Permit the Jews to live by their own customs, 
ESG.8_1.32	 and give them support when they defend themselves against those who attack them on the day set for their destruction, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. 
ESG.8_1.33	 God, who governs all things, has turned that day of destruction into a day of celebration for his chosen people.
ESG.8_1.34	 “Include this day among your national holidays and celebrate it as a festival. 
ESG.8_1.35	 Now and in the future it will remind us and all our allies of the way God watches over our nation, and those who plot against us will be reminded of God's threat of destruction.
ESG.8_1.36	 “Every province, every city, without exception, which does not obey these orders will feel my anger. It will be destroyed in battle and burned to the ground. No human being will ever go there again, and even the birds and wild animals will avoid it forever.
ESG.8_2.37	 “Post copies of this decree in plain view in every province, so that all the Jews can be ready to fight their enemies when that day comes.”
ESG.8_2.38	 Messengers on horses rode off at top speed to carry out the orders of the king, and the decree was also made public in Susa.
ESG.8_2.39	 Mordecai left the palace, wearing royal robes, a turban of fine purple linen, and a gold crown. When the people of Susa saw him, they cheered, 
ESG.8_2.40	 and the Jews were happy and joyful. 
ESG.8_2.41	 They held a joyful holiday with feasting and happiness in every city and province, wherever the king's proclamation was posted. In fact, many Gentiles were circumcised and became Jews, because they were now afraid of them.
ESG.9.1	 On the thirteenth day of Adar, the day on which the royal proclamation was to take effect, 
ESG.9.2	it was the enemies of the Jews who were wiped out. People everywhere were afraid of the Jews, and no one could stand against them. 
ESG.9.3	In fact, the provincial governors, the administrators, and the royal scribes showed respect for the Jews, because they were all afraid of Mordecai. 
ESG.9.4+ESG.9.5	The royal decree had made his name known throughout the empire.
ESG.9.6	In Susa, the capital city itself, the Jews killed five hundred people 
ESG.9.7+ESG.9.8+ESG.9.9+ESG.9.10	and looted their property. Among them were the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, a Bougaean, the enemy of the Jews: Pharsannestain, Delphon, Phasga, Pharadatha, Barea, Sarbacha, Marmasima, Arouphaeus, Arsaeus, and Zabouthaeus.
ESG.9.11	That same day the number of people killed in Susa was reported to the king. 
ESG.9.12	He then said to Esther, “In Susa alone the Jews have killed five hundred people. What must they have done out in the provinces! Tell me what else you want, and you shall have it.”
ESG.9.13	Esther answered, “Let the Jews in Susa do again tomorrow what they were allowed to do today. And have the bodies of Haman's ten sons hung up.” 
ESG.9.14	The king agreed and permitted the Jews to put the bodies of Haman's ten sons on public display. 
ESG.9.15	On the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of Susa got together again and killed three hundred more people in the city. But they did no looting.
ESG.9.16	The Jews in the provinces also organized and defended themselves. They rid themselves of their enemies by killing 15,000 people on the thirteenth day of Adar, but they did no looting. 
ESG.9.17	On the next day, the fourteenth, there was no more killing, and the Jews made it a joyful holiday of rest and feasting. 
ESG.9.18	The Jews of Susa, however, made the fifteenth a holiday, since they had slaughtered their enemies on the thirteenth and fourteenth and did not stop until the fifteenth. 
ESG.9.19	This is why Jews who live in small towns observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday, a time of giving gifts of food to one another, while the Jews in the large cities celebrate the holiday in the same way on the fifteenth.
ESG.9.20	Mordecai had these events written down in a book and sent it to all the Jews, near and far, throughout the Persian Empire, 
ESG.9.21	telling them to observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar as holidays. 
ESG.9.22	These were the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies. The Jews were to observe the whole month as a holiday, for this was a month that had been turned from a time of grief and despair into a time of joy and happiness. They were told to observe these days with feasts and parties, giving gifts of food to friends and to the poor. 
ESG.9.23	So the Jews accepted all that Mordecai had written.
ESG.9.25	and how he had gone to the king to request that Mordecai be hanged. But Haman suffered the same fate he had planned for the Jews—he and his sons were hanged from the gallows. 
ESG.9.26+ESG.9.27+ESG.9.28	Because of Mordecai's letter, because of all they had suffered, and because of all that had happened to them, the Jews accepted Mordecai's suggestion and made it a rule for themselves, their descendants, and anyone that might become a Jew, that these days should be properly observed as a memorial, generation after generation, in every city, province, and country. The Jews were to remember and observe these days of Purim for all time to come and never neglect them. (The holidays are called Purim because “purim” in their language is the word for “lots.”)
ESG.9.29+ESG.9.30	Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote down what they had done, putting the queen's full authority behind the letter about Purim. 
ESG.9.31	They both took responsibility for establishing the festival and made up their minds to observe it at all costs.
ESG.9.32	Esther established the festival forever, and a written record was made of her official decree.
ESG.10.1	King Xerxes imposed taxes on the people of the coastal regions of his empire as well as on those of the interior. 
ESG.10.2	His power and virtue, as well as the wealth and splendor of his empire, are recorded in the official records of the kings of Persia and Media. 
ESG.10.3	Mordecai was second in rank only to King Xerxes himself. He was a great man in the empire and was honored by his fellow Jews. He was greatly loved, for he sought the welfare of his people.
ESG.10_1.4	 Then Mordecai said, “God has caused all these things to happen! 
ESG.10_1.5	 And I am reminded of the dream I had about all of this. Every detail of the dream has come true: 
ESG.10_1.6	 the small spring that became a river, the dawn that turned into sunlight, and the abundance of water. The river is Esther, whom the king married and made his queen. 
ESG.10_1.7	 The two dragons represent Haman and me. 
ESG.10_1.8	 The nations are all those who have gathered together to destroy the Jews. 
ESG.10_1.9	 My nation is Israel, which cried out to God for help and was saved. The Lord saved his people! He rescued us from all these evils and performed great miracles and wonders that have never happened among other nations. 
ESG.10_1.10	 That is because God prepared one destiny for his own people and another for all other nations. 
ESG.10_1.11	 Then came the day and the hour when these two destinies were to be decided; the time had come for God to make a decision about the nations. 
ESG.10_1.12	 God remembered his chosen people and gave the verdict in their favor. 
ESG.10_1.13	 So each year for all time to come God's people will gather together in his presence on the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month of Adar, and celebrate with joy and happiness.”
ESG.10_1.14	 During the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, a man named Dositheus, who claimed to be a levitical priest, brought the preceding letter about the Purim festival. He was accompanied by his son Ptolemy, and they declared that the letter was genuine and that it had been translated by Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, a member of a Jerusalem family.
WIS.1.2	Those who do not try to test him will find him; he will show himself to those who trust him. 
WIS.1.3	Dishonest thoughts separate people from God, and if we are foolish enough to test him, his power will put us to shame. 
WIS.1.4	Wisdom will never be at home with anyone who is deceitful or a slave of sin. 
WIS.1.5	Everyone who is holy has learned to stay away from deceitful people. He will not stay around when foolish thoughts are being expressed; he will not feel comfortable when injustice is done.
WIS.1.6	Wisdom is a spirit that is friendly to people, but she will not forgive anyone who speaks against God, for God knows our feelings and thoughts, and hears our every word. 
WIS.1.7	Since the Lord's spirit fills the entire world, and holds everything in it together, she knows every word that people say. 
WIS.1.8	No one who speaks wickedly will escape notice; sooner or later he will receive just punishment. 
WIS.1.9	The intentions of ungodly people will be closely examined; their words will be reported to the Lord, and then they will get the punishment that their wickedness deserves. 
WIS.1.10	God will tolerate no challenge, and since he hears everything, you cannot hide your complaining from him. 
WIS.1.11	So be sure that you do not go around complaining—it does no good—and don't engage in bitter talk. The most secret things you say will have their consequences, and lying will destroy your soul.
WIS.1.12	Do not bring on your own death by sinful actions. 
WIS.1.13	 God did not invent death, and when living creatures die, it gives him no pleasure. 
WIS.1.14	He created everything so that it might continue to exist, and everything he created is wholesome and good. There is no deadly poison in them. No, death does not rule this world, 
WIS.1.15	for God's justice does not die.
WIS.2.1	Wicked people are wrong when they say to themselves, “Our life is short and full of sorrow, and when its end comes, there is no escape. No one has ever been known to come back from the world of the dead. 
WIS.2.2	We were born by chance, and after life is over, we will be as if we had never been born at all. Our breath is no more than a puff of smoke; our mind is nothing more than a spark thrown off by the beating of our heart. 
WIS.2.3	When that spark dies, our body will crumble into ashes, and our breath will become part of the empty air. 
WIS.2.4	In time, no one will remember anything we ever did, and even our names will be forgotten. Our lives will pass away like the traces of clouds and vanish like fog in the heat of the sun. 
WIS.2.5	Our time on earth is like a passing shadow. There is no escape from the day of our death; it is fixed, and no one can postpone it.”
WIS.2.7	Let's drink the most expensive wines and use the finest perfumes. Let's not miss a single flower in the springtime! 
WIS.2.8	Before the roses wither, let's pick them and wear them in our hair! 
WIS.2.9	Let's all join in and leave signs everywhere of our carefree revelry! Life owes us that much!
WIS.2.10	“We'll oppress the poor, even if they are righteous. We'll show no respect for widows or old people. 
WIS.2.11	We'll call ourselves right if we are strong enough to get what we want. No one ever got anywhere by being weak! 
WIS.2.12	Righteous people are nothing but a nuisance, so let's look for chances to get rid of them. They are against what we do; they accuse us of breaking the Law of Moses and violating the traditions of our ancestors. 
WIS.2.13	They claim to know God, and they call themselves the Lord's children. 
WIS.2.14	We can't stand the sight of people like that; what they are contradicts our whole way of thinking. 
WIS.2.15	They are not like other people; they have strange ways. 
WIS.2.16	They think that our moral standards are so corrupt that everything we do should be avoided. They boast of having God for their Father, and believe that when all is said and done, only the righteous will be happy. 
WIS.2.17	But we'll see if that's true! Let's see what will happen when it's time for them to die! 
WIS.2.18	If the righteous really are God's children, God will save them from their enemies. 
WIS.2.19	So let's put them to the test. We'll be cruel to them, and torment them; then we'll find out how calm and reasonable they are! We'll find out just how much they can stand! 
WIS.2.20	We'll condemn them to a shameful death. After all, they say that God will protect them.”
WIS.2.21	That is how evil people think, but they are wrong. They are blinded by their own wickedness. 
WIS.2.22	They have never known God's secrets, never hoped for the rewards of a holy and blameless life. 
WIS.2.23	 When God created us, he did not intend for us to die; he made us like himself. 
WIS.2.24	It was the Devil's jealousy that brought death into the world, and those who belong to the Devil are the ones who will die.
WIS.3.1	But righteous people are protected by God and will never suffer torment. 
WIS.3.2	 It is a foolish mistake to think that righteous people die and that their death is a terrible evil. 
WIS.3.3	They leave us, but it is not a disaster. In fact, the righteous are at peace. 
WIS.3.4	It might appear that they have suffered punishment, but they have the confident hope of immortality. 
WIS.3.5+WIS.3.6	 Their sufferings were minor compared with the blessings they will receive. God has tested them, like gold in a furnace, and found them worthy to be with him. He has accepted them, just as he accepts the sacrifices which his worshipers burn on the altar.
WIS.3.7	When God comes to reward the righteous, they will blaze out against the wicked like fire in dry straw. 
WIS.3.8	They will rule over nations and peoples, and the Lord will be their king forever. 
WIS.3.9	Those who have put their trust in God will come to understand the truth of his ways. Those who have been faithful will live with him in his love, for he is kind and merciful to the ones whom he has chosen.
WIS.3.10	The ungodly, however, will get the punishment their wicked thoughts deserve, because they rebelled against the Lord and ignored what was right.
WIS.3.11	A man who has no use for wisdom or education has a miserable life in store for him. He has nothing to hope for. His labors are useless, and he will never accomplish anything worthwhile. 
WIS.3.12	The woman he marries will turn out to be irresponsible, and his children will go wrong. 
WIS.3.13	All his descendants will be under a curse.
WIS.3.13	On Judgment Day God will reward the woman who has never been able to have a child, provided she has not been guilty of adultery. Then she will be happy. 
WIS.3.14	On that day, even the man who has been castrated will be rewarded with happiness, if he has kept the Law and has not stored up resentment against the Lord. Because he has been faithful, he will receive a special reward more precious than having children: a place in the Lord's heavenly Temple. 
WIS.3.15	Honest deeds are like a tree that bears marvelous fruit. Wisdom is like a root that is alive and can always send up new shoots.
WIS.3.16	But children born of adultery or of a forbidden union will die an early death. 
WIS.3.17	Yet even if they do live a long time, they will never amount to anything. They will not be respected in their old age, 
WIS.3.18	and if they die young, they will have no hope or comfort on Judgment Day. 
WIS.3.19	Children born of a forbidden union suffer a miserable fate.
WIS.4.2	Virtue provides an example for people to follow; when it is not there, they miss it. It has always been the finest prize a person can win, and it always will be so. It is the noblest of all the good qualities a person can have.
WIS.4.3	No matter how many children are born of a forbidden union, none of them will ever amount to anything. They are illegitimate; they can never lay a firm foundation for themselves, never take deep root. 
WIS.4.4	Like trees with shallow roots, they put out leaves for a while, but they sway in the wind, and storms uproot them. 
WIS.4.5	Their branches snap off before they mature; their fruit never ripens, and it is good for nothing. 
WIS.4.6	On Judgment Day children born of a forbidden union will testify to the sin of their parents and act as witnesses against them.
WIS.4.7	Righteous people, however, will find rest, even if they die young. 
WIS.4.8	We honor old age, but not just because a person has lived a long time. 
WIS.4.9	Wisdom and righteousness are signs of the maturity that should come with old age.
WIS.4.11	so that evil and falsehood could not corrupt his mind and soul. ( 
WIS.4.12	We all know that people can be so fascinated by evil that they cannot recognize what is good even when they are looking right at it. Innocent people can be so corrupted with desire that they can think of nothing but what they want.) 
WIS.4.13	This man Enoch achieved in a few years' time a perfection that other people could never attain in a complete lifetime. 
WIS.4.14	The Lord was pleased with Enoch's life and quickly took him out of this wicked world. People were aware of his departure but didn't understand. They never seemed to learn the lesson 
WIS.4.15	that God is kind and merciful to his own people; he protects those whom he has chosen.
WIS.4.16	Even when righteous people are dead and gone, they put to shame the wicked people who live on after them. In their old age the wicked will be disgraced by young people who have already achieved perfection. 
WIS.4.17	The wise may die young, but the wicked will never understand that this is the Lord's way of taking them off to safety. 
WIS.4.18	They make light of a wise person's death, but the Lord will soon be laughing at them. When they die, they will not be given an honorable burial. Even the dead will hold them in scorn and disgust forever. 
WIS.4.19	God will throw them to the ground and make them speechless. Like buildings shaken from their foundations, they will be reduced to piles of ruins. They will be in torment. People will soon forget all about them. 
WIS.4.20	They will come in fear to the Judgment, where their sins will be counted; they will stand condemned by their own lawless actions.
WIS.5.1	On that day someone righteous, full of confidence, will stand before those who oppressed him and made light of his labors. 
WIS.5.2	They will be amazed to see him safe and will tremble with terrible fear. 
WIS.5.3	Then they will regret what they did, and groaning in anguish they will say to each other: 
WIS.5.4	“This is the one we made fun of. We thought he was a joke. What fools we were! We thought he was crazy to live the way he did, and when he died, we didn't honor him. 
WIS.5.5	And now here he is, one of God's own children, with a place of his own among God's people. 
WIS.5.6	We were the ones who wandered off the right road. We never lived in the light of righteousness; we never caught the first glimmer of its light. 
WIS.5.7	All our lives we wandered across unmarked deserts, instead of following the road which the Lord wanted us to travel. And this lawlessness led us to ruin. 
WIS.5.8	We were so proud of ourselves—we bragged about how rich we were—and now, what good has it done us? 
WIS.5.9	All those things are gone now; they have disappeared like a shadow, like something you hear and then forget.
WIS.5.10	“A ship sails across the waves of the ocean, but when it is gone, it leaves no trace. You cannot tell it was ever there. 
WIS.5.11	A bird flies through the air, but leaves no sign that it has been there. It speeds along, riding through the thin air by the force of its wings, leaving behind no trace of its passing. 
WIS.5.12	An arrow splits the air when it is shot at a target, but at once the air closes up behind it, and no one can tell where it passed. 
WIS.5.13	It is the same with us—we were born, and then we ceased to be. We left no sign of virtue behind us; we were destroyed by our wickedness.”
WIS.5.14	What hope do wicked people have? Only the hope of straw blown about in the wind, the hope of ocean foam
WIS.5.15	But the righteous live on forever. The Lord will reward them; the Most High will protect them. 
WIS.5.16	He will give them royal splendor and a magnificent crown. He will shield them with his powerful arm. 
WIS.5.17	 He will go out into battle determined to defeat his enemies, and use the creation itself as a weapon. 
WIS.5.18	Righteousness will be his armor, genuine justice will be his helmet, 
WIS.5.19	holiness will be his invincible shield. 
WIS.5.20	He will sharpen his stern anger into a sword, and the forces of nature will join him in battle against those who are foolish enough to oppose him. 
WIS.5.21	Bolts of lightning will strike right on target, as if the Lord had made a bow out of the clouds and was shooting arrows. 
WIS.5.22	Hailstones will beat down on his enemies with terrible force. The oceans and rivers will come rushing over them in a devastating flood. 
WIS.5.23	Great windstorms will blow them away like straw. Lawlessness will be the ruin of the whole world. Evil actions will cause governments to fall.
WIS.6.1	So then, you kings, you rulers the world over, listen to what I say, and learn from it. 
WIS.6.2	You govern many lands and are proud that so many people are under your rule, 
WIS.6.3	 but this authority has been given to you by the Lord Most High. He will examine what you have done and what you plan to do. 
WIS.6.4	You rule on behalf of God and his kingdom, and if you do not govern justly, if you do not uphold the law, if you do not live according to God's will, 
WIS.6.5	you will suffer sudden and terrible punishment. Judgment is especially severe on those in power. 
WIS.6.6	Common people may be mercifully forgiven for their wrongs, but those in power will face a severe judgment. 
WIS.6.7	The Lord of all is not afraid of anyone, no matter how great they are. He himself made everyone, great and common alike, and he provides for all equally, 
WIS.6.8	but he will judge the conduct of rulers more strictly. 
WIS.6.9	It is for you, mighty kings, that I write these words, so that you may know how to act wisely and avoid mistakes. 
WIS.6.10	These are holy matters, and if you treat them in a holy manner, you yourselves will be considered holy. If you have learned this lesson, you will be able to defend yourselves at the Judgment. 
WIS.6.11	So then, make my teaching your treasure and joy, and you will be well instructed.
WIS.6.12	Wisdom shines bright and never grows dim; those who love her and look for her can easily find her. 
WIS.6.13	She is quick to make herself known to anyone who desires her. 
WIS.6.14	Get up early in the morning to find her, and you will have no problem; you will find her sitting at your door. 
WIS.6.15	To fasten your attention on Wisdom is to gain perfect understanding. If you look for her, you will soon find peace of mind, 
WIS.6.16	because she will be looking for those who are worthy of her, and she will find you wherever you are. She is kind and will be with you in your every thought.
WIS.6.17	Wisdom begins when you sincerely want to learn. To desire Wisdom is to love her; 
WIS.6.18	to love her is to keep her laws; to keep her laws is to be certain of immortality; 
WIS.6.19	immortality will bring you close to God. 
WIS.6.20	This desire for Wisdom can prepare you to rule a kingdom. 
WIS.6.21	So then, you that rule the nations, if you value your thrones and symbols of authority, honor Wisdom so that you may rule forever.
WIS.6.22	I will tell you what Wisdom is, and how she came to be. I will not keep anything secret. I will trace her history from the beginning and make knowledge of her open to all. I will not ignore any part of the truth. 
WIS.6.23	No jealous desire to guard my own knowledge will make me hold back anything. Wisdom has nothing in common with such an attitude. 
WIS.6.24	No indeed—the more wise people there are, the safer the world will be. A sensible king can be depended on to give his people this kind of security. 
WIS.6.25	So then, learn what I am about to teach you, and you will profit from it.
WIS.7.1+WIS.7.2	Like every human being, I am mortal. I am a descendant of that first man, who was made from the soil. I was conceived from the sperm of a man, in the pleasure of intercourse. For nine months my flesh took shape in the blood of my mother's womb. 
WIS.7.3	When I was born, I came into the world like anyone else. I began to breathe the same air we all breathe; and like everyone else, the first sound I made was a cry. 
WIS.7.4	I was wrapped in cloths and cared for. 
WIS.7.5	No king ever began life differently. 
WIS.7.6	For all of us, there is one way into life, and there is one way out.
WIS.7.8	I regarded her more highly than any throne or crown. Wealth was nothing compared to her. 
WIS.7.9	Precious jewels could not equal her worth; beside Wisdom all the gold in the world is a handful of sand, and silver is nothing more than clay. 
WIS.7.10	I valued her more than health and good looks. Hers is a brightness that never grows dim, and I preferred it to any other light.
WIS.7.11	When Wisdom came to me, all good things came with her. She brought me untold riches. 
WIS.7.12	I was happy with them all, because Wisdom had brought them to me. I had not realized before that she was the source of all these things. 
WIS.7.13	I was sincere in learning from her, and now I am glad to share what I learned. 
WIS.7.14	No one can ever exhaust the treasures of Wisdom. Use those treasures and you are God's friends; he approves of what you learn from her.
WIS.7.15	I pray to God that my thoughts may be worthy of what I have learned, and that I may speak according to his will. He is Wisdom's guide; he gives correction to those who are wise. 
WIS.7.16	We are under his power and authority—we ourselves, our words, all our understanding and skills. 
WIS.7.17	It is he who gave me true knowledge of the forces of nature: what the world is made of; how the elements behave; 
WIS.7.18	how the calendar is determined by the movements of the sun, the changing seasons, 
WIS.7.19	the constellations, and the cycles of years. 
WIS.7.20	He has taught me about the nature of living creatures, the behavior of wild animals, the force of the winds, the reasoning powers of human beings, the different kinds of plants, and the use of their roots as medicine. 
WIS.7.21	I learned things that were well known and things that had never been known before, 
WIS.7.22	because Wisdom, who gave shape to everything that exists, was my teacher.
WIS.7.22	The spirit of Wisdom is intelligent and holy. It is of one nature but reveals itself in many ways. It is not made of any material substance, and it moves about freely. It is clear, clean, and confident; it cannot be harmed.
WIS.7.23	kind, and a friend of humanity. It is dependable and sure, and has no worries. It has power over everything, and sees everything. It penetrates every spirit that is intelligent and pure, no matter how delicate its substance may be.
WIS.7.24	Wisdom moves more easily than motion itself; she is so pure that she penetrates everything. 
WIS.7.25	She is a breath of God's power—a pure and radiant stream of glory from the Almighty. Nothing that is defiled can ever steal its way into Wisdom. 
WIS.7.26	She is a reflection of eternal light, a perfect mirror of God's activity and goodness. 
WIS.7.27	Even though Wisdom acts alone, she can do anything. She makes everything new, although she herself never changes. From generation to generation she enters the souls of holy people, and makes them God's friends and prophets. 
WIS.7.28	There is nothing that God loves more than people who are at home with Wisdom. 
WIS.7.29	Wisdom is more beautiful than the sun and all the constellations. She is better than light itself, 
WIS.7.30	because night always follows day, but evil never overcomes Wisdom.
WIS.8.1	Her great power reaches into every part of the world, and she sets everything in useful order.
WIS.8.3	She glorifies her noble origin by living with God, the Lord of all, who loves her. 
WIS.8.4	 She is familiar with God's mysteries and helps determine his course of action.
WIS.8.5	Is it good to have riches in this life? Nothing can make you richer than Wisdom, who makes everything function. 
WIS.8.6	Is knowledge a useful thing to have? Nothing is better than Wisdom, who has given shape to everything that exists. 
WIS.8.7	Do you love justice? All the virtues are the result of Wisdom's work: justice and courage, self-control and understanding. Life can offer us nothing more valuable than these. 
WIS.8.8	Do you want to have wide experience? Wisdom knows the lessons of history and can anticipate the future. She knows how to interpret what people say and how to solve problems. She knows the miracles that God will perform, and how the movements of history will develop.
WIS.8.9	So I decided to take Wisdom home to live with me, because I knew that she would give me good advice and encourage me in times of trouble and grief. 
WIS.8.10	I thought to myself, “Because of her I will be honored wherever people come together. The old men will respect me, even though I am young. 
WIS.8.11	They will find that my opinions show deep insight, and those in power will admire me. 
WIS.8.12	When I am silent, they will wait for me to speak, and when I speak, they will pay attention. Even when I speak at length, they will listen with concentration. 
WIS.8.13	Because of Wisdom I will gain immortality; I will live forever in the memory of those who come after me. 
WIS.8.14	I will hold power over nations and peoples; 
WIS.8.15	dreaded tyrants will be seized with fear at the mention of my name. I will be famous, as a good king and as a brave soldier. 
WIS.8.16	When I come home to Wisdom, I will find contentment because there is no conflict or pain in living with her, only happiness and joy.”
WIS.8.17	And so I thought it over: to be wedded to Wisdom is to live forever, 
WIS.8.18	to love her is to be perfectly happy, to do her work is to be rich beyond measure, to share her company is to have sound judgment, to converse with her is to be honored. Then I was determined to take Wisdom as my bride. 
WIS.8.19+WIS.8.20	I had a pleasant personality even as a child. I had been fortunate enough to receive a good soul, or rather, I was given a sound body to live in because I was already good. 
WIS.8.21	Still, I realized that I would never receive Wisdom unless God gave her to me—and knowing that only God could give her to me was itself a sign of understanding. So I prayed, begging the Lord with all my heart:
WIS.9.2	By your Wisdom you made us humans to rule all creation, 
WIS.9.3	to govern the world with holiness and righteousness, to administer justice with integrity. 
WIS.9.4	Give me the Wisdom that sits beside your throne; give me a place among your children. 
WIS.9.5	I am your slave, as was my mother before me. I am only human. I am not strong, and my life will be short. I have little understanding of the Law or of how to apply it. 
WIS.9.6	Even if someone is perfect, he will be thought of as nothing without the Wisdom that comes from you. 
WIS.9.7	You chose me over everyone else to be the king of your own people, to judge your sons and daughters. 
WIS.9.8	You told me to build a temple on your sacred mountain, an altar in Jerusalem, the city you chose as your home. It is a copy of that temple in heaven, which you prepared at the beginning. 
WIS.9.9	Wisdom is with you and knows your actions; she was present when you made the world. She knows what pleases you, what is right and in accordance with your commands. 
WIS.9.10	Send her from the holy heavens, down from your glorious throne, so that she may work at my side, and I may learn what pleases you. 
WIS.9.11	She knows and understands everything, and will guide me intelligently in what I do. Her glory will protect me. 
WIS.9.12	Then I will judge your people fairly, and be worthy of my father's throne. My actions will be acceptable.
WIS.9.13	“Who can ever learn the will of God? 
WIS.9.14	Human reason is not adequate for the task, and our philosophies tend to mislead us, 
WIS.9.15	because our mortal bodies weigh our souls down. The body is a temporary structure made of earth, a burden to the active mind. 
WIS.9.16	All we can do is make guesses about things on earth; we must struggle to learn about things that are close to us. Who, then, can ever hope to understand heavenly things? 
WIS.9.17	No one has ever learned your will, unless you first gave him Wisdom, and sent your holy spirit down to him. 
WIS.9.18	In this way people on earth have been set on the right path, have learned what pleases you, and have been kept safe by Wisdom.”
WIS.10.2	and gave him the strength to master everything on earth.
WIS.10.7	You can still see the evidence of their wickedness. The land there is barren and smoking. The plants bear fruit that never ripens, and a pillar of salt stands as a monument to one who did not believe. 
WIS.10.8	The people of those cities ignored Wisdom and could not tell right from wrong. Not only that, but the remains of their cities still remind us of the foolish way they lived, so that their failure can never be forgotten. 
WIS.10.9	But Wisdom rescued her servants from the danger.
WIS.10.11	When others were greedy for what he had, and wanted to take it away from him, Wisdom stood by him and made him rich. 
WIS.10.12	She protected him from his enemies who were waiting for a chance to attack him. She gave him victory in a hard fight, so that he might realize that nothing can make a person stronger than serving God.
WIS.10.14	and never left him until she had given him power over an empire and made him the ruler of people who had once oppressed him. She let it be known that a false accusation had been made against him, and she gave him eternal honor.
WIS.10.16	She entered the soul of one of God's servants and
WIS.10.17	She rewarded God's people for their hardships. She guided them along a miraculous journey. She gave them shade during the day and brilliant starlight at night. 
WIS.10.18	She led them through the deep waters of the Red Sea, 
WIS.10.19	but she drowned their enemies and washed their bodies up on the shore. 
WIS.10.20	And so the righteous looted the ungodly. They sang hymns to your holy name, O Lord; together they praised you for defending them. 
WIS.10.21	Wisdom gave speech to those who could not speak; she even caused babies to speak clearly.
WIS.11.2	They traveled across a desert where no one lived and camped in places where no human being had ever been. 
WIS.11.3	They stood up to their enemies and fought them off. 
WIS.11.4	When your people grew thirsty, they called to you, Lord, and you gave them water flowing out of solid rock. 
WIS.11.5	The disasters that punished the Egyptians saved your people when they were in trouble.
WIS.11.6+WIS.11.7+WIS.11.8	Because those enemies decreed that the babies of your people should be killed, you stirred up the sources of their everflowing river and made it foul with blood.
WIS.11.6+WIS.11.7+WIS.11.8	In the desert you let your people go thirsty, to give them a taste of how you had punished their enemies. And then, when they least expected it, you gave them plenty of water. 
WIS.11.9	When they were being tested, even though it was a merciful discipline, they learned how wicked people were tortured when you judged them in anger. 
WIS.11.10	You tested your people, as parents test their children, to warn them. But you judged their enemies like a stern king and condemned them. 
WIS.11.11	They suffered, whether they were near your people or far from them. 
WIS.11.12	Their sorrow was doubled; they groaned as they looked back on what had happened. 
WIS.11.13	When they learned that their punishment had been of benefit to your people, they realized that it was your work, Lord. 
WIS.11.14	The Egyptians had refused to have anything to do with that man who, long before as a baby, had been thrown out and exposed; but as things worked out, they came to be amazed at him. The righteous never suffered a thirst like theirs.
WIS.11.16	and taught them that punishment for sin takes the same form as the sin itself. 
WIS.11.17	Your almighty power, Lord, created the world out of material that had no form at all. You could easily have punished those people by sending an invasion of bears or savage lions. 
WIS.11.18	You could have created new and terrible animals, that could breathe fire or roar and send out clouds of smoke, or shoot out fearful sparks from their eyes. 
WIS.11.19	You could have made animals like these that would not have to attack those people to kill them, but could scare them to death just by looking at them. 
WIS.11.20	But this was not necessary. You could have pursued them with your justice or struck them dead at the slightest hint of your power. But you have chosen to measure, count, and weigh everything you do.
WIS.11.21	You can show your great power any time you wish, and no one can stand up against it. 
WIS.11.22	In your sight the whole world is a grain of sand, barely heavy enough to tip a pair of scales, a drop of dew on the ground in the morning. 
WIS.11.23	You are powerful enough to do anything, but you are merciful to everyone; you overlook our sins and give us time to repent. 
WIS.11.24	You love everything that exists; you do not despise anything that you have made. If you had not liked it, you would not have made it in the first place. 
WIS.11.25	How could anything last, if you did not want it to? How could it endure, if you had not created it? 
WIS.11.26	You have allowed it all to exist, O Lord, because it is yours, and you love every living thing.
WIS.12.1	Your immortal spirit is in every one of them, 
WIS.12.2	and so you gently correct those who sin against you. You remind them of what they are doing, and warn them about it, so that they may abandon their evil ways and put their trust in you, Lord.
WIS.12.5	they killed children without mercy and ate the flesh and blood of human beings. They were initiated into secret rituals
WIS.12.6	in which parents murdered their own defenseless children. It was your will for our ancestors to destroy these people, 
WIS.12.7	so that the land which you consider the most precious of all lands would be a suitable home for your people. 
WIS.12.8	 But even in this you showed mercy toward their enemies, since they were only human beings. You sent hornets ahead of your army, to destroy the enemy gradually. 
WIS.12.9	You could have allowed the righteous to destroy those ungodly people in battle; you could have wiped them out immediately with wild animals or with one harsh command. 
WIS.12.10	 But instead, you carried out your sentence gradually, to give them a chance to repent, even though you knew that they came from evil stock, that they had been wicked since birth, and that they would never change their way of thinking. 
WIS.12.11	Their whole nation was cursed from the start, and though you had not punished them for their sins, it was not because you were afraid of anyone.
WIS.12.12	You created those wicked people, and no one can speak in their defense or condemn you for destroying them. No one can question what you have done or challenge your judgment. 
WIS.12.13	All things are under your care, and there is no other god to whom you must justify your decisions. 
WIS.12.14	No king or ruler on earth can accuse you of punishing those people unfairly. 
WIS.12.15	You are righteous, and you rule everything righteously. You have never used your power to condemn a person who does not deserve to be punished. 
WIS.12.16	Your strength is the source of justice. You can show mercy to everyone, because you are the Lord of all. 
WIS.12.17	You show your strength when people doubt that your power is perfect, and you punish anyone who knows your power but dares to ignore it. 
WIS.12.18	Even though you have absolute power, you are a merciful judge. You could take action against us whenever you like, but instead, you rule us with great patience.
WIS.12.19	By the things you have done you have taught your people that a person who is righteous must also be kind. You have given your people abundant hope by allowing them to repent of their sins. 
WIS.12.20	You were very careful and patient in punishing your people's enemies; even when they deserved to die, you gave them every opportunity to give up their sinful ways. 
WIS.12.21	But you judged your own people very strictly, even though you had made covenants with their ancestors and had solemnly promised to give them good things.
WIS.12.22	Yes, you punish us, but you punish our enemies ten thousand times more, so that when we judge others, we may remember your goodness, and when we are being judged, we may look for mercy.
WIS.12.23	And so you tormented those who were foolish enough to live wickedly—you tormented them with the horrible things they worshiped. 
WIS.12.24	They had wandered far away from the truth and worshiped the most disgusting and horrible animals. They were deceived as easily as little children. 
WIS.12.25	And so you punished them for their stupidity, and your judgment made them look like fools. 
WIS.12.26	It was a light punishment, but those who pay no attention to such warnings deserve to feel the full weight of God's judgment. 
WIS.12.27	When they were punished with those creatures they considered gods, they became bitterly disillusioned and recognized that the true God was the one they had always refused to acknowledge. That is why they suffered the final punishment.
WIS.13.1	Anyone who does not know God is simply foolish. Such people look at the good things around them and still fail to see the living God. They have studied the things he made, but they have not recognized the one who made them. 
WIS.13.2	Instead, they suppose that the gods who rule the world are fire or wind or storm or the circling stars or rushing water or the heavenly bodies. 
WIS.13.3	People were so delighted with the beauty of these things that they thought they must be gods, but they should have realized that these things have a master and that he is much greater than all of them, for he is the creator of beauty, and he created them. 
WIS.13.4	Since people are amazed at the power of these things, and how they behave, they ought to learn from them that their maker is far more powerful. 
WIS.13.5	When we realize how vast and beautiful the creation is, we are learning about the Creator at the same time.
WIS.13.6	But maybe we are too harsh with these people. After all, they may have really wanted to find God, but couldn't. 
WIS.13.7	Surrounded by God's works, they keep on looking at them, until they are finally convinced that because the things they see are so beautiful, they must be gods. 
WIS.13.8	But still, these people really have no excuse. 
WIS.13.9	If they had enough intelligence to speculate about the nature of the universe, why did they never find the Lord of all things?
WIS.13.11	A skilled woodworker may saw down some suitable tree, carefully strip off the bark, and then, with skillful craftsmanship, make from it an object that will serve some useful purpose. 
WIS.13.12	He will take the leftover pieces and use them as firewood to cook a meal that he can sit down to and enjoy. 
WIS.13.13	But among that scrap wood he may take one piece that isn't good for anything—maybe it's crooked and full of knots—and carefully carve it in his leisure time, using spare moments to shape it into the crude image of a person, 
WIS.13.14	or maybe of some worthless animal. He paints it all over with red, covering up every flaw in the work. 
WIS.13.15	Then he prepares a suitable place in the wall for it and fastens it in place with iron nails. 
WIS.13.16	He is careful to keep it from falling, because he knows it is only an idol and needs help; it cannot help itself. 
WIS.13.17	But he is not ashamed to pray to this lifeless thing about his marriage, his children, and his possessions. 
WIS.13.18	It is weak, but he prays to it for health. It is dead, but he prays to it for life. It has no experience, but he prays to it for help. It cannot walk, but he prays to it for a successful journey. 
WIS.13.19	Its hands have no power, but he asks it to help him—in business, in making money, and in his work.
WIS.14.1	In the same way, a man getting ready to sail on the raging sea will call for help from a piece of wood that is not as strong as the ship he is about to board. 
WIS.14.2	Someone designed the ship out of a desire for profit, and a craftsman built it with skill. 
WIS.14.3	But it is your care, O Father, that steers it; you give it a safe path through the waves of the sea. 
WIS.14.4	People may go to sea even if they have no skill, because you can save them from any danger. 
WIS.14.5	It is your will that the things you have made by your wisdom should be put to use. And so people can cross the sea in a boat and come safely to land, because they trust their lives to that small piece of wood.
WIS.14.6	This was how it was in ancient times, when a proud race of giants was dying away. The hope of the world escaped on such a boat under your guidance and left the world a new generation to carry on the human race. 
WIS.14.7	A blessing was on Noah's wooden boat that allowed righteousness to survive, 
WIS.14.8	but a curse is on an idol made by human hands. A curse is also on the one who makes it, because he works on this perishable thing and then calls it a god. 
WIS.14.9	Ungodly people and these ungodly things they make are equally hated by God, 
WIS.14.10	who will punish both the things made and the people who made them. 
WIS.14.11	And so God's judgment will fall on pagan idols, because, even though they are made from something God created, they became horrible things that trap the souls of foolish people.
WIS.14.12	Sexual immorality began when idols were invented. They have corrupted human life ever since they were first made. 
WIS.14.13	Idols have not always existed, nor will they exist forever. 
WIS.14.14	It was human pride that brought them into the world, and that is why a quick end has been planned for them.
WIS.14.15	Once there was a father who was overwhelmed with grief at the untimely death of his child, so he made an image of that child who had been suddenly taken from him. He then honored a dead human being as a god, and handed on secret rituals and ceremonies to those who were under his authority. 
WIS.14.16	As time went on, this ungodly custom became stronger. Finally it became law, and idols were being worshiped at the command of powerful rulers. 
WIS.14.17	When people lived too far away to honor a ruler in his presence but were eager to pay honor to this absent king, they would imagine what he must look like, and would then make a likeness of him. 
WIS.14.18	The ambitious artists who made these likenesses caused this worship to spread, even among people who did not know the king. 
WIS.14.19	An artist might want to please some ruler, and so he would use his skill to make the likeness better looking than the actual person. 
WIS.14.20	Then people would be so attracted by the work of art, that the one whom they had earlier honored now became the object of their worship. 
WIS.14.21	So all this became a deadly trap, because people who were grieving, or under royal authority, would take objects of stone or wood, and give them the honor reserved for the One God.
WIS.14.22	One thing led to another. It was not enough to be wrong about the knowledge of God. They lived in a state of evil warfare, but they were so ignorant that they called it peace. 
WIS.14.23	They murdered children in their initiation rituals, celebrated secret mysteries, and held wild ceremonial orgies with unnatural practices. 
WIS.14.24	They no longer kept their lives or their marriages pure. A man might kill another by an act of treachery or cause him grief by committing adultery with his wife. 
WIS.14.25	Everything was a complete riot of bloody murder, robbery, deceit, corruption, faithlessness, disorder, falsehood, 
WIS.14.26	harassment of innocent people, ingratitude, moral decay, sexual perversion, broken marriages, adultery, and immorality. 
WIS.14.27	The worship of idols, whose names should never be spoken, is the beginning and the end, the cause and the result of every evil. 
WIS.14.28	People who worship them lose control of themselves in ecstasy, or pass off lies as prophecies, or live wickedly, or break their word without hesitation. 
WIS.14.29	They tell lies under oath and expect no punishment, because the idols they put their trust in are lifeless. 
WIS.14.30	But punishment will finally catch up with them, for two reasons: first, they were in error about God when they worshiped idols, and second, they had so little regard for holiness that they made false statements to deceive people. 
WIS.14.31	When unrighteous people commit sin, they will be hunted down, not by the power of whatever thing they swear by, but by the punishment that sinners deserve.
WIS.15.1	But you, our God, are kind and true and patient. You rule the universe with mercy. 
WIS.15.2	Even if we sin, we know your power and are still yours. But because we know that we belong to you, we will not sin. 
WIS.15.3	Knowing you is perfect righteousness. Recognizing your power is where immortality begins. 
WIS.15.4	We have not been misled by any evil product of human skill, by any useless object painted by some artist, or by any idol smeared with different colors. 
WIS.15.5	The sight of such things arouses the passions of foolish people and makes them desire a dead, lifeless image. 
WIS.15.6	Anyone who makes such a thing or desires it or worships it is in love with something evil, and gets what he deserves when he places his hopes in it.
WIS.15.7	A potter works the soft clay and carefully shapes each object for our use. Some things he makes are put to good use, and some are not, but he makes them all from the same clay, and shapes them in the same manner. The potter himself decides which objects shall be used for what purposes. 
WIS.15.8	He is a human being who was himself formed from earth only a short while earlier, and after a little while, when he must return the soul that was lent to him, he will go back to the same earth. He is a human being, but he wastes his labor shaping a useless god out of the same clay that he uses to make pots. 
WIS.15.9	His life will be short, and he will soon have to die, but he is not concerned about that. He wants to compete with those who work in gold, silver, and bronze, and make things like they do. He takes great pride in the things he makes, but they are counterfeit. 
WIS.15.10	His heart is made of ashes. His hope is cheaper than dirt. His life is not worth as much as his clay, 
WIS.15.11	because he never came to know the God who shaped him, who breathed into him an active soul and a living spirit. 
WIS.15.12	He thinks of human life as just a game, a market where he can make a profit. He believes that he must make money however he can, even by evil ways. 
WIS.15.13	This man, who makes idols and fragile pots from the same clay, knows better than anyone else that he is sinning.
WIS.15.14	But the most foolish of all people, showing less sense than babies, were the enemies who oppressed your people, O Lord. 
WIS.15.15	They thought that all their pagan idols were gods, even though idols cannot see with their eyes, cannot breathe through their nose, cannot hear with their ears, cannot feel with their fingers, and cannot walk on their legs. 
WIS.15.16	Someone whose spirit is only borrowed made them. No one can ever make a god that is equal to a human being. 
WIS.15.17	Every person will sooner or later die, but anything he makes with his wicked hands is dead from the start. He himself is better than what he worships. He at least is alive, but what he worships is not, and never has been. 
WIS.15.18	Such people worship the most disgusting animals, including even the least intelligent ones. 
WIS.15.19	Even as animals they are not attractive enough to make anyone want them. God himself passed them by when he put his approval and blessing on the rest of creation.
WIS.16.1	And so it was appropriate that these people were punished by such creatures—tormented by swarms of them.
WIS.16.3	You did all this so that the idolaters, when they were hungry, would be unable to eat because of the disgusting creatures sent to them. Your people, however, suffered hunger only a short while, and then they ate the finest food. 
WIS.16.4	It was necessary for the oppressors to suffer relentless need, while your people saw how their enemies were being tormented.
WIS.16.6	This trouble lasted for only a little while, as a warning. Then you gave them a healing symbol, the bronze snake, to remind them of what your Law requires. 
WIS.16.7	If a person looked at that symbol, he was cured of the snakebite—not by what he saw, but by you, the savior of all mankind. 
WIS.16.8	By doing this, you also convinced our enemies that you are the one who rescues people from every evil. 
WIS.16.9	Our enemies died from the bites of locusts and flies; no way was found to cure them, because they deserved to be punished by such creatures. 
WIS.16.10	But even poisonous snakes could not overcome your people, because you had mercy, helped them, and cured them. 
WIS.16.11	They were bitten so that they would remember your commands, but they were quickly rescued, in order to keep them from forgetting you completely and depriving themselves of your kindness. 
WIS.16.12	No medicine or ointment cured them. They were restored to health by your word, O Lord, the word which heals all humanity. 
WIS.16.13	You have power over life and death; you can bring a person to the brink of death and back again. 
WIS.16.14	A wicked person may kill someone, but cannot bring the dead person back to life or rescue a soul imprisoned in the world of the dead.
WIS.16.15	No one can possibly escape from you. 
WIS.16.16	Look at those ungodly people: they refused to recognize you as God, so you punished them with your great power. They were overtaken by terrible storms of rain and hail and were completely destroyed by fire. 
WIS.16.17	The most amazing thing was that the fire burned all the more fiercely in the water, which usually puts fire out. All the forces of nature fight to defend those who are righteous. 
WIS.16.18	At one point the flames died down, so that they wouldn't destroy the creatures sent to punish the ungodly. Those people had to learn that they were being overtaken by your judgment. 
WIS.16.19	But at another point, when surrounded by water, the flames burned more fiercely than fire had ever burned before, and so destroyed the crops on the land where those unrighteous people lived.
WIS.16.21	All this showed how lovingly you care for your children. That food satisfied the desire of everyone who ate it; it was changed to suit each person's taste. 
WIS.16.22	It was food that under normal circumstances would vanish away like snow or ice, but now it did not melt even in the fire. This was meant to teach your people that the same fire that was destroying their enemies' crops during the heavy downpour of rain and hail 
WIS.16.23	held back its power, so that your own righteous people might have food.
WIS.16.24	You created the universe; it is at your command. All creation uses its power to punish unrighteous people, but it becomes mild and kind to those who put their trust in you. 
WIS.16.25	Creation assumed all kinds of forms to show how you provide generously for all who pray to you.
WIS.16.26	This happened so that the people whom you loved, O Lord, might learn that they are not fed by what they can grow. It is your word that maintains those who put their trust in you. 
WIS.16.27	The food that was not destroyed by the fire melted when the first ray of sunlight warmed it. 
WIS.16.28	This was to teach us that we must get up before daybreak to give you thanks, and pray as the sun comes up. 
WIS.16.29	But an ungrateful person's hope will melt away like frost, and drain away like water that is not being used.
WIS.17.1	O Lord, your acts of judgment are marvelous and hard to explain; that is why people who had not been taught about them went astray. 
WIS.17.2	When lawless people imagined that they had your holy nation in their power, they were themselves imprisoned in a long night of darkness. They lay in their own houses, shut off from your eternal care. 
WIS.17.3	They thought that their sins had been secret and unnoticed, shielded from view by a dark curtain of forgetfulness, but now they were horribly afraid, confused, and terrified by ghostly forms. 
WIS.17.4	Not even the dark corners where they lay could protect them from fear. They were surrounded by horrible noises; grim ghosts with gloomy faces appeared before their eyes. 
WIS.17.5	No fire had power to give them light, and the brilliant stars could do nothing to relieve that deathly darkness. 
WIS.17.6	There was only a dreadful fire, lit by no human hand, that shone on them, and in their terror they believed that the real world was even worse than the things they imagined. 
WIS.17.7	The illusions produced by their magic tricks were put to shame, and all the wisdom they had boasted of came to nothing. 
WIS.17.8	They had claimed they could drive away all the fears and illnesses of sick minds, but now they themselves were sick with silly, groundless fears. 
WIS.17.9	Even though nothing dangerous had actually happened, they were terrified by hissing snakes and animals advancing on them. 
WIS.17.10	And so they died, shaking with fear, afraid even to open their eyes, yet unable to keep them shut.
WIS.17.11	Wickedness is cowardly in itself and stands self-condemned.
WIS.17.12	Fear is nothing but the failure to use the help that reason gives. 
WIS.17.13	When you lack the confidence to rely on reason, you give in to the fears caused by ignorance.
WIS.17.14	All night long those people slept the same restless sleep, even though the night held no power over them, since it came from the powerless depths of the world of the dead. 
WIS.17.15	They were chased by hideous forms and lay paralyzed as they surrendered themselves to the sudden, unexpected fear that came over them. 
WIS.17.16	People would suddenly collapse and lie locked in the chains of their own fear. 
WIS.17.17	Farmers, shepherds, and laborers out in the countryside were captured by the same inevitable fate and bound in the darkness by the same invisible chain. 
WIS.17.18+WIS.17.19	They were panic-stricken by the sighing of the wind or by the singing of birds in the trees or by the roar of rushing water or by the rumble of falling rock or by the sound of unseen creatures running about or by the savage roaring of wild animals or by the echoes from the mountains. 
WIS.17.20	In the full light of day, the rest of the world went about its business undisturbed. 
WIS.17.21	Only those people were covered by this heavy night, a foretaste of the darkness of death that was waiting for them. They were a burden to themselves that was even heavier than the darkness.
WIS.18.2	Those enemies could at least be thankful that the people they had wronged were not taking vengeance on them now, and so they begged them to leave.
WIS.18.3	Then you guided your people as they traveled through a country they did not know. You guided them with a pillar of fire. It was like a sun that would not harm them on that glorious journey. 
WIS.18.4	But their enemies, who were not allowed to see the light, deserved to be prisoners in darkness, because they had made prisoners of your people. And it was through your people that the eternal light of the Law was going to be given to the world.
WIS.18.5	When your enemies were carrying out their resolve to kill the babies of your holy people, there was one child who was abandoned but later rescued. Then you punished your enemies by killing a great number of their own children. You drowned their whole army at one time in the rushing waters. 
WIS.18.6	But our ancestors had been told in advance of what would happen that night, so that they would be cheered and encouraged by confident trust in your promises to them. 
WIS.18.7	Your people knew that you would rescue the righteous nation and destroy their enemies. 
WIS.18.8	With the same act you punished our enemies and did us the glorious honor of calling us to yourself.
WIS.18.9	During all this time devout people from this righteous nation were secretly offering sacrifices, giving their word to each other that they would keep God's law and share each other's blessings and dangers. Already they were chanting those ancient hymns of praise. 
WIS.18.10	But their enemies' pitiful cries of grief echoed everywhere, as they mourned for their dead children. 
WIS.18.11	Masters suffered the same punishment as their slaves; the king endured the same loss as the common people. 
WIS.18.12	There were too many dead bodies to count. There were not enough people left to bury them all. In a single moment their dearest children died; all of them met death in the same way. 
WIS.18.13	These people had paid no attention to any warning, but relied instead on their magical powers. But when their first-born sons were killed, then they recognized that Israel was God's son.
WIS.18.14	The short night was half over, and all was quiet and peaceful, 
WIS.18.15	when suddenly your threats were carried out! An invincible word of judgment sped from your royal throne in heaven, straight down to that doomed land. It came like a soldier in fierce attack, 
WIS.18.16	carrying out your firm command with a fearful weapon, standing with feet on the ground and head touching the sky, filling the land with death. 
WIS.18.17	At that moment the people who were about to die had terrible nightmares and were seized by sudden fear. 
WIS.18.18	All over the land they lay half-dead and let it be known why they were dying. 
WIS.18.19	They knew why they were dying, because their horrible dreams had told them.
WIS.18.21	There was a certain blameless man who quickly took action to defend them. Acting as their priest, Aaron offered prayers and burned the incense used in asking forgiveness of sins. With prayers and incense as his weapons, he withstood your anger and ended the disaster. By doing this he proved that he was your servant. 
WIS.18.22	He overcame the bitter difficulty,
WIS.18.23	Dead bodies were already lying in piles, but he stepped in to hold your anger back and to keep it from harming those who were left alive. 
WIS.18.24	He wore a long robe decorated with symbols of the universe. In honor of our ancestors he wore four rows of engraved stones on his chest, and your own majesty was represented by the ornament on his turban. 
WIS.18.25	The Angel of Death was afraid of these things, and gave up. It was only a slight experience of your wrath, but it was enough.
WIS.19.1	But the godless continued to feel your pitiless anger until the very end. You knew what they would do before they did it. 
WIS.19.2	You knew that even though they let your people go and made them leave quickly, they would change their minds and pursue them. 
WIS.19.3+WIS.19.4	While the Egyptians were still mourning at the graves of their dead, they forgot why all this had happened, and they foolishly decided that the people they had begged to leave were runaways. So they chased after them. They were led into this as part of the punishment they deserved, so that they would suffer the rest of the torments they were due to receive. 
WIS.19.5	They were to meet a strange death, while your people continued on their miraculous journey.
WIS.19.6	The whole nature of the universe was changed at your command so that your people would not be harmed. 
WIS.19.7	They saw the cloud over their camp and dry land where water had been. There was a grass-covered plain between the stormy waves of the Red Sea, making it easy for them to cross over. 
WIS.19.8	All your people, under your protection, saw this miracle and went across. 
WIS.19.9	They pranced about like horses let out to pasture; they skipped about like lambs and praised you, Lord, for saving them. 
WIS.19.10	They still remembered what life had been like when they were slaves—how the earth bred gnats instead of cattle, how the river produced huge numbers of frogs instead of fish. 
WIS.19.11+WIS.19.12	Later, when they desperately wanted better food, quails came up from the sea to satisfy their hunger. The quail was a bird they had never seen before.
WIS.19.13	But violent thunder gave warning of the punishment that was coming on those sinners. They suffered a well-deserved punishment for their great wickedness. No nation had ever hated strangers so bitterly. 
WIS.19.14	Other people had been known to refuse welcome to strangers who came to them, but these people made slaves of those who were their guests and who had shown them kindness. 
WIS.19.15	Every nation will be punished if it does not welcome foreigners, 
WIS.19.16	but these people, who had earlier welcomed the foreigners with happy celebrations and treated them as equals, later made them suffer cruelly. 
WIS.19.17	These people were also struck with blindness, like the men of Sodom who came to the door of that righteous man Lot. They found themselves in total darkness, as each one groped around to find his own door.
WIS.19.18	On a harp each string keeps its own pitch, but each sound can be combined with others to make different melodies. That is how it was in those days, when the very elements entered into new combinations. Look at what happened! 
WIS.19.19	Land animals took to the water, and swimming creatures came up on the land. 
WIS.19.20	Fire burned even in water, which could not put it out. 
WIS.19.21	And yet the flames could not burn the flesh of the perishable creatures walking in them and did not melt that heavenly food that would ordinarily have melted like frost.
WIS.19.22	Lord, you have made your people great—glorious in all respects. You have never neglected them. You have given them help, always, everywhere.
SIR.1_2.1	and Wisdom is with him forever.
SIR.1_2.2	Who can count raindrops or the sand along the shore?
SIR.1_2.2	Who can count the days of eternity?
SIR.1_2.3	How high is the sky? How wide is the earth?
SIR.1_2.3	How deep is the ocean? How profound is Wisdom?
SIR.1_2.3	Can anyone find answers to these questions?
SIR.1_2.4	Wisdom was created before anything else;
SIR.1_2.4	understanding has always existed.
SIR.1_2.6	Has anyone ever been shown where Wisdom originates?
SIR.1_2.6	Does anyone understand her subtle cleverness?
SIR.1_2.8	There is only one who is wise,
SIR.1_2.8	and we must stand in awe before his throne.
SIR.1_2.9	he saw her and recognized her value,
SIR.1_2.9	and so he filled everything he made with Wisdom.
SIR.1_2.10	He gave some measure of Wisdom to everyone,
SIR.1_2.10	but poured her out on those who love him.
SIR.1_2.11	If you fear the Lord, honor and pride will be yours;
SIR.1_2.11	you will be crowned with happiness and joy.
SIR.1_2.12	To honor the Lord is a heartfelt delight;
SIR.1_2.12	it will give you a long and happy life,
SIR.1_2.13	and at the end of your days all will go well for you.
SIR.1_2.13	God will bless you on the day of your death.
SIR.1_2.14	To fear the Lord is the first step to Wisdom.
SIR.1_2.14	Wisdom is given to the faithful in their mothers' wombs.
SIR.1_2.15	She has lived with us from ancient times,
SIR.1_2.15	and generations to come will rely on her.
SIR.1_2.16	To fear the Lord is Wisdom at her fullest;
SIR.1_2.16	she satisfies us completely with her gifts
SIR.1_2.17	with all that our hearts can desire.
SIR.1_2.18	To fear the Lord is the flower of Wisdom
SIR.1_2.18	that blossoms with peace and good health.
SIR.1_2.19	She sends knowledge and understanding like the rain,
SIR.1_2.19	and increases the honor of those who receive her.
SIR.1_2.20	her branches are long life.
SIR.1_2.22	There is no excuse for unjustified anger; it can bring about your downfall. 
SIR.1_2.23	Wait and be patient, and later you will be glad you did. 
SIR.1_2.24	Keep quiet until the right time to speak, and you will gain a reputation for good sense.
SIR.1_2.25	Wisdom has a treasury of wise sayings, but sinners have nothing but contempt for godliness. 
SIR.1_2.26	If you want to be wise, keep the Lord's commands, and he will give you Wisdom in abundance. 
SIR.1_2.27	Fearing the Lord is Wisdom and an education in itself. He is pleased by loyalty and humility. 
SIR.1_2.28	Be faithful in the practice of your religion; when you worship the Lord, do it with all your heart. 
SIR.1_2.29	Be careful about what you say, and don't be a hypocrite. 
SIR.1_2.30	Don't be arrogant; you may suffer a fall and be disgraced. The Lord will reveal your secrets and humble you in front of everyone in the synagogue, because you did not come there with reverence for the Lord, but with a heart full of hypocrisy.
SIR.2.1	My child, if you are going to serve the Lord, be prepared for times when you will be put to the test. 
SIR.2.2	Be sincere and determined. Keep calm when trouble comes. 
SIR.2.3	Stay with the Lord; never abandon him, and you will be prosperous at the end of your days. 
SIR.2.4	Accept whatever happens to you. Even if you suffer humiliation, be patient. 
SIR.2.5	 Gold is tested by fire, and human character is tested in the furnace of humiliation. 
SIR.2.6	Trust the Lord, and he will help you. Walk straight in his ways, and put your hope in him.
SIR.2.7	All you that fear the Lord, wait for him to show you his mercy. Do not turn away from him, or you will fall. 
SIR.2.8	All you that fear the Lord, trust him, and you will certainly be rewarded. 
SIR.2.9	All you that fear the Lord, look forward to his blessings of mercy and eternal happiness.
SIR.2.10	Think back to the ancient generations and consider this: has the Lord ever disappointed anyone who put his hope in him? Has the Lord ever abandoned anyone who held him in constant reverence? Has the Lord ever ignored anyone who prayed to him? 
SIR.2.11	The Lord is kind and merciful; he forgives our sins and keeps us safe in time of trouble. 
SIR.2.12	But those who lose their nerve are doomed—all those sinners who try to have it both ways! 
SIR.2.13	Doom is sure to come for those who lose their courage; they have no faith, and so they will have no protection. 
SIR.2.14	Doom is sure to come for those who lose their hope. What will they do when the Lord comes to judge them?
SIR.2.16	Those who fear and love the Lord will try to please him and devote themselves to the Law. 
SIR.2.17	Those who fear the Lord are always ready to serve him. They humble themselves before him, and say, 
SIR.2.18	“We place our destiny in the hands of the Lord, not in human hands, because his mercy is as great as his majesty.”
SIR.3.1	Children, listen to me; I am your father. Do what I tell you and you will be safe, 
SIR.3.2	for the Lord has given fathers authority over their children and given children the obligation to obey their mothers. 
SIR.3.3	If you respect your father, you can make up for your sins, 
SIR.3.4	and if you honor your mother, you are earning great wealth. 
SIR.3.5	If you respect your father, one day your own children will make you happy; the Lord will hear your prayers. 
SIR.3.6	If you obey the Lord by honoring your father and making your mother happy, you will live a long life. 
SIR.3.7	Obey your parents as if you were their slave. 
SIR.3.8	 Honor your father in everything you do and say, so that you may receive his blessing. 
SIR.3.9	When parents give their blessing, they give strength to their children's homes, but when they curse their children, they destroy the very foundations.
SIR.3.10	Never seek honor for yourself at your father's expense; it is not to your credit if he is dishonored. 
SIR.3.11	Your own honor comes from the respect that you show to your father. If children do not honor their mothers, it is their own disgrace. 
SIR.3.12	My child, take care of your father when he grows old; give him no cause for worry as long as he lives. 
SIR.3.13	Be sympathetic even if his mind fails him; don't look down on him just because you are strong and healthy. 
SIR.3.14	The Lord will not forget the kindness you show to your father; it will help you make up for your sins. 
SIR.3.15	When you are in trouble, the Lord will remember your kindness and will help you; your sins will melt away like frost in warm sunshine. 
SIR.3.16	Those who abandon their parents or give them cause for anger may as well be cursing the Lord; they are already under the Lord's curse.
SIR.3.17	My child, be humble in everything you do, and people will appreciate it more than gifts.
SIR.3.18	 The greater you become, the more humble you should be; then the Lord will be pleased with you.
SIR.3.20	The Lord's power is great, and he is honored by those who are humble. 
SIR.3.21	Don't try to understand things that are too hard for you, or investigate matters that are beyond your power to know. 
SIR.3.22	 Concentrate on the Law, which has been given to you. You do not need to know about things which the Lord has not revealed, 
SIR.3.23	so don't concern yourself with them. After all, what has been shown to you is beyond human power to understand. 
SIR.3.24	Many people have been misled by their own opinions; their wrong ideas have warped their judgment.
SIR.3.26	Stubbornness will get you into trouble at the end. If you live dangerously, it will kill you. 
SIR.3.27	A stubborn person will be burdened down with troubles. Sinners go on adding one sin to another. 
SIR.3.28	There is no cure for the troubles that arrogant people have; wickedness has taken deep root in them. 
SIR.3.29	Intelligent people will learn from proverbs and parables. They listen well because they want to learn.
SIR.3.30	Giving to the poor can make up for sin, just as water can put out a blazing fire. 
SIR.3.31	Anyone who responds to others with acts of kindness is thinking of the future, because he will find help if he ever falls on hard times.
SIR.4.1	My child, don't prevent the poor from making a living, or keep them waiting in their need. 
SIR.4.2	Never give a hungry person any cause for resentment or anger. 
SIR.4.3	Don't add to the troubles of someone who is already desperate. If he is in need, don't put off giving to him. 
SIR.4.4+SIR.4.5	Don't refuse to help a beggar who is in distress. Don't turn your back on a poor person or give him any reason to curse you. 
SIR.4.6	If he becomes so bitter that he does curse you, his Creator will hear his prayer.
SIR.4.7	Make yourself popular in the synagogue. Bow your head to men of authority. 
SIR.4.8	Listen to what the poor have to say, and answer them politely. 
SIR.4.9	Protect people from those who want to wrong them, and be firm in your judgments. 
SIR.4.10	Be like a father to orphans, and provide widows with the help their husbands can no longer give them. Then you will be like a child of the Most High, and he will love you more than your own mother does.
SIR.4.11	Wisdom takes care of those who look for her; she raises them to greatness. 
SIR.4.12	Loving her is loving life itself; rising early to look for her is pure joy. 
SIR.4.13	Anyone who obtains Wisdom will be greatly honored. Wherever he goes, the Lord will bless him. 
SIR.4.14	Wisdom's servants are the servants of the Holy One, and the Lord loves everyone who loves her. 
SIR.4.15	Those who obey her will give sound judgments;
SIR.4.16	Put your trust in Wisdom, and you will possess her and pass her on to your descendants. 
SIR.4.17	At first, Wisdom will lead you along difficult paths. She will make you so afraid that you will think you cannot go on. The discipline she demands will be tormenting, and she will put you to the test with her requirements until she trusts you
SIR.4.18	Then she will come to you with no delay, reveal her secrets to you, and make you happy. 
SIR.4.19	But if you go astray, she will abandon you and let you go to your own ruin.
SIR.4.20	Take advantage of opportunities, but guard yourself against evil. Don't underrate yourself. 
SIR.4.21	Humility deserves honor and respect, but a low opinion of yourself leads to sin. 
SIR.4.22	Do not let others have their way at your expense; do not bring on your own ruin by giving up your rights. 
SIR.4.23	Never hesitate to speak out when the occasion
SIR.4.24	Your wisdom and education can be known only by what you say. 
SIR.4.25	Do not, however, go against the truth, and remember that you do not know everything. 
SIR.4.26	Don't be ashamed to confess your sins; there's no point in trying to stop a river from flowing. 
SIR.4.27	Don't allow yourself to be dominated by someone who is stupid or show partiality to influential people. 
SIR.4.28	Stand up for what is right, even if it costs you your life; the Lord God will be fighting on your side.
SIR.4.29	Don't be quick to speak or lazy and negligent in your work. 
SIR.4.30	Don't act like a lion at home or be suspicious of your servants. 
SIR.4.31	 Don't stick out your hand to get something if you're going to be tightfisted when the time comes to pay it back.
SIR.5.1	Don't rely on money to make you independent. 
SIR.5.2	Don't think you have to have everything you want, and then spend your energy trying to get it. 
SIR.5.3	Don't think that no one can exercise authority over you; if you do, the Lord is certain to punish you. 
SIR.5.4	 Don't think that you can sin and get away with it; the Lord does not mind waiting to punish you. 
SIR.5.5	Don't be so certain of the Lord's forgiveness that you go on committing one sin after another. 
SIR.5.6	Don't think that his mercy is so great that he will forgive your sins no matter how many they are. He does show mercy, but he also shows his furious anger with sinners. 
SIR.5.7	Come back to the Lord quickly. Don't think that you can keep putting it off. His anger can come upon you suddenly, and you will die under his punishment. 
SIR.5.8	Don't rely on dishonest wealth; it will do you no good on that day of disaster.
SIR.5.9+SIR.5.10	Be certain about what you believe and consistent in what you say. Don't try to please everyone or agree with everything people say.
SIR.5.11	Always be ready to listen, but take your time in answering. 
SIR.5.12	Answer only if you know what to say, and if you don't know what to say, keep quiet. 
SIR.5.13	Speaking can bring you either honor or disgrace; what you say can ruin you.
SIR.5.14	Don't get a reputation for being a gossip, and don't tell tales that will hurt people. Just as robbers will suffer disgrace, so liars will suffer severe condemnation. 
SIR.5.15	Do nothing destructive,
SIR.6.1	and do not be an enemy when you should be a friend. A bad reputation brings you the disgrace that lying sinners deserve. 
SIR.6.2	Do not let your passions carry you away; this can tear your soul to pieces like a bull.
SIR.6.3	You will be left like a dead tree without any leaves or fruit. 
SIR.6.4	Evil desire will destroy you and make you a joke to your enemies.
SIR.6.5	If you are polite and courteous, you will enjoy the friendship of many people. 
SIR.6.6	Exchange greetings with many, but take advice from only one person out of a thousand. 
SIR.6.7	When you make friends, don't be too quick to trust them; make sure that they have proved themselves. 
SIR.6.8	Some people will be your friends only when it is convenient for them, but they won't stand by you in trouble. 
SIR.6.9	Others will fall out with you over some argument, and then embarrass you by letting everyone know about it. 
SIR.6.10+SIR.6.11	Others will sit at your table as long as things are going well; they will stick to you like your shadow and give orders to your servants, but they will not stand by you in trouble. 
SIR.6.12	If your situation takes a turn for the worse, they will turn against you, and you won't be able to find them anywhere.
SIR.6.13	Stay away from your enemies and be on guard against your friends. 
SIR.6.14	A loyal friend is like a safe shelter; find one, and you have found a treasure. 
SIR.6.15	Nothing else is as valuable; there is no way of putting a price on it. 
SIR.6.16	A loyal friend is like a medicine that keeps you in good health. Only those who fear the Lord can find such a friend. 
SIR.6.17	A person who fears the Lord can make real friendships, because he will treat his friends as he does himself.
SIR.6.18	My child, learn to value Wisdom while you are young, and you will still be able to find her when you grow old. 
SIR.6.19	 Work as hard to find Wisdom as a farmer works to plow and plant his fields; then you can expect a good harvest. You will have to work at it for a while, but you will soon be enjoying what you have earned. 
SIR.6.20	Undisciplined people find Wisdom's demands too hard and don't have enough determination to meet them. 
SIR.6.21	Her requirements are a burden heavier than they are willing to bear, and they quickly lay them aside. 
SIR.6.22	“Discipline” means just that—discipline,
SIR.6.23	My child, listen to me and take my advice. 
SIR.6.24	Put Wisdom's chains around your feet and her yoke around your neck. 
SIR.6.25	Carry her on your shoulder and don't be resentful of her bonds. 
SIR.6.26	Follow Wisdom, and keep to her ways with all your heart. 
SIR.6.27	Go looking for her, and she will reveal herself to you. Take hold of her and don't let go. 
SIR.6.28	Then you will discover the peace of mind she offers, and she will become your joy. 
SIR.6.29+SIR.6.30	The signs of slavery you wear will become signs of royal majesty. Her chains will be your protection, and you will wear her yoke like a magnificent robe. 
SIR.6.31	You will wear Wisdom like a splendid crown.
SIR.6.32	My child, you can learn if you want to. You can be clever if you are determined to be. 
SIR.6.33	If you are willing to listen, you will learn and become wise. 
SIR.6.34	Go where the old people are; find someone who is wise, and stay with him. 
SIR.6.35	Be ready to listen when religious people speak, and don't miss anything that shows insight. 
SIR.6.36	If you find someone with understanding, get up early to call on him; wear out his doorstep with your visits.
SIR.7.1+SIR.7.2	If you do no wrong, no wrong will ever come to you. 
SIR.7.3	Do not plow the ground to plant seeds of injustice; you may reap a bigger harvest than you expect.
SIR.7.4	Don't ask the Lord for a place of honor or ask the king for an important position. 
SIR.7.5	Don't try to convince the Lord that you are righteous or make a show of your wisdom before the king. 
SIR.7.6	Don't set your heart on being a judge, unless you have the strength of character it takes to put an end to injustice. If you let yourself be influenced by someone in a position of power, your integrity will be damaged. 
SIR.7.7	Don't commit any crime against the general public, and don't disgrace yourself among your townspeople.
SIR.7.8	Don't commit the same sin twice. The punishment you get the first time ought to be enough.
SIR.7.9	Don't think that God Most High is going to take into account how very generous you are and so accept any offering you decide to make.
SIR.7.10	Never get tired of praying, and never miss a chance to give to the poor.
SIR.7.11	Don't laugh at someone who has been humiliated. It is the Lord who humbles a person, but the Lord also raises him up again.
SIR.7.12	Don't think up lies to tell about your friends. 
SIR.7.13	Don't tell lies at all. It never does any good.
SIR.7.14	In an official assembly, don't get up and talk a lot of nonsense. And don't repeat yourself when you pray.
SIR.7.15	Don't try to avoid farm work or other hard labor; the Most High has given us these jobs to do.
SIR.7.16	Don't join up with a crowd of sinners; remember that the Lord's punishment is sure to come.
SIR.7.17	Be very humble, because the decay of death awaits us all.
SIR.7.18	Don't betray a friend for money. Don't betray a real friend for all the gold in the world.
SIR.7.19	Don't miss your chance to marry a wise and good woman. A gracious wife is worth more than gold.
SIR.7.20	Don't mistreat servants who do their work well, or employees who do their best for you.
SIR.7.22	Take good care of any animals you own. If they make money for you, keep them.
SIR.7.23	If you have sons, educate them. Teach them self-discipline while they are young.
SIR.7.24	If you have daughters, keep them virtuous, and don't be too indulgent with them. 
SIR.7.25	When you give your daughter in marriage, you have finished a great task, but give her to a sensible man.
SIR.7.26	If you have a good wife, do not divorce her, but do not trust yourself to someone you don't love.
SIR.7.28	Remember that you owe your life to them. How can you ever repay them for all they have done for you?
SIR.7.29	Fear the Lord with all your heart, and have respect for his priests. 
SIR.7.30	Love your Creator with all your strength, and give his ministers your support. 
SIR.7.31	Honor the Lord and respect the priests. Supply them with what you have been commanded to give: the first produce, the offering for sin, the shoulder of the sacrificial animal—all the required sacrifices and offerings.
SIR.7.32	Give your help to the poor, and the Lord will give you his perfect blessing. 
SIR.7.33	Be generous to every living soul, and be gracious to the memory of the dead. 
SIR.7.34	Show sympathy to those who have lost a loved one, and mourn with them. 
SIR.7.35	Do not hesitate to visit the sick. You will be loved for things like these. 
SIR.7.36	Whatever you do, remember that some day you must die. As long as you keep this in mind, you will never sin.
SIR.8.1	Do not challenge a person who has influence; you may fall into his power. 
SIR.8.2	Do not quarrel with someone rich; he may bribe people to turn against you. Gold has destroyed many people and corrupted kings. 
SIR.8.3	Don't argue with someone who talks too much; you will just be adding fuel to his fire. 
SIR.8.4	Don't make fun of someone who has bad manners; he may insult your ancestors. 
SIR.8.5	Don't criticize someone if he is already turning away from sin. Remember that we are all guilty. 
SIR.8.6	Never think less of someone because he is old; some of us are growing old, too. 
SIR.8.7	Don't be happy over the death of anyone; remember that all of us must die.
SIR.8.8	Do not disregard what the wise have said. Study their proverbs; from them you can learn to be cultured and to serve great people. 
SIR.8.9	Pay attention to what old people say, for they learned from those who came before them. You can learn from them, and they can teach you how to have an answer ready when you need one.
SIR.8.10	You should not provide a sinner with more opportunity to sin. You might get hurt yourself; it's as easy as getting burned while adding logs to a fire. 
SIR.8.11	You should not get up and walk out on someone who is insolent. He might twist your words and use them against you. 
SIR.8.12	You should not lend anything to someone more powerful than you. If you do, you might as well consider it lost. 
SIR.8.13	You should not guarantee anyone else's loan to an extent that you cannot afford. You must be prepared to pay any such guarantee. 
SIR.8.14	You should not bring a lawsuit against a judge. He will win because of his position. 
SIR.8.15	You should not travel with anyone who is reckless. It will cause you nothing but trouble. He will do any foolish thing he pleases, and you will die with him.
SIR.8.16	You should not get into an argument with anyone who has a hot temper or go to some place where the two of you will be alone. Violence means nothing to such a person, and he will attack you when there is no one to help you. 
SIR.8.17	You should not ask a stupid person for advice. He will not be able to keep secret what you tell him. 
SIR.8.18	You should not do anything in front of a stranger that should be kept secret. There is no way of knowing what will happen if you do. 
SIR.8.19	You should not reveal your most private thoughts to anyone. If you do, you may as well throw away any chance of happiness.
SIR.9.2	Do not surrender your dignity to any woman. 
SIR.9.3	Keep away from other men's wives
SIR.9.4	Don't keep company with female musicians; they will trick you. 
SIR.9.5	Don't look too intently at a virgin, or you may find yourself forced to pay a bride price. 
SIR.9.6	Don't give yourself to prostitutes, or you may lose everything you own. 
SIR.9.7	So don't go looking about in the streets or wandering around in the run-down parts of town. 
SIR.9.8	When you see a good-looking woman, look the other way; don't let your mind dwell on the beauty of any woman who is not your wife. Many men have been led astray by a woman's beauty. It kindles passion as if it were fire. 
SIR.9.9	Don't sit down to eat with another man's wife or join her for a drink. You may give in to the temptation of her charms and be destroyed by your passion.
SIR.9.10	Never abandon old friends; you will never find a new one who can take their place. Friendship is like wine; it gets better as it grows older. 
SIR.9.11	Don't be jealous of a sinner's success; you don't know what kind of disaster is in store for him. 
SIR.9.12	Don't take pleasure in the things that make ungodly people happy; remember that they will be held guilty as long as they live. 
SIR.9.13	If you keep away from someone who has the power to put you to death, you will not have to fear for your life; but if you must go near him, be very careful, or he may kill you. Be conscious that you are walking among hidden traps, that you are an easy target.
SIR.9.14	Get to know the people around you as well as you can, and take advice only from those who are qualified to give it. 
SIR.9.15	Engage in conversation with intelligent people, and let the Law of the Most High be the topic of your discussions. 
SIR.9.16	Choose righteous people for your dinner companions. Your chief pride should be your fear of the Lord.
SIR.9.17	A skilled worker is admired for the things he makes, and a leader's wisdom is proved by his words. 
SIR.9.18	Someone who speaks rashly and recklessly is feared and hated by everyone in town.
SIR.10.1	A wise ruler will educate his people, and his government will be orderly. 
SIR.10.2	All the officials and all the citizens will be like their ruler. 
SIR.10.3	An uneducated king will ruin his people, but a government will grow strong if its rulers are wise. 
SIR.10.4	The Lord sees to the government of the world and brings the right person to power at the right time. 
SIR.10.5	The success of that person is in the Lord's hands. The Lord is the source of the honor given to any official.
SIR.10.6	Don't be angry with someone for every little thing he does wrong. Don't do anything out of injured pride. 
SIR.10.7	Arrogance and injustice are hated by both the Lord and people. 
SIR.10.8	Injustice, arrogance, and wealth cause nations to fall from power, and others then rise to take their place. 
SIR.10.9	We are only dust and ashes; what have we got to be proud of Our body decays even while we are alive.
SIR.10.10	A long illness puzzles the doctor.
SIR.10.11	When a person dies, all he then possesses is worms, flies, and maggots.
SIR.10.12	Pride has its beginning when a person abandons the Lord, his maker. 
SIR.10.13	Pride is like a fountain pouring out sin, and whoever persists in it will be full of wickedness. That is why the Lord brought terrible punishments on some people and completely destroyed them. 
SIR.10.14	 The Lord has overthrown kings and put humbler people in their place. 
SIR.10.15	The Lord has pulled up nations by the roots and established humbler ones in their place. 
SIR.10.16	The Lord has overthrown empires and completely devastated their lands. 
SIR.10.17	He destroyed some so completely that they are not even remembered any more. 
SIR.10.18	The Creator never intended for human beings to be arrogant and violent.
SIR.10.19	Who deserves honor? The human race does, because people fear the Lord. Who does not deserve honor? The human race does not, because people break the Lord's commands. 
SIR.10.20	A leader should be honored by those who follow him, and the Lord honors those who fear him.
SIR.10.22	Rich people, famous people, and poor people all take pride in their fear of the Lord. 
SIR.10.23	It is not right to refuse honor to a poor person who is intelligent, and it is not right to give honor to a sinner. 
SIR.10.24	People of influence, rulers, and judges will be honored, but none of them is greater than a person who fears the Lord. 
SIR.10.25	A slave who is wise will have free citizens serving him; and if they are sensible, they will not resent it.
SIR.10.26	When you do your work, don't make a show of your skill, and don't try to put on a show when you are in trouble. 
SIR.10.27	It is better to work and have more than you need than to go around boasting but hungry.
SIR.10.28	My child, keep your self-respect, but remain modest. Value yourself at your true worth. 
SIR.10.29	There is no excuse for a person to run himself down. No one respects a person who has no respect for himself. 
SIR.10.30	Poor people can be honored for their good sense, and rich people can be honored for their wealth. 
SIR.10.31	If someone is honored while he is poor, think how much he will be honored if he becomes rich! If someone is despised while he is rich, think how much more he will be despised if he becomes poor!
SIR.11.1	If a poor person is wise, he has good reason to be proud, and he will be thought of as someone great.
SIR.11.2	Do not compliment a person on his good looks. On the other hand, do not look down on someone who is unattractive. 
SIR.11.3	Compared to most flying things, a bee is very small, but the honey it makes is the sweetest of foods. 
SIR.11.4	Don't make fun of someone who has fallen on hard times and is dressed in rags.
SIR.11.5	Many are the kings who have ended their careers sitting on the ground, while their crowns were worn by those no one had heard of before. 
SIR.11.6	Many are the rulers who have suffered disgrace. Many are the famous people who have fallen into the power of others.
SIR.11.7	Before you start criticizing, get your facts straight and think the matter through. 
SIR.11.8	Don't interrupt while someone is speaking; hear what he has to say before you answer. 
SIR.11.9	Don't get into an argument over something that is none of your business. Don't take part in decisions that are being made by sinners.
SIR.11.10	My child, don't get involved in too many things. If you try to do too much, you will suffer for it. You won't be able to finish your work, and you won't be able to get away from it either. 
SIR.11.11	For instance, here is someone who never stops working like a slave, but gets further behind all the time. 
SIR.11.12	On the other hand, someone else may be very poor and not up to his task. He may be slow, and he may need help, but the Lord is pleased with him and pulls him out of his bad situation. 
SIR.11.13	When he is back on his feet again, everyone is astounded.
SIR.11.14	Everything comes from the Lord: success and failure, poverty and wealth, life and death. 
SIR.11.15	Wisdom, understanding, knowledge of the Law, love, and the doing of good deeds—all these come from the Lord. 
SIR.11.16	Error and darkness have been with sinners from the beginning, and those who enjoy evil will have it with them into their old age. 
SIR.11.17	The Lord's gifts to religious people are gifts that endure. If he approves of you, you will always be successful. 
SIR.11.18	 Someone may grow rich by working hard and denying himself pleasure, but what does he get for it? 
SIR.11.19	He says to himself, “Now I can finally sit back and enjoy what I have worked for.” But he has no idea how long it will be before he must die and leave his wealth to others.
SIR.11.20	Stand by your duty and stick to it; grow old at your work. 
SIR.11.21	Don't be jealous of what sinners achieve; just stick to your own work, and trust the Lord. It is very easy for the Lord to make a poor person suddenly rich. 
SIR.11.22	Devout people will receive the Lord's blessing as their reward, and that blessing can be given in a moment. 
SIR.11.23	Don't be concerned about what you need, or what success the future holds for you. 
SIR.11.24	On the other hand, don't think that you have everything you need or that nothing can go wrong for you in the future. 
SIR.11.25	When things are going well, people don't think about hard times; and when things are going badly, they forget about prosperity. 
SIR.11.26	The Lord can easily wait until the day of our death to reward or punish us. 
SIR.11.27	At that time our deeds are open for all to see; all our happiness can be erased in that one moment of misery. 
SIR.11.28	So then, don't think of anyone's life as happy until it is over, because all the evidence is not in until the person is dead.
SIR.11.29	Be careful about the kind of person you invite into your home, because clever people can fool you in many ways. 
SIR.11.30	A proud person is a decoy to lure you into danger; like a spy, he will look for your weaknesses.
SIR.11.31	He will make good appear evil and find fault with the noblest actions. 
SIR.11.32	A single spark can set a pile of coals ablaze, and a sinner is just waiting for a chance to do violence. 
SIR.11.33	Watch out for such people and their evil plans; they will ruin you permanently. 
SIR.11.34	If you bring a stranger home with you, it will only cause trouble, even between you and your own family.
SIR.12.2	You will be repaid for any kindness you show to a devout person. If he doesn't repay you, the Most High will. 
SIR.12.3	No good ever comes to a person who gives comfort to the wicked; it is not a righteous act.
SIR.12.4	Give to religious people, but don't help sinners. 
SIR.12.5	Do good to humble people, but don't give anything to those who are not devout. Don't give them food, or they will use your kindness against you. Every good thing you do for such people will bring you twice as much trouble in return. 
SIR.12.6	The Most High himself hates sinners, and he will punish them. 
SIR.12.7	Give to good people, but do not help sinners.
SIR.12.8	When things are going well, it is hard to tell who your real friends are, but in hard times you can recognize your enemies; 
SIR.12.9	even your friends will leave you then. But when you are successful, your enemies will act like friends.
SIR.12.10	Never trust an enemy; his wickedness is as destructive as rust. 
SIR.12.11	Watch out, and be on guard against him, even if he acts ever so humble. He is like a metal mirror that rusts away if you don't keep it polished. 
SIR.12.12	Seat an enemy at your right hand, and the next thing you know he'll be trying to get your own place of honor. Put him next to you, and he will overthrow you. Then you will realize the truth of my words, and be stung with regret when you remember them. 
SIR.12.13	Nobody feels sorry for snake charmers or wild animal tamers who get bitten, 
SIR.12.14	and nobody will feel sorry for you if you run around with sinners and get involved in their wrongdoing.
SIR.12.15	An enemy will stay with you for a while, but not when trouble comes. 
SIR.12.16	He will speak fine words while he plots how to trap you. He will pretend to share your sorrows, but he will kill you if he gets a chance. 
SIR.12.17	If trouble comes your way, you will find him waiting, ready to trip you up while he pretends to help you. 
SIR.12.18	He will be a different person then, rubbing his hands, nodding his head, and spreading rumors about you.
SIR.13.1	If you touch tar, it will stick to you, and if you keep company with arrogant people, you will come to be just like them. 
SIR.13.2	Don't try to lift something too heavy for you, and don't keep company with people who are richer and more powerful than you. You cannot keep a clay pot next to an iron kettle; the pot will break if it hits the kettle. 
SIR.13.3	If a rich person wrongs someone, he can afford to add insult to injury; but if a poor person is wronged, he is forced to apologize for himself. 
SIR.13.4	A rich person will use you as long as he can profit from it, but when you need him, he will leave you helpless. 
SIR.13.5	He will live with you as long as you have anything and will gladly drain you dry. 
SIR.13.6	If he needs you, he will trick you with his smiles and cheerful, kindly words. “Do you need anything?” he will ask. 
SIR.13.7	He will feed you until you are embarrassed. Finally, when he has drained you two or three times over, he will laugh at you. If you see him later, he will pretend he doesn't know you, and will pass you by.
SIR.13.8	Be careful not to be misled; you can be enjoying yourself and suddenly find yourself humiliated. 
SIR.13.9	If you are invited to the home of someone influential, be reserved in your behavior. Then he will invite you more often. 
SIR.13.10	If you push yourself on him, he will put you in your place. On the other hand, if you keep your distance from him, he will forget about you. 
SIR.13.11	Don't pretend to be his equal or trust everything he says. In spite of all of his long and polite conversation, he is testing you.
SIR.13.12	If a person does not keep confidences, he is cruel; he will not hesitate to hurt you or have you put in jail. 
SIR.13.13	Keep your secrets to yourself and be very careful, for you are always walking on dangerous ground.
SIR.13.15	Every creature prefers its own kind, and people are no different. 
SIR.13.16	Just as animals of the same species flock together, so people keep company with people like themselves. 
SIR.13.17	A sinner has no more in common with a devout person than a wolf has with a lamb. 
SIR.13.18	Rich people have no more in common with poor people than hyenas have with dogs. 
SIR.13.19	The rich hunt down the poor just as lions hunt down wild donkeys in the open country. 
SIR.13.20	Arrogant people have nothing but scorn for the humble, and the rich think of the poor in the same way. 
SIR.13.21	When a rich person stumbles, his friends will steady him, but if a poor person falls, his friends will have nothing to do with him. 
SIR.13.22	When someone rich makes a mistake, there are many people to cover up for him and explain away all the things he never should have said. But let someone poor make a mistake, and he gets nothing but criticism. Even if what he says makes good sense, nobody will listen. 
SIR.13.23	When a rich person speaks, everyone is silent, and they praise him to the skies for what he says. But let a poor person speak, and everybody says, “Who is that?” They push him down if he so much as stumbles.
SIR.13.24	There is nothing wrong with being rich if you haven't sinned to get that way. But there is nothing sinful about being poor, either. Only the ungodly think so. 
SIR.13.25	It's what is in your heart that makes the expression on your face happy or sad. 
SIR.13.26	If you feel cheerful, you will look cheerful, although making up proverbs calls for some intense thought.
SIR.14.1	If a person never says anything carelessly, he is to be congratulated; he doesn't need to feel guilty. 
SIR.14.2	If a person has a clear conscience and never gives up hope, he is certainly to be congratulated!
SIR.14.3	It isn't right for someone who is selfish to be rich. What use is money to a stingy person? 
SIR.14.4	If you deny yourself in order to accumulate wealth, you are only accumulating it for someone else. Others will use your riches to live in luxury. 
SIR.14.5	How can you be generous with others if you are stingy with yourself, if you are not willing to enjoy your own wealth? 
SIR.14.6	No one is worse off than someone who is stingy with himself; it is a sin that brings its own punishment. 
SIR.14.7	When such a person does something good, it is only by accident; his selfishness will sooner or later be evident. 
SIR.14.8	A selfish person is evil; he turns his back on people's needs 
SIR.14.9	and is never satisfied with what he has. Greed
SIR.14.10	Some people are too stingy to put bread on their own table.
SIR.14.11	My child, treat yourself as well as you can, and bring worthy offerings to the Lord. 
SIR.14.12	Remember that death is coming for you some day, and you haven't been told when that will be. 
SIR.14.13	Before that day comes, be kind to your friends; be as generous as you can. 
SIR.14.14	Don't deny yourself a single day's happiness. If there is something you want to do and it is lawful, go ahead! 
SIR.14.15	Some day all that you have worked for will be divided up and given to others. 
SIR.14.16	So be generous; but also be willing to receive from others. Enjoy yourself, for you will not find any pleasures in the world of the dead. 
SIR.14.17	The human body wears out like a piece of clothing. The ancient law decrees that we must die. 
SIR.14.18	Human beings are like leaves on a spreading tree. New growth takes the place of the fallen leaves; while some of us die, others are being born. 
SIR.14.19	Everything made by human hands will decay and perish, along with the person who made it.
SIR.14.21	Anyone who studies the ways of Wisdom will also learn her secrets. 
SIR.14.22	Go after Wisdom like a hunter looking for game. 
SIR.14.23	Look into her windows and listen at her doors. 
SIR.14.24	Camp as close to her house as you can get, 
SIR.14.25	and you will have a fine place to live. 
SIR.14.26+SIR.14.27	Build your home there, safe beneath her protecting branches, and shaded from the heat.
SIR.15.1	If you fear the Lord, you will do this. Master his Law, and you will find Wisdom. 
SIR.15.2	She will come to welcome you, like a mother or a young bride. 
SIR.15.3	She will give you wisdom and knowledge like food and drink. 
SIR.15.4	Rely on her for support, and you will never know the disgrace of failure. 
SIR.15.5	She will make you more honored than all your neighbors; when you speak in the assembly, she will give you the right words. 
SIR.15.6	You will find happiness and genuine joy; your name will be remembered forever.
SIR.15.7	But people who are foolish or sinful will never even catch sight of Wisdom. 
SIR.15.8	She will have nothing to do with conceited people; she never enters the mind of liars. 
SIR.15.9	It is not appropriate for a sinner to sing hymns of praise, because his worship is insincere. 
SIR.15.10	A hymn should be an expression of wisdom, inspired by the Lord himself.
SIR.15.12	Don't claim that he has misled you; he doesn't need the help of sinners to accomplish his purposes. 
SIR.15.13	The Lord hates evil in all its forms, and those who fear the Lord find nothing attractive in evil. 
SIR.15.14	When, in the beginning, the Lord created human beings, he left them free to do as they wished. 
SIR.15.15	If you want to, you can keep the Lord's commands. You can decide whether you will be loyal to him or not. 
SIR.15.16	He has placed fire and water before you; reach out and take whichever you want. 
SIR.15.17	You have a choice between life and death; you will get whichever you choose. 
SIR.15.18	The Lord's wisdom and power are great and he sees everything. 
SIR.15.19	He is aware of everything a person does, and he takes care of those who fear him. 
SIR.15.20	He has never commanded anyone to be wicked or given anyone permission to sin.
SIR.16.1	A large family is nothing to be desired if the children are worthless. Godless children are nothing to be proud of. 
SIR.16.2	No matter how many children you have, don't look on them with pride unless they fear the Lord. 
SIR.16.3	Don't put much hope in their future or expect them to live a long time. One child who does the Lord's will is better than a thousand who do not.
SIR.16.4	A city's population may grow because of the wisdom of one person, while a whole tribe of lawless people disappears. 
SIR.16.5	I have seen such things many times and have heard of even more striking examples. 
SIR.16.6	The Lord's flaming anger will break out against a small gathering of sinners or a disobedient nation. 
SIR.16.7	 He did not forgive those ancient giants who rebelled against him, confident of their own strength. 
SIR.16.8	He detested the arrogance of the people among whom Lot lived, and he did not spare them. 
SIR.16.9	He showed no mercy on that nation which he doomed to destruction for its sins, 
SIR.16.10	nor on those 600,000 people on the march through the wilderness who gathered together in stubborn rebellion. 
SIR.16.11	Even if there had been only one stubborn person, it would have been a miracle if he had escaped punishment. The Lord is merciful, but he can also become angry. He can be overwhelming in his forgiveness or in his anger. 
SIR.16.12	His punishment is as severe as his mercy is great. He judges people by what they have done. 
SIR.16.13	No sinner can escape with what he has stolen. The Lord will reward the patience of devout people. 
SIR.16.14	Every righteous person will be rewarded;
SIR.16.17	Never say, “I will hide from the Lord. Nobody up there is going to give me a thought. How can I be noticed among so many people? The creation is so enormous, what am I worth? 
SIR.16.18	When the Lord comes, everything will tremble: the earth and the great waters beneath it, the sky and the heavens above it. 
SIR.16.19	The mountains will shake, and the foundations of the earth will shudder when he looks at them. 
SIR.16.20	The Lord isn't going to give me a thought. Nobody cares what I do. 
SIR.16.21	If I sin and am secretly disloyal, nobody will know it.
SIR.16.22	If I do what is right, nobody will tell the Lord about it. Who wants to wait for him, anyway? He is too slow in doing what he has said he would.” 
SIR.16.23	Only someone with very little sense, and foolishly misguided, would think things like that.
SIR.16.24	My child, listen and pay attention to me; you will gain knowledge if you do. 
SIR.16.25	I will give you diligent and accurate instruction.
SIR.16.26	In the beginning the Lord did his work of creation,
SIR.16.26	and gave everything a place of its own.
SIR.16.27	He arranged everything in an eternal order
SIR.16.27	and decreed that it should be that way forever.
SIR.16.27	Not one part of creation ever grows hungry;
SIR.16.27	no part grows tired or stops its work.
SIR.16.28	The parts do not crowd one another,
SIR.16.28	and they never disobey his word.
SIR.16.29	When the Lord had made all this,
SIR.16.29	he looked at the earth and filled it with good things.
SIR.16.30	He covered it with all kinds of creatures
SIR.16.30	that must die and return to the dust.
SIR.17.1	and sent each of them back to it again.
SIR.17.2	He gave them only a limited time to live,
SIR.17.2	but he gave them authority over everything on earth.
SIR.17.3	He made them to be like himself,
SIR.17.3	and gave them his
SIR.17.4	He made all other creatures afraid of them;
SIR.17.4	he gave them authority over all the animals and birds.
SIR.17.6	He gave them their tongues, their eyes,
SIR.17.6	their ears, their minds, and their consciences.
SIR.17.7	and showed them the difference between good and evil.
SIR.17.8	He gave them his own insight
SIR.17.8	to let them see the majesty of his creation.
SIR.17.10	They will praise his holy name
SIR.17.10	and proclaim the greatness of all he does.
SIR.17.11	He made knowledge available to them
SIR.17.11	and gave them the Law as a source of life.
SIR.17.12	He made an eternal covenant with them
SIR.17.12	and revealed his commands to them.
SIR.17.13	They saw the splendor of his majesty
SIR.17.13	and heard the glory of his voice.
SIR.17.14	He warned them against unrighteousness
SIR.17.14	and taught each person how to treat others.
SIR.17.15	The Lord is always aware of what people do; there is no way to hide from him.
SIR.17.17	He gave each nation its own ruler, but Israel is the Lord's own possession.
SIR.17.19	The Lord is always watching what people do; everything they do is as clear as day to him. 
SIR.17.20	None of their sins are hidden from him; he is aware of them all.
SIR.17.22	When we give to the poor, the Lord considers it as precious as a valuable ring. Human kindness is as precious to him as life itself. 
SIR.17.23	Later he will judge the wicked and punish them; they will get what they deserve. 
SIR.17.24	But the Lord will allow those who repent to return to him. He always gives encouragement to those who are losing hope.
SIR.17.26	Return to the Most High and turn away from sin. Have an intense hatred for wickedness. 
SIR.17.27	 Those who are alive can give thanks to the Lord, but can anyone in the world of the dead sing praise to the Most High? 
SIR.17.28	A person who is alive and well can sing the Lord's praises, but the dead, who no longer exist, have no way to give him thanks. 
SIR.17.29	How great is the Lord's merciful forgiveness of those who turn to him! 
SIR.17.30	But this is not the nature of human beings;
SIR.17.31	Nothing is brighter than the sun, but even the sun's light fails during an eclipse. How much easier it is for human thoughts to be eclipsed by evil! 
SIR.17.32	The Lord can look out over all the stars in the sky. Human beings? They are dust and ashes.
SIR.18.1	The Lord, who lives forever, created the whole universe, 
SIR.18.2	and he alone is just.
SIR.18.4	He has given no one enough power to describe what he has done, and no one can investigate it completely. 
SIR.18.5	Who can measure his majestic power? Who can tell the whole story of his merciful actions? 
SIR.18.6	We cannot add to them; we cannot subtract from them. There is no way to comprehend the marvelous things the Lord has done. 
SIR.18.7	When we come to the end of that story, we have not even begun; we are simply at a loss for words.
SIR.18.8	What are human beings? Of what use are we? The good that we do—the evil that we do—what does it all mean? 
SIR.18.9	If we live a hundred years, we have lived an unusually long time, 
SIR.18.10	but compared with all eternity, those years are like a drop of water in the ocean, like a single grain of sand. 
SIR.18.11	That is why the Lord is so patient with us, why he is so free with his mercy. 
SIR.18.12	He looks at us and knows that we are doomed to die; that is why he is so willing to forgive us. 
SIR.18.13	We can show compassion to someone we know, but the Lord shows compassion for all humanity. He corrects us; he disciplines us; he teaches us. Like a shepherd tending sheep, he brings us back to himself. 
SIR.18.14	He will have compassion on us if we accept his guidance and are eager for him to show us where we are wrong.
SIR.18.15	My child, when you help someone, don't reprimand him at the same time. When you make a gift, don't say anything that hurts. 
SIR.18.16	Your words count for more than what you give. Even dew gives some relief during a spell of hot weather. 
SIR.18.17	Yes, kind words are more effective than the best of gifts, and if you are really concerned, you will give both. 
SIR.18.18	It is stupid to be unkind and insulting. No one's eyes are going to sparkle at a gift that you resent giving.
SIR.18.19	Know what you are talking about before you speak, and give attention to your health before you get sick. 
SIR.18.20	Examine your conscience before the Lord judges you; then when that time comes, he will forgive you. 
SIR.18.21	Humble yourself before you are punished with sickness. When you have sinned, show repentance. 
SIR.18.22	If you make a promise to the Lord, keep it as soon as you can. Don't wait until you are about to die to set things straight. 
SIR.18.23	But before you make such a promise, be prepared to keep it. Don't try to test the Lord's patience. 
SIR.18.24	Think! Do you want him to be angry with you on the day you die? When you face his judgment, do you want him to turn his back on you? 
SIR.18.25	When you have all you want, think what it is like to be hungry, what it is to be poor. 
SIR.18.26	Things can change in a single day; the Lord can act very quickly. 
SIR.18.27	If you are wise, you will be careful in everything you do. When sin is all around you, be especially careful that you do not become guilty. 
SIR.18.28	Every intelligent person can recognize wisdom and will honor anyone who shows it. 
SIR.18.29	If you appreciate wisdom when you hear it, you will become wise yourself, and your words will be a source of wisdom for others.
SIR.18.30	Don't be controlled by your lust; keep your passions in check. 
SIR.18.31	If you allow yourself to satisfy your every desire, you will be a joke to your enemies. 
SIR.18.32	Don't indulge in luxurious living; the expense of it will ruin you. 
SIR.18.33	Don't make yourself a beggar by borrowing for expensive banquets when you don't have enough money of your own.
SIR.19.1	If you do, you
SIR.19.2	Wine and women make sensible men do foolish things. A man who goes to prostitutes gets more and more careless, 
SIR.19.3	and that carelessness will cost him his life. Worms will feed on his decaying body.
SIR.19.4	It is silly to trust people too quickly. If you sin, you are hurting yourself. 
SIR.19.5	If wickedness makes you happy, you will be condemned.
SIR.19.6	Avoid idle talk, and you will avoid a lot of trouble. 
SIR.19.7	Never repeat what you hear, and you will have no regrets. 
SIR.19.8	Don't tell it to your friends or your enemies unless it would be sinful to keep it to yourself. 
SIR.19.9	Whoever hears you will take note of it, and sooner or later will hate you for it. 
SIR.19.10	Have you heard a rumor? Let it die with you. Be brave! It won't make you explode. 
SIR.19.11	A foolish person trying to keep a secret suffers like a woman in labor. 
SIR.19.12	Any time he hears a secret, it's like an arrow stuck in his leg.
SIR.19.13	If you hear that a friend has done something wrong, ask him about it. Maybe it isn't true. If it is true, he won't do it again. 
SIR.19.14	If you hear that a neighbor has said something he shouldn't, ask him about it. Maybe he didn't say it. If he did, he won't say it again. 
SIR.19.15	If you hear something bad about a friend, ask him about it. It might be a lie. Don't believe everything you hear. 
SIR.19.16	A person may say something carelessly and not really mean it. Everyone has sinned in this way at one time or another. 
SIR.19.17	If you hear something that makes you angry with your neighbor, ask him about it before you threaten him. Leave the matter to the Law of the Most High.
SIR.19.20	Fear the Lord and keep his Law; that is what Wisdom is all about.
SIR.19.22	You may know everything there is to know about wickedness, but that does not make you wise. It is not sensible to follow the advice of sinners. 
SIR.19.23	It is possible to use cleverness for wicked purposes, but some people act like fools because they don't know any better. 
SIR.19.24	A devout person, even if he is not very intelligent, is better off than the cleverest of sinners. 
SIR.19.25	It is possible to be marvelously clever and still be dishonest, or to get what you want by being absurdly polite.
SIR.19.26	Then there are those wicked people who go about looking very solemn and mournful, but who are only trying to deceive you. 
SIR.19.27	They will turn their faces away and pretend not to hear you, but they'll take advantage of you when you least expect it. 
SIR.19.28	If for some reason they are unable to sin now, they'll get around to it at the first opportunity. 
SIR.19.29	You can know people by their appearance. The first time you look at them, you can tell if they have good sense. 
SIR.19.30	Their character shows in the way they dress, the way they laugh, and the way they walk.
SIR.20.1	A person can be rebuked in the wrong way; it may be wiser to keep quiet than to speak. 
SIR.20.2	But it is much better to rebuke the person than to keep your anger bottled up. 
SIR.20.3	Admit when you are wrong, and you will avoid embarrassment. 
SIR.20.4	Using force to get a point across is like a castrated man trying to rape a young woman. 
SIR.20.5	Some people are thought to be wise because they don't talk much; others are disliked because they talk too much. 
SIR.20.6	Some people keep quiet because they don't have anything to say; others keep quiet because they know the right time to speak. 
SIR.20.7	A wise person will not speak until the right moment, but a bragging fool doesn't know when that time is. 
SIR.20.8	No one can stand a person who talks too long and will not give others a chance to speak.
SIR.20.9	Bad luck can sometimes lead to success, and a stroke of good luck can sometimes lead to loss.
SIR.20.10	Generosity will sometimes do you no good, but at other times it will repay you double.
SIR.20.11	Honor can be followed by disgrace, but there are people who have risen from obscurity to places of honor.
SIR.20.12	Sometimes what seems like a real bargain can turn out to be a very expensive mistake.
SIR.20.13	When a person with good judgment speaks, he wins friends. A stupid person, though, can shower compliments on everybody, and it won't help him a bit. 
SIR.20.14	If such a person gives you something, it won't do any good; it won't be as valuable as he thinks it is.
SIR.20.15	He isn't generous with anything but criticism, which he will shout for all the world to hear. If he lends you something today, he'll want it back tomorrow. (Don't you hate people like that?) 
SIR.20.16	Then that fool will say, “Nobody likes me. Nobody appreciates what I do for them. They'll take what I give them, but then talk about me behind my back.” 
SIR.20.17	And he's right—he's a constant joke to everyone.
SIR.20.18	A slip of the tongue is worse than a slip on the pavement; the wicked will go to ruin just as suddenly as a person slips and falls.
SIR.20.19	An impolite person is like one of those off-color stories that ignorant people are always telling.
SIR.20.20	Nobody takes a proverb seriously when some fool quotes it at the wrong time.
SIR.20.21	If a person is too poor to afford sin, he can rest without a guilty conscience.
SIR.20.22	You can lose all your self-respect by being reluctant to speak up in the presence of stupidity.
SIR.20.23	If you promise a friend something because you are too bashful to say no, you're needlessly making an enemy.
SIR.20.24	Lying is an ugly blot on a person's character, but ignorant people do it all the time. 
SIR.20.25	A thief is better than a habitual liar, but both are headed for ruin. 
SIR.20.26	A liar has no honor. He lives in constant disgrace.
SIR.20.27	Speak wisely, and you will get ahead in the world. Influential people appreciate good sense. 
SIR.20.28	They will excuse your errors if they like you, so cultivate the soil and reap the harvest!
SIR.20.29	Gifts and bribes make even the wise blind to the truth, and prevent them from being honest in their criticism.
SIR.20.30	Wisdom that is not expressed is like a treasure that has been hidden—both are useless. 
SIR.20.31	But a person who covers up his foolishness is better than one who keeps his wisdom to himself.
SIR.21.1	My child, have you sinned? Don't do it again, and pray for forgiveness for what you have already done. 
SIR.21.2	Avoid sin as if it were a snake. If you get too near, it will sink its teeth into your soul like a lion, and destroy you. 
SIR.21.3	Every lawless act leaves an incurable wound, like one left by a double-edged sword.
SIR.21.4	If a person is insolent and arrogant, he may lose everything he has.
SIR.21.6	If you refuse to accept correction, you are committing a sin; and if you fear the Lord, you will make a sincere change in your ways.
SIR.21.7	Someone may be famous as a good speaker, but when he is wrong, a sensible person will detect it.
SIR.21.8	Anyone who borrows money to build a house is just collecting stones for his own tomb.
SIR.21.9	A group of people who have no respect for the Law is like a pile of kindling; they will meet a fiery end. 
SIR.21.10	The road that sinners walk is smooth and paved, but it leads to the world of the dead.
SIR.21.11	Whoever wants to keep the Law must learn what the Law means. If you fear the Lord in every sense of the term, you will have wisdom. 
SIR.21.12	You have to be intelligent to learn anything; but there is such a thing as just pretending to be intelligent, which only makes people bitter. 
SIR.21.13	A wise person's knowledge is like a river that never runs dry, like an everflowing stream of good advice.
SIR.21.14	A fool, on the other hand, has a mind like a jar with a hole in it; anything he learns is soon lost.
SIR.21.15	When an educated person hears something that shows insight, it stimulates his mind and leads him on to other ideas. But when someone who is satisfied with ignorance hears it, he won't like it, and will forget it as soon as he can. 
SIR.21.16	Listening to a foolish person talk is like traveling with a heavy load on your back, but it is a pleasure to hear what intelligent people have to say. 
SIR.21.17	The assembly will be eager to hear from an intelligent person and will take his opinion seriously.
SIR.21.18	To an ignorant person, wisdom is as useless as a house gone to ruin. He has never even thought about the things he is so sure of. 
SIR.21.19	To a person without any sense, an education is like handcuffs, 
SIR.21.20+SIR.21.21	but to a sensible person, it is like gold bracelets. An intelligent person will smile quietly while a fool roars with laughter. 
SIR.21.22+SIR.21.23	A stupid person will peep into someone's house through the door and then march right in, but someone with experience and good manners will have enough respect to wait outside. 
SIR.21.24	Eavesdropping at doors is bad manners, and anyone with a sense of decency would be ashamed to do it.
SIR.21.25	Presumptuous people talk about things that are none of their business,
SIR.21.26	Fools say whatever comes to mind; wise people think before they speak.
SIR.21.27	When a wicked person curses his enemy
SIR.21.28	A gossip ruins his own character, and everyone in the neighborhood hates him.
SIR.22.1+SIR.22.2	Lazy people are no better than dung; they are repulsive, and no one wants to get near them.
SIR.22.3	It is a disgrace to a father to have an undisciplined child, especially if it is a daughter. 
SIR.22.4	A sensible daughter will get a husband, but a shameless daughter brings her father grief. 
SIR.22.5	A girl with no sense of propriety will disgrace both her husband and her father; neither will have any respect for her.
SIR.22.6	Lecturing your children can sometimes be as out of place as singing to people in mourning, but a whipping is a wise choice of discipline at any time.
SIR.22.7	Trying to teach a fool is like gluing a broken pot back together, like waking someone out of a deep sleep. 
SIR.22.8	Explaining something to a fool is like explaining it to a sleepy person; when you have finished, he'll say, “What was that again?”
SIR.22.11	We mourn for the dead because they have no access to light. We ought to mourn for fools, because they have no access to intelligence. In fact, we should go into deeper mourning for fools, because the life they lead is worse than death. The dead are at least at rest. 
SIR.22.12	 For seven days we mourn the dead, but a foolish or ungodly person causes a lifetime of grief.
SIR.22.13	Don't visit stupid people or spend a lot of time talking with them. Avoid them; then they can't contaminate you, and you can live in peace without being troubled or worn down by their foolishness. 
SIR.22.14	Such people are a heavier burden to bear than lead; and the only word that fits them is “fools.” 
SIR.22.15	It is easier to carry a load of sand, salt, and iron than to put up with a stupid person.
SIR.22.16	A wooden beam can be put into a building so firmly that an earthquake cannot shake it loose; a person can be trained to use reason and good sense so well that he keeps his head when a crisis comes. 
SIR.22.17	A mind that thinks things through intelligently is like a firm wall, finely decorated. 
SIR.22.18	Small stones on top of a wall
SIR.22.19	If you stick something in your eye, tears will flow; and if you hurt a person deeply, you will discover his true feelings. 
SIR.22.20	If you throw rocks at birds, you will scare them away; and if you insult a friend, you will break up the friendship. 
SIR.22.21+SIR.22.22	Even if you have a violent argument with a friend, and speak sharply, all is not lost. You can still make up with him. But any friend will leave you if you insult him, if you are arrogant, if you reveal his secrets, or if you turn on him unexpectedly.
SIR.22.23	Gain the confidence of your neighbor if he is poor; then you can share his happiness if he becomes successful. Stand by him when he is in trouble if you want to share with him when better times come his way.
SIR.22.24	Fumes and smoke appear before the flames do; insults come before violence.
SIR.22.25	I will never be afraid to protect a friend, and I will never turn a friend away if he needs me. 
SIR.22.26	If I suffer because of him, everyone who learns of it will be on guard against him.
SIR.22.27	I wish that a guard could be placed at my mouth, that my lips could be wisely sealed. It would keep me from making mistakes and prevent me from destroying myself with my own tongue!
SIR.23.1	O Lord, my Father and Master of my life, do not leave me at the mercy of my own words; don't let them cause my downfall. 
SIR.23.2	I wish I could be whipped for my thoughts, so that Wisdom could discipline my mind. I would not want to be spared when I am wrong; I would not want a single sin to be overlooked! 
SIR.23.3	Then I would not keep on sinning, making one mistake after another. I could not fall to my enemies and be humiliated by them.
SIR.23.4	O Lord, my Father, God of my life, keep me from being arrogant; 
SIR.23.5	protect me from evil desires. 
SIR.23.6	Keep me from being overcome by greed or lust; do not leave me at the mercy of these shameless passions.
SIR.23.7	My children, listen to what I have to say about proper speech; do as I teach you and you will never get trapped. 
SIR.23.8	Sinners are caught by their own arrogant, insulting words.
SIR.23.10	A slave who is constantly beaten will never be free of bruises; someone who is always taking an oath by the Holy Name will never be free of sin. 
SIR.23.11	Anyone who takes oaths all the time is sinful to the core, and punishment is never far away from his household. If he fails to fulfill his oath, he is guilty. If he ignores his oath, he is twice as guilty. If his oath was insincere in the first place, he cannot be pardoned and will have a house full of trouble.
SIR.23.12	There is one way of speaking that is like death itself—may no Israelite ever be guilty of it! Devout people do not wallow in such sin, and they will keep away from such behavior. 
SIR.23.13	Don't fall into the habit of coarse, profane talk; it is sinful. 
SIR.23.14	You might forget yourself while in the company of important people and make a fool of yourself with some foul word that comes to you naturally. Think how your parents would feel! You would curse the day you were born and wish you were dead! 
SIR.23.15	If you fall into the habit of using offensive language, you will never break yourself of it as long as you live.
SIR.23.16	There are any number of ways to sin and bring down the Lord's anger, but sexual passion is a hot, blazing fire that cannot be put out at will; it can only burn itself out. A man who lives for nothing but sexual enjoyment will keep on until that fire destroys him. 
SIR.23.17	To such a man all women are desirable, and he can never get enough as long as he lives.
SIR.23.18	The man who is unfaithful to his wife thinks to himself, “No one will ever know. It's dark in here, and no one sees me. I have nothing to worry about. As for the Most High, he won't even notice.” 
SIR.23.19	This man is only afraid of other people. He doesn't realize that the eyes of the Lord are 10,000 times brighter than the sun, that he sees everything we do, even when we try to hide it. 
SIR.23.20	He knew everything before he created the world, as well as after. 
SIR.23.21	That sinful man will be caught when he least expects it, and punished publicly.
SIR.23.22	The same is true of a woman who is unfaithful to her husband and presents him with a child by another man. 
SIR.23.23	In the first place, she has broken the Law of the Most High. In the second place, she has wronged her husband. And in the third place, she has made a whore of herself by committing adultery and bearing the child of a man not her husband. 
SIR.23.24+SIR.23.25	The children will suffer for her sin. They will not be able to find a place in society or establish families. She herself will be brought before the assembly 
SIR.23.26	and permanently disgraced. There will be a curse on her memory. After she is gone, 
SIR.23.27	everyone will realize that nothing is better than fearing the Lord, nothing is sweeter than keeping his commands.
SIR.24.1	Listen to Wisdom! She proudly sings her own praises among the Israelites, her own people, 
SIR.24.2	in the assembly of the Most High, in the presence of his power.
SIR.24.3	“I am the word spoken by the Most High.
SIR.24.3	I covered the earth like a mist.
SIR.24.4	my throne on a pillar of cloud.
SIR.24.5	Alone I walked around the circle of the sky
SIR.24.5	and walked through the ocean beneath the earth.
SIR.24.6	I ruled over
SIR.24.6	over every nation, over every people.
SIR.24.7	I looked everywhere for a place to settle,
SIR.24.7	some part of the world to make my home.
SIR.24.8	Then my Creator, who created the universe,
SIR.24.8	told me where I was to live.
SIR.24.8	‘Make your home in Israel,’ he said.
SIR.24.8	‘The descendants of Jacob will be your people.’
SIR.24.9	He created me in eternity, before time began,
SIR.24.9	and I will exist for all eternity to come.
SIR.24.10	I served him in the Sacred Tent
SIR.24.10	and then made my home on Mount Zion.
SIR.24.11	He settled me in the Beloved City
SIR.24.11	and gave me authority over Jerusalem.
SIR.24.12	I put down roots among an honored people
SIR.24.12	whom the Lord had chosen as his own.
SIR.24.13	I grew tall, like the cedars in Lebanon,
SIR.24.13	like the cypresses on Mount Hermon,
SIR.24.14	like the palm trees of Engedi,
SIR.24.14	like the roses of Jericho,
SIR.24.14	like beautiful olive trees in the fields,
SIR.24.14	like plane trees growing by the water.
SIR.24.15	My breath was the spicy smell of cinnamon,
SIR.24.15	of sweet perfume and finest myrrh,
SIR.24.15	of stacte, onycha, and galbanum,
SIR.24.15	the fragrant incense in the Sacred Tent.
SIR.24.16	Like an oak I spread out my branches,
SIR.24.16	magnificent and graceful.
SIR.24.17	Like a grapevine I put out lovely shoots;
SIR.24.17	my blossoms gave way to rich and glorious fruit.
SIR.24.19	Come to me, all you that want me,
SIR.24.19	and eat your fill of my fruit.
SIR.24.20	You will remember me as sweeter than honey,
SIR.24.20	better than honey from the comb.
SIR.24.21	Eat me, and you will hunger for more;
SIR.24.21	drink me, and you will thirst for more.
SIR.24.22	Obey me, and you will never have cause for embarrassment;
SIR.24.22	do as I say, and you will be safe from sin.”
SIR.24.23	Wisdom is the Law, the Law which Moses commanded us to keep, the covenant of God Most High, the inheritance of the synagogues of Israel.
SIR.24.25	The Law overflows with Wisdom like the Pishon River, like the Tigris at fruit-picking time. 
SIR.24.26	The Law brims over with understanding like the Euphrates, like the Jordan at harvest time. 
SIR.24.27	It sparkles with teachings like the Nile,
SIR.24.28	The first human being ever created never knew Wisdom completely, and the last person on earth will be no more successful. 
SIR.24.29	The possibilities of Wisdom are vaster than the ocean; her resources are more profound than the deepest waters beneath the earth.
SIR.24.30	As for me, I thought of myself as an irrigation canal bringing water from a river into a garden. 
SIR.24.31	I only intended to water my orchard and flower beds, but the canal soon became a river, and the river became a sea. 
SIR.24.32	And so I present you with my learning; I hold it high, so that its light can be seen everywhere, like that of the rising sun. 
SIR.24.33	Like an inspired prophet, I pour out my teachings, so that future generations can benefit from them. 
SIR.24.34	Please realize that I have not done all this hard work for myself alone, but to help anyone who wants to be wise.
SIR.25.1	There are three things in which I take special delight—things that are beautiful to the Lord and people alike:
SIR.25.1	brothers who get along with each other,
SIR.25.1	neighbors who are friends,
SIR.25.1	and a married couple who are happy together.
SIR.25.2	There are three kinds of people I cannot stand, whose behavior I find highly offensive:
SIR.25.2	poor people who are arrogant,
SIR.25.2	rich people who lie,
SIR.25.2	and foolish old men who commit adultery.
SIR.25.3	Unless you learn what you can while you are young, you will never be wise when you reach old age. 
SIR.25.4	Sound judgment, good advice, and gray hair go together beautifully. 
SIR.25.5	Wisdom, understanding, and sound counsel are appropriate to the aged and the respected. 
SIR.25.6	Elderly people wear the crown of long experience, and they can boast of nothing finer than their fear of the Lord.
SIR.25.7	I will tell you about ten kinds of people that I feel fortunate to know, especially fortunate in the case of the tenth:
SIR.25.7	someone who takes pride in his children,
SIR.25.7	someone who lives to see his enemies fall,
SIR.25.8	a man fortunate enough to have an understanding wife,
SIR.25.8	a married couple who are well-matched,
SIR.25.8	a person who never speaks sinfully,
SIR.25.8	a person who doesn't have to work for someone less competent than himself,
SIR.25.9	someone fortunate enough to have a real friend,
SIR.25.9	a person that people are happy to listen to,
SIR.25.10	and the really great one: someone who is wise.
SIR.25.10	But the greatest one of all is the person who fears the Lord.
SIR.25.11	Such a person has no equal, because the fear of the Lord is the most important thing in the world.
SIR.25.13	No wound is as serious as wounded love. No troubles are as serious as the troubles that women cause. 
SIR.25.14	No sufferings are worse than the sufferings caused by people who hate you. No revenge is worse than revenge taken by an enemy. 
SIR.25.15	No poison is deadlier than the poison of a snake, and no anger is deadlier than the anger of a woman.
SIR.25.16	I would rather live in the same house with a lion or a dragon than with a bad wife. 
SIR.25.17	When a wife is in a bad mood, her expression changes until she looks like an angry bear. 
SIR.25.18	Her husband has to go and eat with the neighbors, where he can't hold back his bitter sighs.
SIR.25.19	Compared with the troubles caused by a woman, any other trouble looks small. May such women suffer the fate of sinners!
SIR.25.20	A quiet man living with a nagging wife is like an old man climbing up a sandy hill.
SIR.25.21	Never lose your head over a woman's beauty, and don't try to win a woman because she is wealthy.
SIR.25.22	When a man is supported by his wife, there is sure to be anger, arrogance, and humiliation. 
SIR.25.23	A bad wife will make her husband gloomy and depressed, and break his heart. Show me a timid man who can never make up his mind, and I will show you a wife who doesn't make her husband happy. 
SIR.25.24	Sin began with a woman, and we must all die because of her. 
SIR.25.25	Don't let a bad wife have her way, any more than you would allow water to leak from your cistern. 
SIR.25.26	If she won't do as you tell her, divorce her.
SIR.26.1	The husband of a good wife is a fortunate man; he will live twice as long because of her. 
SIR.26.2	A fine wife is a joy to her husband, and he can live out his years in peace. 
SIR.26.3	A good wife is among the precious blessings given to those who fear the Lord. 
SIR.26.4	Whether such men are rich or poor, they will be happy and always look cheerful.
SIR.26.5	There are four things that scare me: vicious rumors spread around town, a gathering mob, false accusations—these are all worse than death. 
SIR.26.6	But a woman jealous of another woman causes heartache and grief; her tongue lashes out at everyone.
SIR.26.7	A bad wife is like a yoke that doesn't fit. Trying to control her is like holding a scorpion. 
SIR.26.8	A drunken woman is an infuriating sight; she can't conceal her shameless behavior. 
SIR.26.9	You can tell an unfaithful wife by the bold and flirting look in her eyes.
SIR.26.10	If your daughter is determined to have her own way, keep a close watch on her. If you don't, she'll take advantage of any chance she gets. 
SIR.26.11	If she is too self-willed, be on guard, and don't be surprised if she disappoints you. 
SIR.26.12	She'll spread her legs anywhere for any man who wants her, just as a thirsty traveler will drink whatever water is available.
SIR.26.13	A gracious wife is her husband's delight; her abilities make him a stronger man.
SIR.26.14	A wife who doesn't talk too much is a gift from the Lord. Such restraint is admirable beyond words. 
SIR.26.15	A modest wife has endless charm; it is a quality too precious to measure. 
SIR.26.16	The beauty of a good wife in her well-kept home is like the noonday sun shining in the Lord's sky. 
SIR.26.17	Her beautiful face and attractive figure are
SIR.26.18	and like its gold shaft set on its silver base are her shapely legs and strong ankles.
SIR.26.28	There are two things that make me sad, and a third that makes me angry:
SIR.26.28	a soldier who has become poor,
SIR.26.28	intelligent people who are not respected,
SIR.26.28	and a righteous person who turns to evil.
SIR.26.28	The Lord will punish such a person with death!
SIR.26.29	A merchant can hardly avoid doing wrong; every salesman is guilty of sin.
SIR.27.1	Many people have sinned while looking for a profit; if you want to be rich you have to keep blinders on your eyes. 
SIR.27.2	It is hard to remove a peg that is stuck between two stones of a house, and it is just as hard to remove dishonesty from buying and selling. 
SIR.27.3	Unless you are determined in your fear of the Lord, your house is going to come down on you.
SIR.27.4	Your talk shows your faults; it is like a sieve that separates out the rubbish. 
SIR.27.5	The way you think shows your character just as surely as a kiln shows any flaws in the pottery being fired. 
SIR.27.6	 You can tell how well a tree has been cared for by the fruit it bears, and you can tell a person's feelings by the way he expresses himself. 
SIR.27.7	Never praise anyone before you hear him talk; that is the real test.
SIR.27.8	If you try to be honest, you can be, and it will improve your character as handsome clothing improves your appearance. 
SIR.27.9	Birds come to roost with those of their own kind, and the habit of honesty comes to those who try to be honest. 
SIR.27.10	Sin waits for those looking for a chance to sin, just as a lion waits for prey.
SIR.27.11	When devout people talk, what they say always makes sense, but foolish people are always contradicting themselves. 
SIR.27.12	When you find yourself with stupid people, look for some excuse to leave, but when you are with serious-minded people, stay as long as you can.
SIR.27.13	The stories that foolish people tell are offensive, and they make jokes about the worst kinds of sin. 
SIR.27.14	When such people curse, it is enough to make your hair stand on end, and when they start arguing among themselves, all you can do is to stop up your ears. 
SIR.27.15	It is painful to listen to them insult each other, and such blustering can lead to violence.
SIR.27.17	Respect your friends, and keep faith with them. If you do betray a friend's confidence, you may as well forget you have a friend. 
SIR.27.18	You have killed that friendship just as surely as if you had taken a weapon and killed an enemy. 
SIR.27.19	Your friend is gone. You can no more get him back than you can get a bird to come back to your hand once you let it go. 
SIR.27.20	Don't bother going after him. It's too late. He is gone, like a deer escaped from a trap. 
SIR.27.21	Wounds can be bandaged and insults can be forgiven, but if you betray a confidence, it is hopeless.
SIR.27.22	When someone starts winking at you, he has something bad in mind, and nothing can stop him from going through with it. 
SIR.27.23	When he's with you, his talk is so nice! He compliments you on every word you say. But behind your back it's a different story; he will take what you have said and turn it against you. 
SIR.27.24	There is nothing in the world that I hate as much as a person like that—and the Lord hates him too.
SIR.27.25	Throw a stone straight up in the air and it will come down on your head. Strike a blow, and you yourself will be wounded. 
SIR.27.26	People who set traps fall into them themselves. 
SIR.27.27	People who hurt others will be hurt by their own actions and will have no idea why.
SIR.27.28	Arrogant people insult others and make fun of them,
SIR.27.29	Those who are happy to witness the downfall of devout people are going to fall into a trap and die a painful death.
SIR.27.30	Anger and a hot temper are horrible things, but sinners have both.
SIR.28.1	The Lord is taking note of your sins, and if you take vengeance on someone, the Lord will take vengeance on you. 
SIR.28.2	 But if you forgive someone who has wronged you, your sins will be forgiven when you pray. 
SIR.28.3	You cannot expect the Lord to pardon you while you are holding a grudge against someone else. 
SIR.28.4	You yourself are a sinner, and if you won't forgive another person, you have no right to pray that the Lord will forgive your sins. 
SIR.28.5	If you cannot get rid of your anger, you have no hope of forgiveness—you are only a human being. 
SIR.28.6	Think about it! Some day you will die, and your body will decay. So give up hate and live by the Lord's commands, 
SIR.28.7	the commands in the covenant of the Most High. Instead of getting upset over your neighbor's faults, overlook them.
SIR.28.8	If you stay out of arguments, you will not sin so much, because a hot temper gets them started. 
SIR.28.9	It is sinful to break up a friendship by creating hostility among people who get along well together. 
SIR.28.10	The more fuel, the hotter the fire. The more stubbornness, the hotter the argument. And the stronger or richer people are, the angrier they can afford to become. 
SIR.28.11	An argument that blazes out suddenly can lead to violence. 
SIR.28.12	You can blow on a spark to make it glow, or you can spit on it to put it out. Either way, you do it with your mouth.
SIR.28.14	Many have had their lives ruined and have been driven from their homes because of people who meddled in their business. Such unwanted interference has resulted in the destruction of strong cities and the homes of respected people. 
SIR.28.15	Meddlers have caused faithful wives to be divorced, robbed of everything they had worked for. 
SIR.28.16	Anyone who pays attention to slander can never find peace of mind. 
SIR.28.17	A whip can raise a welt, but a vicious tongue can break bones. 
SIR.28.18	More people have died as a result of loose talk than were ever killed by swords. 
SIR.28.19+SIR.28.20	Count yourself lucky if you have been spared the experience of having irresponsible talk directed against you—if you have never had that iron yoke around your neck or those heavy chains on your legs. 
SIR.28.21	Slander leads to a miserable death; but in fact, you'd be better off dead.
SIR.28.22	Devout people, however, cannot be overcome by slander; they cannot be burned by its flames. 
SIR.28.23	Its victims are those who have abandoned the Lord; once the fire of slander has been lit among them, it cannot be put out. Slander will pounce on them like a lion and tear them to pieces like a leopard.
SIR.28.24	Don't you fence in your property? Don't you lock up your money? 
SIR.28.25	Well, be just as careful with what you say. Weigh every word, and have a lock ready for your mouth. 
SIR.28.26	Someone may be waiting for you to slip, and if you are not careful, you will stumble over your own words and fall down in front of him.
SIR.29.2	If he needs something, lend it to him. And when you are in debt, pay it back as soon as you can. 
SIR.29.3	If you meet your obligations, you will always be able to borrow what you need. 
SIR.29.4	Many people treat a loan as something they found and can keep, causing embarrassment to those who helped them. 
SIR.29.5	Some people will speak politely, bow, and scrape until they get the loan they want, but when the time comes to pay it back, they'll put it off, say that it's inconvenient, and make a lot of worthless excuses. 
SIR.29.6	If the lender insists on being paid, he can count himself lucky to get back half. If he doesn't insist, the borrower has robbed him and made an unnecessary enemy. All the lender will get from him are curses, insults, and disrespect, but never any gratitude.
SIR.29.7	Many people refuse to lend at all, not because they are stingy, but because
SIR.29.8	Nevertheless, be understanding with those who are poor. Don't keep them waiting for your generosity. 
SIR.29.9	The Lord has commanded us to help the poor; don't refuse them the help they need. 
SIR.29.10	It is better to lose your money by helping a relative or a friend than to lose it by letting it rust away under a rock somewhere. 
SIR.29.11	Use your wealth as the Most High has commanded; this will do you more good than keeping your money for yourself. 
SIR.29.12	Count among your treasures the fact that you give to the poor. It will save you from all kinds of trouble 
SIR.29.13	and will be a better defense against your enemies than the strongest shield or stoutest spear.
SIR.29.14	A good man is willing to guarantee his neighbor's debts. Only someone who has lost all sense of decency would refuse to do so. 
SIR.29.15	If someone does this favor for you, don't forget it; he has risked his good name for you. 
SIR.29.16	There are some ungrateful sinners who abandon those who stand behind them, and they cause them loss of property. 
SIR.29.17	Guaranteeing loans has ruined many prosperous people and caused them unsettling storms of trouble. 
SIR.29.18	Influential people have lost their homes over it and have had to go wandering in foreign countries. 
SIR.29.19	A sinner who hopes to make a profit by guaranteeing a loan is going to find himself involved in lawsuits. 
SIR.29.20	So help your neighbor as much as you can, but protect yourself against the dangers involved.
SIR.29.21	The necessities of life are water, food, clothing, and a home where you can have privacy. 
SIR.29.22	It is better to be poor and live under your own crude roof than to enjoy lavish banquets in other people's homes. 
SIR.29.23	Be happy with what you have, even if it isn't very much, and don't listen to anyone who would insult your home and family.
SIR.29.24	Going from house to house is a miserable way to live. Anywhere you go, you don't dare speak. 
SIR.29.25	You welcome the guests and pour the drinks, and nobody thanks you. Instead, people humiliate you by saying things like: 
SIR.29.26	“Stranger! Come here and set the table! I want to eat what you've got there! Give it here! 
SIR.29.27	Go away, stranger! I've got an important guest! My brother is coming to visit, and I need the room!”
SIR.29.28	Being denied hospitality or having a moneylender hound you—these are hard things for any sensitive person to endure.
SIR.30.1	A father who loves his son will whip him often, so that he can be proud of him later. 
SIR.30.2	If a son is disciplined, he will be of some use, and his father can boast of him to his friends. 
SIR.30.3	Anyone who gives good guidance to his son cannot only take pride in him among his friends, but he can make his enemies jealous. 
SIR.30.4+SIR.30.5	While the father is alive, the sight of his son makes him happy, and when he dies, he has no regrets. He is not really dead, because his son is like him. 
SIR.30.6	He has left someone to take vengeance on his enemies and to return the favors he owes his friends.
SIR.30.7	But anyone who spoils his son will have to bandage his wounds.
SIR.30.8	An untamed horse is going to be stubborn, and an undisciplined son is no different. 
SIR.30.9	If you pamper your child and play with him, he will be a disappointment and a source of grief. 
SIR.30.10	Laugh with him now, and one day you will have to cry over him, grinding your teeth in regret. 
SIR.30.11	Don't give him freedom while he is young, and don't overlook what he does wrong. 
SIR.30.12	Whip him while he is still a child, and make him respect your authority. If you don't, he will be stubborn and disobedient and cause you nothing but sorrow. 
SIR.30.13	So discipline your son and give him work to do, or else he will be an embarrassment to you.
SIR.30.14	It is better to be poor, but strong and healthy, than to be rich, but in poor health. 
SIR.30.15	A sound, healthy body and a cheerful attitude
SIR.30.16	Nothing can make you richer or give you greater happiness than those two things. 
SIR.30.17	It would be better to be dead, asleep forever, than to live in the misery of chronic illness. 
SIR.30.18	The finest food means nothing if you are too sick to eat it; it might as well be offered to an idol.
SIR.30.19	But there is no point in offering food to an idol; it can't eat it or smell it. It is just the same with someone whom the Lord has afflicted. 
SIR.30.20	He looks at his food and sighs, like a castrated man hugging a young woman.
SIR.30.22	Happiness makes for a long life and makes it worth living. 
SIR.30.23	Enjoy yourself and be happy; don't worry all the time. Worry never did anybody any good, and it has destroyed many people. 
SIR.30.24	It will make you old before your time. Jealousy and anger will shorten your life. 
SIR.30.25	A cheerful person with a good attitude will have a good appetite and enjoy his food.
SIR.31.1	Worrying about money will make you lose weight and lose sleep. 
SIR.31.2	Worrying about business
SIR.31.3	Rich people work hard to make a lot of money; then they can sit back and live in luxury. 
SIR.31.4	Poor people work hard and have nothing to show for it, and when they rest, they are still poor.
SIR.31.5	No one who loves money can be judged innocent; his efforts to get rich have led him into sin.
SIR.31.6	Many people have been ruined because of money, brought face-to-face with disaster. 
SIR.31.7	Money is a trap for those who are fascinated by it, a trap that every fool falls into.
SIR.31.8	A person who gets rich without sinfully chasing after money is fortunate. 
SIR.31.9	Do you know anyone like that? If so, we will congratulate him for performing a miracle that no one else has ever been able to do. 
SIR.31.10	If anyone has ever passed this test, he can well be proud. Has anyone ever known that he could get away with cheating someone, and not taken advantage of it? 
SIR.31.11	If so, he deserves his wealth, and everyone will praise him for his generosity.
SIR.31.12	When you sit down at a fancy banquet, don't let your mouth hang open, and don't say, “Look at all that food!” 
SIR.31.13	It is impolite to have a greedy eye; remember that. Nothing in creation is greedier than the eye; that is why it sheds tears so often.
SIR.31.14	Don't reach out for everything you see, and don't elbow people out of the way to get at the food. 
SIR.31.15	Be considerate of the other people at the table and treat them the way you want to be treated. 
SIR.31.16	When you get your food, eat it like a human being. Don't smack and slurp; nobody can stand that. 
SIR.31.17	It's good manners to be the first to stop eating; stuffing yourself is offensive. 
SIR.31.18	If there are many people present, don't try to be the first to be served. 
SIR.31.19	A little bit is plenty for anyone with good manners. Besides, you won't be short of breath when you go to bed. 
SIR.31.20	People who eat too much get stomach aches and cannot sleep. If you don't overeat, you can get a good night's sleep and wake up early the next morning feeling fine. 
SIR.31.21	But if you do get a stomach ache from eating too much, go off and vomit
SIR.31.22	My child, if you listen to what I am saying and put it into practice, one of these days you will thank me for it. Be moderate
SIR.31.23	People appreciate a generous host, and he deserves their praise. 
SIR.31.24	But everybody in town will complain about a host who is stingy with food, and their complaints are justified.
SIR.31.25	Don't try to prove your manhood by how much you can drink. Wine has been the ruin of many. 
SIR.31.26	An arrogant person's character shows through when he is in a drunken argument, in the same way that iron is tested when it is heated red-hot and then dipped in water. 
SIR.31.27	Wine can put new life into you if you drink it in moderation. What would life be like without it? Wine was created to make us happy. 
SIR.31.28	If you drink it in moderation and at the right time, it can lift your spirits and make you cheerful, 
SIR.31.29	but if you drink when you are angry and upset, it leads to headaches, embarrassment, and disgrace.
SIR.31.30	A drunken fool can lose his temper and hurt himself. His drinking makes him weak and an easy target for angry blows. 
SIR.31.31	Never rebuke a person when you have both been drinking. Don't hurt his feelings while he is having a good time. It's not the time to criticize anyone, or to ask him to pay back a debt.
SIR.32.1	If you are chosen to preside at a banquet, don't put on airs. Just be like everyone else. Look after the guests before you sit down. 
SIR.32.2	After you have performed your duties, you can sit down and enjoy yourself with the others. They will respect you for doing a good job.
SIR.32.3	If you are older than most of the guests, you may talk; that is your right. But you should know what you are talking about and not interrupt the music. 
SIR.32.4	If entertainment is being provided, don't keep up a steady conversation; it's the wrong time to show off your wit. 
SIR.32.5	Music at a banquet where wine is served is like a ruby set in gold. 
SIR.32.6	Good music and good wine—an emerald set in gold.
SIR.32.7	If you are young, don't speak unless you have to, but never more than twice, and only if someone speaks to you first. 
SIR.32.8	Come to the point and say it all in a few words. Show that you are well-informed, but stay quiet. 
SIR.32.9	Don't treat important people as if you were their equal and don't make a nuisance of yourself by asking them a lot of questions.
SIR.32.10	The reputation of a modest person goes before him, as lightning before thunder.
SIR.32.11	Leave the party at the right time and never be the last to go. Don't linger at the door; just go straight home. 
SIR.32.12	There you can enjoy yourself as you wish, but don't commit the sin of bragging. 
SIR.32.13	And don't forget to thank your Creator for letting you enjoy so many good things.
SIR.32.14	If you fear the Lord, you will accept his correction. He will bless those who get up early in the morning to pray. 
SIR.32.15	Study his Law, and you will master it, unless you are insincere about it, in which case you will fail. 
SIR.32.16	If you fear the Lord, you will know what is right, and you will be famous for your fairness. 
SIR.32.17	Sinners have no use for correction, and will interpret the Law to suit themselves.
SIR.32.18	Sensible people will consider every opinion, but arrogant
SIR.32.19	Never do anything without thinking it through, and once you have done something, don't look back and wish you had done something else. 
SIR.32.20	Don't take a course of action that is dangerous, and don't make the same mistake twice.
SIR.32.21	Don't be too sure of yourself, even when the way looks easy. 
SIR.32.22	Always watch where you are going.
SIR.32.23	Whatever you do be careful;
SIR.32.24	Believing in the Law means keeping the Lord's commands.
SIR.32.24	If you trust the Lord, you cannot lose.
SIR.33.1	No evil will ever come to a person who fears the Lord; however often danger comes, the Lord will come to the rescue. 
SIR.33.2	A person who has no use for the Law doesn't have good sense, and anyone who is insincere about it is going to be tossed about like a boat in a storm. 
SIR.33.3	 If you are wise, you will believe in the Law; you will find it as reliable as the sacred lots.
SIR.33.4	Prepare what you are going to say and people will listen to you. Use what you have learned before you start talking. 
SIR.33.5	A foolish person's mind works like a cartwheel, going round and round in circles. 
SIR.33.6	A sarcastic friend is like a wild horse that neighs no matter who tries to ride him.
SIR.33.7	Why are some days holier than others, even though the same sun rises on every day of the year? 
SIR.33.8	It is because the Lord made them different by setting them apart as religious holidays and festivals. 
SIR.33.9	He made some days holy and important, and made other days ordinary.
SIR.33.10	Every human being was made from the earth, just as Adam was. 
SIR.33.11	But the Lord, in his wisdom, made them all different and gave them different tasks. 
SIR.33.12	He blessed some, making them honored and holy, keeping them near him. Others he cursed, humbling them and removing them from their positions. 
SIR.33.13	Just as clay is in the potter's hands for him to shape as he pleases, so we are in the hands of our Creator for him to do with as he wishes.
SIR.33.14	Good is the opposite of evil, life is the opposite of death, and sin is the opposite of devotion to the Lord. 
SIR.33.15	Think about it: the Most High has made everything in pairs, each thing the opposite of something else.
SIR.33.16	As for me, I have been the last to come on duty, as if going through vineyards to gather whatever the grape-pickers had left behind. But the Lord blessed me, and I did well,
SIR.33.17	But I want you to know that I have not done all this work for myself alone, but for everyone who wants to learn. 
SIR.33.18	Listen to me, all you great leaders! All you leaders of the assemblies, hear what I have to say!
SIR.33.19	Never, as long as you live, give anyone power over you—whether son, wife, brother, or friend. Don't give your property to anyone; you might change your mind and have to ask for it back. 
SIR.33.20	As long as you have breath in your body, don't let anyone lead your life for you. 
SIR.33.21	It is better that your children be dependent on you than the other way around. 
SIR.33.22	Keep control over all that you do; don't let anything stain your reputation. 
SIR.33.23	Wait until the last moment of your life, when you are breathing your last, and then divide your property among your heirs.
SIR.33.24	A donkey should be given its fodder and its burden, and it should be beaten. A slave should be given food and work, and should be disciplined. 
SIR.33.25	If you make your slave work, you can set your mind at ease. If you don't keep him busy, he will be looking for freedom. 
SIR.33.26	You can use a harness and yoke to tame an animal, and a slave can be tortured in the stocks. 
SIR.33.27	Keep him at work, and don't let him be idle; idleness can only teach him how to make trouble. 
SIR.33.28	Work is what he needs. If he won't obey you, put him in chains.
SIR.33.29	But don't be too severe with anyone, and never be unfair. 
SIR.33.30	If you have a slave, treat him as you would want to be treated; you bought him with your hard-earned money. 
SIR.33.31	Treat him as a brother; you need him as you need yourself. If you mistreat him and he runs away, where are you going to look for him?
SIR.34.2	A person who pays any attention at all to dreams is like someone who tries to catch shadows or chase the wind. 
SIR.34.3	What you see in a dream is no more real than the reflection of your face in a mirror. 
SIR.34.4	What is unreal can no more produce something real than what is dirty can produce something clean. 
SIR.34.5	Dreams, divination, and omens are all nonsense. You see in them only what you want to see.
SIR.34.6	Unless the Most High has sent you the dream, pay no attention to it. 
SIR.34.7	Dreams have misled many people; they put their faith in them, only to be disappointed. 
SIR.34.8	The Law is complete without such falsehood. Wisdom, as spoken by the righteous, is also complete without it.
SIR.34.9	A well-traveled
SIR.34.10	You can't know much if you haven't experienced much, but travel can make you more clever. 
SIR.34.11	In my own travels I have seen many things and learned more than I can put into words. 
SIR.34.12	I have been in danger of death many times, but I have always been able to escape by relying on past experience.
SIR.34.13	Those who fear the Lord will live, because they have put their trust in the one who can save them. 
SIR.34.14	Fear the Lord, and you will have nothing else to fear. If your trust is in him, you will never act like a coward. 
SIR.34.15	People who fear the Lord are fortunate, because they know where they can look for help. 
SIR.34.16	The Lord watches over those who love him; he is their strong protection and firm support. He shelters them from the heat, shades them from the noonday sun, and keeps them from stumbling and falling. 
SIR.34.17	He makes them cheerful and puts a sparkle in their eyes. He blesses them with life and health.
SIR.34.18	If you offer as a sacrifice an animal that you have obtained dishonestly, it is defective and unacceptable. 
SIR.34.19	The Most High gets no pleasure from sacrifices made by ungodly people; no amount of sacrifices can make up for their sins. 
SIR.34.20	Anyone who steals an animal from the poor to offer as a sacrifice is like someone who kills a boy before his father's eyes. 
SIR.34.21	Food means life itself to poor people, and taking it away from them is murder. 
SIR.34.22	It is murder to deprive someone of his living or to cheat an employee of his wages.
SIR.34.23	When one person builds and somebody else tears down, has anything been accomplished but hard work? 
SIR.34.24	When one person blesses and somebody else curses, which one is the Lord going to listen to? 
SIR.34.25	If you touch a dead body and then purify yourself by washing, but then go and touch it again, what good did the washing do? 
SIR.34.26	If you fast because of your sins, and then go out and commit the same sins over again, what have you gained by going without food? Who do you think is going to listen to your prayers?
SIR.35.1	Keeping the Law is worth many offerings; it is a fellowship offering in itself. 
SIR.35.2	Returning a kindness is like a grain offering; giving to the poor is like a thanksgiving offering. 
SIR.35.3	Keeping away from sin will please the Lord and make atonement for sin. 
SIR.35.4	But don't come to the Temple without an offering; 
SIR.35.5	the Law requires that you bring one. 
SIR.35.6	When someone righteous offers a sacrifice and the fat drips down on the altar, a pleasant smell rises to the Most High. 
SIR.35.7	The Lord will accept the offerings made by a righteous person and will not forget them. 
SIR.35.8	Praise the Lord by making generous offerings to him; don't be stingy with the first of your crops. 
SIR.35.9	 Be cheerful with every gift you make, and when you pay your tithes, do it gladly. 
SIR.35.10	Give to the Most High as he has given to you, just as generously as you can. 
SIR.35.11	The Lord always repays and will do it many times over. 
SIR.35.12	But don't try to bribe him or rely on offerings that you have obtained dishonestly. He will not accept them.
SIR.35.12	The Lord is fair
SIR.35.13	He is not prejudiced against the poor; when someone prays who has been wronged, the Lord listens. 
SIR.35.14	When orphans and widows pour out their prayers, he does not ignore them. 
SIR.35.15	The tears running down a widow's cheek cry out in accusation against the one who has caused her distress.
SIR.35.16	Serve the Lord willingly, and the Lord will accept you; your prayers will reach the skies. 
SIR.35.17	The prayer of a humble person goes past the clouds and keeps on going until it reaches the Lord Most High, where it stays until he answers by seeing that justice is done and that the guilty are punished.
SIR.35.18	And the Lord will act quickly. He will show no patience with wicked people. He will take vengeance by crushing the heathen. He will completely wipe out the merciless and the arrogant, and will destroy the authority of the wicked. 
SIR.35.19	He will give each of us what our thoughts and actions deserve. Because of the Lord's mercy, his people will be happy when he has judged their case. 
SIR.35.20	In times of trouble his mercy is as welcome as rain after a long drought.
SIR.36.1	O Lord God of the universe, look upon us and have mercy. 
SIR.36.2	Make every nation stand in fear of you. 
SIR.36.3	Take action against the foreign nations, and let them witness your power! 
SIR.36.4	You have used us to show them how holy you are; now use them to show us how great you are. 
SIR.36.5	Let them learn, as we have learned, that there is no God, O Lord, but you. 
SIR.36.6	Give new signs, perform new miracles; show us your glorious strength! 
SIR.36.7+SIR.36.8+SIR.36.9	Bring on that appointed time when everyone can talk about the great things you do. Pour out your furious, flaming anger, and let none of our enemies survive. Destroy those who have oppressed your people. 
SIR.36.10	Crush all those enemy rulers who think they are the only people in the world who matter! 
SIR.36.11	Gather the tribes of Israel together again, and give them back their land as you gave it to them long ago. 
SIR.36.12	Lord, have mercy on Israel, the people who are known by your name, whom you called your first-born son. 
SIR.36.13	Take pity on Jerusalem, your holy city, where you chose to stay. 
SIR.36.14	Fill your Temple
SIR.36.15	Testify for your people, whom you created in the beginning; fulfill the prophecies that have been spoken in your name. 
SIR.36.16	Reward those who have put their faith in you, and vindicate your prophets. 
SIR.36.17	You have always been gracious to your people;
SIR.36.18	Any kind of food can be eaten, but some foods are better than others. 
SIR.36.19	And just as the tongue can distinguish the flavors of different kinds of meat, so a sharp mind can detect lies. 
SIR.36.20	A person with a warped mind causes trouble, but an experienced person knows how to pay it back.
SIR.36.21	A woman has to take any man as a husband, but a man must choose his wife carefully. 
SIR.36.22	A woman's beauty makes a man happy; there is no fairer sight for the human eye to see. 
SIR.36.23	If the woman is kind and gentle in her speech, her husband is the most fortunate of men. 
SIR.36.24	When a man marries, he gets the finest thing he will ever have—a wife to help and encourage him.
SIR.36.25	If property is not fenced in, thieves will wander in and help themselves. And if a man has no wife, he is a sighing wanderer; 
SIR.36.26	people have no more trust in a homeless person who sleeps in a different place every night than they have in a wandering thief who goes from town to town.
SIR.37.1	Anyone can claim to be your friend, but some people are friends in name only. 
SIR.37.2	The grief caused when a close friendship turns sour is as bad as death. 
SIR.37.3	This evil impulse we have! Why was it ever formed? How did it manage to cover the earth with deceit? 
SIR.37.4	Some people will be your friend as long as things are going well, but they will turn against you when trouble comes. 
SIR.37.5	A real
SIR.37.6	Never forget such companions in battle;
SIR.37.7	Anyone can give advice, but some people do so only in their own interest. 
SIR.37.8	Be careful when somebody offers you advice. Find out first what his interest in the matter is, because you can be sure that he is thinking primarily of himself. Why should he come out on top instead of you?
SIR.37.9	He will assure you that things look good, and then stand back to watch what happens to you.
SIR.37.10	Don't ask advice of anyone who doesn't trust you, and don't give advice to anyone who is jealous of you.
SIR.37.11	Don't ask a woman for advice about a rival of hers,
SIR.37.11	a coward about war,
SIR.37.11	a merchant about a bargain,
SIR.37.11	a buyer about selling,
SIR.37.11	a stingy person about gratitude,
SIR.37.11	a cruel person about kindness,
SIR.37.11	a lazy person about work,
SIR.37.11	a casual worker about finishing a job,
SIR.37.11	a lazy slave about a difficult task.
SIR.37.11	Pay no attention to any advice they may give.
SIR.37.12	Instead, rely on someone who is religious and known to keep the Lord's commands, someone who is sympathetic with you, who will be sorry to see you fail. 
SIR.37.13	And trust your own judgment; no one's advice is more reliable. 
SIR.37.14	Sometimes your own intuition can tell you more than seven watchmen on a high tower. 
SIR.37.15	Above all, pray to the Most High that he will show you the right thing to do.
SIR.37.16	Planning and thought lie behind everything that is done. 
SIR.37.17+SIR.37.18	The mind concerns itself with four things: these are good and evil, life and death. They all begin in the mind,
SIR.37.19	Someone may have the ability to teach, but still not be of much use to himself. 
SIR.37.20	He may be clever with words, but end up starving because people hate him. 
SIR.37.21	This may happen if he doesn't have good sense, if the Lord has not given him tact. 
SIR.37.22	Someone may consider himself wise and let you know that he is certain about what he knows. 
SIR.37.23	Anyone who really is wise will be the teacher of his people, and they can be certain that what he teaches is the truth. 
SIR.37.24	Everyone will praise such a person and speak of him as fortunate. 
SIR.37.25	A person's life has only a limited number of days, but the life of Israel cannot be measured in days at all. 
SIR.37.26	The wise will win the confidence of others, and will be remembered forever.
SIR.37.27	My child, as you go through life, keep your appetite under control, and don't eat anything that you know is bad for you. 
SIR.37.28	All food doesn't agree with everyone, and everyone doesn't like the same kinds of food. 
SIR.37.29	Don't feel that you just have to have all sorts of fancy food, and don't be a glutton over any food. 
SIR.37.30	If you eat too much, you'll get sick; if you do it all the time, you'll always have stomach trouble. 
SIR.37.31	Gluttony has been the death of many people. Avoid it and live longer.
SIR.38.1	Give doctors the honor they deserve, for the Lord gave them their work to do.
SIR.38.2	Their skill came from the Most High, and kings reward them for it. 
SIR.38.3	Their knowledge gives them a position of importance, and powerful people hold them in high regard.
SIR.38.4	The Lord created medicines from the earth, and a sensible person will not hesitate to use them. 
SIR.38.5	 Didn't a tree once make bitter water fit to drink, so that the Lord's power
SIR.38.6	He gave medical knowledge to human beings, so that we would praise him for the miracles he performs. 
SIR.38.7+SIR.38.8	The druggist mixes these medicines, and the doctor will use them to cure diseases and ease pain. There is no end to the activities of the Lord, who gives health to the people of the world.
SIR.38.9	My child, when you get sick, don't ignore it. Pray to the Lord, and he will make you well. 
SIR.38.10	Confess all your sins and determine that in the future you will live a righteous life. 
SIR.38.11	Offer incense and a grain offering, as fine as you can afford.
SIR.38.12	Then call the doctor—for the Lord created him—and keep him at your side; you need him. 
SIR.38.13	There are times when you have to depend on his skill. 
SIR.38.14	The doctor's prayer is that the Lord will make him able to ease his patients' pain and make them well again. 
SIR.38.15	As for the person who sins against his Creator, he deserves to be sick.
SIR.38.17	Weep bitterly and passionately; observe the proper period of mourning for the person. Mourn for a whole day or maybe two, to keep people from talking, but then pull yourself together and reconcile yourself to the loss. 
SIR.38.18	Grief can undermine your health and even lead to your own death. 
SIR.38.19	Grief lingers on after the death of a loved one, but it is not wise to let it lead you into poverty.
SIR.38.20	Don't lose yourself in sorrow; drive it away.
SIR.38.21	There is no way to bring the dead person back. All your sorrow does him no good, and it hurts you. Don't forget that. 
SIR.38.22	You will die, just as he did. Today it was his turn; tomorrow it will be yours. 
SIR.38.23	When the dead have been laid to rest, let the memory of them fade. Once they are gone, take courage.
SIR.38.24	Scholars must have time to study if they are going to be wise; they must be relieved of other responsibilities. 
SIR.38.25	How can a farm hand gain knowledge, when his only ambition is to drive the oxen and make them work, when all he knows to talk about is livestock? 
SIR.38.26	He takes great pains to plow a straight furrow and will work far into the night to feed the animals.
SIR.38.27	It is the same with the artist and the craftsman, who work night and day engraving precious stones, carefully working out new designs. They take great pains to produce a lifelike image, and will work far into the night to finish the work.
SIR.38.28	It is the same with the blacksmith at his anvil, planning what he will make from a piece of iron. The heat from the fire sears his skin as he sweats away at the forge. The clanging of the hammer deafens him
SIR.38.29	It is the same with the potter, sitting at his wheel and turning it with his feet, always concentrating on his work, concerned with how many objects he can produce. 
SIR.38.30	He works the clay with his feet until he can shape it with his hands; then he takes great pains to glaze it properly, and will work far into the night to clean out the kiln.
SIR.38.31	All of these people are skilled with their hands, each of them an expert at his own craft. 
SIR.38.32	Without such people there could be no cities; no one would live or visit where these services were not available. 
SIR.38.33	These people are not sought out to serve on the public councils, and they never attain positions of great importance. They do not serve as judges, and they do not understand legal matters. They have no education and are not known for their wisdom. You never hear them quoting proverbs. 
SIR.38.34	But the work they do holds this world together. When they do their work, it is the same as offering prayer.
SIR.39.1	But it is different with the person who devotes himself to studying the Law of the Most High. He examines the wisdom of all the ancient writers and concerns himself with the prophecies. 
SIR.39.2	He memorizes the sayings of famous men and is a skilled interpreter of parables. 
SIR.39.3	He studies the hidden meaning of proverbs and is able to discuss the obscure points of parables. 
SIR.39.4	Great people call on him for his services, and he is seen in the company of rulers. He travels to foreign lands in his efforts to learn about human good and evil. 
SIR.39.5	It is his practice to get up early and pray aloud to the Lord his Creator, asking the Most High to forgive his sins. 
SIR.39.6	Then, if the great Lord is willing, he will be filled with understanding. He will pour out a stream of wise sayings, and give thanks to the Lord in prayer. 
SIR.39.7	He will have knowledge to share and good advice to give, as well as insight into the Lord's secrets. 
SIR.39.8	He will demonstrate his learning in what he teaches,
SIR.39.9	He will be widely praised for his wisdom, and it will never be lost, because people for generations to come will remember him. 
SIR.39.10	The Gentiles will talk about his wisdom, and he will be praised aloud in the assembly. 
SIR.39.11	If he lives to old age, he will die famous, but if he is laid to rest before he is famous, he will be content.
SIR.39.12	Like the moon, I am full—full of more ideas to be discussed. 
SIR.39.13	Listen to me, you devout children of mine, and blossom like a rosebush on a stream bank. 
SIR.39.14	Bloom like a sweet-smelling lily, and send your fragrance into the air like incense. Sing the Lord's praises, and thank him for all that he has done. 
SIR.39.15	Proclaim his glory in grateful praise! To the music of the harp, sing this song:
SIR.39.16	All that the Lord has done is very good;
SIR.39.16	all that he commands is sooner or later done.
SIR.39.17	No one should ask why things are as they are;
SIR.39.17	these questions will be answered at the right time.
SIR.39.17	He commanded, and the water piled up high,
SIR.39.17	great walls of water arose when he spoke.
SIR.39.18	Whatever he commands is promptly done;
SIR.39.18	there are no limits to his power to save.
SIR.39.19	He sees all that every human being does;
SIR.39.19	there is no way to hide from his sight.
SIR.39.20	He sees the whole of time, from beginning to end,
SIR.39.20	and nothing takes him by surprise.
SIR.39.21	No one should ask why things are as they are;
SIR.39.21	everything in creation has its purpose.
SIR.39.22	His blessings overflow like the Nile,
SIR.39.22	enriching the world in a fertile flood.
SIR.39.23	He turns fresh water into salt water,
SIR.39.23	and he turns his anger on the nations.
SIR.39.24	For the devout, his ways are straight;
SIR.39.24	for the wicked, they are laid with traps.
SIR.39.25	From the beginning he has made good things for the good
SIR.39.25	and terrible things for sinners.
SIR.39.26	The basic needs of life are these:
SIR.39.26	water, fire, iron, and salt,
SIR.39.26	flour, honey, and milk,
SIR.39.26	wine, clothing, and oil.
SIR.39.27	All these things are good for those who are devout,
SIR.39.27	but they turn into evils for sinners.
SIR.39.28	There are winds that were created to bring punishment,
SIR.39.28	fierce enough to move mountains.
SIR.39.28	In times of judgment, they unleash their strength
SIR.39.28	and calm the anger of their maker.
SIR.39.29+SIR.39.30	Vicious animals, scorpions, and snakes;
SIR.39.29+SIR.39.30	the sword that destroys the wicked;
SIR.39.29+SIR.39.30	fire, hail, famine, and disease;
SIR.39.29+SIR.39.30	these have all been created as punishments.
SIR.39.31	They are all glad to obey the Lord's command
SIR.39.31	and are ready to serve him here on earth.
SIR.39.31	When their times of duty come,
SIR.39.31	they never disobey.
SIR.39.31	( 
SIR.39.32	I was long convinced of this, so after thinking it over I put
SIR.39.33	Everything made by the Lord is good;
SIR.39.33	he meets every need at the proper time.
SIR.39.34	No one can claim that some things are worse than others,
SIR.39.34	for everything is good in its proper place.
SIR.39.35	Now then, sing praises with all your heart,
SIR.39.35	and praise the name of the Lord!
SIR.40.1	Every person has been given a great deal of work to do. A heavy burden lies on all of us from the day of our birth until the day we go back to the earth, the mother of us all. 
SIR.40.2	We are confused and fearful, dreading the day of our death— 
SIR.40.3+SIR.40.4	all of us from the king on his splendid throne wearing royal robes and a crown, to the humblest person dressed in burlap and living in poverty. 
SIR.40.5	All through our lives we meet anger, jealousy, and trouble. Things disturb us; we live with furious conflicts and with the fear of death. Even when we go to bed, we think up new troubles in our sleep. 
SIR.40.6	We get little rest, if any at all. When we sleep, it is as if we were awake, disturbed by our imaginations. If we dream that we are running from an enemy, 
SIR.40.7	just as we are about to be caught,
SIR.40.8	Here is what all creatures, both human and animal, must face (but it is seven times worse for sinners): 
SIR.40.9	death, violence, conflict, murder, disaster, famine, sickness, epidemic. 
SIR.40.10	All these things were created because of the wicked; they are the ones who have caused destruction.
SIR.40.11	Everything that comes from the earth goes back to the earth, just as all water flows into the sea.
SIR.40.12	Nothing that comes from bribery or injustice will last, but the effects of loyalty will remain forever. 
SIR.40.13	Wealth that has been obtained dishonestly is like a stream that runs full during a thunderstorm, 
SIR.40.14	tumbling rocks along as it flows, but then suddenly goes dry.
SIR.40.15	The children of ungodly people will not leave large families; they are like plants trying to take root on rock, 
SIR.40.16	like reeds along a river bank, withering
SIR.40.17	Acts of kindness and charity are as lasting as eternity.
SIR.40.18	Being independently wealthy or working for a living—both can make life pleasant, but it is better to find a treasure.
SIR.40.19	Your name can be preserved if you have children or if you establish a city, but finding Wisdom is a better way.
SIR.40.19	Owning livestock and orchards will make you famous,
SIR.40.20	Wine and music can make you happy, but a happy marriage
SIR.40.21	Flutes and harps make fine music, but a pleasant voice is better than either.
SIR.40.22	Gracefulness and beauty please the eye, but not as much as new growth in the spring.
SIR.40.23	You can't go wrong with a good friend or neighbor, but an intelligent wife is
SIR.40.24	Relatives and helpers are good to have in times of trouble, but it will be an even greater help if you have made a practice of giving to the poor.
SIR.40.25	Gold and silver provide security, but good advice is better.
SIR.40.26	Wealth and strength give confidence, but the fear of the Lord can give you even greater confidence. When you fear the Lord you need nothing more; it is all the support you need. 
SIR.40.27	The fear of the Lord is like a rich garden of blessings; you could not want a more glorious shelter.
SIR.40.28	My child, don't live the life of a beggar; it is better to die than to beg. 
SIR.40.29	If you have to depend on someone else for your food, you are not really living your own life. You pollute yourself by accepting food from another. Begging is torture to the soul of any sensitive person.
SIR.40.30	A shameless person can make begging sound sweet, but something inside him burns.
SIR.41.1	Death! The very thought of it is bitter to someone who is prosperous, living peacefully with his possessions, free of worries, and still able to enjoy his food.
SIR.41.2	Death! Its sentence is welcome to someone living in poverty, with failing health, very old, burdened with worries, blind, and without hope.
SIR.41.3	Do not be afraid of death's decree. Remember that it came to those before you and will come to those after you. 
SIR.41.4	The Lord has decreed it for every living creature. Who are you to object to what the Most High wishes? In the world of the dead no one will care whether you lived ten years, a hundred, or a thousand.
SIR.41.5	The children of sinners, brought up in ungodly surroundings, turn out to be hateful people. 
SIR.41.6	They will lose whatever they inherit, and their own descendants will live in permanent disgrace. 
SIR.41.7	The children will put the blame for their disgrace on their ungodly parents.
SIR.41.8	You are doomed, you irreligious people who have abandoned the Law of the Most High God. 
SIR.41.9	When you have children, disaster will strike them and you will be left with nothing but sorrow. There will be great joy whenever you stumble,
SIR.41.10	What comes into being from nothing
SIR.41.11	A person's body amounts to nothing,
SIR.41.12	Protect your reputation; it will outlive you and last longer than a thousand treasures of gold. 
SIR.41.13	A good life lasts only so long, but a good reputation will last forever.
SIR.41.14	My children, do as I teach you and live at peace. Wisdom that is not expressed is like a treasure that has been hidden—both are useless. 
SIR.41.15	A person who covers up his foolishness is better than one who keeps his wisdom to himself.
SIR.41.16	My children, listen and I will teach you the circumstances when it is proper to be ashamed.
SIR.41.17	Before your parents, be ashamed of immoral behavior.
SIR.41.17	Before a ruler or an important person, be ashamed of a lie.
SIR.41.18	Before a judge, be ashamed of criminal behavior.
SIR.41.18	Before a public assembly, be ashamed of breaking the law.
SIR.41.18	Before a friend or partner, be ashamed of dishonesty.
SIR.41.19	Before your neighbors, be ashamed of theft.
SIR.41.19	Be ashamed of breaking a promise,
SIR.41.19	of leaning on the dinner table with your elbows,
SIR.41.19	of stinginess when you are asked for something,
SIR.41.20	of not returning a greeting,
SIR.41.20	of staring at a prostitute,
SIR.41.21	of turning down a relative's request,
SIR.41.21	of depriving someone of what is rightly his,
SIR.41.21	of staring at another man's wife,
SIR.41.22	of playing around with his slave woman (keep away from her bed!)
SIR.41.22	of insulting your friends,
SIR.41.22	of following up your gifts with criticism,
SIR.41.23	of betraying secrets.
SIR.41.23	These are times when it is proper for you to be ashamed, and people will respect you for it.
SIR.42.1	On the other hand, it is possible to sin by giving in to other people too much. Here are some things you should not be ashamed of:
SIR.42.2	the Law of the Most High and his covenant,
SIR.42.2	judging even godless people fairly,
SIR.42.3	sharing expenses with a business partner or a traveling companion,
SIR.42.3	sharing an inheritance,
SIR.42.4	using accurate weights and measures,
SIR.42.5	making a profit, whether great or small,
SIR.42.5	bargaining with a merchant,
SIR.42.5	disciplining your children often,
SIR.42.5	beating a disloyal slave until the blood flows.
SIR.42.6	It is wise to lock things up if you cannot trust your wife or if too many people are around. 
SIR.42.7	Keep an accurate record of any deposits you make or of anything you give or receive. 
SIR.42.8	Don't hesitate to correct someone who is acting foolishly or an old man who goes around with prostitutes. All of this is worthwhile advice, and if you follow it, everyone will approve of your behavior.
SIR.42.10	If she is a virgin, he worries that she might be seduced and become pregnant while living in his house. If she is married, he worries that she might be unfaithful, or that she might not be able to have children.
SIR.42.11	Keep a close watch over your daughter if she is determined to have her own way. If you don't, she may make a fool of you in front of your enemies. You will be a constant joke to everyone in town, a public disgrace. Make sure that her room has no windows or any place where she can look out to the entrance of the house.
SIR.42.12	Don't let her show off her beauty in front of men, or spend her time talking with the women.
SIR.42.13	Women hurt other women just as moths damage clothing.
SIR.42.14	A man's wickedness is better than a woman's goodness; women bring shame and disgrace.
SIR.42.15	Now I will remind you of the works of the Lord
SIR.42.15	and describe the things I have seen.
SIR.42.15	The words of the Lord brought his works into being,
SIR.42.15	and the whole creation obeys his commands.
SIR.42.16	The light of the sun shines down on everything,
SIR.42.16	and everything is filled with the Lord's glory.
SIR.42.17	Not even to his holy angels has the Lord given power
SIR.42.17	to describe all his mighty deeds,
SIR.42.17	even though he has given them power
SIR.42.17	to stand unharmed in his glorious presence.
SIR.42.18	He sees into the oceans and into the human heart,
SIR.42.18	and he knows the secrets of both.
SIR.42.18	The Most High knows everything that can be known
SIR.42.18	and understands the signs of the ages.
SIR.42.19	He knows all that has ever been and all that ever will be;
SIR.42.19	he uncovers the deepest of mysteries.
SIR.42.20	He takes notice of our every thought
SIR.42.20	and hears our every word.
SIR.42.21	The orderly world shows the greatness of his wisdom;
SIR.42.21	he is the same forever and ever.
SIR.42.21	Nothing can be added to him, and nothing taken away;
SIR.42.21	he needs no one to give him advice.
SIR.42.22	All his works are beautiful,
SIR.42.22	down to the smallest and faintest spark of light.
SIR.42.23	All these things go on forever,
SIR.42.23	and all of them have their purpose.
SIR.42.24	All things are in pairs, each the opposite of the other,
SIR.42.24	but nothing the Lord made is incomplete.
SIR.42.25	Everything completes the goodness of something else.
SIR.42.25	Could anyone ever see enough of this splendor?
SIR.43.1	How beautiful is the bright, clear sky above us!
SIR.43.1	What a glorious sight it is!
SIR.43.2	The sun, when it appears, proclaims as it rises
SIR.43.2	how marvelous a thing it is, made by the Most High.
SIR.43.3	At noon it dries up the land;
SIR.43.3	no one can stand its blazing heat.
SIR.43.4	The setting sun sets fire to the hilltops,
SIR.43.4	like a metal furnace glowing from the heat.
SIR.43.4	It sends out fiery rays,
SIR.43.4	blinding the eyes with its brightness.
SIR.43.5	The Lord, who made it, is great;
SIR.43.5	it speeds on its way at his command.
SIR.43.6	There is also the moon, marking the passage of time,
SIR.43.6	an eternal sign of the changing seasons.
SIR.43.7	The moon determines the holy days.
SIR.43.7	Its light grows full and then grows dim.
SIR.43.8	The “month” is named after the moon,
SIR.43.8	marvelous to watch as it grows fuller each night,
SIR.43.8	a signal light for the heavenly armies,
SIR.43.8	shining out in the dome of the sky.
SIR.43.9	The shining stars make the night sky lovely,
SIR.43.9	brilliant ornaments in the Lord's high heavens.
SIR.43.10	They stay in the places assigned to them by the Holy One
SIR.43.10	and never relax their dutiful watch.
SIR.43.11	Look at the rainbow and praise its Creator!
SIR.43.11	How magnificent, how radiant, its beauty!
SIR.43.12	Like a bow bent by the hands of the Most High,
SIR.43.12	it spans the horizon in a circle of glory.
SIR.43.13	He commands, and snow begins to fall;
SIR.43.13	lightning strikes to carry out his judgments.
SIR.43.14	The storerooms of the sky are thrown open,
SIR.43.14	and the clouds roll out like flying birds.
SIR.43.15	With his power he forms great masses of clouds
SIR.43.15	and shatters the ice into hailstones.
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	He speaks, and thunder twists the earth in pain;
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	the mountains are shaken by his strength.
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	Whenever he wishes, the south wind blows,
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	whirlwinds come, and windstorms from the north.
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	He sends the snow fluttering down like birds,
SIR.43.16+SIR.43.17	like locusts lighting on the ground.
SIR.43.18	We marvel at its beautiful whiteness,
SIR.43.18	and in fascination we watch it fall.
SIR.43.19	He sprinkles frost over the ground like salt,
SIR.43.19	and it freezes into thorny flowers of ice.
SIR.43.20	He sends the cold north wind blowing
SIR.43.20	and the water hardens into ice;
SIR.43.20	every lake and pond freezes over,
SIR.43.20	putting on a coat of icy armor.
SIR.43.21	He scorches the wilderness hills with drought,
SIR.43.21	and the grass turns brown from its heat;
SIR.43.22	but a cloudy mist restores it all to life
SIR.43.22	as the weather cools and dew appears.
SIR.43.23	By his wisdom he calmed the great oceans
SIR.43.23	and placed the islands there.
SIR.43.24	Sailors tell about the dangers of the sea,
SIR.43.24	and we listen to their tales in amazement.
SIR.43.25	In the sea are strange and marvelous creatures:
SIR.43.25	huge monsters and all kinds of living things.
SIR.43.26	Each of the Lord's messengers succeeds at its task.
SIR.43.26	Everything is held together by his word.
SIR.43.27	We could say much more and never finish,
SIR.43.27	but it all means this: the Lord is everything.
SIR.43.28	How can we find the power to praise him?
SIR.43.28	He is greater than all his creation.
SIR.43.29	The Lord is awesome in his greatness;
SIR.43.29	his power is overwhelming.
SIR.43.30	Though you do your best to praise him,
SIR.43.30	he is greater than you can ever express.
SIR.43.30	Though you honor him tirelessly and with all your strength,
SIR.43.30	you still cannot praise him enough.
SIR.43.31	No one has seen him, no one can describe him;
SIR.43.31	no one can praise him as he deserves.
SIR.43.32	Mysteries greater than these are still unknown;
SIR.43.32	we know only a fraction of his works.
SIR.43.33	The Lord made the universe
SIR.43.33	and then gave wisdom to devout people.
SIR.44.1	So let us now give praise to godly
SIR.44.1	our ancestors of generations past,
SIR.44.2	those whom the Lord honored with great glory,
SIR.44.2	in whom his greatness has been seen
SIR.44.2	from the beginning of time.
SIR.44.3	There were some who ruled kingdoms,
SIR.44.3	and some who were known for their strength.
SIR.44.3	Some were wise advisers,
SIR.44.3	and some spoke prophecies.
SIR.44.4	There were statesmen whose policies governed the people,
SIR.44.4	rulers who issued decrees,
SIR.44.4	scholars who spoke wise words,
SIR.44.4	and those who used pointed proverbs,
SIR.44.5	poets, and composers of music,
SIR.44.6	rich and powerful men living peacefully at home.
SIR.44.7	All of these were famous in their own times,
SIR.44.7	honored by the people of their day.
SIR.44.8	Some of them left a reputation,
SIR.44.8	and people still praise them today.
SIR.44.9	There are others who are not remembered,
SIR.44.9	as if they had never lived,
SIR.44.9	who died and were forgotten,
SIR.44.9	they, and their children after them.
SIR.44.10	But we will praise these godly men,
SIR.44.10	whose righteous deeds have never been forgotten.
SIR.44.11	Their reputations will be passed on to their descendants,
SIR.44.11	and this will be their inheritance.
SIR.44.12	Their descendants continue to keep the covenant
SIR.44.12	and always will, because of what their ancestors did.
SIR.44.13	Their family line will go on forever,
SIR.44.13	and their fame will never fade.
SIR.44.14	Their bodies were laid to rest,
SIR.44.14	but their reputations will live forever.
SIR.44.15	Nations will tell about their wisdom,
SIR.44.15	and God's people will praise them.
SIR.44.18	The Lord made an eternal covenant with him, promising that life would never again be destroyed by a flood.
SIR.44.20	He kept the Law of the Most High and made a covenant with him, a covenant marked on his body. When he was put to the test, he was found faithful. 
SIR.44.21	And so the Lord made him a solemn promise that his descendants would be a blessing to the world; that their number would be countless, like the dust of the earth; that they would be honored more than any other people on earth; and that their land would extend from sea to sea, from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
SIR.45.2	The Lord made him as glorious as the angels and made his enemies fear him. 
SIR.45.3	There in Egypt at his command the disaster struck.
SIR.45.4	The Lord chose Moses out of the whole human race and consecrated him because of his loyalty and humility. 
SIR.45.5	He let him hear his voice and led him into the dark cloud, where, face-to-face, he gave him the commandments, the Law that gives life and knowledge, so that Moses might teach the covenant regulations to the Israelites.
SIR.45.7	 He made an eternal covenant with him, giving him the privilege of serving as priest to the Lord's people. He honored him by clothing him with magnificent robes and fine ornaments, 
SIR.45.8	perfect in their splendor. He granted him the symbols of authority: the linen shorts, the shirt, and the robe with the pomegranates around the hem. 
SIR.45.9	Gold bells were also around its hem, so that when he walked, their ringing would be heard in the Temple, and the Lord would remember his people. 
SIR.45.10	The Lord gave Aaron the sacred robe with the gold, blue, and purple embroidery; the breastpiece with the Urim and Thummim;
SIR.45.11	the red yarn, spun by an expert; the precious stones with names engraved on them, mounted in a gold setting by a jeweler, placed on the breastpiece to remind the Lord of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
SIR.45.12	He gave him the turban with the gold ornament engraved with the words “Dedicated to the Lord.” It was expertly crafted, a beautiful work of art, and it was a high honor to wear it. 
SIR.45.13	Before Aaron's time such beautiful things were never seen. No one but Aaron and his descendants ever wore them, or ever will. 
SIR.45.14	The grain offering is to be presented twice a day and burned completely.
SIR.45.16	The Lord chose Aaron out of the whole human race to offer sacrifices, to burn fragrant incense to remind the Lord of his people, and to take away their sins. 
SIR.45.17	He entrusted the commandments to Aaron's keeping and gave him the authority to make legal decisions and to teach Israel the Law.
SIR.45.19	The Lord saw what they were doing and became angry, so furious that he performed a miracle and destroyed them in a blazing fire. 
SIR.45.20	Then he rewarded Aaron again, giving him a special honor: the right to the offerings of the first produce, so that the priests should have enough to eat. 
SIR.45.21	Their food is the sacrifices offered to the Lord; the Lord gave this to Aaron and his descendants. 
SIR.45.22	 But Aaron, unlike the rest of the people, was to inherit no land, no special portion of his own. The Lord himself would be all he needed.
SIR.45.24	And so the Lord made a covenant with him, valid for all time to come, that he should be in charge of the sanctuary and of his people, that he and his descendants should hold the office of High Priest forever. 
SIR.45.25	Unlike the covenant made with David son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah, where the kingship passed only from father to son, the priesthood was to pass from Aaron to all his descendants.
SIR.45.26	Now praise the Lord, who is good, who has crowned you with glory!
SIR.46.2	How magnificent it was when he raised his arm and then led the attacks on the cities! 
SIR.46.3	No one could stand up to him;
SIR.46.4	Remember how he held back the sun and made one day as long as two? 
SIR.46.5	When his enemies were threatening him from every side, he prayed to the mighty Lord Most High, and his prayer was answered with a hailstorm of devastating force. 
SIR.46.6	The Lord hurled the hail down on the enemy
SIR.46.8	Out of the 600,000 Israelites who marched through the wilderness, these two were the only ones spared and allowed to enter the rich and fertile land that was to be theirs. 
SIR.46.9	The Lord made Caleb strong, and when he was an old man, he was still strong enough to go up into the hill country and capture it for himself and his descendants. 
SIR.46.10	Then all of Israel could see how good it is to follow the Lord.
SIR.46.12	May their memory be honored! May these whom we honor spring from the grave to new life in their descendants!
SIR.46.14	He judged the nation in accordance with the Law of the Lord, and the Lord protected Israel. 
SIR.46.15	Because Samuel was faithful, he was accepted as a true prophet. People trusted him as a seer because of his words. 
SIR.46.16	When his enemies were threatening him from every side, he called upon the mighty Lord and offered him a young lamb as a sacrifice. 
SIR.46.17	Then the Lord thundered from heaven with a mighty roar 
SIR.46.18	and destroyed all the enemy
SIR.46.19	When Samuel was about to die, he gave assurances before the Lord and the anointed king that he had never taken anyone's property, not even so much as a pair of shoes, and no one contradicted him. 
SIR.46.20	Even after he died, he prophesied to King Saul how he would die. Out of the grave he spoke as a prophet, to blot out his people's wickedness.
SIR.47.3	He played with lions and bears as if they were lambs or little goats. 
SIR.47.4	When he was still a boy, he killed a giant to rescue his people. He put a stone in his sling, took aim, and put an end to Goliath's bragging. 
SIR.47.5	He prayed to the Lord, the Most High, and was given the strength to kill that famous soldier, so that the nations would have respect for the power of his people. 
SIR.47.6	The people honored him for killing his tens of thousands, and when he was crowned king, they praised him for being chosen by the Lord. 
SIR.47.7	He wiped out all his enemies and permanently crushed the Philistines, so that they never again became a threat.
SIR.47.8	In everything David did, he gave thanks and praise to the Holy Lord, the Most High. He loved his Creator and sang praises to him with all his heart. 
SIR.47.9	He put singers at the altar to provide beautiful music. 
SIR.47.10	He set the times of the festivals throughout the year and made them splendid occasions; the Temple rang with the Lord's praises all day long. 
SIR.47.11	The Lord forgave David's sin and established his power forever. He made a covenant with him that he and his descendants would reign in splendor over Israel.
SIR.47.12	David prepared the way well for his son, a wise man, to rule after him. 
SIR.47.13	 There was no war while Solomon was king. God gave him peace on all his borders, so that he could build for the Lord a Temple which would stand forever. 
SIR.47.14	How wise you were, Solomon, when you were young! Your knowledge was like the Nile
SIR.47.15	Your influence reached over all the world; your proverbs and riddles were known everywhere. 
SIR.47.16	You were famous everywhere, and people loved you for bringing peace. 
SIR.47.17	Nations around the world held you in admiration for your songs, proverbs, parables, and witty sayings. 
SIR.47.18	 You gathered silver and gold as if it were tin or lead, all in the name of the Lord God of Israel.
SIR.47.20	You stained your reputation and that of your descendants. They suffered punishment for that foolishness of yours, which caused them so much grief. 
SIR.47.21	 It divided the nation, and a rival kingdom arose in northern Israel. 
SIR.47.22	 But the Lord will always be merciful and keep all his promises.
SIR.47.23	There was also the unspeakable
SIR.47.24	His people became so sinful that they were exiled from their land. 
SIR.47.25	They tried all kinds of wickedness until the Lord took vengeance on them.
SIR.48.2	He brought a famine on the people, and many of them died because of his persistence. 
SIR.48.3	Speaking in the name of the Lord, he kept the rain from coming, and on three occasions he called down fire. 
SIR.48.4	Elijah, your miracles were marvelous! No one else can boast of such deeds! 
SIR.48.5	In the name of the Most High, you brought a dead man back to life. 
SIR.48.6	You brought a famous king down to sickness and death. 
SIR.48.7	At Sinai you heard the Lord rebuke you and declare his determination to punish his enemies. 
SIR.48.8	You anointed a king to be the instrument of that punishment, and a prophet to take your place. 
SIR.48.9	You were taken up to heaven in a fiery whirlwind, a chariot drawn by fiery horses. 
SIR.48.10	The scripture says that you are ready to appear at the designated time,
SIR.48.11	Fortunate are those who live to see you come, as well as those who have already died in love, for we too shall live.
SIR.48.13	 Nothing was too hard for him. Even when he was dead, his body worked a miracle. 
SIR.48.14	In life and in death he performed amazing miracles.
SIR.48.16	Some of the people did what was pleasing to the Lord, but others committed sin after sin.
SIR.48.18	 During his reign Sennacherib attacked the city and sent his chief official from Lachish. He challenged Jerusalem and boasted arrogantly. 
SIR.48.19	The people lost their courage and shook with fear; they were in pain, like a woman in labor. 
SIR.48.20	 But they prayed to the merciful Lord, the Holy One in heaven, who quickly answered their prayers and sent Isaiah to save them. 
SIR.48.21	The Lord struck the Assyrian camp; his angel wiped them out. 
SIR.48.22	Yes, Hezekiah did what was pleasing to the Lord and firmly followed the example of his ancestor David. This was what was commanded by the great prophet Isaiah, whose visions were trusted. 
SIR.48.23	 He made the sun move backward and lengthened the king's life. 
SIR.48.24	He comforted the mourners in Jerusalem. His powerful spirit looked into the future, 
SIR.48.25	and he predicted what was to happen before the end of time, hidden things that had not yet occurred.
SIR.49.2	He followed the correct policy of reforming the nation and removed the horrors of idolatry. 
SIR.49.3	He was completely loyal to the Lord and strengthened true religion in those wicked times.
SIR.49.4	All the kings, except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah, were terrible sinners, because they abandoned the Law of the Most High to the very end of the kingdom.
SIR.49.5	They surrendered their power and honor to foreigners, 
SIR.49.6	 who set fire to the holy city and left its streets deserted, just as Jeremiah had predicted. 
SIR.49.7	Jeremiah had been badly treated, even though he was chosen as a prophet before he was born, “to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow,” but also “to build and to plant.”
SIR.49.9	He also referred to the prophet Job, who always did the right thing.
SIR.49.10	May the bones of the twelve prophets rise to new life, because these men encouraged the people of Israel and saved them with confident hope.
SIR.49.12	 as was Joshua son of Jehozadak. They rebuilt the Lord's holy Temple, destined for eternal fame.
SIR.49.14	No one else like Enoch has ever walked the face of the earth, for he was taken up from the earth. 
SIR.49.15	No one else like Joseph has ever been born;
SIR.49.16	Shem, Seth, and Enosh
SIR.50.1	The greatest of his brothers and the pride of his people
SIR.50.2	and laid the foundation for the high double wall and the fortifications of the Temple.
SIR.50.3	The reservoir, as big as the bronze tank, was dug
SIR.50.4	He made plans to protect his people from attack and fortified the city so that it could withstand a siege.
SIR.50.5	How glorious he was when he came out of the Most Holy Place!
SIR.50.6	He was like the morning star shining through the clouds, like the full moon, 
SIR.50.7	like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming in glory against the clouds, 
SIR.50.8	like roses in springtime, like lilies beside a stream, like the cedars of Lebanon in summer, 
SIR.50.9	like burning incense, like a cup made of hammered gold and decorated with all kinds of jewels, 
SIR.50.10	like an olive tree loaded with fruit, like a cypress tree towering into the clouds.
SIR.50.11	When Simon put on his magnificent robe and went up to the holy altar dressed in perfect splendor, he made the Temple courtyard a majestic sight. 
SIR.50.12	When the priests handed him the portions of the sacrifice as he stood beside the altar with his assistants circling him like a wreath, he was like a young cedar of Lebanon surrounded by palm trees. 
SIR.50.13	Those were the descendants of Aaron in their splendid garments, standing before the whole assembly of Israel, holding in their hands the offering made to the Lord. 
SIR.50.14	When he had finished the service at the altar and had arranged the sacrifice to the Most High, the Almighty, 
SIR.50.15	he reached for a cup and poured out sweet-smelling wine at the foot of the altar as an offering to the Most High, the universal King. 
SIR.50.16	Then the priests shouted and blew their trumpets of hammered silver. They made a loud noise that the Most High would hear. 
SIR.50.17	All the people immediately bowed down with their faces to the ground to worship their Lord, the Almighty, the Most High. 
SIR.50.18	Then the choir began to sing his praises, and the beautiful music rang out. 
SIR.50.19	The people kept praying to the merciful Lord Most High until the service of worship had come to a close. 
SIR.50.20	 Then Simon came down from the altar, raised his hands over the whole assembly of Israel, and reverently pronounced the blessing from the Lord, 
SIR.50.21	while the people bowed a second time in worship to receive that blessing from the Most High.
SIR.50.22	Now then, give praise to the God of the universe, who has done great things everywhere, who brings us up
SIR.50.23	May he give us happiness and allow us to have peace in Israel forever. 
SIR.50.24	May he continue his mercy to us and rescue us in our time of need.
SIR.50.25	There are two nations that I detest, and a third that does not even deserve to be called a nation. 
SIR.50.26	These are the Edomites,
SIR.50.27	I, Jesus son of Sirach Eleazar
SIR.50.28	May God bless everyone who gives attention to these teachings. Whoever takes them to heart will become wise. 
SIR.50.29	Whoever lives by them will be strong enough for any occasion, because he will be walking in the light of the Lord.
SIR.51.1	I give you thanks, O Lord and King;
SIR.51.1	I praise you as my God and Savior.
SIR.51.1	I give you thanks,
SIR.51.2	for you have helped me and protected me.
SIR.51.2	You have rescued me from death,
SIR.51.2	from dangerous lies and slander.
SIR.51.3	You helped me when no one else would;
SIR.51.3	in your great mercy you saved me
SIR.51.3	from the many troubles I have known:
SIR.51.3	from the glaring hatred of my enemies,
SIR.51.3	who wanted to put an end to my life;
SIR.51.4	from suffocation in oppressive smoke
SIR.51.4	rising from fires that I did not light;
SIR.51.5	from death itself;
SIR.51.5	from vicious slander reported to the king.
SIR.51.6	I was once brought face-to-face with death;
SIR.51.7	enemies surrounded me everywhere.
SIR.51.7	I looked for someone to help me,
SIR.51.7	but there was no one there.
SIR.51.8	But then, O Lord, I remembered how merciful you are
SIR.51.8	and what you had done in times past.
SIR.51.8	I remembered that you rescue those who rely on you,
SIR.51.8	that you save them from their enemies.
SIR.51.9	Then from here on earth I prayed to you
SIR.51.9	to rescue me from death.
SIR.51.10	I prayed, “O Lord, you are my father;
SIR.51.10	do not abandon me to my troubles
SIR.51.10	when I am helpless against arrogant enemies.
SIR.51.11	I will always praise you
SIR.51.11	and sing hymns of thanksgiving.”
SIR.51.11	You answered my prayer,
SIR.51.12	and saved me from the threat of destruction.
SIR.51.12	And so I thank you and praise you.
SIR.51.12	O Lord, I praise you!
SIR.51.13	When I was still young, before I started out on my travels, I boldly prayed for Wisdom. 
SIR.51.14	I went to the Temple and asked for her, and I will look for her as long as I live. 
SIR.51.15	From my blossoming youth to my ripe old age she has been my delight. I have followed directly in her path ever since I was young. 
SIR.51.16	I received Wisdom as soon as I began listening for her, and I have been rewarded with great knowledge. 
SIR.51.17	I have always been a learner and am grateful to everyone who has been my teacher. 
SIR.51.18	I was determined to live wisely and was devoted to the cause of goodness. I have no regrets. 
SIR.51.19	I fought for Wisdom and was strict in my conduct. When I prayed, I sadly confessed how far short of Wisdom I fell. 
SIR.51.20	But I was determined to have her, and I found her by keeping myself free from sin. I have grown in Wisdom since first I found her, and I will never be without her. 
SIR.51.21	Because I was driven by the desire to find her, I have been richly rewarded. 
SIR.51.22	The Lord gave me a gift for words, and I have used it in his praise.
SIR.51.23	Come to me, all you that need instruction, and learn in my school. 
SIR.51.24	Why do you admit that you are ignorant and do nothing about it? 
SIR.51.25	Here is what I say: It costs nothing to be wise. 
SIR.51.26	Put on the yoke, and be willing to learn. The opportunity is always near. 
SIR.51.27	See for yourselves! I have really not studied very hard, but I have found great contentment. 
SIR.51.28	No matter how much it costs you to get Wisdom, it will be well worth it. 
SIR.51.29	Be joyfully grateful for the Lord's mercy, and never be ashamed to praise him. 
SIR.51.30	Do your duty at the proper time, and the Lord, at the time he thinks proper, will give you your reward.
BAR.1.2	on the seventh day of the month
BAR.1.3+BAR.1.4	 Baruch read the book aloud to Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and to all the people who lived in Babylon by the Sud River. Everyone came to hear it read—nobles, children of royal families, elders, in fact, all the people, no matter what their status.
BAR.1.5	When the book was read, everyone cried, fasted, and prayed to the Lord. 
BAR.1.6	Then they all gave as much money as they could, 
BAR.1.7	and the collection was sent to Jerusalem to Jehoiakim the High Priest, son of Hilkiah and grandson of Shallum, and to the other priests and to all the people who were with him in Jerusalem.
BAR.1.8	On the tenth day of the month of Sivan, Baruch took the sacred utensils which had been carried away from the Temple and returned them to Judah. These were the silver utensils which Zedekiah son of King Josiah of Judah had ordered made 
BAR.1.9	after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had deported Jehoiachin, the rulers, the skilled workers,
BAR.1.10	The people wrote:
BAR.1.10	Please use the money we are sending you to buy animals for the burnt offerings and the sin offerings, to buy incense, and to provide the grain offerings. Offer them on the altar of the Lord our God, 
BAR.1.11	and pray for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his son Belshazzar, that they may live as long as the heavens last. 
BAR.1.12	Then the Lord will strengthen us and be our guide. Nebuchadnezzar and his son Belshazzar will protect us, and we will be loyal to them as long as we live; then they will be pleased with us. 
BAR.1.13	We ask you also to pray to the Lord God for us, because we have sinned against him, and he is still angry with us. 
BAR.1.14	Please read this book that we are sending you and make your own confession of sin in the Temple on the first day of the Festival of Shelters and on other holy days of assembly.
BAR.1.15	This is the confession you should make: “The Lord our God is righteous, but we are still covered with shame. All of us—the people of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, 
BAR.1.16	our kings, our rulers, our priests, our prophets, and our ancestors have been put to shame, 
BAR.1.17	because we have sinned against the Lord our God 
BAR.1.18	and have disobeyed him. We did not listen to him or live according to his commandments. 
BAR.1.19	From the day the Lord brought our ancestors out of Egypt until the present day, we have continued to be unfaithful to him, and we have not hesitated to disobey him. 
BAR.1.20	 Long ago, when the Lord led our ancestors out of Egypt, so that he could give us a rich and fertile land, he pronounced curses against us through his servant Moses. And today we are suffering because of those curses. 
BAR.1.21	We refused to obey the word of the Lord our God which he spoke to us through the prophets. Instead, we all did as we pleased and went on our own evil way. We turned to other gods and did things the Lord hates.
BAR.2.1	“So the Lord carried out the threat he had made against us and against our judges, our kings, our rulers, and the people of Israel and Judah. 
BAR.2.2	Nowhere else on earth have such things happened as happened in Jerusalem when the Lord carried out the threats written in the Law of Moses. 
BAR.2.3	Things were so bad that we even ate the flesh of our own sons and daughters. 
BAR.2.4	The Lord scattered our people, handing us over to the control of all the nations around us, and they looked on us with reproach and horror. 
BAR.2.5	We sinned against the Lord our God and refused to obey him. Therefore, our nation was conquered, instead of being victorious.
BAR.2.6	“The Lord our God is always righteous, but we and our ancestors are still burdened with our guilt. 
BAR.2.7	Even though the Lord punished us as he had threatened, 
BAR.2.8	we still did not turn to him and pray that we would abandon our evil thoughts. 
BAR.2.9+BAR.2.10	We did not obey him or live by his just commands, so the Lord brought on us all the punishments he had kept ready for us.
BAR.2.11	“You, O Lord, are the God of Israel who brought your people out of Egypt with great power and with signs, miracles, and wonders. You showed your mighty strength and gained a glorious reputation, which is still recognized today. 
BAR.2.12	O Lord our God, we have sinned; we have been unfaithful; we have disobeyed all your commands. 
BAR.2.13	But do not be angry with us any longer. Here among the nations where you have scattered us, only a few of us are left. 
BAR.2.14	Listen to our prayer of petition, Lord, and rescue us for the sake of your own honor. Let those who have taken us into exile be pleased with us. 
BAR.2.15	Then the whole world will know that you are the Lord our God and that you have chosen the nation of Israel to be your own people.
BAR.2.16	“O Lord, look down from heaven and see our misery. Listen to our prayer. 
BAR.2.17	Open your eyes and look upon us. Those in the world of the dead with no breath left in their bodies cannot offer praises to you or proclaim how just you are. 
BAR.2.18	Only the living, O Lord, can offer you praise and acknowledge your justice, even though they may be suffering greatly, bent and weak, hungry and with failing eyesight.
BAR.2.19	“O Lord our God, we pray to you for mercy, but not because of any good things done by our ancestors and our kings. 
BAR.2.20	You turned your anger and wrath against us, just as you had threatened to do when your servants the prophets spoke your word to us and said, 
BAR.2.21	 ‘Bend your backs and serve the king of Babylonia, and you can remain in the land that I gave to your ancestors. 
BAR.2.22	But if you refuse to obey my command to serve him, 
BAR.2.23	I will bring to an end every sound of joy and celebration in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem. Even the happy sounds of wedding feasts will no longer be heard. The whole land will be desolate and uninhabited.’
BAR.2.25	And now here they lie exposed to the heat of the day and to the frost of the night. They died in torment from famine, war, and disease. 
BAR.2.26	And because of the sin of the people of Israel and Judah, you have reduced your own Temple to ruins, even as it is today.
BAR.2.27	“But, Lord, you have been patient with us and have shown us great mercy, 
BAR.2.28	 as you promised through your servant Moses on the day you commanded him to write your Law in the presence of the Israelites. 
BAR.2.29	‘If you do not obey me,’ you said, ‘you will be reduced to a handful among the nations where I will scatter you. 
BAR.2.30	I know that you will not obey me, because you are a stubborn people. But when you are taken into exile in another land, you will come to your senses. 
BAR.2.31	Then you will realize that I am the Lord your God, and I will give you a desire to know and a mind with which to understand. 
BAR.2.32	There in the land of your exile you will praise me and remember me. 
BAR.2.33	You will stop being so stubborn and wicked, for you will remember what happened to your ancestors when they sinned against the Lord. 
BAR.2.34	Then I will bring you back to the land that I solemnly promised to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it will be yours again. I will increase your population, and you will never again be reduced to a small number. 
BAR.2.35	 I will make an everlasting covenant with you; I will be your God and you will be my people. I will never again remove you, the people of Israel, from the land that I gave you.’
BAR.3.1	“O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, from the depth of our troubled, weary souls we cry out to you. 
BAR.3.2	Hear us, O Lord, and have mercy on us, because we have sinned against you. 
BAR.3.3	You reign as king forever, but we die and are gone forever. 
BAR.3.4	O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hear our prayer. We are no better off than the dead. Our ancestors sinned against you, the Lord their God. They refused to obey you, and we are suffering the consequences of their sin. 
BAR.3.5	Forget the sinful things that our ancestors did in the past; at a time like this, think only of your power and reputation, 
BAR.3.6	for you are the Lord our God, and we will praise you. 
BAR.3.7	You have made us fear you, so that we might pray to you. Here in exile we will praise you because we have turned away from the sins of our ancestors. 
BAR.3.8	You have scattered us among the nations, and you have made them despise and curse us. You are punishing us for the sins of our ancestors when they rebelled against you, the Lord our God.”
BAR.3.10	Why is it, Israel, that you find yourself in an enemy land? Why have you grown old in a foreign country? You are ritually unclean, like the dead; 
BAR.3.11	you are already counted among the dead. But why? 
BAR.3.12	It is because you have left the source of Wisdom! 
BAR.3.13	If you had walked in God's ways, you would have lived in peace forever. 
BAR.3.14	Learn where understanding, strength, and insight are to be found. Then you will know where to find a long and full life, light to guide you, and peace.
BAR.3.16+BAR.3.17	and those who have tried have vanished: the rulers of the nations, those who hunted wild animals and birds for sport, those who accumulated vast fortunes of silver and gold, which everyone trusts and will do anything to get, 
BAR.3.18	and those who worried and schemed to make money, but who left no trace of their work behind. 
BAR.3.19	They have all disappeared and gone down to the world of the dead. Others have come along to take their place. 
BAR.3.20	A later generation was born and lived in the land, but they too did not discover the way to knowledge. They did not find the path to Wisdom or ever reach her. 
BAR.3.21	Their children also failed. 
BAR.3.22	Wisdom was not found by the Canaanites. It has not been discovered by the Edomites 
BAR.3.23	although they search after knowledge. The way to Wisdom has not been found by the merchants of Merran and Tema or by those who relate fables or by any others who seek understanding.
BAR.3.24	O Israel, how great is the universe in which God dwells! How vast is all that he possesses! 
BAR.3.25	There is no end to it; there is no way to measure how wide or how high it is. 
BAR.3.26	 Here in early times the famous giants were born, a mighty race skilled in war. 
BAR.3.27	But God did not choose them to be his people or show them the way of knowledge. 
BAR.3.28	They died out because they had neither understanding nor insight.
BAR.3.29	No one has ever gone up into heaven to get Wisdom and bring her down out of the clouds. 
BAR.3.30	No one has sailed across the seas to find Wisdom or bought her with precious gold. 
BAR.3.31	No one knows how to get to her or how to discover the path that leads to her.
BAR.3.32	The only one who knows Wisdom is God, and he knows all things. With his understanding he found her. He established the earth for all time and filled it with all kinds of animals. 
BAR.3.33	The light trembled and obeyed when he called. He sent it forth, and it appeared. 
BAR.3.34	He called the stars, and they promptly answered; they took their places and gladly shone to please the one who made them. 
BAR.3.35	He is our God, and there is none like him. 
BAR.3.36	He discovered the entire path leading to understanding and gave Wisdom to his servant Israel, whom he loved. 
BAR.3.37	From that time on, Wisdom appeared on earth and lived among us.
BAR.4.2	Turn to Wisdom, people of Israel, and take hold of her. Make your way toward the splendor of her light. 
BAR.4.3	Do not surrender our glorious privileges to any other people. 
BAR.4.4	How happy we are, people of Israel; we have the advantage of knowing what is pleasing to God!
BAR.4.5	Take courage, my people, you are the ones who keep Israel's name alive. 
BAR.4.6	You were sold to Gentile nations, but not to be destroyed. Because you made God angry, he handed you over to your enemies. 
BAR.4.7	When you offered sacrifices to demons instead of to God, you angered the one who made you. 
BAR.4.8	You forgot the Eternal God, who had nourished you as a child, and so you brought grief to Jerusalem, who had been like a mother to you. 
BAR.4.9	Jerusalem saw that God was punishing you because he was angry, and she said to all the neighboring cities, “Look at the great misery that God has brought on me. 
BAR.4.10	I saw my sons and daughters taken into captivity, a captivity brought on them by the Eternal God. 
BAR.4.11	I brought up my children with great delight, but I cried and mourned when they were taken from me. 
BAR.4.12	Let no one take pleasure in my suffering now that I am a widow and so many of my children have been taken from me. They turned away from God's Law, and their sins have made me a deserted city. 
BAR.4.13	They had no respect for his commandments and would not live by them; they refused to let him guide them in the way of righteousness.
BAR.4.14	“All you neighboring cities, come and consider how the Eternal God has sent my children into exile. 
BAR.4.15	He brought against them a nation from far away, a shameless nation that speaks a foreign language and has no respect for the elderly and no pity for children. 
BAR.4.16	These people carried off my beloved sons and took away my daughters, and I was left a widow, completely alone.
BAR.4.17	“My children in exile, I can do nothing to help you. 
BAR.4.18	Only the one who brought this punishment upon you can rescue you from your enemies. 
BAR.4.19	 Go your own way, my children; live your own life! I am all alone. 
BAR.4.20	I have taken off the robes I wore during days of peace, and I have dressed myself like a person in mourning. I will cry out to the Eternal God for help as long as I live.
BAR.4.21	“Take courage, my children, and cry out to God for help. He will rescue you from oppression, from the power of your enemies. 
BAR.4.22	I am confident that the Eternal God will soon set you free. The Holy One, your eternal savior, will make me happy when he shows you mercy. 
BAR.4.23	I cried and wailed when you were taken away, but God will bring you back and will make me happy forever. 
BAR.4.24	Just as the neighboring cities watched as you were taken captive, so they will soon see the Eternal God coming in glorious splendor to rescue you. 
BAR.4.25	My children, endure God's punishment with patience. Your enemies have persecuted you, but you will soon see them destroyed and at your mercy. 
BAR.4.26	My children, I spoiled you with love, but you have had to follow rugged paths; you were carried off like sheep caught in an enemy raid.
BAR.4.27	“Take courage, my children, and cry out to God for help. He punished you, but he will not forget you. 
BAR.4.28	Just as you were once determined to turn away from God, now turn back and serve him with ten times more determination. 
BAR.4.29	The one who brought these calamities upon you will rescue you and bring you everlasting joy.”
BAR.4.30	Take courage, Jerusalem. God, who gave you your name, will now bring comfort to you. 
BAR.4.31	Misery will come to those who mistreated you and then rejoiced when you fell. 
BAR.4.32	Misery will come to those cities that made your children slaves. Misery will be the fate of Babylon, that city which swallowed up your children. 
BAR.4.33	Just as that city rejoiced when you fell and took delight in your ruin, so now she will mourn when she herself is deserted. 
BAR.4.34	I will turn her proud boastings into mourning and take away her large population in which she took pride. 
BAR.4.35	I, the Eternal God, will send down fire on her, and it will burn for many days. Her ruins will be haunted by demons for a long time to come.
BAR.4.36	Look to the east, Jerusalem, and see the joy that God is bringing to you. 
BAR.4.37	Look, your children are coming home, the children that were taken from you. They have been gathered together from the east and from the west by the command of God, the Holy One. And now they are coming home, rejoicing in the glory of God.
BAR.5.2	Put around you the cloak of God's righteousness. Place on your head the crown of the glory of the Eternal God. 
BAR.5.3	God will show your splendor to every nation on earth. 
BAR.5.4	Forever he will say to you: “Your security comes from your righteousness, and your splendor from your devotion to me.”
BAR.5.5	Get up, Jerusalem, stand on the mountaintop; see where God, the Holy One, is bringing your children together from the east and from the west. They are rejoicing that God has remembered them. 
BAR.5.6	Jerusalem, your children were led away by their enemies; they left you on foot, but God is bringing them back to you, carried in royal splendor. 
BAR.5.7	God has commanded that every high mountain and the everlasting hills shall be made low; he has commanded that the valleys shall be filled and the ground leveled, so that the people of Israel may come safely home in the glory of God. 
BAR.5.8	At the command of God, forests of fragrant trees will spring up to provide shade for the people of Israel. 
BAR.5.9	God will lead Israel home. They will return with great joy, guided by his mercy and righteousness, surrounded by the light of his glorious presence.
LJE.1_1.2	You have sinned against God. That is why you are about to be taken away as prisoners to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. 
LJE.1_1.3	You will remain there in exile for many years, as long as seven generations; then God will lead you peacefully home from Babylon.
LJE.1_1.4	There in Babylon you will see gods made of wood, silver, and gold—gods which people carry on their shoulders and which fill the heathen with fear. 
LJE.1_1.5	You must be careful never to imitate those Gentiles. Don't let their gods fill you with fear when you see them being carried in procession and being worshiped. 
LJE.1_1.6	Instead, say to yourselves, “It is you alone, Lord, that we must worship.” 
LJE.1_1.7	God's angel will be there with you; he will take care of you.
LJE.1_1.8	Their idols are plated with silver and gold and have tongues that were carved by woodworkers. But they are not real gods, and they cannot speak. 
LJE.1_1.9	The people make gold crowns and put them on the heads of their gods, as if these idols were girls who love jewelry. 
LJE.1_1.10	Sometimes the priests steal the silver and gold from their gods and spend it on themselves; 
LJE.1_1.11	they even give some of it to the temple prostitutes. People take these gods of wood, silver, and gold, and put clothes on them, as if they were human. 
LJE.1_1.12	But even though the gods are dressed in purple robes like kings, they still cannot keep themselves from being tarnished or protect themselves from termites. 
LJE.1_1.13	When dust from the temple settles on their faces, someone has to wipe it off for them. 
LJE.1_1.14	Like human judges they hold scepters in their hands, but they have no power to punish anyone who wrongs them. 
LJE.1_1.15	Sometimes they have daggers and axes in their hands, but they cannot protect themselves from being destroyed in war or from being carried off by thieves. 
LJE.1_1.16	All of this proves that they are not gods—do not worship them.
LJE.1_1.17	Those gods sitting in their temples are as useless as a broken bowl. Their eyes are filled with the dust that people kick up when they come in. 
LJE.1_1.18	The priests fortify the temples with doors and bars and bolts, so that thieves cannot break in. The gods are locked up as securely as a prisoner about to be executed for a crime against the king. 
LJE.1_1.19	The priests light lamps for the gods, far more than they need for their own use, but the idols can't see even one of them. 
LJE.1_1.20	Their insides are eaten away by termites, just like the wooden beams of the temple, and their clothing is destroyed, but they don't even know it. 
LJE.1_1.21	Their faces are blackened by the smoke in the temple. 
LJE.1_1.22	Bats, swallows, and other birds perch on them, and even cats sit on them. 
LJE.1_1.23	All of this proves that they are not gods—do not worship them.
LJE.1_1.24	These idols have been plated with gold to make them beautiful, but they do not shine unless someone polishes them. When they were being poured into molds, they felt nothing. 
LJE.1_1.25	It makes no difference how high a price is paid for them; they are still unable to breathe. 
LJE.1_1.26	See how useless they are! They can't walk on their own feet, but must be carried around. 
LJE.1_1.27	Even those who take care of them are embarrassed when one of their gods falls to the ground and has to be picked up again. When someone stands one of them in a certain place, it cannot move, and if it is leaning over, it can never straighten itself up. Offering gifts to them is like giving gifts to a corpse. 
LJE.1_1.28	Priests sell what is sacrificed to their gods and use the money on themselves. And the wives of the priests preserve the sacrifices with salt for later use, instead of sharing them with the poor and helpless. 
LJE.1_1.29	Even women who are having their monthly period or women who have just given birth are allowed to touch the sacrifices. All of this proves that they are not gods—do not worship them.
LJE.1_1.30	How can they ever be called gods, when women are allowed to make offerings to these things made of wood, silver, and gold? 
LJE.1_1.31	The priests even sit in the temples when they are in mourning, with torn clothes and shaved, uncovered heads. 
LJE.1_1.32	The priests roar and shout in the presence of their gods as if they were taking part in a funeral feast. 
LJE.1_1.33	They take the clothing off their gods and give it to their wives and children. 
LJE.1_1.34	It doesn't matter whether a person helps or harms these gods, since they cannot pay him back. They are not able to make anyone a king or to dethrone him, 
LJE.1_1.35	and they cannot make a person wealthy or give him any money. If someone makes a vow to them but does not keep it, they will never make him pay. 
LJE.1_1.36	They can never rescue a person from death, and they never help a weak person against one who is strong. 
LJE.1_1.37	They cannot restore sight to the blind or save anyone in distress. 
LJE.1_1.38	They cannot offer any mercy or give help to widows or orphans. 
LJE.1_1.39	These things made of wood and covered with silver and gold are as powerless as stone taken from the mountains; and the people who worship them will be put to shame. 
LJE.1_1.40	How can anyone think that they are gods or call them gods?
LJE.1_1.40	The Babylonians bring dishonor on their own gods. 
LJE.1_1.41	 When someone cannot speak, they take him to the temple and ask Bel to give him the power of speech, as if Bel could understand anything. 
LJE.1_1.42	But even when the people realize that their gods cannot help, they are stupid enough to go on worshiping them. 
LJE.1_1.43	Not only that, but women wrap cords around themselves and sit alongside the road burning incense and offering themselves as prostitutes. When one of them is taken off for sex, she returns to ridicule the woman next to her who was not beautiful enough to be chosen. 
LJE.1_1.44	Everything about these idols is false. How can anyone think that they are gods or call them gods?
LJE.1_1.45	Woodworkers and goldsmiths make these gods, so they can never be anything other than what these people want them to be. 
LJE.1_1.46	Even their makers do not live long lives, so how are they able to create gods? 
LJE.1_1.47	These people leave nothing but deceit and disgrace as an inheritance for future generations. 
LJE.1_1.48	When wars and disturbances come, the priests plan where they can go into hiding with their gods. 
LJE.1_1.49	These idols are helpless in the face of wars and disturbances. Why can't people realize that these idols are not gods?
LJE.1_1.50	These idols are nothing more than wood covered with silver and gold; one day it will be clear that they are really not gods at all. 
LJE.1_1.51	All nations and kings will realize that idols are nothing more than the work of human hands. They do not have the power of a god, 
LJE.1_1.52	and anyone should know that they are not really gods.
LJE.1_1.53	These gods can never make anyone a king or bring rain. 
LJE.1_1.54	They can't make decisions about their own affairs or give justice to someone who has been wronged; they can do absolutely nothing. They are as useless as crows flying around in the air. 
LJE.1_1.55	When a temple catches on fire, the priests run away to save themselves, while the gods made of wood and covered with silver and gold are left to burn like wooden beams. 
LJE.1_1.56	They can't fight kings or go to war against enemies. How can anyone believe that they are gods?
LJE.1_1.57	These gods of wood, covered with silver and gold, cannot protect themselves from thieves and robbers 
LJE.1_1.58	who take off the silver and gold and the gods' clothing and walk away with all of it. The gods can do nothing to stop them. 
LJE.1_1.59	Anything from a courageous king to a useful piece of pottery is better than a false god. Even a door is better than a false god; a door at least protects the things in the house. Even a wooden pillar in a palace is better than a false god.
LJE.1_1.60	God provided the sun, the moon, and the stars to give light, and they obey him. 
LJE.1_1.61	The same is true of lightning and wind. The lightning can be seen far and wide, and the wind blows everywhere. 
LJE.1_1.62	When God commands clouds to spread out over the whole world, they obey. 
LJE.1_1.63	When God sends down fire from heaven to burn up mountains and forests, it does what it is told. Idols cannot do these things—they can't even do a good imitation. 
LJE.1_1.64	Why should they be called gods, when they are not able to help us or harm us in any way? 
LJE.1_1.65	You know that they are not gods—do not worship them.
LJE.1_1.66	These gods have no power over kings; they cannot pronounce curses on them or grant them blessings. 
LJE.1_1.67	They cannot produce for the nations any signs in the sky; they cannot shine like the sun or the moon. 
LJE.1_1.68	Even wild animals are better off than these idols; animals can at least run from danger to protect themselves. 
LJE.1_1.69	So it is absolutely clear that they are not gods—do not worship them.
LJE.1_1.70	These gods of theirs, made of wood and covered with silver and gold, are about as helpful as a scarecrow in a cucumber patch; they are no protection at all. 
LJE.1_1.71	They do as much good as a thorn bush in a garden; instead of keeping birds away, they provide a perch for them. These gods are like a dead body thrown out into the darkness. 
LJE.1_1.72	The purple linen
LJE.1_1.73	The righteous person has an advantage over others; he does not own any idols, and they can never make a fool of him.
