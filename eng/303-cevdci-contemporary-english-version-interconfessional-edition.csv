GEN.1.1	In the beginning God
GEN.1.1	created the heavens
GEN.1.1	and the earth.
GEN.1.2	The earth was barren,
GEN.1.2	with no form of life;
GEN.1.2	it was under a roaring ocean
GEN.1.2	covered with darkness.
GEN.1.2	But the Spirit of God
GEN.1.2	was moving over the water.
GEN.1.4	God looked at the light and saw that it was good. He separated light from darkness 
GEN.1.5	and named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night.” Evening came, then morning—that was the first day.
GEN.1.7	And that's what happened. God made the dome 
GEN.1.8	and named it “Sky.” Evening came, then morning—that was the second day.
GEN.1.9	God said, “I command the water under the sky to come together in one place, so there will be dry ground.” And that's what happened. 
GEN.1.10	God named the dry ground “Land,” and he named the water “Ocean.” God looked at what he had done and saw that it was good.
GEN.1.11	God said, “I command the earth to produce all kinds of plants, including fruit trees and grain.” And that's what happened. 
GEN.1.12	The earth produced all kinds of vegetation. God looked at what he had done, and it was good. 
GEN.1.13	Evening came, then morning—that was the third day.
GEN.1.14	God said, “I command lights to appear in the sky and to separate day from night and to show the time for seasons, special days, and years. 
GEN.1.15	I command them to shine on the earth.” And that's what happened. 
GEN.1.16	God made two powerful lights, the brighter one to rule the day and the other
GEN.1.17	Then God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God looked at what he had done, and it was good. 
GEN.1.19	Evening came, then morning—that was the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	God said, “I command the ocean to be full of living creatures, and I command birds to fly above the earth.” 
GEN.1.21	So God made the giant sea monsters and all the living creatures that swim in the ocean. He also made every kind of bird. God looked at what he had done, and it was good. 
GEN.1.22	Then he gave the living creatures his blessing—he told the ocean creatures to increase and live everywhere in the ocean and the birds to increase everywhere on earth. 
GEN.1.23	Evening came, then morning—that was the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	God said, “I command the earth to give life to all kinds of tame animals, wild animals, and reptiles.” And that's what happened. 
GEN.1.25	God made every one of them. Then he looked at what he had done, and it was good.
GEN.1.28	God gave them his blessing and said:
GEN.1.28	Have a lot of children! Fill the earth with people and bring it under your control. Rule over the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, and every animal on the earth.
GEN.1.29	I have provided all kinds of fruit and grain for you to eat. 
GEN.1.30	And I have given the green plants as food for everything else that breathes, including animals, both wild and tame, and birds. And so it was.
GEN.1.31	God looked at what he had done. All of it was very good! Evening came, then morning—that was the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	So the heavens and the earth and everything else were created.
GEN.2.3	God blessed the seventh day and made it special, because on that day he rested from his work.
GEN.2.4	That's how God created the heavens and the earth.
GEN.2.4	When the 
GEN.2.5	no grass or plants were growing anywhere. God had not yet sent any rain, and there was no one to work the land. 
GEN.2.6	But streams
GEN.2.8	The 
GEN.2.10	From Eden a river flowed out to water the garden, then it divided into four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The first one is the Pishon River that flows through the land of Havilah, 
GEN.2.12	where pure gold, rare perfumes, and precious stones are found. 
GEN.2.13	The second is the Gihon River that winds through Ethiopia.
GEN.2.14	The Tigris River that flows east of Assyria is the third, and the fourth is the Euphrates River.
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	But the 
GEN.2.17	except the one that has the power to let you know the difference between right and wrong. If you eat any fruit from that tree, you will die before the day is over!”
GEN.2.18	The 
GEN.2.19+GEN.2.20	So the 
GEN.2.19+GEN.2.20	None of these was the right kind of partner for the man. 
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	the 
GEN.2.22	The 
GEN.2.23	and the man exclaimed,
GEN.2.23	“Here is someone like me!
GEN.2.23	She is part of my body,
GEN.2.23	my own flesh and bones.
GEN.2.23	She came from me, a man.
GEN.2.23	So I will name her Woman!”
GEN.2.25	Although the man and his wife were both naked, they were not ashamed.
GEN.3.2	The woman answered, “God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden, 
GEN.3.3	except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.”
GEN.3.4	“No, you won't!” the snake replied. 
GEN.3.5	“God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.”
GEN.3.6	The woman stared at the fruit. It looked beautiful and tasty. She wanted the wisdom that it would give her, and she ate some of the fruit. Her husband was there with her, so she gave some to him, and he ate it too. 
GEN.3.7	At once they saw what they had done, and they realized they were naked. Then they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.
GEN.3.8	Late in the afternoon, when the breeze began to blow, the man and woman heard the 
GEN.3.9	The 
GEN.3.10	The man answered, “I was naked, and when I heard you walking through the garden, I was frightened and hid!”
GEN.3.11	“How did you know you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden?”
GEN.3.12	“It was the woman you put here with me,” the man said. “She gave me some of the fruit, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	“The snake tricked me,” she answered, “and I ate some of that fruit.”
GEN.3.14	So the 
GEN.3.14	“Because of what you have done,
GEN.3.14	you will be the only animal
GEN.3.14	to suffer this curse—
GEN.3.14	For as long as you live,
GEN.3.14	you will crawl on your stomach
GEN.3.14	and eat dirt.
GEN.3.15	will hate each other;
GEN.3.15	your descendants and hers
GEN.3.15	will always be enemies.
GEN.3.15	One of hers will strike you
GEN.3.15	on the head,
GEN.3.15	and you will strike him
GEN.3.15	on the heel.”
GEN.3.16	Then the 
GEN.3.16	“You will suffer terribly
GEN.3.16	when you give birth.
GEN.3.16	But you will still desire
GEN.3.16	your husband,
GEN.3.16	and he will rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	“You listened to your wife
GEN.3.17	and ate the fruit
GEN.3.17	I told you not to eat.
GEN.3.17	And so, the ground
GEN.3.17	will be under a curse
GEN.3.17	because of what you did.
GEN.3.17	As long as you live,
GEN.3.17	you will have to struggle
GEN.3.17	to grow enough food.
GEN.3.18	Your food will be plants,
GEN.3.18	but the ground will produce
GEN.3.18	thorns and thistles.
GEN.3.19	You will sweat all your life
GEN.3.19	to earn a living;
GEN.3.19	you were made out of soil,
GEN.3.19	and you will once again
GEN.3.19	turn into soil.”
GEN.3.20	The man Adam
GEN.3.21	Then the 
GEN.3.23	So the 
GEN.3.24	Then God put winged creatures at the entrance to the garden and a flaming, flashing sword to guard the way to the life-giving tree.
GEN.4.1	Adam
GEN.4.2	Later she had another son and named him Abel.
GEN.4.2	Abel became a sheep farmer, but Cain farmed the land. 
GEN.4.3	One day, Cain gave part of his harvest to the 
GEN.4.4	 and Abel also gave an offering to the 
GEN.4.5	but not with Cain and his offering. This made Cain so angry that he could not hide his feelings.
GEN.4.6	The 
GEN.4.6	What's wrong with you? Why do you look so angry? 
GEN.4.7	If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling.
GEN.4.9	Afterwards the 
GEN.4.9	“How should I know?” he answered. “Am I supposed to look after my brother?”
GEN.4.10	Why have you done this terrible thing? You killed your own brother, and his blood flowed onto the ground. Now his blood is calling out for me to punish you. 
GEN.4.11	And so, I'll put you under a curse. Because you killed Abel and made his blood run out on the ground, you will never be able to farm it again. 
GEN.4.12	When you try to farm the land, it won't produce anything for you. From now on, you'll be without a home, and you'll spend the rest of your life wandering from place to place.
GEN.4.13	“This punishment is too hard!” Cain said. 
GEN.4.14	“You're making me leave my home and live far from you.
GEN.4.15	“No!”
GEN.4.16	But Cain had to go far from the 
GEN.4.17	Later, Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch. At the time Cain was building a town, and so he named it Enoch after his son. 
GEN.4.18	Then Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methushael, who had a son named Lamech.
GEN.4.19	Lamech married Adah, then Zillah. 
GEN.4.20+GEN.4.21	Lamech and Adah had two sons, Jabal and Jubal. Their son Jabal was the first to live in tents and raise sheep and goats. Jubal was the first to play harps and flutes.
GEN.4.22	Lamech and Zillah had a son named Tubal Cain who made tools out of bronze and iron. They also had a daughter, whose name was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	One day, Lamech said to his two wives, “A young man wounded me, and I killed him. 
GEN.4.24	Anyone who tries to get even with me will be punished ten times more than anyone who tries to get even with Cain.”
GEN.4.25	Adam and his wife had another son. They named him Seth, because they said, “God has given
GEN.4.26	Later, Seth had a son and named him Enosh.
GEN.4.26	About this time people started worshiping the 
GEN.5.3+GEN.5.4	When Adam was 130, he had a son who was just like him, and he named him Seth. Adam had more children 
GEN.5.5	and died at the age of 930.
GEN.5.6	When Seth was 105, he had a son named Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Seth had more children 
GEN.5.8	and died at the age of 912.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh was 90, he had a son named Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh had more children 
GEN.5.11	and died at the age of 905.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan was 70, he had a son named Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	Kenan had more children 
GEN.5.14	and died at the age of 910.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel was 65, he had a son named Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Mahalalel had more children 
GEN.5.17	and died at the age of 895.
GEN.5.18	When Jared was 162, he had a son named Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Jared had more children 
GEN.5.20	and died at the age of 962.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch was 65, he had a son named Methuselah, 
GEN.5.22	and during the next 300 years he had more children. Enoch truly loved God, 
GEN.5.23+GEN.5.24	 and God took him away at the age of 365.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah was 187, he had a son named Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	Methuselah had more children 
GEN.5.27	and died at the age of 969.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech was one 182, he had a son. 
GEN.5.29	Lamech said, “I'll name him Noah because he will give us comfort,
GEN.5.30	Lamech had more children 
GEN.5.31	and died at the age of 777.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was 500 years old, he had three sons and named them Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.3	Then the 
GEN.6.6	He was sorry that he had made them, 
GEN.6.7	and he said, “I'm going to destroy every person on earth! I'll even wipe out animals, birds, and reptiles. I'm sorry I ever made them.”
GEN.6.8	But the 
GEN.6.9	 and this is the story about him. Noah was the only person who lived right and obeyed God. 
GEN.6.10	He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11+GEN.6.12	God knew that everyone was terribly cruel and violent. 
GEN.6.13	So he told Noah:
GEN.6.13	Cruelty and violence have spread everywhere. Now I'm going to destroy the whole earth and all its people. 
GEN.6.14	Get some good lumber and build a boat. Put rooms in it and cover it with tar inside and out. 
GEN.6.15	Make it 133 meters long, 22 meters wide, and 13 meters high. 
GEN.6.16	Build a roof
GEN.6.17	I'm going to send a flood that will destroy everything that breathes! Nothing will be left alive. 
GEN.6.18	But I solemnly promise that you, your wife, your sons, and your daughters-in-law will be kept safe in the boat.
GEN.6.19+GEN.6.20	Take into the boat with you a male and a female of every kind of animal and bird, as well as a male and a female of every reptile. I don't want them to be destroyed. 
GEN.6.21	Store up enough food both for yourself and for them.
GEN.7.1	The 
GEN.7.1	Take your whole family with you into the boat, because you are the only one on this earth who pleases me. 
GEN.7.2	Take seven pairs of every kind of animal that can be used for sacrifice
GEN.7.3	Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird with you. Do this so there will always be animals and birds on the earth. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I will send rain that will last for 40 days and nights, and I will destroy all other living creatures I have made.
GEN.7.8+GEN.7.9	He obeyed God and took a male and a female of each kind of animal and bird into the boat with him. 
GEN.7.10	Seven days later a flood began to cover the earth.
GEN.7.13	On that day Noah and his wife went into the boat with their three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives. 
GEN.7.14	They took along every kind of animal, tame and wild, including the birds. 
GEN.7.15	Noah took a male and a female of every living creature with him, 
GEN.7.16	just as God had told him to do. And when they were all in the boat, the 
GEN.7.17+GEN.7.18	For 40 days the rain poured down without stopping. And the water became deeper and deeper, until the boat started floating high above the ground. 
GEN.7.19+GEN.7.20	Finally, the mighty flood was so deep that even the highest mountain peaks were about seven meters below the surface of the water. 
GEN.7.21	Not a bird, animal, reptile, or human was left alive anywhere on earth. 
GEN.7.22+GEN.7.23	 The 
GEN.7.24	A hundred fifty days later, the water started going down.
GEN.8.1	God did not forget about Noah and the animals with him in the boat. So God made a wind blow, and the water started going down. 
GEN.8.2	God stopped up the places where the water had been gushing out from under the earth. He also closed up the sky, and the rain stopped. 
GEN.8.3	For 150 days the water slowly went down. 
GEN.8.4	Then on the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the year, the boat came to rest somewhere in the Ararat mountains. 
GEN.8.5	The water kept going down, and the mountain tops could be seen on the first day of the tenth month.
GEN.8.6+GEN.8.7	Forty days later Noah opened a window to send out a raven, but it kept flying around until the water had dried up. 
GEN.8.8	Noah wanted to find out if the water had gone down, so he sent out a dove. 
GEN.8.9	Deep water was still everywhere, and when the dove could not find a place to land, it flew back to the boat. Then Noah held out his hand and helped it back in.
GEN.8.10	Seven days later Noah sent the dove out again. 
GEN.8.11	It returned in the evening, holding in its beak a green leaf from an olive tree. Noah knew the water was finally going down. 
GEN.8.12	He waited seven more days before sending the dove out again, and this time it did not return.
GEN.8.13	Noah was now 601 years old. And by the first day of that year, almost all the water had gone away. Noah made an opening in the roof of the boat
GEN.8.14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was completely dry.
GEN.8.15	God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“You, your wife, your sons, and your daughters-in-law may now leave the boat. 
GEN.8.17	Let out the birds, animals, and reptiles, so they can mate and live all over the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	After Noah and his family had left the boat, 
GEN.8.19	the living creatures left in groups of their own kind.
GEN.8.20	Noah built an altar where he could offer sacrifices to the 
GEN.8.21	The smell of the burning offering pleased the 
GEN.8.21	Never again will I punish the earth for the sinful things its people do. All of them have evil thoughts from the time they are young, but I will never destroy everything that breathes, as I did this time.
GEN.8.22	As long as the earth remains,
GEN.8.22	there will be planting
GEN.8.22	and harvest,
GEN.8.22	cold and heat;
GEN.8.22	winter and summer,
GEN.8.22	day and night.
GEN.9.1	I am giving you my blessing. Have a lot of children and grandchildren, so people will live everywhere on this earth. 
GEN.9.2	All animals, birds, reptiles, and fish will be afraid of you. I have placed them under your control, 
GEN.9.3	and I have given them to you for food. From now on, you may eat them, as well as the green plants that you have always eaten. 
GEN.9.4	 But life is in the blood, and you must not eat any meat that still has blood in it. 
GEN.9.5+GEN.9.6	 I created humans to be like me, and I will punish any animal or person that takes a human life. If an animal kills someone, that animal must die. And if a person takes the life of another, that person must be put to death.
GEN.9.8	Again, God said to Noah and his sons:
GEN.9.9	I am going to make a solemn promise to you and to everyone who will live after you. 
GEN.9.10	This includes the birds and the animals that came out of the boat. 
GEN.9.11	I promise every living creature that the earth and those living on it will never again be destroyed by a flood.
GEN.9.12+GEN.9.13	The rainbow that I have put in the sky will be my sign to you and to every living creature on earth. It will remind you that I will keep this promise forever. 
GEN.9.14	When I send clouds over the earth, and a rainbow appears in the sky, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my promise to you and to all other living creatures. Never again will I let floodwaters destroy all life. 
GEN.9.16	When I see the rainbow in the sky, I will always remember the promise that I have made to every living creature. 
GEN.9.17	The rainbow will be the sign of that solemn promise.
GEN.9.18	Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, left the boat. Ham later had a son named Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	All people on earth are descendants of Noah's three sons.
GEN.9.20	Noah farmed the land and was the first to plant a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	One day he got drunk and was lying naked in his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham entered the tent and saw him naked, then went back outside and told his brothers. 
GEN.9.23	Shem and Japheth put a robe over their shoulders and walked backwards into the tent. Without looking at their father, they placed it over his body.
GEN.9.24	When Noah sobered up and learned what his youngest son had done, 
GEN.9.25	he said,
GEN.9.25	“I now put a curse on Canaan!
GEN.9.25	He will be the lowest slave
GEN.9.25	of his brothers.
GEN.9.26	I ask the 
GEN.9.26	to bless Shem
GEN.9.26	and make Canaan his slave.
GEN.9.27	I pray God will give Japheth
GEN.9.27	more and more
GEN.9.27	and let him take over
GEN.9.27	the territory of Shem.
GEN.9.27	May Canaan be his slave.”
GEN.9.28	Noah lived 350 years after the flood 
GEN.9.29	and died at the age of 950.
GEN.10.1	After the flood Shem, Ham, and Japheth had many descendants.

GEN.10.21+GEN.10.22+GEN.10.23+GEN.10.24+GEN.10.25+GEN.10.26+GEN.10.27+GEN.10.28+GEN.10.29+GEN.10.30+GEN.10.31	Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. Their land reached from Mesha in the direction of Sephar, the hill country in the east.
GEN.10.32	This completes the list of Noah's descendants. After the flood their descendants became nations and spread all over the world.
GEN.11.1	At first everyone spoke the same language, 
GEN.11.2	but after some of them moved from the east
GEN.11.3+GEN.11.4	they said:
GEN.11.3+GEN.11.4	Let's build a city with a tower that reaches to the sky! We'll use hard bricks and tar instead of stone and mortar. We'll become famous, and we won't be scattered all over the world.
GEN.11.5	But when the 
GEN.11.6	he said:
GEN.11.6	These people are working together because they all speak the same language. This is just the beginning. Soon they will be able to do anything they want. 
GEN.11.7	Let's go down and confuse them! We'll make them speak different languages, and they won't be able to understand each other.
GEN.11.8+GEN.11.9	So the people had to stop building the city, because the 
GEN.11.10+GEN.11.11	Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100, he had a son named Arpachshad. He had more children and died at the age of 600. This is a list of his descendants:
GEN.11.12	When Arpachshad was 35, he had a son named Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	Arpachshad had more children and died at the age of 438.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah was 30, he had a son named Eber. 
GEN.11.15	Shelah had more children and died at the age of 433.
GEN.11.16	When Eber was 34, he had a son named Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	Eber had more children and died at the age of 464.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg was 30, he had a son named Reu. 
GEN.11.19	Peleg had more children and died at the age of 239.
GEN.11.20	When Reu was 32 he had a son named Serug. 
GEN.11.21	Reu had more children and died at the age of 239.
GEN.11.22	When Serug was 30, he had a son named Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	Serug had more children and died at the age of 230.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor was 29, he had a son named Terah. 
GEN.11.25	Nahor had more children and died at the age of 148.
GEN.11.26+GEN.11.27+GEN.11.28	After Terah was 70 years old, he had three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran, who became the father of Lot. Terah's sons were born in the city of Ur in Chaldea,
GEN.11.29+GEN.11.30	Abram married Sarai, but she was not able to have children. And Nahor married Milcah, who was the daughter of Haran and the sister of Iscah.
GEN.11.31	Terah decided to move from Ur to the land of Canaan. He took along Abram and Sarai and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran. But when they came to the city of Haran,
GEN.11.32	Terah lived to be 205 years old and died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Leave your country, your family, and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you. 
GEN.12.2	I will bless you and make your descendants into a great nation. You will become famous and be a blessing to others. 
GEN.12.3	 I will bless those who bless you, but I will put a curse on anyone who puts a curse on you. Everyone on earth will be blessed because of you.
GEN.12.4+GEN.12.5	Abram was 75 years old when the 
GEN.12.4+GEN.12.5	When they came to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram went as far as the sacred tree of Moreh in a place called Shechem. The Canaanites were still living in the land at that time, 
GEN.12.7	 but the 
GEN.12.8	Abram traveled to the hill country east of Bethel and camped between Bethel and Ai, where he built another altar and worshiped the 
GEN.12.9	Later, Abram started out toward the Southern Desert.
GEN.12.10+GEN.12.11	The crops failed, and there was no food anywhere in Canaan. So Abram and his wife Sarai went to live in Egypt for a while. But just before they got there, Abram said, “Sarai, you are really beautiful! 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will murder me because I am your husband. But they won't kill you. 
GEN.12.13	 Please save my life by saying you are my sister.”
GEN.12.14	As soon as Abram and Sarai arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed how beautiful she was. 
GEN.12.15	The king's
GEN.12.16	The king was good to Abram because of Sarai, and Abram was given sheep, cattle, donkeys, slaves, and camels.
GEN.12.17	Because of Sarai, the 
GEN.12.18	Finally, the king sent for Abram and said to him, “What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me Sarai was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you make me believe she was your sister? Now I've married her. Take her and go! She's your wife.”
GEN.12.20	So the king told his men to let Abram and Sarai take their possessions and leave.
GEN.13.1	Abram and Sarai took everything they owned and went to the Southern Desert. Lot went with them.
GEN.13.2	Abram was very rich. He owned many cattle, sheep, and goats, and had a lot of silver and gold. 
GEN.13.3	Abram moved from place to place in the Southern Desert. And finally, he went north and set up his tents between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	where he had earlier camped and built an altar. There he worshiped the 
GEN.13.5	Lot, who was traveling with him, also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and slaves. 
GEN.13.6+GEN.13.7	At this time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were still living in the same area, and so there wasn't enough pastureland left for Abram and Lot with all of their animals. Besides this, the men who took care of Abram's animals and the ones who took care of Lot's animals started quarreling.
GEN.13.8	Abram said to Lot, “We are close relatives. We shouldn't argue, and our men shouldn't be fighting one another. 
GEN.13.9	There is plenty of land for you to choose from. Let's separate. If you go north, I'll go south; if you go south, I'll go north.”
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself, and as he started out toward the east, he and Abram separated. 
GEN.13.12	Abram stayed in the land of Canaan. But Lot settled near the cities of the valley and put up his tents not far from Sodom, 
GEN.13.13	where the people were evil and sinned terribly against the 
GEN.13.14	After Abram and Lot had gone their separate ways, the 
GEN.13.14	Look around to the north, south, east, and west. 
GEN.13.15	 I will give you and your family all the land you can see. It will be theirs forever! 
GEN.13.16	I will give you more descendants than there are specks of dust on the earth, and someday it will be easier to count those specks of dust than to count your descendants. 
GEN.13.17	Now walk back and forth across the land, because I am going to give it to you.
GEN.13.18	Abram took down his tents and went to live near the sacred trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar in honor of the 
GEN.14.1	About this time, King Amraphel of Babylonia,
GEN.14.2	attacked King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, a city also known as Zoar. 
GEN.14.3+GEN.14.4	King Chedorlaomer and his allies had ruled these last five kings for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year the kings rebelled and joined forces in Siddim Valley, which is now covered by the southern part of the Dead Sea.
GEN.14.5	A year later King Chedorlaomer and his allies attacked and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, and the Emites in Shaveh-Kiriathaim. 
GEN.14.6	They also defeated the Horites in the hill country of Edom,
GEN.14.7	They went back to the city of Enmishpat, better known as Kadesh. Then they captured all the land that belonged to the Amalekites, and they defeated the Amorites who were living in Hazazon-Tamar.
GEN.14.8+GEN.14.9	At Siddim Valley, the armies of the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela fought the armies of King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Babylonia, and King Arioch of Ellasar. The valley 
GEN.14.10	was full of tar pits, and when the troops from Sodom and Gomorrah started running away, some of them fell into the pits. Others escaped to the hill country. 
GEN.14.11	Their enemies took everything of value from Sodom and Gomorrah, including their food supplies. 
GEN.14.12	They also captured Abram's nephew Lot, who lived in Sodom. They took him and his possessions and then left.
GEN.14.13	At this time Abram the Hebrew was living near the oaks that belonged to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his brothers Eshcol and Aner were Abram's friends. Someone who had escaped from the battle told Abram 
GEN.14.14	that his nephew Lot had been taken away. Three hundred and eighteen of Abram's servants were fighting men, so he took them and followed the enemy as far north as the city of Dan.
GEN.14.15	That night, Abram divided up his troops, attacked from all sides, and won a great victory. But some of the enemy escaped to the town of Hobah north of Damascus, 
GEN.14.16	and Abram went after them. He brought back his nephew Lot, together with Lot's possessions and the women and everyone else who had been captured.
GEN.14.17	Abram returned after he had defeated King Chedorlaomer and the other kings. Then the king of Sodom went to meet Abram in Shaveh Valley, which is also known as King's Valley.
GEN.14.19	and said to Abram:
GEN.14.19	“I bless you in the name
GEN.14.19	of God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Creator of heaven and earth.
GEN.14.20	All praise belongs
GEN.14.20	to God Most High
GEN.14.20	for helping you defeat
GEN.14.20	your enemies.”
GEN.14.20	Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “All I want are my people. You can keep everything else.”
GEN.14.22	Abram answered:
GEN.14.22	The 
GEN.14.23	that I won't keep anything of yours, not even a sandal strap or a piece of thread. Then you can never say that you are the one who made me rich. 
GEN.14.24	Let my share be the food that my men have eaten. But Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre went with me, so give them their share of what we brought back.
GEN.15.1	Later the 
GEN.15.2	But Abram answered, “
GEN.15.3	You have not given me any children, and this servant of mine will inherit everything.”
GEN.15.4	The 
GEN.15.5	 Then the 
GEN.15.6	 Abram believed the 
GEN.15.7	The 
GEN.15.8	Abram asked, “
GEN.15.9	Then the 
GEN.15.10	Abram obeyed the 
GEN.15.11	And when birds came down to eat the animals, Abram chased them away.
GEN.15.13+GEN.15.14+GEN.15.15	 Then the 
GEN.15.13+GEN.15.14+GEN.15.15	Abram, you will live to an old age and die in peace.
GEN.15.13+GEN.15.14+GEN.15.15	But I solemnly promise that your descendants will live as foreigners in a land that doesn't belong to them. They will be forced into slavery and abused for 400 years. But I will terribly punish the nation that enslaves them, and they will leave with many possessions.
GEN.15.16	Four generations later,
GEN.15.17	Sometime after sunset, when it was very dark, a smoking cooking pot
GEN.15.18	 At that time the 
GEN.15.18	I will give your descendants the land east of the Shihor River
GEN.15.19	They will possess the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
GEN.16.1	Abram's wife Sarai had not been able to have any children. But she owned a young Egyptian slave woman named Hagar, 
GEN.16.2	and Sarai said to Abram, “The 
GEN.16.3	and Sarai gave him Hagar to be his wife. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan for ten years. 
GEN.16.4	Later, when Hagar knew she was going to have a baby, she became proud and treated Sarai hatefully.
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “It's all your fault!
GEN.16.6	Abram said, “All right! She's your slave—do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai began treating Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away.
GEN.16.7	Hagar stopped to rest at a spring in the desert on the road to Shur. While she was there, the angel of the 
GEN.16.8	and asked, “Hagar, where have you come from, and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	She answered, “I'm running away from Sarai, my owner.”
GEN.16.9	The angel said, “Go back to Sarai and be her slave. 
GEN.16.10+GEN.16.11	I will give you a son, who will be called Ishmael,
GEN.16.12	But your son will live far from his relatives; he will be like a wild donkey, fighting everyone, and everyone fighting him.”
GEN.16.13	Hagar thought, “Have I really seen God and lived to tell about it?”
GEN.16.14	That's why people call the well between Kadesh and Bered, “The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.”
GEN.17.1	When Abram was 99 years old, the 
GEN.17.2	I will keep my solemn promise to you and give you more descendants than can be counted.” 
GEN.17.3	Abram bowed with his face to the ground, and God said:
GEN.17.6	I will give you a lot of descendants, and they will become great nations. Some of them will even be kings.
GEN.17.8	 I will give you and them the land in which you are now a foreigner. I will give the whole land of Canaan to your family forever, and I will be their God.
GEN.17.9	Abraham, you and all future members of your family must promise to obey me. 
GEN.17.10+GEN.17.11	 As the sign that you are keeping this promise, you must circumcise every man and boy in your family. 
GEN.17.12+GEN.17.13	From now on, your family must circumcise every baby boy when he is eight days old. You must even circumcise any man or boy you have as a slave, both those born in your homes and those you buy from foreigners. This will be a sign that my promise to you will last forever. 
GEN.17.14	Any man who isn't circumcised hasn't kept his part of the promise and cannot be one of my people.
GEN.17.15	Abraham, from now on your wife's name will be Sarah instead of Sarai. 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and you will have a son by her. She will become the mother of nations, and some of her descendants will even be kings.
GEN.17.17	Abraham bowed with his face to the ground and thought, “I am almost 100 years old. How can I become a father? And Sarah is 90. How can she have a child?” So he started laughing. 
GEN.17.18	Then he asked God, “Why not let Ishmael
GEN.17.19	But God answered:
GEN.17.19	No! You and Sarah will have a son. His name will be Isaac,
GEN.17.20	However, I have heard what you asked me to do for Ishmael, and so I will also bless him with many descendants. He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make his family a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But your son Isaac will be born about this time next year, and the promise I am making to you and your family will be for him and his descendants forever.
GEN.17.22	God finished speaking to Abraham and then left.
GEN.17.23+GEN.17.24+GEN.17.25+GEN.17.26+GEN.17.27	On that same day Abraham obeyed God by circumcising Ishmael. Abraham was also circumcised, and so were all the other men and boys in his household, including his servants and slaves. He was 99 years old at the time, and his son Ishmael was 13.
GEN.18.1	One hot summer afternoon while Abraham was sitting by the entrance to his tent near the sacred trees of Mamre, the 
GEN.18.2	 Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly ran to meet them, bowed with his face to the ground, 
GEN.18.3	and said, “Please come to my home where I can serve you. 
GEN.18.4	I'll have some water brought, so you can wash your feet, then you can rest under a tree. 
GEN.18.5	Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave. I would be honored to serve you.”
GEN.18.5	“Thank you very much,” they answered. “We accept your offer.”
GEN.18.6	Abraham went quickly to his tent and said to Sarah, “Hurry! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread.” 
GEN.18.7	After saying this, he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves, which his servant quickly prepared. 
GEN.18.8	He then served his guests some yogurt and milk together with the meat.
GEN.18.8	While they were eating, he stood near them under the tree, 
GEN.18.9	and they asked, “Where's your wife Sarah?”
GEN.18.9	“She is right there in the tent,” Abraham answered.
GEN.18.10	Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent. 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was well past the age for having children. 
GEN.18.12	 So she laughed and said to herself, “Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, will I really know such happiness?”
GEN.18.13	The 
GEN.18.14	 I am the 
GEN.18.15	Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said, “I didn't laugh.”
GEN.18.15	“Yes, you did!” he answered.
GEN.18.16	When the three men got ready to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked part of the way with them.
GEN.18.17	The 
GEN.18.18	since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all the other nations on earth.
GEN.18.19	I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me forever and to do what is right and fair. If they do, I will give Abraham many descendants, just as I promised.”
GEN.18.20	The 
GEN.18.21	Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren't, I would like to know.”
GEN.18.22	The men turned and started toward Sodom. But the 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham asked him, “
GEN.18.24	Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only 50 good people in it? 
GEN.18.25	You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.”
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Abraham answered, “I am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, 
GEN.18.28	But suppose there are only 45 good people in Sodom. Would you still wipe out the whole city?”
GEN.18.28	“If I find 45 good people,” the 
GEN.18.29	“Suppose there are just 40 good people?” Abraham asked.
GEN.18.29	“Even for them,” the 
GEN.18.30	Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, 
GEN.18.30	“If I find 30,” the 
GEN.18.31	Then Abraham said, “I don't have any right to ask you, 
GEN.18.31	“Because of them, I won't destroy the city,” was the 
GEN.18.32	Finally, Abraham said, “Please don't get angry, 
GEN.18.32	“For the sake of 10 good people,” the 
GEN.18.33	After speaking with Abraham, the 
GEN.19.1	That evening, while Lot was sitting near the city gate,
GEN.19.2	and said, “Gentlemen, I am your servant. Please come to my home. You can wash your feet, spend the night, and be on your way in the morning.”
GEN.19.2	They told him, “No, we'll spend the night in the city square.” 
GEN.19.3	But Lot kept insisting, until they finally agreed and went home with him. He quickly baked some bread,
GEN.19.4	Before Lot and his guests could go to bed, every man in Sodom, young and old, came and stood outside his house 
GEN.19.5	 and started shouting, “Where are your visitors? Send them out, so we can have sex with them!”
GEN.19.6	Lot went outside and shut the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	Then he said, “Friends, please don't do such a terrible thing! 
GEN.19.8	I have two daughters who have never had sex. I'll bring them out, and you can do what you want with them. But don't harm these men. They are guests in my home.”
GEN.19.9	“Don't get in our way,” the crowd answered. “You're a foreigner. What right do you have to order us around? We'll do worse things to you than we're going to do to them.”
GEN.19.9	The crowd kept arguing with Lot. Finally, they rushed toward the door to break it down. 
GEN.19.10	But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside. 
GEN.19.11	 Then they struck blind everyone in the crowd, and none of them could even find the door.
GEN.19.12+GEN.19.13	The two angels said to Lot, “The 
GEN.19.14	Lot went to the men who were engaged to his daughters and said, “Hurry up and get out of here! The 
GEN.19.15	Early the next morning the two angels tried to make Lot hurry and leave. They said, “Take your wife and your two daughters and get away from here as fast as you can! If you don't, every one of you will be killed when the 
GEN.19.16	 At first, Lot just stood there. But the 
GEN.19.17	When they were outside, one of the angels said, “Run for your lives! Don't even look back. And don't stop in the valley. Run to the hills, where you'll be safe.”
GEN.19.18+GEN.19.19	Lot answered, “You have done us a great favor, sir. You have saved our lives, but please don't make us go to the hills. That's too far away. The city will be destroyed before we can get there, and we will be killed when it happens. 
GEN.19.20	There's a town near here. It's only a small place, but my family and I will be safe, if you let us go there.”
GEN.19.21	“All right, go there,” he answered. “I won't destroy that town. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry! Run! I can't do anything until you are safely there.”
GEN.19.22	The town was later called Zoar
GEN.19.23	The sun was coming up as Lot reached the town of Zoar, 
GEN.19.24	 and the 
GEN.19.25	He destroyed those cities and everyone who lived in them, as well as their land and the trees and grass that grew there.
GEN.19.27	That same morning Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood and spoken with the 
GEN.19.28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw smoke rising from all over the land—it was like a flaming furnace.
GEN.19.29	When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot lived, he remembered his promise to Abraham and saved Lot from the terrible destruction.
GEN.19.30	Lot was afraid to stay on in Zoar. So he took his two daughters and moved to a cave in the hill country. 
GEN.19.31	One day his older daughter said to her sister, “Our father is old, and there are no men anywhere for us to marry. 
GEN.19.32	Let's get our father drunk! Then we can sleep with him and have children.” 
GEN.19.33	That night they got their father drunk, and the older daughter got in bed with him, but he was too drunk even to know she was there.
GEN.19.34	The next day the older daughter said to her sister, “I slept with my father last night. We'll get him drunk again tonight, so you can sleep with him, and we can each have a child.” 
GEN.19.35	That night they got their father drunk, and this time the younger sister slept with him. But once again he was too drunk even to know she was there.
GEN.19.36	That's how Lot's two daughters had children. 
GEN.19.37	The older daughter named her son Moab,
GEN.19.38	The younger daughter named her son Benammi,
GEN.20.1	Abraham moved to the Southern Desert, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. Later he went to Gerar, and while there 
GEN.20.2	 he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said, “You have taken a married woman into your home, and for this you will die!”
GEN.20.4+GEN.20.5	Abimelech said to the Lord, “Don't kill me! I haven't slept with Sarah. Didn't they say they were brother and sister? I am completely innocent.”
GEN.20.6	Then God continued:
GEN.20.6	I know you are innocent. That's why I kept you from sleeping with Sarah and doing anything wrong. 
GEN.20.7	Her husband is a prophet. Let her go back to him, and his prayers will save you from death. But if you don't return her, you and all your people will die.
GEN.20.8	Early the next morning Abimelech sent for his officials, and when he told them what had happened, they were frightened. 
GEN.20.9	Abimelech then called in Abraham and said:
GEN.20.9	Look what you've done to us! What have I ever done to you? Why did you make me and my nation guilty of such a terrible sin? 
GEN.20.10	What were you thinking when you did this?
GEN.20.11	Abraham answered:
GEN.20.11	I did it because I didn't think any of you respected God, and I was sure that someone would kill me to get my wife. 
GEN.20.12	Besides, she is my half sister. We have the same father, but different mothers. 
GEN.20.13	When God made us leave my father's home and start wandering, I told her, “If you really love me, then tell everyone that I am your brother.”
GEN.20.14	After Abimelech had given Abraham some sheep, cattle, and slaves, he sent Sarah back 
GEN.20.15	and told Abraham he could settle anywhere in his country. 
GEN.20.16	Then he said to Sarah, “I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver as proof to everyone that you have done nothing wrong.”
GEN.20.17+GEN.20.18	Meanwhile, God had kept Abimelech's wife and slaves from having children. But Abraham prayed, and God let them start having children again.
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	 Although Abraham was very old, Sarah had a son exactly at the time God had said. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham named his son Isaac, 
GEN.21.4	 and when the boy was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, just as God had commanded.
GEN.21.5	Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, 
GEN.21.6	and Sarah said, “God has made me laugh.
GEN.21.7	Who would have dared to tell Abraham that someday I would have a child? But in his old age, I have given him a son.”
GEN.21.8	The time came when Sarah no longer had to nurse Isaac,
GEN.21.11	Abraham was worried about Ishmael. 
GEN.21.12	 But God said, “Abraham, don't worry about your slave woman and the boy. Just do what Sarah tells you. Isaac will inherit your family name, 
GEN.21.13	but the son of the slave woman is also your son, and I will make his descendants into a great nation.”
GEN.21.14	Early the next morning Abraham gave Hagar an animal skin full of water and some bread. Then he put the boy on her shoulder and sent them away.
GEN.21.14	They wandered around in the desert near Beersheba, 
GEN.21.15	and after they had run out of water, Hagar put her son under a bush. 
GEN.21.16	Then she sat down a long way off, because she could not bear to watch him die. And she cried bitterly.
GEN.21.17	When God heard the boy crying, the angel of God called out to Hagar from heaven and said, “Hagar, why are you worried? Don't be afraid. I have heard your son crying. 
GEN.21.18	Help him up and hold his hand, because I will make him the father of a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God let her see a well. So she went to the well and filled the skin with water, then gave some to her son.
GEN.21.20+GEN.21.21	God blessed Ishmael, and as the boy grew older, he became an expert at hunting with his bow and arrows. He lived in the Paran Desert, and his mother chose an Egyptian woman for him to marry.
GEN.21.23	Now I want you to promise in the name of God that you will always be loyal to me and my descendants, just as I have always been loyal to you in this land where you have lived as a foreigner.” 
GEN.21.24	And so, Abraham promised he would.
GEN.21.25	One day, Abraham told Abimelech, “Some of your servants have taken over one of my wells.”
GEN.21.26	“This is the first I've heard about it,” Abimelech replied. “Why haven't you said something before? I don't have any idea who did it.” 
GEN.21.27	Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle, then the two men made a peace treaty.
GEN.21.28	Abraham separated seven female lambs from his flock of sheep, 
GEN.21.29	and Abimelech asked, “Why have you done this?”
GEN.21.30	Abraham replied, “I want you to accept these seven lambs as proof that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	So they called the place Beersheba,
GEN.21.32	When the treaty was completed, Abimelech and his army commander Phicol went back to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree
GEN.21.34	Then Abraham lived a long time as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines.
GEN.22.1	Abraham answered, “Here I am, 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham got up early the next morning and chopped wood for the fire. He put a saddle on his donkey and set out with Isaac and two servants for the place where God had told him to go.
GEN.22.4	Three days later Abraham looked off in the distance and saw the place. 
GEN.22.5	He told his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while my son and I go over there to worship. We will come back.”
GEN.22.6	Abraham put the wood on Isaac's shoulder, but he carried the hot coals and the knife. As the two of them walked along, 
GEN.22.7+GEN.22.8	Isaac said, “Father, we have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?”
GEN.22.7+GEN.22.8	“My son,” Abraham answered, “God will provide the lamb.”
GEN.22.7+GEN.22.8	The two of them walked on, and 
GEN.22.9	 when they reached the place that God had told him about, Abraham built an altar and placed the wood on it. Next, he tied up his son and put him on the wood. 
GEN.22.10	 He then took the knife and got ready to kill his son. 
GEN.22.11	But the 
GEN.22.11	“Here I am!” he answered.
GEN.22.12	“Don't hurt the boy or harm him in any way!” the angel said. “Now I know that you truly obey God, because you were willing to offer him your only son.”
GEN.22.13	Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes. So he took the ram and sacrificed it instead of his son.
GEN.22.14	Abraham named that place “The 
GEN.22.15	The 
GEN.22.17	 “I will bless you and give you such a large family, that someday your descendants will be more numerous than the stars in the sky or the grains of sand along the seashore. They will defeat their enemies and take over the cities where their enemies live. 
GEN.22.18	 You have obeyed me, and so you and your descendants will be a blessing to all nations on earth.”
GEN.22.19	Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him, and they returned to Abraham's home in Beersheba.
GEN.22.20+GEN.22.21+GEN.22.22+GEN.22.23	Abraham's brother Nahor had married Milcah, and Abraham was later told that they had eight sons. Uz was their first-born; Buz was next, and then there was Kemuel the father of Aram; their other five sons were: Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel the father of Rebekah. 
GEN.22.24	Nahor also had another wife.
GEN.23.1+GEN.23.2	When Sarah was 127 years old, she died in Kiriath-Arba, better known as Hebron, in the land of Canaan. After Abraham had mourned for her, 
GEN.23.3	he went to the Hittites and said, 
GEN.23.4	 “I live as a foreigner in your land, and I don't own any property where I can bury my wife. Please let me buy a piece of land.”
GEN.23.5+GEN.23.6	“Sir,” they answered, “you are an important man. Choose the best place to bury your wife. None of us would refuse you a resting place for your dead.”
GEN.23.7	Abraham bowed down 
GEN.23.8	and replied, “If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Zohar's son Ephron 
GEN.23.9	to sell me Machpelah Cave at the end of his field. I'll pay what it's worth, and all of you can be witnesses.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron was sitting there near the city gate, when Abraham made this request, and he answered, 
GEN.23.11	“Sir, the whole field, including the cave, is yours. With my own people as witnesses, I freely give it to you as a burial place for your dead.”
GEN.23.12	Once again, Abraham bowed down 
GEN.23.13	and said to Ephron, “In front of these witnesses, I offer you the full price, so I can bury my wife. Please accept my offer.”
GEN.23.14+GEN.23.15	“But sir,” the man replied, “the property is worth only 400 pieces of silver. Why should we haggle over such a small amount? Take the land. It's yours.”
GEN.23.16+GEN.23.17+GEN.23.18	Abraham accepted Ephron's offer and paid him the 400 pieces of silver in front of everyone at the city gate. That's how Abraham came to own Ephron's property east of Mamre,
GEN.23.19	So Abraham buried his wife Sarah in Machpelah Cave that was in the field 
GEN.23.20	he had bought from the Hittites.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now a very old man. The 
GEN.24.2	One day, Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him, “Solemnly promise me 
GEN.24.3	in the name of the 
GEN.24.4	Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives.”
GEN.24.5	But the servant asked, “What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife?”
GEN.24.6	“No!” Abraham answered. “Don't ever do that, no matter what. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	If the woman refuses to come along, you don't have to keep this promise. But don't ever take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do.
GEN.24.10	Soon after that, the servant loaded ten of Abraham's camels with valuable gifts. Then he set out for the city in northern Syria,
GEN.24.11	When he got there, he let the camels rest near the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when the women came out for water. 
GEN.24.12	The servant prayed:
GEN.24.12	You, 
GEN.24.13	The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water, 
GEN.24.14	and I'll ask one of them for a drink. If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master.
GEN.24.15+GEN.24.16	While he was still praying, a beautiful unmarried young woman came by with a water jar on her shoulder. She was Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. Rebekah walked past Abraham's servant, then went over to the well, and filled her water jar. When she started back, 
GEN.24.17	Abraham's servant ran to her and said, “Please let me have a drink of water.”
GEN.24.18	“I'll be glad to,” she answered. Then she quickly took the jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank. 
GEN.24.19+GEN.24.20	After he had finished, she said, “Now I'll give your camels all the water they want.” She quickly poured out water for them, and she kept going back for more, until his camels had drunk all they wanted. 
GEN.24.21	Abraham's servant did not say a word, but he watched everything Rebekah did, because he wanted to know for certain if this was the woman the 
GEN.24.22	The servant had brought along an expensive gold ring and two large gold bracelets. When Rebekah had finished bringing the water, he gave her the ring for her nose
GEN.24.23	Then he said, “Please tell me who your father is. Does he have room in his house for me and my men to spend the night?”
GEN.24.24	She answered, “My father is Bethuel, the son of Nahor and Milcah. 
GEN.24.25	We have a place where you and your men can stay, and we also have enough straw and feed for your camels.”
GEN.24.26	Then the servant bowed his head and prayed, 
GEN.24.27	“I thank you, 
GEN.24.28	Rebekah ran straight home and told her family everything. 
GEN.24.29+GEN.24.30	Her brother Laban heard her tell what the servant had said, and he saw the ring and the bracelets she was wearing. So Laban ran out to Abraham's servant, who was standing by his camels at the well. 
GEN.24.31	Then Laban said, “The 
GEN.24.32	Abraham's servant went home with Laban, where Laban's servants unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed. Then they brought water into the house, so Abraham's servant and his men could wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	After that, they brought in food. But the servant said, “Before I eat, I must tell you why I have come.”
GEN.24.33	“Go ahead and tell us,” Laban answered.
GEN.24.34	The servant explained:
GEN.24.34	I am Abraham's servant. 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	Sarah, my master's wife, didn't have any children until she was very old. Then she had a son, and my master has given him everything. 
GEN.24.37	I solemnly promised my master that I would do what he said. And he told me, “Don't choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan. 
GEN.24.38	Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives.”
GEN.24.39	I asked my master, “What if the young woman refuses to come with me?”
GEN.24.40	My master answered, “I have always obeyed the 
GEN.24.41	But if they refuse to let her come back with you, then you are freed from your promise.”
GEN.24.42	When I came to the well today, I silently prayed, “You, 
GEN.24.43	while I am here at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I'll ask her to give me a drink. 
GEN.24.44	If she gives me a drink and offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen.”
GEN.24.45	Even before I had finished praying, Rebekah came by with a water jar on her shoulder. When she had filled the jar, I asked her for a drink. 
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, “Have a drink. Then I'll get water for your camels.” So I drank, and after that she got some water for my camels. 
GEN.24.47	I asked her who her father was, and she answered, “My father is Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah.” At once I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.48	Then I bowed my head and gave thanks to the God my master Abraham worships. The 
GEN.24.49	Now please tell me if you are willing to do the right thing for my master. Will you treat him fairly, or do I have to look for another young woman?
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “The 
GEN.24.51	Take Rebekah with you; she can marry your master's son, just as the 
GEN.24.52	Abraham's servant bowed down and thanked the 
GEN.24.53	Then he gave clothing, as well as silver and gold jewelry, to Rebekah. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and her mother.
GEN.24.54	Abraham's servant and the men with him ate and drank, then spent the night there. The next morning they got up, and the servant told Rebekah's mother and brother, “I would like to go back to my master now.”
GEN.24.55	“Let Rebekah stay with us for a week or ten days,” they answered. “Then she may go.”
GEN.24.56	But he said, “Don't make me stay any longer. The 
GEN.24.57	They answered, “Let's ask Rebekah what she wants to do.” 
GEN.24.58	They called her and asked, “Are you willing to leave with this man at once?”
GEN.24.58	“Yes,” she answered.
GEN.24.59	So they agreed to let Rebekah and an old family servant woman
GEN.24.60	They gave Rebekah their blessing and said, “We pray that God will give you many children and grandchildren and that he will help them defeat their enemies.” 
GEN.24.61	Afterwards, Rebekah and the young women who were to travel with her prepared to leave. Then they got on camels and left with Abraham's servant and his men.
GEN.24.62	At that time Isaac was living in the southern part of Canaan near a place called “The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.”
GEN.24.63+GEN.24.64+GEN.24.65	One evening he was walking
GEN.24.63+GEN.24.64+GEN.24.65	“He is my master Isaac,” the servant answered. Then Rebekah covered her face with her veil.
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.
GEN.24.67	Isaac took Rebekah into the tent
GEN.25.1	Abraham married Keturah, 
GEN.25.2	and they had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Later, Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan, and when Dedan grew up, he had three sons: Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	Midian also had five sons: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.
GEN.25.5+GEN.25.6	While Abraham was still alive, he gave gifts to the sons of Hagar and Keturah. He also sent their sons to live in the east far from his son Isaac, and when Abraham died, he left everything to Isaac.
GEN.25.7+GEN.25.8	Abraham died at the ripe old age of 175. 
GEN.25.9+GEN.25.10	 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him east of Hebron
GEN.25.11	God blessed Isaac after this, and Isaac moved to a place called “The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.”
GEN.25.12	Ishmael was the son of Abraham and Hagar, the slave woman of Sarah. 
GEN.25.13	Ishmael had twelve sons, in this order: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	Each of Ishmael's sons was a tribal chief, and a village was named after each of them.
GEN.25.17+GEN.25.18	Ishmael had settled in the land east of his brothers, and his sons
GEN.25.19	Isaac was the son of Abraham, 
GEN.25.20	and he was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel. She was also the sister of Laban, the Aramean from northern Syria.
GEN.25.20	Almost 20 years later, 
GEN.25.21	Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac asked the 
GEN.25.22	Before Rebekah gave birth, she knew she was going to have twins, because she could feel them inside her, fighting each other. She thought, “Why is this happening to me?” Finally, she asked the 
GEN.25.23	 and he told her:
GEN.25.23	“Your two sons will become
GEN.25.23	two separate nations.
GEN.25.23	The younger of the two
GEN.25.23	will be stronger,
GEN.25.23	and the older son
GEN.25.23	will be his servant.”
GEN.25.24	When Rebekah gave birth, 
GEN.25.25	the first baby was covered with red hair, so he was named Esau.
GEN.25.26	The second baby grabbed on to his brother's heel, so they named him Jacob.
GEN.25.27	As Jacob and Esau grew older, Esau liked the outdoors and became a good hunter, while Jacob lived the quiet life of a shepherd.
GEN.25.28	Esau would take the meat of wild animals to his father Isaac, so Isaac loved him more, but Jacob was his mother's favorite son.
GEN.25.29	One day, when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home hungry 
GEN.25.30	and said, “I'm starving to death! Here and now give me some of that red stew!” That's how Esau got the name “Edom.”
GEN.25.31	Jacob replied, “Sell me your rights as the first-born son.”
GEN.25.32	“I'm about to die,” Esau answered. “What good will those rights do me?”
GEN.25.34	Jacob then gave Esau some bread and some of the bean stew, and when Esau had finished eating and drinking, he just got up and left, showing how little he thought of his rights as the first-born.
GEN.26.1	Once during Abraham's lifetime, the fields had not produced enough grain, and now the same thing happened. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in the land of Gerar, 
GEN.26.2	because the 
GEN.26.2	Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go. 
GEN.26.3	 You will live there as a foreigner, but I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants.
GEN.26.4	I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all of this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth,
GEN.26.5	because Abraham did everything I told him to do.
GEN.26.6	Isaac moved to Gerar 
GEN.26.7	 with his beautiful wife Rebekah. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her, and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister. 
GEN.26.8	After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah. 
GEN.26.9	Abimelech called him in and said, “Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?”
GEN.26.9	“Because I thought someone would kill me,” Isaac answered.
GEN.26.10	“Don't you know what you've done?” Abimelech exclaimed. “If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!” 
GEN.26.11	Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death.
GEN.26.12	Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year. The 
GEN.26.13	and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich. 
GEN.26.14	In fact, the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep, goats, and slaves that Isaac owned, 
GEN.26.15	and they stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug before his death. 
GEN.26.16	Finally, Abimelech said, “Isaac, I want you to leave our country. You have become too powerful to stay here.”
GEN.26.17	Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley, 
GEN.26.18	where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up. Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name
GEN.26.19	While his servants were digging in the valley, they found a spring-fed well. 
GEN.26.20	But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarreled with Isaac's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them. So this well was named “Quarrel,” because they had quarreled with Isaac.
GEN.26.21	Isaac's servants dug another well, and the shepherds also quarreled about it. So that well was named “Jealous.” 
GEN.26.22	Finally, they dug one more well. There was no quarreling this time, and the well was named “Lots of Room,” because the 
GEN.26.23	Isaac went on to Beersheba, 
GEN.26.24	where the 
GEN.26.25	Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the 
GEN.26.27	When they arrived, Isaac asked, “Why are you here? Didn't you send me away because you hated me?”
GEN.26.28	They answered, “We now know for certain that the 
GEN.26.29	not to harm each other. Remember, we have never hurt you, and when we sent you away, we let you go in peace. The 
GEN.26.30	Isaac gave a big feast for them, and everyone ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement, then he let them go in peace.
GEN.26.32	Later that same day Isaac's servants came and said, “We've struck water!” 
GEN.26.33	So Isaac named the well Shibah,
GEN.26.34	When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	But these two women brought a lot of grief to Esau's parents Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	Isaac was old and almost blind, when he called in his first-born son Esau, who asked him, “Father, what can I do for you?”
GEN.27.2	Isaac replied, “I am old and might die at any time. 
GEN.27.3	So go hunting with your bow and arrows and kill a wild animal. 
GEN.27.4	Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.”
GEN.27.5	Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting, 
GEN.27.6	she said to Jacob, “I heard your father tell Esau 
GEN.27.7	to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for him before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the 
GEN.27.8	Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do. 
GEN.27.9	Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much. 
GEN.27.10	Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	“My brother Esau is a hairy man,” Jacob reminded her. “And I am not. 
GEN.27.12	If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.”
GEN.27.13	Rebekah insisted, “Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.” 
GEN.27.14	So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked. 
GEN.27.15	Then she took Esau's best clothes and put them on Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins 
GEN.27.17	and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked.
GEN.27.18	Jacob went to his father and said, “Father, here I am.”
GEN.27.18	“Which one of my sons are you?” his father asked.
GEN.27.19	Jacob replied, “I am Esau, your first-born, and I have done what you told me. Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought. Then you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.20	Isaac asked, “My son, how did you find an animal so quickly?”
GEN.27.20	“The 
GEN.27.21	“My son,” Isaac said, “come closer, where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau.” 
GEN.27.22	Jacob went closer. His father touched him and said, “You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau's.” 
GEN.27.23	And so Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau.
GEN.27.24	Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”
GEN.27.24	“Yes, I am,” Jacob answered.
GEN.27.25	So Isaac told him, “Serve me the wild meat, and I can give you my blessing.”
GEN.27.25	Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it. 
GEN.27.26	Then Isaac said, “Son, come over here and kiss me.” 
GEN.27.27	 While Jacob was kissing him, Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said:
GEN.27.27	“The smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is like a field
GEN.27.27	the 
GEN.27.28	God will bless you, my son,
GEN.27.28	with dew from heaven
GEN.27.28	and with fertile fields,
GEN.27.28	rich with grain and grapes.
GEN.27.29	and bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	You will rule over your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and they will kneel
GEN.27.29	at your feet.
GEN.27.29	Anyone who curses you
GEN.27.29	will be cursed;
GEN.27.29	anyone who blesses you
GEN.27.29	will be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	Right after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone, Esau came back from hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He cooked the tasty food, brought it to his father, and said, “Father, please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you, so you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.32	“Who are you?” Isaac asked.
GEN.27.32	“I am Esau, your first-born son.”
GEN.27.33	Isaac started trembling and said, “Then who brought me some wild meat right before you came in? I ate it and gave him a blessing that cannot be taken back.”
GEN.27.34	Esau cried out in great distress, “Father, give me a blessing too!”
GEN.27.35	Isaac answered, “Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing.”
GEN.27.37	“My son,” Isaac answered, “I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants. I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs. There's nothing left that I can do for you.”
GEN.27.39	“Your home will be far
GEN.27.39	from that fertile land,
GEN.27.39	where dew comes down
GEN.27.39	from the heavens.
GEN.27.40	of your sword
GEN.27.40	and be your brother's slave.
GEN.27.40	But when you decide to be free,
GEN.27.40	you will break loose.”
GEN.27.41	Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his. So he said to himself, “Just as soon as my father dies, I'll kill Jacob.”
GEN.27.43	Now listen carefully and do what I say. Go to the home of my brother Laban in Haran 
GEN.27.44	and stay with him for a while. When Esau stops being angry 
GEN.27.45	and forgets what you have done to him, I'll send for you to come home. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?”
GEN.27.46	Rebekah later told Isaac, “Those Hittite wives of Esau are making my life miserable! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman, I'd be better off dead.”
GEN.28.1	Isaac called in Jacob, then gave him a blessing, and said:
GEN.28.1	Don't marry any of those Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.2	Go at once to your mother's father Bethuel in northern Syria
GEN.28.3	I pray that God All-Powerful will bless you with many descendants and let you become a great nation. 
GEN.28.4	 May he bless you with the land he promised Abraham, so that you will take over this land where we now live as foreigners.
GEN.28.5	Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.
GEN.28.6	Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learned that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria
GEN.28.7	and that he had obeyed his father and mother. 
GEN.28.8	Esau already had several wives, but he now realized how much his father hated the Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	So he married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth
GEN.28.11	At sunset he stopped for the night and went to sleep, resting his head on a large rock. 
GEN.28.12	 In a dream he saw a ladder that reached from earth to heaven, and God's angels were going up and down on it.
GEN.28.13	I am the 
GEN.28.14	 Your descendants will spread over the earth in all directions and will become as numerous as the specks of dust. Your family will be a blessing to all people.
GEN.28.15	Wherever you go, I will watch over you, then later I will bring you back to this land. I won't leave you—I will do all I have promised.
GEN.28.16	Jacob woke up suddenly and thought, “The 
GEN.28.17	Then Jacob became frightened and said, “What a frightening place! It must be the house of God and the gateway to heaven.”
GEN.28.18	When Jacob got up early the next morning, he took the rock that he had used for a pillow and stood it up as a place of worship. Then he poured olive oil on the rock to dedicate it to God, 
GEN.28.19	and he named the place Bethel.
GEN.28.20	Jacob solemnly promised God, “If you go with me and watch over me as I travel, and if you give me food and clothes 
GEN.28.21	and bring me safely home again, you will be my God. 
GEN.28.22	This rock will be your house, and I will give back to you a tenth of everything you give me.”
GEN.29.1	As Jacob continued on his way to the east, 
GEN.29.2	he looked out in a field and saw a well where shepherds took their sheep for water. Three flocks of sheep were lying around the well, which was covered with a large rock. 
GEN.29.3	Shepherds would roll the rock away when all their sheep had gathered there. Then after the sheep had been watered, the shepherds would roll the rock back over the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.4	Jacob asked the shepherds, “Where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	“We're from Haran,” they answered.
GEN.29.5	Then he asked, “Do you know Nahor's grandson Laban?”
GEN.29.5	“Yes we do,” they replied.
GEN.29.6	“How is he?” Jacob asked.
GEN.29.6	“He's fine,” they answered. “And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”
GEN.29.7	Jacob told them, “Look, the sun is still high up in the sky, and it's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks. Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture.”
GEN.29.8	But they replied, “We can't do that until they all get here, and the rock has been rolled away from the well.”
GEN.29.9	While Jacob was still talking with the men, his cousin Rachel came up with her father's sheep. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw her and his uncle's sheep, he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep. 
GEN.29.11	He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy. 
GEN.29.12	He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah, and she ran and told her father about him.
GEN.29.13	As soon as Laban heard the news, he ran out to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him everything that had happened. 
GEN.29.14	Laban said, “You are my nephew, and you are like one of my own family.”
GEN.29.14	After Jacob had been there for a month, 
GEN.29.15	Laban said to him, “You shouldn't have to work without pay, just because you are a relative of mine. What do you want me to give you?”
GEN.29.16+GEN.29.17	Laban had two daughters. Leah was older than Rachel, but her eyes didn't sparkle,
GEN.29.18	Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he answered, “If you will let me marry Rachel, I'll work seven years for you.”
GEN.29.19	Laban replied, “It's better for me to let you marry Rachel than for someone else to have her. So stay and work for me.” 
GEN.29.20	Jacob worked seven years for Laban, but the time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.
GEN.29.21	Jacob said to Laban, “The time is up, and I want to marry Rachel now!” 
GEN.29.22	So Laban gave a big feast and invited all their neighbors. 
GEN.29.23	But that evening he brought Leah to Jacob, who married her and spent the night with her. 
GEN.29.24	Laban also gave Zilpah to Leah as her servant woman.
GEN.29.25	The next morning Jacob found out that he had married Leah, and he asked Laban, “Why did you do this to me? Didn't I work to get Rachel? Why did you trick me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban replied, “In our country the older daughter must get married first. 
GEN.29.27	After you spend this week
GEN.29.28+GEN.29.29+GEN.29.30	At the end of the week of celebration, Laban let Jacob marry Rachel, and he gave her his servant woman Bilhah. Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah, but he had to work another seven years for Laban.
GEN.29.31	The 
GEN.29.32	Leah gave birth to a son and named him Reuben.
GEN.29.33	She had a second son and named him Simeon,
GEN.29.34	When Leah's third son was born, she said, “Now my husband will hold me close.” So this son was named Levi.
GEN.29.35	She had one more son and named him Judah,
GEN.30.1	Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, “I'll die if you don't give me some children!”
GEN.30.2	But Jacob became upset with Rachel and answered, “Don't blame me! I'm not God.”
GEN.30.3	“Here, take my servant Bilhah,” Rachel told him. “Have children by her, and I'll let them be born on my knees to show that they are mine.”
GEN.30.4	Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah, 
GEN.30.5	and they had a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel named him Dan,
GEN.30.7	When Bilhah and Jacob had a second son, 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said, “I've struggled hard with my sister, and I've won!” So she named the boy Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah, 
GEN.30.10	and they had a son. 
GEN.30.11	“I'm really lucky,” Leah said, and she named the boy Gad.
GEN.30.12	When they had another son, 
GEN.30.13	Leah exclaimed, “I'm happy now, and all the women will say how happy I am.” So she named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	During the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben found some love flowers
GEN.30.15	but Leah said, “It's bad enough that you stole my husband! Now you want my son's love flowers too.”
GEN.30.15	“All right,” Rachel answered. “Let me have the flowers, and you can sleep with Jacob tonight.”
GEN.30.16	That evening when Jacob came in from the fields, Leah told him, “You're sleeping with me tonight. I hired you with my son's love flowers.”
GEN.30.16	They slept together that night, 
GEN.30.17	and God answered Leah's prayers by giving her a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah shouted, “God has rewarded me for letting Jacob marry my servant,” and she named the boy Issachar.
GEN.30.19	When Leah had another son, 
GEN.30.20	she exclaimed, “God has given me a wonderful gift, and my husband will praise me for giving him six sons.” So she named the boy Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	Later, Leah had a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22+GEN.30.23	Finally, God remembered Rachel—he answered her prayer by giving her a son. “God has taken away my disgrace,” she said. 
GEN.30.24	“I'll name the boy Joseph,
GEN.30.25	After Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban, “Release me from our agreement
GEN.30.26	You know how hard I've worked for you, so let me take my wives and children and leave.”
GEN.30.27+GEN.30.28	But Laban told him, “If you really are my friend, stay on, and I'll pay whatever you ask. I'm sure
GEN.30.29	Jacob answered:
GEN.30.29	You've seen how hard I've worked for you, and you know how your flocks and herds have grown under my care. 
GEN.30.30	You didn't have much before I came, but the 
GEN.30.31	“How much do you want me to pay you?” Laban asked.
GEN.30.31	Then Jacob told him:
GEN.30.31	I don't want you to pay me anything. Just do one thing, and I'll take care of your sheep and goats. 
GEN.30.32	Let me go through your flocks and herds and take the sheep and goats that are either spotted or speckled
GEN.30.33	In the future you can easily find out if I've been honest. Just look and see if my animals are either spotted or speckled, or if the lambs are black. If they aren't, they've been stolen from you.
GEN.30.34	“I agree to that,” was Laban's response. 
GEN.30.35	Before the end of the day, Laban had separated his spotted and speckled animals and the black lambs from the others and had put his sons in charge of them. 
GEN.30.36	Then Laban made Jacob keep the rest of the sheep and goats at a distance of three days' journey.
GEN.30.37	Jacob cut branches from some poplar trees and from some almond and evergreen trees. He peeled off part of the bark and made the branches look spotted and speckled. 
GEN.30.38	Then he put the branches where the sheep and goats would see them
GEN.30.39	in front of the branches, and their young were spotted and speckled.
GEN.30.40	Some of the sheep that Jacob was keeping for Laban were already spotted. And when the others were ready to mate, he made sure that they faced in the direction of the spotted and black ones. In this way, Jacob built up a flock of sheep for himself and did not put them with the other sheep.
GEN.30.41	When the stronger sheep were mating near the drinking place, Jacob made sure that the spotted branches were there. 
GEN.30.42	But he would not put out the branches when the weaker animals were mating. So Jacob got all of the healthy animals, and Laban got what was left. 
GEN.30.43	Jacob soon became rich and successful. He owned many sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys, as well as a lot of slaves.
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard that Laban's sons were complaining, “Jacob is now a rich man, and he got everything he owns from our father.” 
GEN.31.2	Jacob also noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before. 
GEN.31.3	One day the 
GEN.31.4	Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the pasture where he kept his sheep, 
GEN.31.5	and he told them:
GEN.31.5	Your father isn't as friendly with me as he used to be, but the God my ancestors worshiped has been on my side. 
GEN.31.6	You know that I have worked hard for your father 
GEN.31.7	and that he keeps cheating me by changing my wages time after time. But God has protected me. 
GEN.31.8	When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages, all of them were speckled. And when he said the spotted ones would be mine, all of them were spotted. 
GEN.31.9	That's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled. 
GEN.31.11	Then God's angel called me by name. I answered, 
GEN.31.12	and he said, “Notice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled. I know everything Laban is doing to you, 
GEN.31.13	 and I am the God you worshiped at Bethel,
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah said to Jacob:
GEN.31.14	There's nothing left for us to inherit from our father. 
GEN.31.15	He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price
GEN.31.16	So do whatever God tells you to do. Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children.
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob, his wives, and his children got on camels and left 
GEN.31.18	northern Syria
GEN.31.19	Before Rachel left, she stole the household idols
GEN.31.20	Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean
GEN.31.21	When Jacob crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead, he took with him everything he owned.
GEN.31.22	Three days later Laban found out that Jacob had gone. 
GEN.31.23	So he took some of his relatives along and chased after Jacob for seven days, before catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	But God appeared to Laban in a dream that night and warned, “Don't say a word to Jacob. Don't make a threat or a promise.”
GEN.31.25	Jacob had set up camp in the hill country of Gilead, when Laban and his relatives came and set up camp in another part of the hill country. Laban went to Jacob 
GEN.31.26	and said:
GEN.31.26	Look what you've done! You've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper. 
GEN.31.27	Why did you sneak away without telling me? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps. 
GEN.31.28	You didn't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters goodbye. That was really foolish. 
GEN.31.29	I could easily hurt you, but the God your father worshiped has warned me not to make any threats or promises.
GEN.31.30	I can understand why you were eager to return to your father, but why did you have to steal my idols?
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered, “I left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	If you find that any one of us has taken your idols, I'll have that person killed. Let your relatives be witnesses. Show me what belongs to you, and you can take it back.” Jacob did not realize that Rachel had stolen the household idols.
GEN.31.33	Laban searched the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the two servant women,
GEN.31.34	She had already hidden them in the cushion she used as a saddle and was sitting on it. Laban searched everywhere and did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	Rachel said, “Father, please don't be angry with me for not getting up; I'm having my period.” Laban kept on searching, but still did not find the idols.
GEN.31.36	Jacob became very angry and said to Laban:
GEN.31.36	What have I done wrong? Have I committed some crime? Is that why you hunted me down? 
GEN.31.37	After searching through everything I have, did you find anything of yours? If so, put it here, where your relatives and mine can see it. Then we can decide what to do.
GEN.31.38	In all the 20 years that I've worked for you, not one of your sheep or goats has had a miscarriage, and I've never eaten even one of your rams. 
GEN.31.39	If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats, I paid for it myself. In fact, you demanded the full price, whether the animal was killed during the day or at night.
GEN.31.40	I sweated every day, and I couldn't sleep at night because of the cold.
GEN.31.41	I had to work 14 of these 20 long years to earn your two daughters and another 6 years to buy your sheep and goats. During that time you kept changing my wages. 
GEN.31.42	If the fearsome God
GEN.31.43	Laban said to Jacob, “Leah and Rachel are my daughters, and their children belong to me. All these sheep you are taking are really mine too. In fact, everything you have belongs to me. But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children. 
GEN.31.44	So I am ready to make an agreement with you, and we will pile up some large rocks here to remind us of the agreement.”
GEN.31.45	After Jacob had set up a large rock, 
GEN.31.46	he told his men to get some more rocks and pile them up next to it. Then Jacob and Laban ate a meal together beside the rocks. 
GEN.31.47	Laban named the pile of rocks Jegar Sahadutha.
GEN.31.48	Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks will remind us of our agreement.” That's why the place was named Galeed. 
GEN.31.49	Laban also said, “This pile of rocks means that the 
GEN.31.50	Then Laban said:
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women, I may not know about it, but remember, God is watching us! 
GEN.31.51+GEN.31.52	Both this pile of rocks and this large rock have been set up between us as a reminder. I must never go past them to attack you, and you must never come past them to attack me. 
GEN.31.53	My father Nahor, your grandfather Abraham, and their ancestors all worshiped the same God, and he will make sure that we each keep the agreement.
GEN.31.53	Then Jacob made a promise in the name of the fearsome God
GEN.31.54	Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice there on the mountain, and he invited his men to eat with him. After the meal they spent the night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Early the next morning, Laban kissed his daughters and his grandchildren goodbye, then he left to go back home.
GEN.32.1	As Jacob was on his way back home, some of God's angels came and met him. 
GEN.32.2	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God's camp.” So he named the place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent messengers on ahead to Esau, who lived in the land of Seir, also known as Edom. 
GEN.32.4	Jacob told them to say to Esau, “Master, I am your servant! I have lived with Laban all this time, 
GEN.32.5	and now I own cattle, donkeys, and sheep, as well as many slaves. Master, I am sending these messengers in the hope that you will be kind to me.”
GEN.32.6	When the messengers returned, they told Jacob, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is heading this way with 400 men.”
GEN.32.7	Jacob was so frightened that he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two groups. 
GEN.32.8	He thought, “If Esau attacks one group, perhaps the other can escape.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob prayed:
GEN.32.9	You, 
GEN.32.10	I don't deserve all the good things you have done for me, your servant. When I first crossed the Jordan, I had only my walking stick, but now I have two large groups of people and animals. 
GEN.32.11	Please rescue me from my brother. I am afraid he will come and attack not only me, but my wives and children as well. 
GEN.32.12	 But you have promised that I would be a success and that someday it will be as hard to count my descendants as it is to count the grains of sand along the seashore.
GEN.32.13	After Jacob had spent the night there, he chose some animals as gifts for Esau: 
GEN.32.14+GEN.32.15	200 female goats and 20 males, 200 female sheep and 20 males, 30 female camels with their young, 40 cows and 10 bulls, and 20 female donkeys and 10 males.
GEN.32.16	Jacob put servants in charge of each herd and told them, “Go ahead of me and keep a space between each herd.” 
GEN.32.17	Then he said to the servant in charge of the first herd, “When Esau meets you, he will ask whose servant you are. He will want to know where you are going and who owns those animals in front of you. 
GEN.32.18	So tell him, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, who is coming this way. He is sending them as a gift to his master Esau.’ ”
GEN.32.19	Jacob also told the men in charge of the second and third herds and those who followed to say the same thing when they met Esau. 
GEN.32.20	And Jacob told them to be sure to say that he was right behind them. Jacob hoped the gifts would make Esau friendly, so Esau would be glad to see him when they met. 
GEN.32.21	Jacob's men took the gifts on ahead of him, but he spent the night in camp.
GEN.32.24	 Afterwards, Jacob went back and spent the rest of the night alone.
GEN.32.24	A man came and fought with Jacob until just before daybreak. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he could not win, he struck Jacob on the hip and threw it out of joint. 
GEN.32.26	They kept on wrestling until the man said, “Let go of me! It's almost daylight.”
GEN.32.26	“You can't go until you bless me,” Jacob replied.
GEN.32.27	Then the man asked, “What is your name?”
GEN.32.27	“Jacob,” he answered.
GEN.32.29	“Don't you know who I am?” he asked. And he blessed Jacob.
GEN.32.30	Jacob said, “I have seen God face to face, and I am still alive.” So he named the place Peniel.
GEN.32.31	The sun was coming up as Jacob was leaving Peniel. He was limping because he had been struck on the hip, 
GEN.32.32	and the muscle on his hip joint had been injured. That's why even today the people of Israel don't eat the hip muscle of any animal.
GEN.33.1	Later that day Jacob met Esau coming with his 400 men. So Jacob told his children to walk with their mothers. 
GEN.33.2	The two servant women, Zilpah and Bilhah, together with their children went first, followed by Leah and her children, then by Rachel and Joseph. 
GEN.33.3	Jacob himself walked in front of them all, bowing to the ground seven times as he came near his brother.
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran toward Jacob and hugged and kissed him. Then the two brothers started crying.
GEN.33.5	When Esau noticed the women and children he asked, “Whose children are these?”
GEN.33.5	Jacob answered, “These are the children the 
GEN.33.6	Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau. 
GEN.33.7	Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down; finally, Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down.
GEN.33.8	Esau asked Jacob, “Why did you send those herds I met along the road?”
GEN.33.8	“Master,” Jacob answered, “I sent them so you would be friendly to me.”
GEN.33.9	“But, brother, I already have plenty,” Esau replied. “Keep them for yourself.”
GEN.33.10	“No!” Jacob said. “Please accept them as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God. 
GEN.33.11	Please accept these as gifts I brought to you. God has been good to me, and I have everything I need.” Jacob kept insisting until Esau agreed.
GEN.33.12	“Let's get ready to travel,” Esau said. “I'll go along with you.”
GEN.33.13	But Jacob answered, “Master, you know traveling is hard on children, and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young. If my animals travel too much in one day, they will all die. 
GEN.33.14	Why don't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children, the herds, and the flocks. We can meet again in the country of Edom.”
GEN.33.15	Esau replied, “Let me leave some of my men with you.”
GEN.33.15	“You don't have to do that,” Jacob answered. “I am happy, simply knowing that you are friendly to me.”
GEN.33.16	So Esau left for Edom. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob went to Succoth,
GEN.33.18	After leaving northern Syria,
GEN.33.19	 The land where he camped was owned by the descendants of Hamor, the father of Shechem. So Jacob paid them 100 pieces of silver
GEN.33.20	then he set up his tents and built an altar there to honor the God of Israel.
GEN.34.1	Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women who lived nearby. 
GEN.34.2	She was seen by Hamor's son Shechem, the leader of the Hivites, and he grabbed her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	But Shechem was attracted to Dinah, so he told her how much he loved her. 
GEN.34.4	Shechem even asked his father to arrange for him to marry her.
GEN.34.5	Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened. But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle, so he did not do anything at the time. 
GEN.34.6	Hamor arrived at Jacob's home 
GEN.34.7	just as Jacob's sons were coming in from work. When they learned that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry, because nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it must not be tolerated.
GEN.34.8	Hamor said to Jacob and his sons:
GEN.34.8	My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her. 
GEN.34.9	Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours? 
GEN.34.10	You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.
GEN.34.11	Shechem added, “Do this favor for me, and I'll give whatever you want. 
GEN.34.12	Ask anything, no matter how expensive. I'll do anything, just let me marry Dinah.”
GEN.34.13	Jacob's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister. 
GEN.34.14	So they tricked them by saying:
GEN.34.14	You're not circumcised!
GEN.34.15	But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe agree to be circumcised. 
GEN.34.16	Then your families can marry into ours, and ours can marry into yours, and we can live together like one nation. 
GEN.34.17	But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we'll take Dinah and leave this place.
GEN.34.18	Hamor and Shechem liked what was said. 
GEN.34.19	Shechem was the most respected person in his family, and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done. 
GEN.34.20	The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them:
GEN.34.21	These people really are friendly. Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want? There's enough land here for them and for us. Then our families can marry into theirs, and theirs can marry into ours.
GEN.34.22	We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us. Our men will have to be circumcised just like theirs. 
GEN.34.23	Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds. All we have to do is to agree, and they will live here with us.
GEN.34.24	Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised.
GEN.34.25	Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi,
GEN.34.26	including Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob's other sons came and took everything they wanted. All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took sheep, goats, donkeys, and everything else that was in the town or the countryside. 
GEN.34.29	After taking everything of value from the houses, they dragged away the wives and children of their victims.
GEN.34.30	Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “Look what you've done! Now I'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here. There aren't many of us, and if they attack, they'll kill everyone in my household.”
GEN.34.31	They answered, “Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way?”
GEN.35.2	Jacob said to his family and to everyone else who was traveling with him:
GEN.35.2	Get rid of your foreign gods! Then make yourselves acceptable to worship God and put on clean clothes. 
GEN.35.3	Afterwards, we'll go to Bethel. I will build an altar there for God, who answered my prayers when I was in trouble and who has always been at my side.
GEN.35.4	So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings,
GEN.35.5	While Jacob and his family were traveling through Canaan, God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them. 
GEN.35.6	Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz. 
GEN.35.7	Jacob built an altar there and called it “God of Bethel,” because that was the place where God had appeared to him when he was running from Esau. 
GEN.35.8	While they were there, Rebekah's personal servant Deborah
GEN.35.9+GEN.35.10+GEN.35.11	I am God All-Powerful, and from now on your name will be Israel
GEN.35.12	I will give you the land that I promised Abraham and Isaac, and it will belong to your family forever.
GEN.35.13	After God had gone, 
GEN.35.14	 Jacob set up a large rock, so that he would remember what had happened there. Then he poured wine and olive oil on the rock to show that it was dedicated to God, 
GEN.35.15	and he named the place Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Jacob and his family had left Bethel and were still a long way from Ephrath, when the time came for Rachel's baby to be born. 
GEN.35.17	She was having a rough time, but the woman who was helping her said, “Don't worry! It's a boy.” 
GEN.35.18	Rachel was at the point of death, and right before dying, she said, “I'll name him Benoni.”
GEN.35.19	Rachel was buried beside the road to Ephrath, which is also called Bethlehem. 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a tombstone over her grave, and it is still there. 
GEN.35.21	Jacob, also known as Israel, traveled to the south of Eder Tower, where he set up camp.
GEN.35.23+GEN.35.24+GEN.35.25+GEN.35.26	Jacob had twelve sons while living in northern Syria.
GEN.35.23+GEN.35.24+GEN.35.25+GEN.35.26	Jacob and his wife Rachel had Joseph and Benjamin. Rachel's servant woman Bilhah had two more sons: Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.28+GEN.35.29	Isaac died at the ripe old age of 180, then his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	Esau, also known as Edom, had many descendants. 
GEN.36.2	 He married three Canaanite women: The first was Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; the second was Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	 the third was Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebaioth's sister.
GEN.36.4+GEN.36.5	Esau and his three wives had five sons while in Canaan. Adah's son was Eliphaz; Basemath's son was Reuel; Oholibamah's three sons were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his children and wives, his relatives and servants, his animals and possessions he had acquired while in Canaan, and moved far from Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	He did this because the land was too crowded and could not support him and his brother with their flocks and herds. 
GEN.36.8	That's why Esau made his home in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.9+GEN.36.10+GEN.36.11+GEN.36.12+GEN.36.13+GEN.36.14	Esau lived in the hill country of Seir and was the ancestor of the Edomites. Esau had three wives: Adah, Basemath, and Oholibamah. Here is a list of his descendants: Esau and Adah had a son named Eliphaz, whose sons were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. Timna was the other wife
GEN.36.9+GEN.36.10+GEN.36.11+GEN.36.12+GEN.36.13+GEN.36.14	Esau and Basemath had a son named Reuel, whose sons were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
GEN.36.9+GEN.36.10+GEN.36.11+GEN.36.12+GEN.36.13+GEN.36.14	Esau and Oholibamah had three sons: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	Esau and Adah's oldest son was Eliphaz, and the clans that descended from him were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These and Esau's other descendants lived in the land of Edom.
GEN.36.17	The clans that descended from Esau and Basemath's son Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
GEN.36.18	The clans that descended from Esau and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
GEN.36.19	All of these clans descended from Esau, who was known as Edom.
GEN.36.20	Seir was from the Horite tribe that had lived in Edom before the time of Esau. The clans that had descended from him were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
GEN.36.22	Lotan's sons were Hori and Heman; his sister was Timna.
GEN.36.23	Shobal's sons were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	Zibeon's sons were Aiah and Anah—the same Anah who found an oasis
GEN.36.25	Anah's children were Dishon and Oholibamah.
GEN.36.26	Dishon's sons were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
GEN.36.27	Ezer's sons were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	Dishan's sons were Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	The clans of the Horites were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan, and they lived in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Before there were kings in Israel, the following kings ruled Edom one after another:
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Bela son of Beor from Dinhabah;
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah;
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Husham from the land of Teman;
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Hadad son of Bedad from Avith (Bedad had defeated the Midianites in Moab);
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Samlah from Masrekah;
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Shaul from the city of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River;
GEN.36.31+GEN.36.32+GEN.36.33+GEN.36.34+GEN.36.35+GEN.36.36+GEN.36.37+GEN.36.38+GEN.36.39	Baalhanan son of Achbor;

GEN.36.40	The clans that descended from Esau took their names from their families and the places where they lived. They are Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram. These clans descended from Esau, who was known as Edom, the father of the Edomites. They took their names from the places where they settled.
GEN.37.1	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father Isaac had lived, 
GEN.37.2	and this is the story of his family.
GEN.37.2	When Jacob's son Joseph was 17 years old, he took care of the sheep with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah.
GEN.37.3	Jacob loved Joseph more than he did any of his other sons, because Joseph was born when Jacob was very old. Jacob had even given Joseph a fancy coat
GEN.37.4	which showed that Joseph was his favorite son, and so Joseph's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him.
GEN.37.5	One day, Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed, and they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	Joseph said, “Let me tell you about my dream. 
GEN.37.7	We were out in the field, tying up bundles of wheat. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it.”
GEN.37.8	His brothers asked, “Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us?” Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream.
GEN.37.9	Joseph later had another dream, and he told his brothers, “Listen to what else I dreamed. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.”
GEN.37.10	When he told his father about this dream, his father became angry and said, “What's that supposed to mean? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down to you?” 
GEN.37.11	 Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept wondering about the dream.
GEN.37.12	One day when Joseph's brothers had taken the sheep to a pasture near Shechem, 
GEN.37.13	his father Jacob said to him, “I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.”
GEN.37.13	“Yes, sir,” Joseph answered.
GEN.37.14	His father said, “Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.” So he sent him from Hebron Valley.
GEN.37.14	Joseph was near Shechem 
GEN.37.15	and wandering through the fields, when a man asked, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	Joseph answered, “I'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?”
GEN.37.17	“They're not here anymore,” the man replied. “I overheard them say they were going to Dothan.”
GEN.37.17	Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	But before he got there, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Look, here comes the hero of those dreams! 
GEN.37.20	Let's kill him and throw him into a pit and say that some wild animal ate him. Then we'll see what happens to those dreams.”
GEN.37.21	Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. “Let's not kill him,” he said. 
GEN.37.22	“Don't murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a well out here in the desert.” Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
GEN.37.23	When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat
GEN.37.24	and threw him into a dry well.
GEN.37.25	As Joseph's brothers sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt. 
GEN.37.26	So Judah said, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body? 
GEN.37.27	Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him. After all, he is our brother.” And the others agreed.
GEN.37.29	When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there, he tore his clothes in sorrow. 
GEN.37.30	Then he went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”
GEN.37.31	Joseph's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's fancy coat in its blood. 
GEN.37.32	After this, they took the coat to their father and said, “We found this! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son.”
GEN.37.33	Jacob knew it was Joseph's coat and said, “It's my son's coat! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal.”
GEN.37.34	Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time, and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth.
GEN.37.35	All of Jacob's children came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will go to my grave, mourning for my son.” So Jacob kept on grieving.
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar, who was the king's
GEN.38.1	About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam. 
GEN.38.2	While there he met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her, 
GEN.38.3	and they had three sons. He named the first one Er; 
GEN.38.4	she named the next one Onan. 
GEN.38.5	The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib, and she named him Shelah.
GEN.38.6	Later, Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er, his oldest son. 
GEN.38.7	But Er was very evil, and the 
GEN.38.8	So Judah told Onan, “It's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.”
GEN.38.9	Onan knew the child would not be his,
GEN.38.10	The 
GEN.38.11	Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah, and he told Tamar, “Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown.” So Tamar went to live with her father.
GEN.38.12	Some years later Judah's wife died, and he mourned for her. He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared. 
GEN.38.13	Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep. 
GEN.38.14	She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man, but she had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow's clothes and to cover her face with a veil. After this, she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah.
GEN.38.15	When Judah came along, he did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute 
GEN.38.16	and asked her to sleep with him. She asked, “What will you give me if I do?”
GEN.38.17	“One of my young goats,” he answered.
GEN.38.17	“What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?” she asked.
GEN.38.18	“What do you want?” he asked in return.
GEN.38.18	“The ring on that cord around your neck,” was her reply. “I also want the special walking stick
GEN.38.19	After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow's clothes again.
GEN.38.20	Judah asked his friend Hirah take a goat to the woman, so he could get back the ring and walking stick, but she wasn't there. 
GEN.38.21	Hirah asked the people of Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town?”
GEN.38.21	“There's never been one here,” they answered.
GEN.38.22	Hirah went back and told Judah, “I couldn't find the woman, and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there.”
GEN.38.23	“If you couldn't find her, we'll just let her keep the things I gave her,” Judah answered. “And we'd better forget about the goat, or else we'll look like fools.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant!”
GEN.38.24	“Drag her out of town and burn her to death!” Judah shouted.
GEN.38.25	As Tamar was being dragged off, she sent someone to tell her father-in-law, “The man who gave me this ring, this cord, and this walking stick is the one who got me pregnant.”
GEN.38.26	“Those are mine!” Judah admitted. “She's a better person than I am, because I broke my promise to let her marry my son Shelah.” After this, Judah never slept with her again.
GEN.38.27+GEN.38.28	Tamar later gave birth to twins. But before either of them was born, one of them stuck a hand out of her womb. The woman who was helping tied a red thread around the baby's hand and explained, “This one came out first.”
GEN.38.29	At once his hand went back in, and the other child was born first. The woman then said, “What an opening you've made for yourself!” So they named the baby Perez.
GEN.38.30	When the brother with the red thread was born, they named him Zerah.
GEN.39.1	The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, the king's
GEN.39.2+GEN.39.3	 So Joseph lived in the home of Potiphar, his Egyptian owner.
GEN.39.2+GEN.39.3	Soon Potiphar realized that the 
GEN.39.4	Potiphar liked Joseph and made him his personal assistant, putting him in charge of his house and all of his property. 
GEN.39.5	Because of Joseph, the 
GEN.39.6	Potiphar left everything up to Joseph, and with Joseph there, the only decision he had to make was what he wanted to eat.
GEN.39.6	Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
GEN.39.7	 and Potiphar's wife soon noticed him. She asked him to make love to her, 
GEN.39.8	but he refused and said, “My master isn't worried about anything in his house, because he has placed me in charge of everything he owns. 
GEN.39.9	No one in my master's house is more important than I am. The only thing he hasn't given me is you, and that's because you are his wife. I won't sin against God by doing such a terrible thing as this.” 
GEN.39.10	She kept begging Joseph day after day, but he refused to do what she wanted or even to go near her.
GEN.39.11	One day, Joseph went to Potiphar's house to do his work, and none of the other servants were there. 
GEN.39.12	Potiphar's wife grabbed hold of his coat and said, “Make love to me!” Joseph ran out of the house, leaving his coat there in her hands.
GEN.39.13	When this happened, 
GEN.39.14	she called in her servants and said, “Look! This Hebrew has come just to make fools of us. He tried to rape me, but I screamed for help. 
GEN.39.15	And when he heard me scream, he ran out of the house, leaving his coat with me.”
GEN.39.16	Potiphar's wife kept Joseph's coat until her husband came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she said, “That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me! 
GEN.39.18	But when I screamed for help, he left his coat and ran out of the house.”
GEN.39.19	Potiphar became very angry 
GEN.39.20	and threw Joseph in the same prison where the king's prisoners were kept.
GEN.39.20	While Joseph was in prison, 
GEN.39.21	 the 
GEN.39.22	he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail. 
GEN.39.23	The jailer did not worry about anything, because the 
GEN.40.1+GEN.40.2+GEN.40.3	While Joseph was in prison, both the king's
GEN.40.4	They spent a long time in prison, and the official in charge of the palace guard,
GEN.40.5	One night each of the two men had a dream, but their dreams had different meanings. 
GEN.40.6	The next morning, when Joseph went to see the men, he could tell they were upset, 
GEN.40.7	and he asked, “Why are you so worried today?”
GEN.40.8	“We each had a dream last night,” they answered, “and there is no one to tell us what they mean.”
GEN.40.8	Joseph replied, “Doesn't God know the meaning of dreams? Now tell me what you dreamed.”
GEN.40.9	The king's personal servant told Joseph, “In my dream I saw a vine 
GEN.40.10	with three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its grapes became ripe. 
GEN.40.11	I held the king's cup and squeezed the grapes into it, then I gave the cup to the king.”
GEN.40.12	Joseph said:
GEN.40.12	This is the meaning of your dream. The three branches stand for three days, 
GEN.40.13	and in three days the king will pardon you. He will make you his personal servant again, and you will serve him his wine, just as you used to do. 
GEN.40.14	But when these good things happen, please don't forget to tell the king about me, so I can get out of this place. 
GEN.40.15	I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here in Egypt I haven't done anything to deserve being thrown in jail.
GEN.40.16	When the chief cook saw that Joseph had given a good meaning to the dream, he told Joseph, “I also had a dream. In it I was carrying three breadbaskets stacked on top of my head. 
GEN.40.17	The top basket was full of all kinds of baked things for the king, but birds were eating them.”
GEN.40.18	Joseph said:
GEN.40.18	This is the meaning of your dream. The three baskets are three days, 
GEN.40.19	 and in three days the king will cut off your head. He will hang your body on a pole, and birds will come and peck at it.
GEN.40.20	Three days later, while the king was celebrating his birthday with a dinner for his officials, he sent for his personal servant and the chief cook. 
GEN.40.21	He put the personal servant back in his old job 
GEN.40.22	and had the cook put to death.
GEN.40.22	Everything happened just as Joseph had said it would, 
GEN.40.23	but the king's personal servant completely forgot about Joseph.
GEN.41.1	Two years later the king
GEN.41.2	Suddenly, seven fat, healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank. 
GEN.41.3	Then seven ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river and 
GEN.41.4	ate the fat, healthy cows. When this happened, the king woke up.
GEN.41.5	The king went back to sleep and had another dream. This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.6	Later, seven other heads of grain appeared, but they were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert. 
GEN.41.7	The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads. Again the king woke up, and it had only been a dream.
GEN.41.9	The king's personal servant said:
GEN.41.9	Now I remember what I was supposed to do. 
GEN.41.10	When you were angry with me and your chief cook, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	One night we both had dreams, and each dream had a different meaning. 
GEN.41.12	A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant, 
GEN.41.13	and everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death.
GEN.41.14	The king sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.
GEN.41.15	The king said to him, “I had a dream, yet no one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.”
GEN.41.16	“Your Majesty,” Joseph answered, “I can't do it myself, but God can give a good meaning to your dreams.”
GEN.41.17	The king told Joseph:
GEN.41.17	I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile River. 
GEN.41.18	I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river, and they began feeding on the grass. 
GEN.41.19	Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	The skinny cows ate the fat ones. 
GEN.41.21	But you couldn't tell it, because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before. At once, I woke up.
GEN.41.22	I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk. The heads were full and ripe. 
GEN.41.23	Then seven other heads of grain came up. They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert. 
GEN.41.24	These heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told my dreams to the magicians, but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams.
GEN.41.25	Joseph replied:
GEN.41.25	Your Majesty, both of your dreams mean the same thing, and in them God has shown what he is going to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows stand for seven years, and so do the seven good heads of grain. 
GEN.41.27	The seven skinny, ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years, as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the desert wind. The dreams mean there will be seven years when there won't be enough grain.
GEN.41.28	It is just as I said—God has shown what he intends to do. 
GEN.41.29	For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain, 
GEN.41.30	but that will be followed by seven years when there won't be enough. The good years of plenty will be forgotten, and everywhere in Egypt people will be starving. 
GEN.41.31	The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty. 
GEN.41.32	God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon.
GEN.41.33	Your Majesty, you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do, so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Then appoint some other officials to collect one fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty. 
GEN.41.35	Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities. 
GEN.41.36	It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there won't be enough grain in Egypt. This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food.
GEN.41.37	The king
GEN.41.38	So the king said to them, “Who could possibly handle this better than Joseph? After all, the Spirit of God is with him.”
GEN.41.39	The king told Joseph, “God is the one who has shown you these things. No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do. 
GEN.41.40	 I'm putting you in charge of my palace, and everybody will have to obey you. No one will be over you except me. 
GEN.41.41	You are now governor of all Egypt!”
GEN.41.43	He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own, and people shouted, “Make way for Joseph!” So Joseph was governor of Egypt.
GEN.41.44	The king told Joseph, “Although I'm king, no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission.” 
GEN.41.45	He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah. And he let him marry Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis.
GEN.41.46	Joseph was 30 when the king made him governor, and he went everywhere for the king. 
GEN.41.47	For seven years there were big harvests of grain. 
GEN.41.48	Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested. 
GEN.41.49	In fact, there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record, because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach.
GEN.41.50	Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began. 
GEN.41.51	Their first son was named Manasseh, which means, “God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home.” 
GEN.41.52	His second son was named Ephraim, which means “God has made me a success
GEN.41.53	Egypt's seven years of plenty came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was not enough food in other countries, but all over Egypt there was plenty. 
GEN.41.55	 When the famine finally struck Egypt, the people asked the king for food, but he said, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you to do.”
GEN.41.56	The famine became bad everywhere in Egypt, so Joseph opened the storehouses and sold the grain to the Egyptians. 
GEN.41.57	People from all over the world came to Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was so severe in their countries.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob found out there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you just sitting here, staring at one another? 
GEN.42.2	 I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down and buy some, so we won't starve to death.”
GEN.42.3	Ten of Joseph's brothers went to Egypt to buy grain. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Joseph's younger brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid that something might happen to him. 
GEN.42.5	So Jacob's sons joined others from Canaan who were going to Egypt because of the terrible famine.
GEN.42.6	Since Joseph was governor of Egypt and in charge of selling grain, his brothers came to him and bowed with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7+GEN.42.8	They did not recognize Joseph, but at once he knew who they were, though he pretended not to know. Instead, he spoke harshly and asked, “Where do you come from?”
GEN.42.7+GEN.42.8	“From the land of Canaan,” they answered. “We've come here to buy grain.”
GEN.42.10	“No sir,” they replied. “We're your servants, and we have only come to buy grain. 
GEN.42.11	We're honest men, and we come from the same family—we're not spies.”
GEN.42.12	“That isn't so!” Joseph insisted. “You've come here to find out where our country is weak.”
GEN.42.13	But they explained, “Sir, we come from a family of twelve brothers. The youngest is still with our father in Canaan, and one of our brothers is dead.”
GEN.42.14	Joseph replied:
GEN.42.14	It's like I said. You're spies, 
GEN.42.15	and I'm going to find out the truth. I swear by the life of the king that you won't leave this place until your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Choose one of you to go after your brother, while the rest of you stay here in jail. That will show whether you are telling the truth. But if you are lying, I swear by the life of the king that you are spies!
GEN.42.17	Joseph kept them all under guard for three days, 
GEN.42.18	before saying to them:
GEN.42.18	Since I respect God, I'll give you a chance to save your lives. 
GEN.42.19	If you are honest men, one of you must stay here in jail, and the rest of you can take the grain back to your starving families. 
GEN.42.20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then I'll know that you are telling the truth, and you won't be put to death.
GEN.42.20	Joseph's brothers agreed 
GEN.42.21	and said to one another, “We're being punished because of Joseph. We saw the trouble he was in, but we refused to help him when he begged us. That's why these terrible things are happening.”
GEN.42.23	They did not know that Joseph could understand them, since he was speaking through an interpreter. 
GEN.42.24	Joseph turned away from them and cried, but soon he turned back and spoke to them again. Then he had Simeon tied up and taken away while they watched.
GEN.42.25	Joseph gave orders for his brothers' grain sacks to be filled with grain and for their money
GEN.42.26	they each loaded the grain on their donkeys and left.
GEN.42.27	When they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get some grain for his donkey, and at once he saw his moneybag. 
GEN.42.28	“Here's my money!” he told his brothers. “Right here in my sack.”
GEN.42.28	They were trembling with fear as they stared at one another and asked themselves, “What has God done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When they returned to the land of Canaan, they told their father Jacob everything that had happened to them:
GEN.42.30	The governor of Egypt was rude and treated us like spies. 
GEN.42.31	But we told him, “We're honest men, not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We come from a family of twelve brothers. The youngest is still with our father in Canaan, and the other is dead.”
GEN.42.33	Then the governor of Egypt told us, “I'll find out if you really are honest. Leave one of your brothers here with me, while you take the grain to your starving families. 
GEN.42.34	But bring your youngest brother to me, so I can be certain that you are honest men and not spies. After that, I'll let your other brother go free, and you can stay here and trade.”
GEN.42.35	When the brothers started emptying their sacks of grain, they found their moneybags in them. They were frightened, and so was their father Jacob, 
GEN.42.36	who said, “You have already taken my sons Joseph and Simeon from me. And now you want to take away Benjamin! Everything is against me.”
GEN.42.37	Reuben spoke up, “Father, if I don't bring Benjamin back, you can kill both of my sons. Trust me with him, and I'll bring him back.”
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “I won't let my son Benjamin go down to Egypt with the rest of you. His brother is already dead, and he is the only son I have left.
GEN.43.1	The famine in Canaan got worse, 
GEN.43.2	until finally, Jacob's family had eaten all the grain they had bought in Egypt. So Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy some more grain.”
GEN.43.3+GEN.43.4+GEN.43.5	Judah replied, “The governor strictly warned us that we would not be allowed to see him unless we brought our youngest brother with us. If you let us take Benjamin along, we will go and buy grain. But we won't go without him!”
GEN.43.6	Jacob asked, “Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the governor you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	They answered, “He asked a lot of questions about us and our family. He wanted to know if you were still alive and if we had any more brothers. All we could do was answer his questions. How could we know he would tell us to bring along our brother?”
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to his father, “Let Benjamin go with me, and we will leave at once, so that none of us will starve to death. 
GEN.43.9	I promise to bring him back safely, and if I don't, you can blame me as long as I live. 
GEN.43.10	If we had not wasted all this time, we could already have been there and back twice.”
GEN.43.11	Their father said:
GEN.43.11	If Benjamin must go with you, take the governor a gift of some of the best things from our own country, such as perfume, honey, spices, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
GEN.43.12	Also take along twice the amount of money for the grain, because there must have been some mistake when the money was put back in your sacks. 
GEN.43.13	Take Benjamin with you and leave at once.
GEN.43.14	When you go in to see the governor, I pray that God All-Powerful will be good to you and that the governor will let your other brother and Benjamin come back home with you. But if I must lose my children, I suppose I must.
GEN.43.15	The brothers took the gifts, twice the amount of money, and Benjamin. Then they hurried off to Egypt. When they stood in front of Joseph, 
GEN.43.16	he saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and cook it, so they can eat with me at noon.”
GEN.43.17	The servant did as he was told and took the brothers to Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.18	But on the way they got worried and started thinking, “We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time. He will arrest us, make us his slaves, and take our donkeys.”
GEN.43.19	So when they arrived at Joseph's house, they said to the servant in charge, 
GEN.43.20	“Sir, we came to Egypt once before to buy grain. 
GEN.43.21	But when we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back, 
GEN.43.22	together with enough money to buy more grain. We don't know who put the money in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	“It's all right,” the servant replied. “Don't worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because I received your payment in full.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
GEN.43.24	The servant took them into Joseph's house and gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	The brothers got their gifts ready to give to Joseph at noon, since they had heard they were going to eat there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought, and they bowed down to him. 
GEN.43.27	After Joseph had asked how they were, he said, “What about your elderly father? Is he still alive?”
GEN.43.28	They answered, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And again they bowed down to Joseph.
GEN.43.29	When Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin, he said, “This must be your youngest brother, the one you told me about. God bless you, my son.”
GEN.43.30	Then, because of his love for Benjamin, he rushed off to his room and cried. 
GEN.43.31	After washing his face and returning, he was able to control himself and said, “Serve the meal!”
GEN.43.32	Joseph was served at a table by himself, and his brothers were served at another. The Egyptians sat at yet another table, because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews. 
GEN.43.33	To the surprise of Joseph's brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest. 
GEN.43.34	They were served food from Joseph's table, and Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Joseph's brothers ate and drank with him and had a good time.
GEN.44.1+GEN.44.2	Later, Joseph told the servant in charge of his house, “Fill the men's grain sacks with as much as they can hold and put their money in the sacks. Also put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother.” The servant did as he was told.
GEN.44.3	Early the next morning, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	But they had not gone far from the city when Joseph told the servant, “Go after those men! When you catch them, say, ‘My master has been good to you. So why have you stolen his silver cup? 
GEN.44.5	Not only does he drink from his cup, but he also uses it to learn about the future. You have done a terrible thing.’ ”
GEN.44.6	When the servant caught up with them, he said exactly what Joseph had told him to say. 
GEN.44.7	But they replied, “Sir, why do you say such things? We would never do anything like that! 
GEN.44.8	We even returned the money we found in our grain sacks when we got back to Canaan. So why would we want to steal any silver or gold from your master's house? 
GEN.44.9	If you find that one of us has the cup, then kill him, and the rest of us will become your slaves.”
GEN.44.10	“Good!” the man replied, “I'll do what you have said. But only the one who has the cup will become my slave. The rest of you can go free.”
GEN.44.11	Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	Joseph's servant started searching the sacks, beginning with the one that belonged to the oldest brother. When he came to Benjamin's sack, he found the cup. 
GEN.44.13	This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow. Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers got there, Joseph was still at home. So they bowed down to Joseph, 
GEN.44.15	who asked them, “What have you done? Didn't you know I could find out?”
GEN.44.16	“Sir, what can we say?” Judah replied. “How can we say we are innocent, when God has shown we are guilty? And now all of us are your slaves, especially the one who had the cup.”
GEN.44.17	Joseph told them, “I would never punish all of you. Only the one who was caught with the cup will become my slave. The rest of you are free to go home to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Judah went over to Joseph and said:
GEN.44.18	Sir, you have as much power as the king
GEN.44.19	You asked us if our father was still alive and if we had any more brothers. 
GEN.44.20	So we told you, “Our father is a very old man. In fact, he was already old when Benjamin was born. Benjamin's brother is dead. Now Benjamin is the only one of the two brothers who is still alive, and our father loves him very much.”
GEN.44.21	You ordered us to bring him here, so you could see him for yourself. 
GEN.44.22	We told you that our father would die if Benjamin left him. 
GEN.44.23	But you warned us that we could never see you again, unless our youngest brother came with us. 
GEN.44.24	So we returned to our father and reported what you had said.
GEN.44.25	Later our father sent us back here to buy more grain. 
GEN.44.26	But we told him, “We can't go back to Egypt without our youngest brother. We will never be let in to see the governor, unless he is with us.”
GEN.44.27	Sir, our father then reminded us that his favorite wife had given birth to two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One of them was already missing and had not been seen for a long time. My father thinks the boy was torn to pieces by some wild animal, 
GEN.44.29	and he said, “I am an old man. If you take Benjamin from me, and something happens to him, I will die of a broken heart.”
GEN.44.30	That's why Benjamin must be with us when I go back to my father. He loves him so much 
GEN.44.31	that he will die if Benjamin doesn't come back with me. 
GEN.44.32	I promised my father that I would bring him safely home. If I don't, I told my father he could blame me the rest of my life.
GEN.44.33	Sir, I am your slave. Please let me stay here in place of Benjamin and let him return home with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	How can I face my father if Benjamin isn't with me? I couldn't bear to see my father in such sorrow.
GEN.45.2	Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's
GEN.45.3	Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer. 
GEN.45.4	Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said:
GEN.45.4	Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Don't worry or blame yourselves for what you did. God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives.
GEN.45.6	There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plow fields or harvest grain. 
GEN.45.7	But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way. 
GEN.45.8	After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here—it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt.
GEN.45.10	You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren, as well as with your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own. 
GEN.45.11	I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine. But if you don't come, you and your family and your animals will starve to death.”
GEN.45.12	All of you, including my brother Benjamin, can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph. 
GEN.45.13	Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him here.
GEN.45.14	Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying. 
GEN.45.15	Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers. After this, they started talking with Joseph.
GEN.45.16	When it was told in the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were happy. 
GEN.45.17	So the king said to Joseph:
GEN.45.17	Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Tell them to bring their father and their families here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows there. 
GEN.45.19	Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in. And be sure they bring their father. 
GEN.45.20	They can leave their possessions behind, because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt.
GEN.45.21	Jacob's sons agreed to do what the king had said. And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home, just as the king had ordered. 
GEN.45.22	Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers, but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and 300 pieces of silver. 
GEN.45.23	To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt, and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip. 
GEN.45.24	Then he sent his brothers off and told them, “Don't argue on the way home!”
GEN.45.25	Joseph's brothers left Egypt, and when they arrived in Canaan, 
GEN.45.26	they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	Then they told him everything Joseph had said. When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, he felt much better 
GEN.45.28	and said, “Now I can believe you! My son Joseph must really be alive, and I will get to see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshiped. 
GEN.46.2	That night, God spoke to him in a dream and said, “Jacob! Jacob!”
GEN.46.2	“Here I am,” Jacob answered.
GEN.46.3	God said, “I am God, the same God your father worshiped. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation. 
GEN.46.4	I will go with you to Egypt, and later I will bring your descendants back here. Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die.”
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	When Jacob went to Egypt, his children who were born in northern Syria
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Jacob and his wife Leah had a total of 33 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, but two of their grandchildren had died in Canaan.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their oldest son Reuben took his sons Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their son Simeon took his sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, whose mother was a Canaanite.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their son Levi took his sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their son Judah took his sons Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. Judah's sons Er and Onan had died in Canaan. Judah's son Perez took his sons Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their son Issachar took his sons Tola, Puvah, Jashub,
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their son Zebulun took his sons Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.8+GEN.46.9+GEN.46.10+GEN.46.11+GEN.46.12+GEN.46.13+GEN.46.14+GEN.46.15	Their daughter Dinah also went.
GEN.46.16+GEN.46.17+GEN.46.18	Jacob and Zilpah, the servant woman Laban had given his daughter Leah, had a total of 16 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
GEN.46.16+GEN.46.17+GEN.46.18	Their son Gad took his sons Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.16+GEN.46.17+GEN.46.18	Their son Asher took his sons Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, who took his sons, Heber and Malchiel.
GEN.46.16+GEN.46.17+GEN.46.18	Serah, the daughter of Asher, also went.
GEN.46.19+GEN.46.20+GEN.46.21+GEN.46.22	Their son Joseph was already in Egypt, where he had married Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of Heliopolis.
GEN.46.19+GEN.46.20+GEN.46.21+GEN.46.22	Jacob and Rachel's son Benjamin took his sons Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.23+GEN.46.24+GEN.46.25	Jacob and Bilhah, the servant woman Laban had given his daughter Rachel, had seven children and grandchildren.
GEN.46.23+GEN.46.24+GEN.46.25	Their son Dan took his son Hushim.
GEN.46.23+GEN.46.24+GEN.46.25	Their son Naphtali took his sons Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.26	Sixty-six members of Jacob's family went to Egypt with him, not counting his daughters-in-law. 
GEN.46.27	 Jacob's two grandsons who were born there made it a total of 70 members of Jacob's family in Egypt.
GEN.46.28	Jacob had sent his son Judah ahead of him to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	So Joseph got in his chariot and went to meet his father. When they met, Joseph hugged his father around the neck and cried for a long time. 
GEN.46.30	Jacob said to Joseph, “Now that I have seen you and know you are still alive, I am ready to die.”
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to everyone who had come with them:
GEN.46.31	I must go and tell the king
GEN.46.32	I will tell him that you are shepherds and that you have brought your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own. 
GEN.46.33	The king will call you in and ask what you do for a living. 
GEN.46.34	When he does, be sure to say, “We are shepherds. Our families have always raised sheep.” If you tell him this, he will let you settle in the region of Goshen.
GEN.46.34	Joseph wanted them to say this to the king, because the Egyptians did not like to be around anyone who raised sheep.
GEN.47.1+GEN.47.2	Joseph took five of his brothers to the king and told him, “My father and my brothers have come from Canaan. They have brought their sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else they own to the region of Goshen.”
GEN.47.1+GEN.47.2	Then he introduced his brothers to the king, 
GEN.47.3	who asked them, “What do you do for a living?”
GEN.47.3	“Sir, we are shepherds,” was their answer. “Our families have always raised sheep. 
GEN.47.4	But in our country all the pastures are dried up, and our sheep have no grass to eat. So we, your servants, have come here. Please let us live in the region of Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	The king said to Joseph, “It's good that your father and brothers have arrived. 
GEN.47.6	I will let them live anywhere they choose in the land of Egypt, but I suggest that they settle in Goshen, the best part of our land. I would also like for your finest shepherds to watch after my own sheep and goats.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and introduced him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing, 
GEN.47.8	and the king asked him, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	Jacob answered, “I have lived only 130 years, and I have had to move from place to place. My parents and my grandparents also had to move from place to place. But they lived much longer, and their life was not as hard as mine.” 
GEN.47.10	Then Jacob gave the king his blessing once again and left. 
GEN.47.11	Joseph obeyed the king's orders and gave his father and brothers some of the best land in Egypt near the city of Rameses. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph also provided food for their families.
GEN.47.13	The famine was bad everywhere in Egypt and Canaan, and the people were suffering terribly. 
GEN.47.14	So Joseph sold them the grain that had been stored up, and he put the money
GEN.47.15	But when everyone had run out of money, the Egyptians came to Joseph and demanded, “Give us more grain! If you don't, we'll soon be dead, because our money's all gone.”
GEN.47.16	“If you don't have any money,” Joseph answered, “give me your animals, and I'll let you have some grain.” 
GEN.47.17	From then on, they brought him their horses and donkeys and their sheep and goats in exchange for grain.
GEN.47.17	Within a year Joseph had collected every animal in Egypt. 
GEN.47.18	Then the people came to him and said:
GEN.47.18	Sir, there's no way we can hide the truth from you. We are broke, and we don't have any more animals. We have nothing left except ourselves and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Don't let us starve and our land be ruined. If you'll give us grain to eat and seed to plant, we'll sell ourselves and our land to the king.
GEN.47.20	The famine became so severe that Joseph finally bought every piece of land in Egypt for the king 
GEN.47.21	and made everyone the king's slaves,
GEN.47.22	except the priests. The king gave the priests a regular food allowance, so they did not have to sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “You and your land now belong to the king. I'm giving you seed to plant, 
GEN.47.24	but one fifth of your crops must go to the king. You can keep the rest as seed or as food for your families.”
GEN.47.25	“Sir, you have saved our lives!” they answered. “We are glad to be slaves of the king.” 
GEN.47.26	Then Joseph made a law that one fifth of the harvest would always belong to the king. Only the priests did not lose their land.
GEN.47.27	The people of Israel made their home in the land of Goshen, where they became prosperous and had large families. 
GEN.47.28	Jacob himself lived there for 17 years, before dying at the age of 147. 
GEN.47.29	 When Jacob knew he did not have long to live, he called in Joseph and said, “If you really love me, you must make a solemn promise not to bury me in Egypt. 
GEN.47.30	Instead, bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried.”
GEN.47.30	“I will do what you have asked,” Joseph answered.
GEN.47.31	“Will you give me your word?” Jacob asked.
GEN.47.31	“Yes, I will,” Joseph promised. After this, Jacob bowed down and prayed at the head of his bed.
GEN.48.1	Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick. So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
GEN.48.2	When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” Jacob sat up in bed, but it took almost all his strength.
GEN.48.3	God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, where he gave me his blessing 
GEN.48.4	and promised, “I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family forever.”
GEN.48.5	Then Jacob went on to say:
GEN.48.5	Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt, but I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
GEN.48.6	Any children you have later will be considered yours, but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh. 
GEN.48.7	 Unfortunately, your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria
GEN.48.8+GEN.48.9+GEN.48.10	Jacob was very old and almost blind. He did not recognize the two boys, and so he asked Joseph, “Who are these boys?”
GEN.48.8+GEN.48.9+GEN.48.10	Joseph answered, “They are my sons. God has given them to me here in Egypt.”
GEN.48.8+GEN.48.9+GEN.48.10	“Bring them to me,” Jacob said. “I want to give them my blessing.” Joseph brought the boys to him, and he hugged and kissed them.
GEN.48.11	Jacob turned to Joseph and told him, “For many years I thought you were dead and that I would never see you again. But now God has even let me live to see your children.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph made his sons move away from Jacob's knees,
GEN.48.13	After Joseph got up, he brought his two sons over to Jacob again. He led his younger son Ephraim to the left side of Jacob and his older son Manasseh to the right. 
GEN.48.14	But before Jacob gave them his blessing, he crossed his arms, putting his right hand on the head of Ephraim and his left hand on the head of Manasseh. 
GEN.48.15	Then he gave Joseph his blessing and said:
GEN.48.15	My grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac worshiped the 
GEN.48.16	and his angel has kept me safe. Now I pray that he will bless these boys and that my name and the names of Abraham and Isaac will live on because of them. I ask God to give them many children and many descendants as well.
GEN.48.17	Joseph did not like it when he saw his father place his right hand on the head of the younger son. So he tried to move his father's right hand from Ephraim's head and place it on Manasseh. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said, “Father, you have made a mistake. This is the older boy. Put your right hand on him.”
GEN.48.19	But his father said, “Son, I know what I am doing. It's true that Manasseh's family will someday become a great nation. But Ephraim will be even greater than Manasseh, because his descendants will become many great nations.”
GEN.48.21	After that, Jacob said, “Joseph, you can see that I won't live much longer. But God will be with you and will lead you back to the land he promised our family long ago. 
GEN.48.22	Meanwhile, I'm giving you the hillside
GEN.49.1	Jacob called his sons together and said:
GEN.49.1	My sons, I am Jacob,
GEN.49.1	your father Israel.
GEN.49.2	Come, gather around,
GEN.49.2	as I tell your future.
GEN.49.3	Reuben, you are my oldest,
GEN.49.3	born at the peak of my powers;
GEN.49.3	you were an honored leader.
GEN.49.4	Uncontrollable as a flood,
GEN.49.4	you slept with my wife
GEN.49.4	and disgraced my bed.
GEN.49.4	And so you no longer deserve
GEN.49.4	the place of honor.
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi,
GEN.49.5	you are brothers,
GEN.49.5	each a gruesome sword.
GEN.49.6	I never want to take part
GEN.49.6	in your plans or deeds.
GEN.49.6	You slaughtered people
GEN.49.6	in your anger,
GEN.49.6	and you crippled cattle
GEN.49.6	for no reason.
GEN.49.7	Now I place a curse on you
GEN.49.7	because of
GEN.49.7	your fierce anger.
GEN.49.7	Your descendants
GEN.49.7	will be scattered
GEN.49.7	among the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, you will be praised
GEN.49.8	by your brothers;
GEN.49.8	they will bow down to you,
GEN.49.8	as you defeat your enemies.
GEN.49.9	ready to eat your victim!
GEN.49.9	You are terribly fierce;
GEN.49.9	no one will bother you.
GEN.49.10	You will have power and rule
GEN.49.10	until nations obey you
GEN.49.10	and come bringing gifts.
GEN.49.11	You will tie your donkey
GEN.49.11	to a choice grapevine
GEN.49.11	and wash your clothes
GEN.49.11	in wine from those grapes.
GEN.49.12	Your eyes are darker than wine,
GEN.49.12	your teeth whiter than milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun, you will settle
GEN.49.13	along the seashore
GEN.49.13	and provide safe harbors
GEN.49.13	as far north as Sidon.
GEN.49.14	Issachar, you are a strong donkey
GEN.49.14	resting in the meadows.
GEN.49.15	You found them so pleasant
GEN.49.15	that you worked too hard
GEN.49.15	and became a slave.
GEN.49.16	Dan,
GEN.49.16	that will bring justice
GEN.49.16	to Israel.
GEN.49.17	You are a snake that bites
GEN.49.17	the heel of a horse,
GEN.49.17	making its rider fall.
GEN.49.18	Our 
GEN.49.18	for you to save us.
GEN.49.19	Gad,
GEN.49.19	then attack your attackers.
GEN.49.20	Asher, you will eat food
GEN.49.20	fancy enough for a king.
GEN.49.21	Naphtali, you are a wild deer
GEN.49.21	with lovely fawns.
GEN.49.22	Joseph, you are a fruitful vine
GEN.49.22	growing near a stream
GEN.49.22	and climbing a wall.
GEN.49.23	Enemies attacked with arrows,
GEN.49.23	refusing to show mercy.
GEN.49.24	But you stood your ground,
GEN.49.24	swiftly shooting back
GEN.49.24	with the help of Jacob's God,
GEN.49.24	the All-Powerful One—
GEN.49.24	his name is the Shepherd,
GEN.49.24	Israel's mighty rock.
GEN.49.25	Your help came from the God
GEN.49.25	your father worshiped,
GEN.49.25	from God All-Powerful.
GEN.49.25	God will bless you with rain
GEN.49.25	and streams from the earth;
GEN.49.25	he will bless you
GEN.49.25	with many descendants.
GEN.49.26	My son, the blessings I give
GEN.49.26	are better than the promise
GEN.49.26	of ancient mountains
GEN.49.26	or eternal hills.
GEN.49.26	Joseph, I pray these blessings
GEN.49.26	will come to you,
GEN.49.26	because you are the leader
GEN.49.26	of your brothers.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin, you are a fierce wolf,
GEN.49.27	destroying your enemies
GEN.49.27	morning and evening.
GEN.49.28	These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is how Jacob gave each of them their proper blessings.
GEN.49.29+GEN.49.30+GEN.49.31	Soon I will die, and I want you to bury me in Machpelah Cave. Abraham bought this cave as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, and it is near the town of Mamre in Canaan. Abraham and Sarah are buried there, and so are Isaac and Rebekah. I buried Leah there too. 
GEN.49.32	Both the cave and the land that goes with it were bought from the Hittites.
GEN.50.1	Joseph started crying, then leaned over to hug and kiss his father.
GEN.50.2	Joseph gave orders for Jacob's body to be embalmed, 
GEN.50.3	and it took the usual 40 days.
GEN.50.3	The Egyptians mourned 70 days for Jacob. 
GEN.50.4	When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the Egyptian leaders, “If you consider me your friend, please speak to the king
GEN.50.5	 Just before my father died, he made me promise to bury him in his burial cave in Canaan. If the king will give me permission to go, I will come back here.”
GEN.50.6	The king answered, “Go to Canaan and keep your promise to your father.”
GEN.50.7+GEN.50.8+GEN.50.9	When Joseph left Goshen with his brothers, his relatives, and his father's relatives to bury Jacob, many of the king's highest officials and even his military chariots and cavalry went along. The Israelites left behind only their children, their cattle, and their sheep and goats.
GEN.50.10	After crossing the Jordan River, Joseph stopped at Atad's threshing place, where they all mourned and wept seven days for Jacob. 
GEN.50.11	The Canaanites saw this and said, “The Egyptians are in great sorrow.” Then they named the place “Egypt in Sorrow.”
GEN.50.12	So Jacob's sons did just as their father had instructed. 
GEN.50.13	 They took him to Mamre in Canaan and buried him in Machpelah Cave, the burial place Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite.
GEN.50.14	After the funeral, Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else returned to Egypt.
GEN.50.15	After Jacob died, Joseph's brothers said to each other, “What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him?”
GEN.50.16	So they sent this message to Joseph:
GEN.50.16	Before our father died, 
GEN.50.17	he told us, “You did some cruel and terrible things to Joseph, but you must ask him to forgive you.”
GEN.50.17	Now we ask you to please forgive the terrible things we did. After all, we serve the same God that your father worshiped.
GEN.50.17	When Joseph heard this, he started crying.
GEN.50.18	Right then, Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to the ground in front of him and said, “We are your slaves.”
GEN.50.19	But Joseph told them, “Don't be afraid! I have no right to change what God has decided. 
GEN.50.20	You tried to harm me, but God made it turn out for the best, so that he could save all these people, as he is now doing. 
GEN.50.21	Don't be afraid! I will take care of you and your children.” After Joseph said this, his brothers felt much better.
GEN.50.22	Joseph lived in Egypt with his brothers until he died at the age of 110. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph lived long enough to see Ephraim's children and grandchildren. He also lived to see the children of Manasseh's son Machir, and he welcomed them into his family. 
GEN.50.24	Before Joseph died, he told his brothers, “I won't live much longer. But God will take care of you and lead you out of Egypt to the land he promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
GEN.50.25	 Now promise me that you will take my body with you when God leads you to that land.”
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died in Egypt at the age of 110; his body was embalmed and put in a coffin.
EXO.1.6	After Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else in that generation had died, 
EXO.1.7	 the people of Israel became so numerous that the whole region of Goshen was full of them.
EXO.1.9	and he told the Egyptians:
EXO.1.9	There are too many of those Israelites in our country, and they are becoming more powerful than we are. 
EXO.1.10	 If we don't outsmart them, their families will keep growing larger. And if our country goes to war, they could easily fight on the side of our enemies and escape from Egypt.
EXO.1.11	The Egyptians put slave bosses in charge of the people of Israel and tried to wear them down with hard work. Those bosses forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses,
EXO.1.12	But even though the Israelites were mistreated, their families grew larger, and they took over more land. Because of this, the Egyptians feared them worse than before 
EXO.1.13	and made them work so hard 
EXO.1.14	that their lives were miserable. The Egyptians were cruel to the people of Israel and forced them to make bricks and to mix mortar and to work in the fields.
EXO.1.15	Finally, the king called in Shiphrah and Puah, the two women who helped the Hebrew
EXO.1.16	He told them, “If a Hebrew woman gives birth to a girl, let the child live. If the baby is a boy, kill him!”
EXO.1.17	But the two women were faithful to God and did not kill the boys, even though the king had told them to. 
EXO.1.18	The king called them in again and asked, “Why are you letting those baby boys live?”
EXO.1.19	They answered, “Hebrew women have their babies much quicker than Egyptian women. By the time we arrive, their babies are already born.” 
EXO.1.20+EXO.1.21	God was good to the two women because they truly respected him, and he blessed them with children of their own.
EXO.1.20+EXO.1.21	The Hebrews kept increasing 
EXO.1.22	 until finally, the king gave a command to everyone in the nation, “As soon as a Hebrew boy is born, throw him into the Nile River! But you can let the girls live.”
EXO.2.1	A man from the Levi tribe married a woman from the same tribe, 
EXO.2.2	 and she later had a baby boy. He was a beautiful child, and she kept him inside for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer keep him hidden, she made a basket out of reeds and covered it with tar. She put him in the basket and placed it in the tall grass along the edge of the Nile River. 
EXO.2.4	The baby's older sister
EXO.2.5	About that time one of the king's
EXO.2.6	When the king's daughter opened the basket, she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him. She said, “This must be one of the Hebrew babies.”
EXO.2.7	At once the baby's older sister came up and asked, “Do you want me to get a Hebrew woman to take care of the baby for you?”
EXO.2.8	“Yes,” the king's daughter answered.
EXO.2.8	So the girl brought the baby's mother, 
EXO.2.9	and the king's daughter told her, “Take care of this child, and I will pay you.”
EXO.2.9	The baby's mother carried him home and took care of him. 
EXO.2.10	 And when he was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him. She named him Moses
EXO.2.12	Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching, then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
EXO.2.13	When Moses went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting. So he went to the man who had started the fight and asked, “Why are you beating up one of your own people?”
EXO.2.14	The man answered, “Who put you in charge of us and made you our judge? Are you planning to kill me, just like you killed that Egyptian?”
EXO.2.14	This frightened Moses because he was sure that people must have found out what had happened. 
EXO.2.15	 When the king
EXO.2.15	One day, when Moses was sitting by a well, 
EXO.2.16	the seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian,
EXO.2.17	Some shepherds tried to chase them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their animals. 
EXO.2.18	When Jethro's daughters returned home, their father asked, “Why have you come back so early today?”
EXO.2.19	They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even watered our sheep and goats.”
EXO.2.20	“Where is he?” Jethro asked. “Why did you leave him out there? Invite him to eat with us.”
EXO.2.21	Moses agreed to stay on with Jethro, who later let his daughter Zipporah marry Moses. 
EXO.2.22	And when she had a son, Moses said, “I will name him Gershom,
EXO.2.23	After the death of the king of Egypt, the Israelites still complained because they were forced to be slaves. They cried out for help, 
EXO.2.24	 and God heard their loud cries. He did not forget the promise he had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
EXO.2.25	and because he knew what was happening to his people, he felt sorry for them.
EXO.3.1	One day, Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and Moses decided to lead them across the desert to Sinai,
EXO.3.2	 There an angel of the 
EXO.3.3	“This is strange!” he said to himself. “I'll go over and see why the bush isn't burning up.”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.5	God replied, “Don't come any closer. Take off your sandals—the ground where you are standing is holy. 
EXO.3.6	I am the God who was worshiped by your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
EXO.3.6	Moses was afraid to look at God, and so he hid his face.
EXO.3.7	The 
EXO.3.7	I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt, and I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being mistreated. I feel sorry for them, 
EXO.3.8	and I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians.
EXO.3.8	I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is a lot of good land, rich with milk and honey. I will give them the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live. 
EXO.3.9	My people have begged for my help, and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them. 
EXO.3.10	Now go to the king! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country.
EXO.3.11	But Moses said, “Who am I to go to the king and lead your people out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	God replied, “I will be with you. And you will know that I am the one who sent you, when you worship me on this mountain after you have led my people out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.14+EXO.3.15	I am the eternal God. So tell them that the 
EXO.3.16	Call together the leaders of Israel and tell them that the God who was worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has appeared to you. Tell them I have seen how terribly they are being treated in Egypt, 
EXO.3.17	and I promise to lead them out of their troubles. I will give them a land rich with milk and honey, where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.
EXO.3.18	The leaders of Israel will listen to you. Then you must take them to the king of Egypt and say, “The 
EXO.3.19	But I know that the king of Egypt won't let you go unless something forces him to. 
EXO.3.20	So I will use my mighty power to perform all kinds of miracles and strike down the Egyptians. Then the king will send you away.
EXO.3.22	Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbors or to any Egyptian woman living with them and ask them for gold and silver jewelry and for their finest clothes. The Egyptians will give them to you, and you will put these fine things on your sons and daughters. Carry all this away when you leave Egypt.
EXO.4.1	Moses asked the 
EXO.4.2	The 
EXO.4.2	“A walking stick,” Moses replied.
EXO.4.3	“Throw it down!” the 
EXO.4.4	“Pick it up by the tail!” the 
EXO.4.5	“Do this,” the 
EXO.4.6	Next, the 
EXO.4.7	“Put your hand back inside your shirt,” the 
EXO.4.8+EXO.4.9	Then the 
EXO.4.10	Moses replied, “I have never been a good speaker. I wasn't one before you spoke to me, and I'm not one now. I am slow at speaking, and I can never think of what to say.”
EXO.4.11	But the 
EXO.4.12	Now go! When you speak, I will be with you and give you the words to say.”
EXO.4.13	Moses begged, “
EXO.4.14	The 
EXO.4.14	What about your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know he is a good speaker. He is already on his way here to visit you, and he will be happy to see you again. 
EXO.4.15+EXO.4.16	Aaron will speak to the people for you, and you will be like me, telling Aaron what to say. I will be with both of you as you speak, and I will tell each of you what to do. 
EXO.4.17	Now take this walking stick and use it to perform miracles.
EXO.4.18	Moses went to his father-in-law Jethro and asked, “Please let me return to Egypt to see if any of my people are still alive.”
EXO.4.18	“All right,” Jethro replied. “I hope all goes well.”
EXO.4.19	But even before this, the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses put his wife and sons on donkeys and headed for Egypt, holding the walking stick that had the power of God.
EXO.4.21	On the way the 
EXO.4.21	When you get to Egypt, go to the king and work the miracles I have shown you. But I will make him so stubborn that he will refuse to let my people go. 
EXO.4.22	Then tell him that I have said, “Israel is my first-born son, 
EXO.4.23	 and I commanded you to release him, so he could worship me. But you refused, and now I will kill your first-born son.”
EXO.4.24	One night while Moses was in camp, the 
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah
EXO.4.26	So the 
EXO.4.27	The 
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron what God had sent him to say; he also told him about the miracles God had given him the power to perform.
EXO.4.29	Later they brought together the leaders of Israel, 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron told them what the 
EXO.4.31	and everyone believed. They bowed down and worshiped the 
EXO.5.1	Moses and Aaron went to the king
EXO.5.2	“Who is this 
EXO.5.3	They answered, “The 
EXO.5.4+EXO.5.5	The king said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you keeping these people from working? Look how many you are keeping from doing their work. Now everyone get back to work!”
EXO.5.6	That same day the king gave orders to his Egyptian slave bosses and to the Israelite men directly in charge of the Israelite slaves. He told them:
EXO.5.7	Don't give the slaves any more straw
EXO.5.8	but they must make the same number of bricks as before. They are lazy, or else they would not beg me to let them go and sacrifice to their God. 
EXO.5.9	Make them work so hard that they won't have time to listen to these lies.
EXO.5.10	The slave bosses and the men in charge of the slaves went out and told them, “The king says he will not give you any more straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go and find your own straw wherever you can, but you must still make as many bricks as before.”
EXO.5.12	The slaves went all over Egypt, looking for straw. 
EXO.5.13	But the slave bosses were hard on them and kept saying, “Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw.” 
EXO.5.14	The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said, “Why didn't you force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before?”
EXO.5.15	Finally, the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and said, “Why are you treating us like this? 
EXO.5.16	No one brings us any straw, but we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks. We are beaten with whips, and your own people are to blame.”
EXO.5.17	The king replied, “You are lazy—nothing but lazy! That's why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to your 
EXO.5.18	Get back to work! You won't be given straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.”
EXO.5.19	The men knew they were in deep trouble when they were ordered to make the same number of bricks each day. 
EXO.5.20	After they left the king, they went to see Moses and Aaron, who had been waiting for them. 
EXO.5.21	Then the men said, “We hope the 
EXO.5.22	Moses left them and prayed, “Our 
EXO.5.23	Ever since you told me to speak to the king,
EXO.6.1	The 
EXO.6.1	Soon you will see what I will do to the king. Because of my mighty power, he will let my people go, and he will even chase them out of his country.
EXO.6.3	But when I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I came as God All-Powerful and did not use my name. 
EXO.6.4	I made an agreement and promised them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners. 
EXO.6.5	Now I have seen how the people of Israel are suffering because of the Egyptians, and I will keep my promise.
EXO.6.6	Here is my message for Israel: “I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will accept you as my people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I was the one who rescued you from the Egyptians. 
EXO.6.8	I will bring you into the land that I solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it will be yours. I am the 
EXO.6.9	When Moses told this to the Israelites, they were too discouraged and mistreated to believe him.
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	to demand that the king of Egypt let the Israelites leave. 
EXO.6.12	But Moses replied, “I'm not a powerful speaker. If the Israelites won't listen to me, why should the king of Egypt?” 
EXO.6.13	But the 
EXO.6.14	The following men were the heads of their ancestral clans:
EXO.6.14	The sons of Reuben, Jacob's
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
EXO.6.17	Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei.
EXO.6.18	Kohath lived to be 133; his sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
EXO.6.19	Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. All of the above were from the Levi tribe.
EXO.6.20	Amram lived to be 137. He married his father's sister Jochebed, and they had two sons, Aaron and Moses.
EXO.6.21	Izhar's sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO.6.22	Uzziel's sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon; they had four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	Korah's sons were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.
EXO.6.25	Aaron's son Eleazar married one of Putiel's daughters, and their son was Phinehas. This ends the list of those who were the heads of clans in the Levi tribe.
EXO.6.26	The 
EXO.6.27	and so they told the king of Egypt to set the people of Israel free.
EXO.6.28	When the 
EXO.6.29	he said, “I am the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses answered, “You know I am a very poor speaker, and the king will never listen to me.”
EXO.7.1	The 
EXO.7.1	I am going to let your brother Aaron speak for you. He will tell your message to the king, just as a prophet speaks my message to the people. 
EXO.7.2	Tell Aaron everything I say to you, and he will order the king to let my people leave his country. 
EXO.7.3+EXO.7.4	 But I will make the king so stubborn that he won't listen to you. He won't listen even when I do many terrible things to him and his nation. Then I will bring a final punishment on Egypt, and the king will let Israel's families and tribes go. 
EXO.7.5	When this happens, the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	Moses and Aaron obeyed the 
EXO.7.7	and spoke to the king. At the time, Moses was 80 years old, and Aaron was 83.
EXO.7.8+EXO.7.9	The 
EXO.7.10	Moses and Aaron went to the king and his officials and did exactly as the 
EXO.7.11	Then the king called in the wise men and the magicians, who used their secret powers to do the same thing— 
EXO.7.12	they threw down sticks that turned into snakes. But Aaron's snake swallowed theirs. 
EXO.7.13	The king behaved just as the 
EXO.7.14	The Egyptian king
EXO.7.15	Tomorrow morning take the stick that turned into a snake, then wait beside the Nile River for the king. 
EXO.7.16	Tell him, “The 
EXO.7.18	The fish will die, the river will stink, and none of you Egyptians will be able to drink the water.”
EXO.7.19	Moses, then command Aaron to hold his stick over the water. And when he does, every drop of water in Egypt will turn into blood, including rivers, canals, ponds, and even the water in buckets and jars.
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron obeyed the 
EXO.7.21	the fish died, and the water smelled so bad that none of the Egyptians could drink it. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
EXO.7.22	But the Egyptian magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing. The king did just as the 
EXO.7.23	Then he went back to his palace and never gave it a second thought. 
EXO.7.24	The Egyptians had to dig holes along the banks of the Nile for drinking water, because water from the river was unfit to drink.
EXO.7.25	Seven days after the 
EXO.8.1	he said to Moses:
EXO.8.1	Go to the palace and tell the king
EXO.8.2	If he refuses, I will cover his entire country with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	Warn the king that the Nile will be full of frogs, and from there they will spread into the royal palace, including the king's bedroom and even his bed. Frogs will enter the homes of his officials and will find their way into ovens and into the bowls of bread dough. 
EXO.8.4	Frogs will be crawling on everyone—the king, his officials, and every citizen of Egypt.
EXO.8.5	Moses, now command Aaron to hold his stick over the water. Then frogs will come from all rivers, canals, and ponds in Egypt, and they will cover the land.
EXO.8.6	Aaron obeyed, and suddenly frogs were everywhere in Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing.
EXO.8.8	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “If you ask the 
EXO.8.9	“All right,” Moses answered. “You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you, your officials, and your people, and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river.”
EXO.8.10	“Do it tomorrow!” the king replied.
EXO.8.10	“As you wish,” Moses agreed. “Then everyone will discover that there is no god like the 
EXO.8.11	and frogs will no longer be found anywhere, except in the Nile.”
EXO.8.12	After Moses and Aaron left the palace, Moses begged the 
EXO.8.13	The 
EXO.8.14	The dead frogs were placed in piles, and the whole country began to stink. 
EXO.8.15	But when the king saw that things were now better, he again did just as the 
EXO.8.16	The 
EXO.8.17	They obeyed, and when Aaron struck the ground with the stick, gnats started swarming on people and animals. In fact, every speck of dust in Egypt turned into a gnat. 
EXO.8.18	When the magicians tried to use their secret powers to do this,
EXO.8.19	But, as the 
EXO.8.20	The 
EXO.8.20	Early tomorrow morning, while the king
EXO.8.21	If you don't, he will send swarms of flies to attack you, your officials, and every citizen of your country. Your houses will be full of flies, and the ground will crawl with them.
EXO.8.22+EXO.8.23	“The 
EXO.8.24	The 
EXO.8.25	Then the king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “Go ahead and sacrifice to your God, but stay here in Egypt.”
EXO.8.26	“That's impossible!” Moses replied. “Any sacrifices we offer to the 
EXO.8.27	No indeed! The 
EXO.8.28	Then the king told him, “I'll let you go into the desert to offer sacrifices, if you don't go very far. But in the meantime, pray for me.”
EXO.8.29	“Your Majesty,” Moses replied, “I'll pray for you as soon as I leave, and by tomorrow the flies will stop bothering you, your officials, and the citizens of your country. Only make sure that you're telling the truth this time and that you really intend to let our people offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.30	After leaving the palace, Moses prayed, 
EXO.8.31	and the 
EXO.8.32	But the king turned stubborn again and would not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	The 
EXO.9.1	The 
EXO.9.2	If you keep refusing, 
EXO.9.3	he will bring a terrible disease on your horses and donkeys, your camels and cattle, and your sheep and goats. 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	Tomorrow is the day the 
EXO.9.6	It happened the next day—all of the animals belonging to the Egyptians died, but the Israelites did not lose even one. 
EXO.9.7	When the king found out, he was still too stubborn to let the people go.
EXO.9.8	The 
EXO.9.8	Take a few handfuls of ashes from a stove and you, Moses, throw them into the air. Be sure the king is watching. 
EXO.9.9	The ashes will blow across the land of Egypt, causing sores to break out on people and animals.
EXO.9.11	The magicians were suffering so much from the sores, that they could not even come to Moses. 
EXO.9.12	Everything happened just as the 
EXO.9.13	The 
EXO.9.13	The 
EXO.9.14	If you don't, he will send his worst plagues to strike you, your officials, and everyone else in your country. Then you will find out that no one can oppose the 
EXO.9.15	In fact, he could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth. 
EXO.9.16	 But he has kept you alive, just to show you his power and to bring honor to himself everywhere in the world.
EXO.9.17	You are still determined not to let the 
EXO.9.18	All right. At this time tomorrow, he will bring on Egypt the worst hailstorm in its history. 
EXO.9.19	You had better give orders for every person and every animal in Egypt to take shelter. If they don't, they will die.
EXO.9.20	Some of the king's officials were frightened by what the 
EXO.9.21	But others paid no attention to his threats and left their slaves and animals out in the open.
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23+EXO.9.24	 Moses pointed his walking stick toward the sky, and hailstones started falling everywhere. Thunder roared, and lightning flashed back and forth, striking the ground. This was the worst storm in the history of Egypt. 
EXO.9.25	People, animals, and crops were pounded by the hailstones, and bark was stripped from trees. 
EXO.9.26	Only Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was safe from the storm.
EXO.9.27	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “Now I have really sinned! My people and I are guilty, and the 
EXO.9.28	We can't stand any more of this thunder and hail. Please ask the 
EXO.9.29	Moses answered, “As soon as I leave the city, I will lift my arms in prayer. When the thunder and hail stop, you will know that the earth belongs to the 
EXO.9.30	But I am certain that neither you nor your officials really fear the 
EXO.9.31	Meanwhile, the flax and barley crops had been destroyed by the storm because they were ready to ripen. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat crops
EXO.9.33	After Moses left the royal palace and the city, he lifted his arms in prayer to the 
EXO.9.34	When the king realized that the storm was over, he disobeyed once more. He and his officials were so stubborn 
EXO.9.35	that he refused to let the Israelites go. This was exactly what the 
EXO.10.1	The 
EXO.10.1	Go back to the king.
EXO.10.2	I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about my miracles and about my harsh treatment of the Egyptians. Then all of you will know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him that the 
EXO.10.3	How long will you stubbornly refuse to obey? Release my people so they can worship me. 
EXO.10.4	Do this by tomorrow, or I will cover your country with so many locusts
EXO.10.5	that you won't be able to see the ground. Most of your crops were ruined by the hailstones, but these locusts will destroy what little is left, including the trees. 
EXO.10.6	Your palace, the homes of your officials, and all the other houses in Egypt will overflow with more locusts than have ever been seen in this country.
EXO.10.6	After Moses left the palace, 
EXO.10.7	the king's officials asked, “Your Majesty, how much longer is this man going to be a troublemaker? Why don't you let the people leave, so they can worship the 
EXO.10.8	The king had Moses and Aaron brought back, and he said, “All right, you may go and worship the 
EXO.10.9	“Everyone, young and old,” Moses answered. “We will even take our sheep, goats, and cattle, because we want to hold a celebration in honor of the 
EXO.10.10	The king replied, “The 
EXO.10.11	Do you want to worship the 
EXO.10.12	The 
EXO.10.13	Moses held out his walking stick, and the 
EXO.10.14	 were swarming everywhere. Never before had there been so many locusts in Egypt, and never again will there be so many. 
EXO.10.15	The ground was black with locusts, and they ate everything left on the trees and in the fields. Nothing green remained in Egypt—not a tree or a plant.
EXO.10.16	At once the king sent for Moses and Aaron. He told them, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Forgive me one more time and ask the 
EXO.10.18	Moses left the palace and prayed. 
EXO.10.19	Then the 
EXO.10.20	but the 
EXO.10.22	 Moses stretched his arm toward the sky, and Egypt was covered with darkness for three days. 
EXO.10.23	During that time, the Egyptians could not see each other or leave their homes, but there was light where the Israelites lived.
EXO.10.24	The king
EXO.10.25	“No!” Moses replied. “You must let us offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.10.26	and we won't know which animals we will need until we get there. That's why we can't leave even one of them here.”
EXO.10.27	This time the 
EXO.10.28	that he said to Moses, “Get out and stay out! If you ever come back, you're dead!”
EXO.10.29	“Have it your way,” Moses answered. “You won't see me again.”
EXO.11.1	The 
EXO.11.1	I am going to punish the king
EXO.11.2	Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold and silver jewelry.
EXO.11.3	So the 
EXO.11.4	Moses went to the king and said:
EXO.11.4	I have come to let you know what the 
EXO.11.5	and wherever he goes, the first-born son in every family will die. Your own son will die, and so will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the first-born males of your cattle will die. 
EXO.11.6	Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.
EXO.11.7	But there won't be any need for the Israelites to cry. Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking. Then you Egyptians will know that the 
EXO.11.8	Your leaders will come and bow down, begging me to take my people and leave your country. Then we will leave.
EXO.11.8	Moses was very angry; he turned and left the king.
EXO.11.9	What the 
EXO.11.10	So the king of Egypt saw Moses and Aaron work miracles, but the 
EXO.12.2	This month
EXO.12.3	Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat. 
EXO.12.4+EXO.12.5	If any family is too small to eat the whole animal, they must share it with their next-door neighbors. Choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a one-year-old male that has nothing wrong with it. And it must be large enough for everyone to have some of the meat.
EXO.12.6	Each family must take care of its animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, when the animals are to be killed. 
EXO.12.7	Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten. 
EXO.12.8	That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten, together with bitter herbs and thin bread made without yeast. 
EXO.12.9	Don't eat the meat raw or boiled. The entire animal, including its head, legs, and insides, must be roasted. 
EXO.12.10	Eat what you want that night, and the next morning burn whatever is left. 
EXO.12.11	When you eat the meal, be dressed and ready to travel. Have your sandals on, carry your walking stick in your hand, and eat quickly. This is the Passover Festival in honor of me, your 
EXO.12.12	That same night I will pass through Egypt and kill the first-born son in every family and the first-born male of all animals. I am the 
EXO.12.13	The blood on the houses will show me where you live, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. Then you won't be bothered by the terrible disasters I will bring on Egypt.
EXO.12.15	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. And on the first of these seven days, you must remove all yeast from your homes. If you eat anything made with yeast during this festival, you will no longer be part of Israel. 
EXO.12.16	Meet together for worship on the first and seventh days of the festival. The only work you are allowed to do on either of these two days is that of preparing the bread.
EXO.12.17	Celebrate this Festival of Thin Bread as a way of remembering the day that I brought your families and tribes out of Egypt. And do this each year. 
EXO.12.18	Begin on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month by eating bread made without yeast. Then continue this celebration until the evening of the twenty-first day. 
EXO.12.19	During these seven days no yeast is allowed in anyone's home, whether they are native Israelites or not. If you are caught eating anything made with yeast, you will no longer be part of Israel. 
EXO.12.20	Stay away from yeast, no matter where you live. No one is allowed to eat anything made with yeast!
EXO.12.21	Moses called the leaders of Israel together and said:
EXO.12.21	Each family is to pick out a sheep and kill it for Passover. 
EXO.12.22	Make a brush from a few small branches of a hyssop plant and dip the brush in the bowl that has the blood of the animal in it. Then brush some of the blood above the door and on the posts at each side of the door of your house. After this, everyone is to stay inside until morning.
EXO.12.24+EXO.12.25	After you have entered the country promised to you by the 
EXO.12.26	Your children will ask you, “What are we celebrating?” 
EXO.12.27	And you will answer, “The Passover animal is killed to honor the 
EXO.12.27	After Moses finished speaking, the people of Israel knelt down and worshiped the 
EXO.12.28	Then they left and did what Moses and Aaron had told them to do.
EXO.12.30	That night the king, his officials, and everyone else in Egypt got up and started crying bitterly. In every Egyptian home, someone was dead.
EXO.12.31	During the night the king
EXO.12.32	Take your sheep, goats, and cattle, and get out. But ask your God to be kind to me.”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians did everything they could to get the Israelites to leave their country as quickly as possible. They said, “Please hurry and leave. If you don't, we will all be dead.” 
EXO.12.34	So the Israelites quickly made some bread dough and put it in pans. But they did not mix any yeast in the dough to make it rise. They wrapped cloth around the pans and carried them on their shoulders.
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	The Israelites walked from the city of Rameses to the city of Succoth. There were about 600,000 of them, not counting women and children. 
EXO.12.38	Many other people went with them as well, and there were also a lot of sheep, goats, and cattle. 
EXO.12.39	They left Egypt in such a hurry that they did not have time to prepare any food except the bread dough made without yeast. So they baked it and made thin bread.
EXO.12.42	On that night the 
EXO.12.43	The 
EXO.12.43	Only Israelites may eat the Passover meal.
EXO.12.44	Your slaves may eat the meal if they have been circumcised, 
EXO.12.45	but no foreigners who work for you are allowed to have any.
EXO.12.46	No bones of the Passover lamb may be broken. 
EXO.12.47	And all Israelites must take part in the meal.
EXO.12.48	If anyone who isn't an Israelite wants to celebrate Passover with you, every man and boy in that family must first be circumcised. Then they may join in the meal, just like native Israelites. No uncircumcised man or boy may eat the Passover meal! 
EXO.12.49	This law applies both to native Israelites and to those foreigners who live among you.
EXO.12.50	The Israelites obeyed everything the 
EXO.12.51	And on that same day the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	 “Dedicate to me the first-born son of every family and the first-born males of your flocks and herds. These belong to me.”
EXO.13.3+EXO.13.4	Moses said to the people:
EXO.13.3+EXO.13.4	Remember this day in the month of Abib.
EXO.13.5	The 
EXO.13.5	Each year during the month of Abib, celebrate these events in the following way: 
EXO.13.6	For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast, and on the seventh day you are to celebrate a festival in honor of the 
EXO.13.7	During those seven days, you must not eat anything made with yeast or even have yeast anywhere near your homes. 
EXO.13.8	Then on the seventh day you must explain to your children that you do this because the 
EXO.13.9	This celebration will be like wearing a sign on your hand or on your forehead, because then you will pass on to others the teaching of the 
EXO.13.10	Celebrate this festival each year at the same time.
EXO.13.11	The 
EXO.13.12	 From then on, you must give him every first-born son from your families and every first-born male from your animals, because these belong to him. 
EXO.13.13	You can spare the life of a first-born donkey
EXO.13.14	In the future your children will ask what this ceremony means. Explain it to them by saying, “The 
EXO.13.15	The king
EXO.13.16	This ceremony will serve the same purpose as a sign on your hand or on your forehead to tell how the 
EXO.13.17	After the king
EXO.13.18	So he led them around through the desert and toward the Red Sea.
EXO.13.18	The Israelites left Egypt, prepared for battle.
EXO.13.20	The people of Israel left Succoth and camped at Etham at the border of Egypt near the desert. 
EXO.13.21+EXO.13.22	 During the day the 
EXO.14.1	At Etham the 
EXO.14.2	Tell the people of Israel to turn back and camp across from Pi-Hahiroth near Baal-Zephon, between Migdol and the Red Sea.
EXO.14.3	The king
EXO.14.4	I will make the king stubborn again, and he will try to catch you. Then I will destroy him and his army. People everywhere will praise me for my victory, and the Egyptians will know that I really am the 
EXO.14.4	The Israelites obeyed the 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt heard that the Israelites had finally left, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “Look what we have done! We let them get away, and they will no longer be our slaves.”
EXO.14.6	The king got his war chariot and army ready. 
EXO.14.7	He commanded his officers in charge of his 600 best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	But the king's horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon.
EXO.14.10	When the Israelites saw the king coming with his army, they were frightened and begged the 
EXO.14.11	They also complained to Moses, “Wasn't there enough room in Egypt to bury us? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt anyway? 
EXO.14.12	While we were there, didn't we tell you to leave us alone? We'd rather be slaves in Egypt than die in this desert!”
EXO.14.13	But Moses answered, “Don't be afraid! Be brave, and you will see the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	The 
EXO.14.16	Then hold your walking stick over the sea. The water will open up and make a road where they can walk through on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go after you. Then I will be praised because of what happens to the king and his chariots and cavalry. 
EXO.14.18	The Egyptians will know for sure that I am the 
EXO.14.19	All this time God's angel had gone ahead of Israel's army, but now he moved behind them. A large cloud had also gone ahead of them, 
EXO.14.20	but now it moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud gave light to the Israelites, but made it dark for the Egyptians, and during the night they could not come any closer.
EXO.14.22	 and the Israelites walked through on dry land with a wall of water on each side.
EXO.14.23	The Egyptian chariots and cavalry went after them. 
EXO.14.24	But before daylight the 
EXO.14.25	Their chariot wheels got stuck,
EXO.14.26	The 
EXO.14.27	Moses stretched out his arm, and at daybreak the water rushed toward the Egyptians. They tried to run away, but the 
EXO.14.28	The water came and covered the chariots, the cavalry, and the whole Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them was left alive. 
EXO.14.29	But the sea had made a wall of water on each side of the Israelites, so they walked through on dry land.
EXO.14.30	On that day, when the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the shore, they knew that the 
EXO.14.31	Because of the mighty power he had used against the Egyptians, the Israelites worshiped him and trusted him and his servant Moses.
EXO.15.1	I sing praises to the 
EXO.15.1	for his great victory!
EXO.15.1	He has thrown the horses
EXO.15.1	and their riders
EXO.15.1	into the sea.
EXO.15.2	the reason for my song,
EXO.15.2	because he has saved me.
EXO.15.2	I praise and honor the 
EXO.15.2	he is my God and the God
EXO.15.2	of my ancestors.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	and he is a warrior!
EXO.15.4	He threw the chariots and army
EXO.15.4	of Egypt's king
EXO.15.4	into the Red Sea,
EXO.15.4	and he drowned the best
EXO.15.4	of the king's officers.
EXO.15.5	They sank to the bottom
EXO.15.5	just like stones.
EXO.15.6	With the tremendous force
EXO.15.6	of your right arm, our 
EXO.15.6	you crushed your enemies.
EXO.15.7	What a great victory was yours,
EXO.15.7	when you defeated everyone
EXO.15.7	who opposed you.
EXO.15.7	Your fiery anger wiped them out,
EXO.15.7	as though they were straw.
EXO.15.8	You were so furious
EXO.15.8	that the sea piled up
EXO.15.8	like a wall,
EXO.15.8	and the ocean depths
EXO.15.8	curdled like cheese.
EXO.15.9	Your enemies boasted
EXO.15.9	that they would
EXO.15.9	pursue and capture us,
EXO.15.9	divide up our possessions,
EXO.15.9	treat us as they wished,
EXO.15.9	then take out their swords
EXO.15.9	and kill us right there.
EXO.15.10	But when you got furious,
EXO.15.10	they sank like lead,
EXO.15.10	swallowed by ocean waves.
EXO.15.11	Our 
EXO.15.11	compare with you—
EXO.15.11	Majestic and holy!
EXO.15.11	Fearsome and glorious!
EXO.15.11	Miracle worker!
EXO.15.12	When you signaled
EXO.15.12	with your right hand,
EXO.15.12	your enemies were swallowed
EXO.15.12	deep into the earth.
EXO.15.13	The people you rescued
EXO.15.13	were led by your powerful love
EXO.15.13	to your holy place.
EXO.15.14	Nations learned of this
EXO.15.14	and trembled—
EXO.15.14	Philistines shook with horror.
EXO.15.15	The leaders of Edom and of Moab
EXO.15.15	were terrified.
EXO.15.15	Everyone in Canaan fainted,
EXO.15.16	struck down by fear.
EXO.15.16	Our 
EXO.15.16	kept them still as a rock
EXO.15.16	until the people you rescued
EXO.15.16	to be your very own
EXO.15.16	had marched by.
EXO.15.17	You will let your people settle
EXO.15.17	on your own mountain,
EXO.15.17	where you chose to live
EXO.15.17	and to be worshiped.
EXO.15.18	Our 
EXO.15.19	The 
EXO.15.20	Miriam the sister of Aaron was a prophet. So she took her tambourine and led the other women out to play their tambourines and to dance. 
EXO.15.21	Then she sang to them:
EXO.15.21	“Sing praises to the 
EXO.15.21	for his great victory!
EXO.15.21	He has thrown the horses
EXO.15.21	and their riders into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	After the Israelites left the Red Sea,
EXO.15.23	They did find water at Marah, but it was bitter, which is how that place got its name.
EXO.15.24	The people complained and said, “Moses, what are we going to drink?”
EXO.15.25	At Marah the 
EXO.15.26	Then he said, “I am the 
EXO.15.27	Later the Israelites came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and 70 palm trees. So they camped there.
EXO.16.1	On the fifteenth day of the second month after the Israelites had escaped from Egypt, they left Elim and started through the western edge of the Sinai Desert
EXO.16.2	There in the desert they started complaining to Moses and Aaron, 
EXO.16.3	“We wish the 
EXO.16.5	But on the sixth day of each week they must gather and cook twice as much.”
EXO.16.6	Moses and Aaron told the people, “This evening you will know that the 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning you will see his glorious power, because he has heard your complaints against him. Why should you grumble to us? Who are we?”
EXO.16.8	Then Moses continued, “You will know it is the 
EXO.16.9	Moses turned to Aaron and said, “Bring the people together, because the 
EXO.16.10	Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of the 
EXO.16.11	The 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard my people complain. Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread. Then they will know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	That evening a lot of quails came and landed everywhere in the camp, and the next morning dew covered the ground. 
EXO.16.14	After the dew had gone, the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost. 
EXO.16.15	 The people had never seen anything like this, and they started asking each other, “What is it?”
EXO.16.15	Moses answered, “This is the bread that the 
EXO.16.16	And he orders you to gather about two liters for each person in your family—that should be more than enough.”
EXO.16.17	They did as they were told. Some gathered more and some gathered less. 
EXO.16.18	 Everyone had exactly what they needed, just the right amount.
EXO.16.19	Moses told them not to keep any overnight. 
EXO.16.20	Some of them disobeyed, but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms, and Moses was angry.
EXO.16.21	Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and in the heat of the day the rest melted. 
EXO.16.22	However, on the sixth day of the week, everyone gathered enough to have four liters, instead of two. When the leaders reported this to Moses, 
EXO.16.23	 he told them that the 
EXO.16.24	The people obeyed, and the next morning the food smelled fine and had no worms. 
EXO.16.25	“You may eat the food,” Moses said. “Today is the Sabbath in honor of the 
EXO.16.26	You will find it there for the first six days of the week, but not on the Sabbath.”
EXO.16.27	A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some, but there was none. 
EXO.16.28	Then the 
EXO.16.29	Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath. That's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days. Everyone is to stay home and rest on the Sabbath.” 
EXO.16.30	And so they rested on the Sabbath.
EXO.16.32	Moses told the people that the 
EXO.16.34	Aaron followed the 
EXO.16.35+EXO.16.36	 The Israelites ate manna for 40 years, before they came to the border of Canaan that was a settled land.
EXO.17.2	The people started complaining to Moses, “Give us some water!”
EXO.17.2	Moses replied, “Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the 
EXO.17.3	But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining, “Moses, did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst?”
EXO.17.4	Then Moses prayed to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	When you get to the rock at Mount Sinai,
EXO.17.7	The people had complained and tested the 
EXO.17.8	When the Israelites were at Rephidim, they were attacked by the Amalekites. 
EXO.17.9	So Moses told Joshua, “Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on a hilltop, holding this walking stick that has the power of God.”
EXO.17.10	Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on the hilltop. 
EXO.17.11	The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he lowered them. 
EXO.17.12	After a while, his arms were so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset. 
EXO.17.13	That's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar and named it “The 
EXO.17.16	Then Moses explained, “This is because I depended on the 
EXO.18.1	Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses. He heard what the 
EXO.18.2+EXO.18.3+EXO.18.4	When his second son was born, Moses said, “I'll name him Eliezer,
EXO.18.5+EXO.18.6	While Israel was camped in the desert near Mount Sinai,
EXO.18.7	When they arrived, Moses went out and bowed down in front of Jethro, then kissed him. After they had greeted each other, they went into the tent, 
EXO.18.8	where Moses told him everything the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro was so pleased to hear this good news about what the 
EXO.18.10	that he shouted, “Praise the 
EXO.18.11	 Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	Jethro offered sacrifices to God. Then Aaron and Israel's leaders came to eat with Jethro there at the place of worship.
EXO.18.13	The next morning Moses sat down at the place where he decided legal cases for the people, and everyone crowded around him until evening. 
EXO.18.14	Jethro saw how much Moses had to do for the people, and he asked, “Why are you the only judge? Why do you let these people crowd around you from morning till evening?”
EXO.18.15	Moses answered, “Because they come here to find out what God wants them to do. 
EXO.18.16	They bring their complaints to me, and I make decisions on the basis of God's laws.”
EXO.18.17	Jethro replied:
EXO.18.17	That isn't the best way to do it. 
EXO.18.18	You and the people who come to you will soon be worn out. The job is too much for one person; you can't do it alone. 
EXO.18.19	God will help you if you follow my advice. You should be the one to speak to God for the people, 
EXO.18.20	and you should teach them God's laws and show them what they must do to live right.
EXO.18.21	You will need to appoint some competent leaders who respect God and are trustworthy and honest. Then put them over groups of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000. 
EXO.18.22	These judges can handle the ordinary cases and bring the more difficult ones to you. Having them to share the load will make your work easier. 
EXO.18.23	This is the way God wants it done. You won't be under nearly as much stress, and everyone else will return home feeling satisfied.
EXO.18.24	Moses followed Jethro's advice. 
EXO.18.25	He chose some competent leaders from every tribe in Israel and put them over groups of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000. 
EXO.18.26	They served as judges, deciding the easy cases themselves, but bringing the more difficult ones to Moses.
EXO.18.27	After Moses and his father-in-law Jethro had said goodbye to each other, Jethro returned home.
EXO.19.1+EXO.19.2	The Israelites left Rephidim
EXO.19.3	Moses went up the mountain to meet with the 
EXO.19.4	You saw what I did in Egypt, and you know how I brought you here to me, just as a mighty eagle carries its young. 
EXO.19.6	 but you will be my holy nation and serve me as priests.
EXO.19.6	Moses, that is what you must tell the Israelites.
EXO.19.7	After Moses went back, he reported to the leaders what the 
EXO.19.8	and they all promised, “We will do everything the 
EXO.19.9	The 
EXO.19.10	Once more the 
EXO.19.10	Go back and tell the people that today and tomorrow they must get themselves ready to meet me. They must wash their clothes 
EXO.19.11	and be ready by the day after tomorrow, when I will come down to Mount Sinai, where all of them can see me.
EXO.19.13	either with stones or arrows, and no one must touch the body of the person being put to death in this way. Even an animal that touches this mountain must be put to death. You may go up the mountain only after a signal is given on the trumpet.
EXO.19.14	After Moses went down the mountain, he gave orders for the people to wash their clothes and make themselves acceptable to worship God. 
EXO.19.15	He told them to be ready in three days and not to have sex in the meantime.
EXO.19.17	Moses led them out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
EXO.19.18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the 
EXO.19.19	The trumpet blew louder and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him with thunder.
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	Then he said, “Moses, go and warn the people not to cross the boundary that you set at the foot of the mountain. They must not cross it to come and look at me, because if they do, many of them will die. 
EXO.19.22	Only the priests may come near me, and they must obey strict rules before I let them. If they don't, they will be punished.”
EXO.19.23	Moses replied, “The people cannot come up the mountain. You warned us to stay away because it is holy.”
EXO.19.24	Then the 
EXO.19.25	After Moses had gone back down, he told the people what the 
EXO.20.1	God said to the people of Israel:
EXO.20.2	I am the 
EXO.20.3	Do not worship any god except me.
EXO.20.5	 Don't bow down and worship idols. I am the 
EXO.20.6	But if you love me and obey my laws, I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations.
EXO.20.9	 You have six days when you can do your work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day of each week belongs to me, your God. No one is to work on that day—not you, your children, your slaves, your animals, or the foreigners who live in your towns. 
EXO.20.11	 In six days I made the sky, the earth, the oceans, and everything in them, but on the seventh day I rested. That's why I made the Sabbath a special day that belongs to me.
EXO.20.19	and said to Moses, “If you speak to us, we will listen. But don't let God speak to us, or we will die!”
EXO.20.20	“Don't be afraid!” Moses replied. “God has come only to test you, so that by obeying him you won't sin.” 
EXO.20.21	But when Moses went near the thick cloud where God was, the people stayed a long way off.
EXO.20.22	The 
EXO.20.22	With your own eyes you saw me speak to you from heaven. 
EXO.20.23	So you must never make idols of silver or gold to worship in place of me.
EXO.20.24	Build an altar out of earth, and offer on it your sacrifices
EXO.20.25	 If you ever build an altar for me out of stones, do not use any tools to chisel the stones, because that would make the altar unfit for use in worship. 
EXO.20.26	And don't build an altar that requires steps; you might expose yourself when you climb up.
EXO.21.1	The 
EXO.21.3	If he was single at the time you bought him, he alone must be set free. But if he was married at the time, both he and his wife must be given their freedom. 
EXO.21.4	If you give him a wife, and they have children, only the man himself must be set free; his wife and children remain the property of his owner.
EXO.21.5	But suppose the slave loves his wife and children and his owner so much that he won't leave them. 
EXO.21.6	Then he must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship,
EXO.21.7	A young woman who was sold by her father doesn't gain her freedom in the same way that a man does. 
EXO.21.8	If she doesn't please the man who bought her to be his wife, he must let her be bought back.
EXO.21.9	If he selects her as a wife for his son, he must treat her as his own daughter.
EXO.21.10	If the man later marries another woman, he must continue to provide food and clothing for the one he bought and to treat her as a wife. 
EXO.21.11	If he fails to do any of these things, she must be given her freedom without paying for it.
EXO.21.13	 But if you did not intend to kill someone, and I, the 
EXO.21.14	If you plan in advance to murder someone, there's no escape, not even by holding on to my altar.
EXO.21.15	Death is the punishment for attacking your father or mother.
EXO.21.18	Suppose two of you are arguing, and you hit the other with either a rock or your fist, without causing a fatal injury. If the victim has to stay in bed, 
EXO.21.19	and later has to use a stick when walking outside, you must pay for the loss of time and do what you can to help until the injury is completely healed. That's your only responsibility.
EXO.21.20	Death is the punishment for beating to death any of your slaves. 
EXO.21.21	However, if the slave lives a few days after the beating, you are not to be punished. After all, you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property.
EXO.21.22	Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage
EXO.21.23	But if she is seriously injured, the payment will be life for life, 
EXO.21.24	 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burn for burn, cut for cut, and bruise for bruise.
EXO.21.26	If you hit one of your slaves and cause the loss of an eye, the slave must be set free. 
EXO.21.27	The same law applies if you knock out a slave's tooth—the slave goes free.
EXO.21.28	A bull that kills someone with its horns must be killed and its meat destroyed, but the owner of the bull isn't responsible for the death.
EXO.21.29	Suppose you own a bull that has been in the habit of attacking people, but you have refused to keep it fenced in. If that bull kills someone, both you and the bull must be put to death by stoning. 
EXO.21.30	However, you may save your own life by paying whatever fine is demanded. 
EXO.21.31	This same law applies if the bull gores someone's son or daughter. 
EXO.21.32	If the bull kills a slave, you must pay the slave owner 30 pieces of silver for the loss of the slave, and the bull must be killed by stoning.
EXO.21.33	Suppose someone's ox or donkey is killed by falling into an open pit that you dug or left uncovered on your property. 
EXO.21.34	You must pay for the dead animal, and it becomes yours.
EXO.21.35	If your bull kills someone else's, yours must be sold. Then the money from your bull and the meat from the dead bull must be divided equally between you and the other owner.
EXO.21.36	If you refuse to fence in a bull that is known to attack others, you must replace any animal it kills, but the dead animal will belong to you.
EXO.22.1	If you steal an ox and slaughter or sell it, you must replace it with five oxen; if you steal a sheep and slaughter it or sell it, you must replace it with four sheep. 
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	But if you cannot afford to replace the animals, you must be sold as a slave to pay for what you have stolen. If you steal an ox, donkey, or sheep, and are caught with it still alive, you must pay the owner double.
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	If you happen to kill a burglar who breaks into your home after dark, you are not guilty. But if you kill someone who breaks in during the day, you are guilty of murder.
EXO.22.5	If you allow any of your animals to stray from your property and graze
EXO.22.6	If you carelessly let a fire spread from your property to someone else's, you must pay the owner for any crops or fields destroyed by the fire.
EXO.22.7	Suppose a neighbor asks you to keep some silver or other valuables, and they are stolen from your house. If the thief is caught, the thief must repay double. 
EXO.22.8	But if the thief isn't caught, some judges
EXO.22.9	Suppose two people claim to own the same ox or donkey or sheep or piece of clothing. Then the judges
EXO.22.10	Suppose a neighbor who is going to be away asks you to keep a donkey or an ox or a sheep or some other animal, and it dies or gets injured or is stolen while no one is looking. 
EXO.22.11	If you swear with me as your witness that you did not harm the animal, you do not have to replace it. Your word is enough. 
EXO.22.12	But if the animal was stolen while in your care, you must replace it. 
EXO.22.13	If the animal was attacked and killed by a wild animal, and you can show the remains of the dead animal to its owner, you do not have to replace it.
EXO.22.14	Suppose you borrow an animal from a neighbor, and it gets injured or dies while the neighbor isn't around. Then you must replace it. 
EXO.22.15	But if something happens to the animal while the owner is present, you do not have to replace it. If you had leased the animal, the money you paid the owner will cover any harm done to it.
EXO.22.17	But if her father refuses to let her marry the man, the bride price must still be paid.
EXO.22.22	Do not mistreat widows or orphans. 
EXO.22.23	If you do, they will beg for my help, and I will come to their rescue. 
EXO.22.24	In fact, I will get so angry that I will kill your men and make widows of their wives and orphans of their children.
EXO.22.26	 Before sunset you must return any coat taken as security for a loan, 
EXO.22.27	because that is the only cover the poor have when they sleep at night. I am a merciful God, and when they call out to me, I will come to help them.
EXO.22.29	Don't fail to give me the offerings of grain and wine that belong to me.
EXO.22.29	Dedicate to me your first-born sons 
EXO.22.30	and the first-born of your cattle and sheep. Let the animals stay with their mothers for seven days, then on the eighth day give them to me, your God.
EXO.23.2	Always tell the truth in court, even if everyone else is
EXO.23.3	 And don't favor the poor, simply because they are poor.
EXO.23.5	If a donkey is overloaded and falls down, you must do what you can to help, even if it belongs to someone who doesn't like you.
EXO.23.7	Don't bring false charges against anyone or sentence an innocent person to death. I won't forgive you if you do.
EXO.23.8	Don't accept bribes. Judges are blinded and justice is twisted by bribes.
EXO.23.11	but let the land rest during the seventh year. The poor are to eat what they want from your fields, vineyards, and olive trees during that year, and when they have all they want from your fields, leave the rest for wild animals.
EXO.23.13	Make certain that you obey everything I have said. Don't pray to other gods or even mention their names.
EXO.23.14	Celebrate three festivals each year in my honor.
EXO.23.17	Your men must come to these three festivals each year to worship me.
EXO.23.18	Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. And make sure that the fat of the animal is burned that same day.
EXO.23.19	Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
EXO.23.20	I am sending an angel to protect you and to lead you into the land I have ready for you. 
EXO.23.21	Carefully obey everything the angel says, because I am giving him complete authority, and he won't tolerate rebellion. 
EXO.23.22	If you faithfully obey him, I will be a fierce enemy of your enemies. 
EXO.23.23	My angel will lead you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out. 
EXO.23.24	Don't worship their gods or follow their customs. Instead, destroy their idols and shatter their stone images.
EXO.23.25	Worship only me, the 
EXO.23.26	Your women will give birth to healthy children, and everyone will live a long life.
EXO.23.27	I will terrify those nations and make your enemies so confused that they will run from you. 
EXO.23.28	I will make the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites panic as you approach. 
EXO.23.29	But I won't do all this in the first year, because the land would become poor, and wild animals would be everywhere. 
EXO.23.30	Instead, I will force out your enemies little by little and give your nation time to grow strong enough to take over the land.
EXO.23.31	I will see that your borders reach from the Red Sea
EXO.23.32	But you must not make any agreements with them or with their gods. 
EXO.23.33	Don't let them stay in your land. They will trap you into sinning against me and worshiping their gods.
EXO.24.1	The 
EXO.24.2	but you are to come near. Don't let anyone else come up.”
EXO.24.3	Moses gave the 
EXO.24.4	Then Moses wrote down what the 
EXO.24.4	The next morning Moses got up early. He built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up a large stone for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
EXO.24.5	He also sent some young men to burn offerings and to sacrifice bulls as special offerings
EXO.24.6	Moses put half of the blood from the animals into bowls and sprinkled the rest on the altar. 
EXO.24.7	Then he read aloud the 
EXO.24.9	Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the 70 leaders, went up the mountain 
EXO.24.10	and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire,
EXO.24.11	Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank.
EXO.24.12	The 
EXO.24.13	Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready, then Moses started up the mountain to meet with God.
EXO.24.14	Moses had told the leaders, “Wait here until we come back. Aaron and Hur will be with you, and they can settle any arguments while we are away.”
EXO.24.15	When Moses went up on Mount Sinai, a cloud covered it, 
EXO.24.16	and the bright glory of the 
EXO.24.17+EXO.24.18	 Moses did so and stayed there 40 days and nights. To the people, the 
EXO.25.1	The 
EXO.25.2	Tell everyone in Israel who wants to give gifts that they must bring them to you. 
EXO.25.3	Here is a list of what you are to collect: Gold, silver, and bronze; 
EXO.25.4	blue, purple, and red wool; fine linen; goat hair; 
EXO.25.5	tanned ram skins; fine leather; acacia wood; 
EXO.25.6	olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices to mix with the incense and with the oil for dedicating the tent and ordaining the priests; 
EXO.25.7	and onyx
EXO.25.8	I also want them to build a special place where I can live among my people. 
EXO.25.9	Make it and its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.
EXO.25.10	Tell the people to build a chest of acacia wood 110 centimeters long, 66 centimeters wide, and 66 centimeters high. 
EXO.25.11	Cover it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the lid. 
EXO.25.12	Make four gold rings and attach one of them to each of the four legs of the chest. 
EXO.25.13	Make two poles of acacia wood. Cover them with gold 
EXO.25.14	and put them through the rings, so the chest can be carried by the poles. 
EXO.25.15	Don't ever remove the poles from the rings. 
EXO.25.16	When I give you the Ten Commandments written on two flat stones, put them inside the chest.
EXO.25.18+EXO.25.19	Then hammer out two winged creatures of pure gold and fasten them to the lid at the ends of the chest. 
EXO.25.20	The creatures must face each other with their wings spread over the chest. 
EXO.25.21	Inside it place the two flat stones with the Ten Commandments on them and put the gold lid on top of the chest. 
EXO.25.22	I will meet you there
EXO.25.23	Make a table of acacia wood 88 centimeters long, 44 centimeters wide, and 66 centimeters high. 
EXO.25.24+EXO.25.25	Cover it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it with a border 75 millimeters thick.
EXO.25.26	Make four gold rings and attach one to each of the legs 
EXO.25.27+EXO.25.28	near the edging. The poles for carrying the table are to be placed through these rings and are to be made of acacia wood covered with gold. 
EXO.25.29+EXO.25.30	 The table is to be kept in the holy place, and the sacred loaves of bread must always be on it. All bowls, plates, jars, and cups for wine offerings are to be made of pure gold and set on this table.
EXO.25.31	Make a lampstand of pure gold. The whole lampstand, including its decorative flowers, must be made from a single piece of hammered gold 
EXO.25.32	with three branches on each of its two sides. 
EXO.25.33	There are to be three decorative almond blossoms on each branch 
EXO.25.34	and four on the stem. 
EXO.25.35	There must also be a blossom where each pair of branches comes out from the stem. 
EXO.25.36	The lampstand, including its branches and decorative flowers, must be made from a single piece of hammered pure gold. 
EXO.25.37	The lamp on the top and those at the end of each of its six branches must be made so as to shine toward the front of the lampstand. 
EXO.25.38	The tongs and trays for taking care of the lamps are to be made of pure gold. 
EXO.25.39	The lampstand and its equipment will require 35 kilograms of pure gold, 
EXO.25.40	 and they must be made according to the pattern I showed you on the mountain.
EXO.26.1	The top of the sacred tent must be made from ten pieces of the finest linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures. 
EXO.26.2	Make each piece twelve meters long and two meters wide 
EXO.26.3	and sew them together into two panels with five sections each. 
EXO.26.4+EXO.26.5+EXO.26.6	Put 50 loops of blue cloth along one of the wider sides of each panel, then fasten the two panels at the loops with 50 gold hooks.
EXO.26.7+EXO.26.8	As the material for protecting the tent, use goat hair to weave eleven sections of cloth 13 meters by 2 meters each. 
EXO.26.9	Sew five of the sections together to make one panel. Then sew the other six together to make a second panel, and fold the sixth section double over the front of the tent. 
EXO.26.10	Put 50 loops along one of the wider sides of each panel 
EXO.26.11	and fasten the two panels at the loops with 50 bronze hooks. 
EXO.26.12+EXO.26.13	The panel of goat hair will be a meter longer than the tent itself, so fold 50 centimeters of the material behind the tent and on each side as a protective covering. 
EXO.26.14	Make two more coverings—one with tanned ram skins and the other with fine leather.
EXO.26.15	Build a framework of acacia wood for the walls of the sacred tent. 
EXO.26.16	Make each frame 4 meters high and 66 centimeters wide 
EXO.26.17	with two wooden pegs near the bottom. 
EXO.26.18+EXO.26.19+EXO.26.20+EXO.26.21	Place two silver stands under each frame with sockets for the pegs, so the frames can be joined together. Put 20 of these frames along the south side and 20 more along the north. 
EXO.26.22	For the back wall along the west side use six frames 
EXO.26.23+EXO.26.24	with two more at the southwest and northwest corners. Make certain that these corner frames are joined from top to bottom. 
EXO.26.25	Altogether, this back wall will have eight frames with two silver stands under each one.
EXO.26.26+EXO.26.27	Make five crossbars for each of the wooden frames, 
EXO.26.28	with the center crossbar running the full length of the wall. 
EXO.26.29	Cover the frames and the crossbars with gold and attach gold rings to the frames to run the crossbars through. 
EXO.26.30	Then set up the tent in the way I showed you on the mountain.
EXO.26.34	Inside the most holy place, put the sacred chest that has the place of mercy on its lid.
EXO.26.35	Outside the most holy place, as you face the curtain, put the table for the sacred bread on the right side and the gold lampstand on the left.
EXO.26.36	For the entrance to the tent, use a piece of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with fancy needlework. 
EXO.26.37	Cover five acacia wood posts with gold and set them each on a bronze stand. Then put gold hooks on the posts and hang the curtain there.
EXO.27.1	Use acacia wood to build an altar 2.25 meters square and 1.34 meters high, 
EXO.27.2	and make each of the four top corners stick up like the horn of a bull. Then cover the whole altar with bronze, including the four horns. 
EXO.27.3	All the equipment for the altar must also be made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the sprinkling bowls, the meat forks, and the fire pans. 
EXO.27.4+EXO.27.5	Halfway up the altar build a ledge around it, and cover the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating. Then attach a bronze ring beneath the ledge at the four corners of the altar. 
EXO.27.6+EXO.27.7	Cover two acacia wood poles with bronze and put them through the rings for carrying the altar. 
EXO.27.8	Construct the altar in the shape of an open box, just as you were shown on the mountain.
EXO.27.9+EXO.27.10+EXO.27.11+EXO.27.12+EXO.27.13+EXO.27.14+EXO.27.15	Surround the sacred tent with a courtyard 44 meters long on the south and north and 22 meters wide on the east and west. Use 20 bronze posts on bronze stands for the south and north and 10 for the west. Then hang a curtain of fine linen on the posts along each of these three sides by using silver hooks and rods.
EXO.27.9+EXO.27.10+EXO.27.11+EXO.27.12+EXO.27.13+EXO.27.14+EXO.27.15	Place three bronze posts on each side of the entrance at the east and hang a curtain 6.67 meters wide on each set of posts. 
EXO.27.16	Use four more of these posts for the entrance way, then hang on them an embroidered curtain of fine linen nine meters long and woven with blue, purple, and red wool.
EXO.27.17+EXO.27.18	Make the curtains that surround the courtyard 2.25 meters high and hang them from the bronze posts with silver hooks and rods. 
EXO.27.19	Make the rest of the equipment for the sacred tent of bronze, including the pegs for the tent and for the curtain surrounding the courtyard.
EXO.27.20	Command the people of Israel to supply you with the purest olive oil. Do this so the lamp will keep burning 
EXO.27.21	in front of the curtain that separates the holy place from the most holy place, where the sacred chest is kept. Aaron and his sons are responsible for keeping the lamp burning every night in the sacred tent. The Israelites must always obey this command.
EXO.28.1	Send for your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. They are the ones I have chosen from Israel to serve as my priests. 
EXO.28.2	Make Aaron some beautiful clothes that are worthy of a high priest. 
EXO.28.3	Aaron is to be dedicated as my high priest, and his clothes must be made only by persons who possess skills that I have given them. 
EXO.28.4	Here are the items that need to be made: a breastpiece, a priestly vest, a robe, an embroidered shirt, a turban, and a sash. These sacred clothes are to be made for your brother Aaron and his sons who will be my priests. 
EXO.28.5	Use only gold and fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool, for making these clothes.
EXO.28.6+EXO.28.7+EXO.28.8	Make the entire priestly vest of fine linen skillfully woven with blue, purple, and red wool, and decorate it with gold. It is to have two shoulder straps to support it and a sash that fastens around the waist.
EXO.28.9+EXO.28.10+EXO.28.11+EXO.28.12	Put two onyx
EXO.28.13+EXO.28.14	Attach two gold settings to the shoulder straps and fasten them with two braided chains of pure gold.
EXO.28.15	From the same costly material make a breastpiece for the high priest to use in finding out what I want my people to do. 
EXO.28.16	It is to be 22 centimeters square and folded double 
EXO.28.17	with four rows of three precious stones: In the first row put a carnelian, a chrysolite, and an emerald; 
EXO.28.18	in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
EXO.28.19	in the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
EXO.28.20	and in the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper.
EXO.28.21	and engrave on each of them the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.
EXO.28.22+EXO.28.23+EXO.28.24+EXO.28.25	Attach two gold rings to the upper front corners of the breastpiece and fasten them with two braided gold chains to gold settings on the shoulder straps. 
EXO.28.26	Attach two other gold rings to the lower inside corners next to the vest 
EXO.28.27	and two more near the bottom of the shoulder straps right above the sash. 
EXO.28.28	Then take a blue cord and tie the two lower rings on the breastpiece to those on the vest. This will keep the breastpiece in place.
EXO.28.29	In this way Aaron will have the names of the twelve tribes of Israel written on his heart each time he enters the holy place, and I will never forget my people. 
EXO.28.30	 He must also wear on his breastpiece the two small objects
EXO.28.31	Under his vest Aaron must wear a robe of blue wool 
EXO.28.32	with an opening in the center for his head. Be sure to bind the material around the collar to keep it from wearing out. 
EXO.28.33+EXO.28.34	 Along the hem of the robe weave pomegranates
EXO.28.35	If Aaron wears these clothes when he enters the holy place as my high priest, the sound of the bells will be heard, and his life will not be in danger.
EXO.28.36	On a narrow strip of pure gold engrave the words: “Dedicated to the 
EXO.28.37	Fasten it to the front of Aaron's turban with a blue cord, 
EXO.28.38	so he can wear it on his forehead. This will show that he will take on himself the guilt for any sins the people of Israel commit in offering their gifts to me, and I will forgive them.
EXO.28.39	Make Aaron's robe and turban of fine linen and decorate his sash with fancy needlework.
EXO.28.40	Since Aaron's sons are priests, they should also look dignified. So make robes, sashes, and special caps for them. 
EXO.28.41	Then dress Aaron and his sons in these clothes, pour olive oil on their heads, and ordain them as my priests.
EXO.28.42	Make linen shorts for them that reach from the waist down to the thigh, so they won't expose themselves. 
EXO.28.43	Whenever they enter the sacred tent or serve at the altar or enter the holy place, they must wear these shorts, or else they will be guilty and die. This same rule applies to any of their descendants who serve as priests.
EXO.29.1	When you ordain Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests, choose a young bull and two rams that have nothing wrong with them. 
EXO.29.2	Then from your finest flour make three batches of dough without yeast. Shape some of it into larger loaves, some into smaller loaves mixed with olive oil, and the rest into thin wafers brushed with oil. 
EXO.29.3	Put all of this bread in a basket and bring it when you come to sacrifice the three animals to me.
EXO.29.4	Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the sacred tent and tell them to wash themselves. 
EXO.29.5	Dress Aaron in the priestly shirt, the robe that goes under the sacred vest, the vest itself, the breastpiece, and the sash. 
EXO.29.6	Put on his turban with its narrow strip of engraved gold 
EXO.29.7	and then ordain him by pouring olive oil on his head.
EXO.29.8	Next, dress Aaron's sons in their special shirts, 
EXO.29.9	caps, and sashes,
EXO.29.10	Lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, where Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head. 
EXO.29.11	Kill the bull near my altar in front of the tent. 
EXO.29.12	Use a finger to smear some of its blood on each of the four corners of the altar and pour out the rest of the blood on the ground next to the altar. 
EXO.29.13	Then take the fat from the animal's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and send them up as an offering to me in the smoke from the altar. 
EXO.29.14	But the meat, the skin, and the food still in the bull's stomach must be burned outside the camp as an offering to ask forgiveness for the sins of the priests.
EXO.29.15	Bring one of the rams to Aaron and his sons and tell them to lay their hands on its head. 
EXO.29.16	Kill the ram and splatter its blood against all four sides of the altar. 
EXO.29.17	Cut up the ram, wash its insides and legs, and lay all of its parts on the altar, including the head. 
EXO.29.18	 Then make sure that the whole animal goes up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
EXO.29.19	Bring the other ram to Aaron and his sons and tell them to lay their hands on its head. 
EXO.29.20	Kill the ram and place some of its blood on Aaron's right ear lobe, his right thumb, and the big toe of his right foot. Do the same for each of his sons and splatter the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar. 
EXO.29.21	Then take some of the blood from the altar, mix it with the oil used for ordination, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes, and also on his sons and their clothes. This will show that they and their clothes have been dedicated to me.
EXO.29.22	This ram is part of the ordination service. So remove its right hind leg,
EXO.29.23	Take one loaf of each kind of bread
EXO.29.24	and put this bread, together with the meat, into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they will lift it all up
EXO.29.25	After this, put the meat and bread on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
EXO.29.26	You may eat the choice ribs from this second ram, but you must first lift them up
EXO.29.27+EXO.29.28	In the future, when anyone from Israel offers the ribs and a hind leg of a ram either to ordain a priest or to ask for my blessing, the meat belongs to me, but it may be eaten by the priests. This law will never change.
EXO.29.29+EXO.29.30	After Aaron's death, his priestly clothes are to be handed down to each descendant who succeeds him as high priest, and these clothes must be worn during the seven-day ceremony of ordination.
EXO.29.31	Boil the meat of the ordination ram in a sacred place, 
EXO.29.32	then Aaron and his sons are to eat it together with the three kinds of bread
EXO.29.33	At their ordination, a ceremony of forgiveness was performed for them with this sacred food, and only they have the right to eat it. 
EXO.29.34	If any of the sacred food is left until morning, it must be completely burned.
EXO.29.35	Repeat this ordination ceremony for Aaron and his sons seven days in a row, just as I have instructed you. 
EXO.29.36	Each day you must offer a bull as a sacrifice for sin and as a way of purifying the altar. In addition, you must smear the altar with olive oil to make it completely holy. 
EXO.29.37	Do this for seven days, and the altar will become so holy that anyone who touches it will become holy.
EXO.29.38	Each day you must sacrifice two lambs a year old, 
EXO.29.39	one in the morning and one in the evening. 
EXO.29.40+EXO.29.41	With each lamb offer one kilogram of your finest flour mixed with a liter of pure olive oil, and also pour out a liter of wine as an offering. The smell of this sacrifice on the fires of the altar will be pleasing to me. 
EXO.29.42+EXO.29.43	You and your descendants must always offer this sacrifice on the altar at the entrance to the sacred tent.
EXO.29.42+EXO.29.43	People of Israel, I will meet and speak with you there, and my shining glory will make the place holy. 
EXO.29.44	Because of who I am, the tent will become sacred, and Aaron and his sons will become worthy to serve as my priests. 
EXO.29.45	I will live among you as your God, 
EXO.29.46	and you will know that I am the 
EXO.30.1	Build an altar of acacia wood where you can burn incense. 
EXO.30.2	Make it 45 centimeters square and 90 centimeters high, and make each of its four corners stick up like the horn of a bull. 
EXO.30.3	Cover it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it. 
EXO.30.4	Then below the edging on opposite sides attach two gold rings through which you can put the poles for carrying the altar. 
EXO.30.5	These poles are also to be made of acacia wood covered with gold.
EXO.30.6	Put the altar in front of the inside curtain of the sacred tent. The chest with the place of mercy
EXO.30.7+EXO.30.8	From now on, when Aaron takes care of the lamps each morning and evening, he must burn sweet-smelling incense to me on the altar. 
EXO.30.9	Burn only the proper incense on the altar and never use it for grain sacrifices or animal sacrifices or drink offerings. 
EXO.30.10	 Once a year Aaron must purify the altar by smearing on its four corners
EXO.30.11	The 
EXO.30.12	Find out how many grown men there are in Israel and require each of them to pay me to keep him safe from danger while you are counting them. 
EXO.30.13+EXO.30.14+EXO.30.15	 Each man over 19, whether rich or poor, must pay me the same amount of money, weighed according to the official standards. 
EXO.30.16	This money is to be used for the upkeep of the sacred tent, and because of it, I will never forget my people.
EXO.30.17	The 
EXO.30.23+EXO.30.24+EXO.30.25	Mix four liters of olive oil with the following costly spices: six kilograms of myrrh, three kilograms of cinnamon, three kilograms of cane, and six kilograms of cassia. Measure these according to the official standards. Then use this sacred mixture 
EXO.30.26	for dedicating the tent and chest, 
EXO.30.27	the table with its equipment, the lampstand with its equipment, the incense altar with all its utensils, 
EXO.30.28	the altar for sacrifices, and the large bowl with its stand. 
EXO.30.29	By dedicating them in this way, you will make them so holy that anyone who even touches them will become holy.
EXO.30.30	When you ordain Aaron and his sons as my priests, sprinkle them with some of this oil, 
EXO.30.31	and say to the people of Israel: “This oil must always be used in the ordination service of a priest. It is holy because it is dedicated to the 
EXO.30.32	So treat it as holy! Don't ever use it for everyday purposes or mix any for yourselves. 
EXO.30.33	If you do, you will no longer belong to the 
EXO.30.34+EXO.30.35	Mix equal amounts of the costly spices stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense, then add salt to make the mixture pure and holy. 
EXO.30.36	Pound some of it into powder and sprinkle it in front of the sacred chest, where I meet with you. Be sure to treat this incense as something very holy. 
EXO.30.37	It is truly holy because it is dedicated to me, so don't ever make any for yourselves. 
EXO.30.38	If you ever make any of it to use as perfume, you will no longer belong to my people.
EXO.31.1	The 
EXO.31.2	I have chosen Bezalel
EXO.31.3+EXO.31.4+EXO.31.5	Not only have I filled him with my Spirit, but I have given him wisdom and made him a skilled craftsman who can create objects of art with gold, silver, bronze, precious stones, and wood. 
EXO.31.6	I have appointed Oholiab
EXO.31.7+EXO.31.8+EXO.31.9+EXO.31.10+EXO.31.11	the sacred tent with its furnishings, the sacred chest with its place of mercy, the table with all that is on it, the lamp with its equipment, the incense altar, the altar for sacrifices with its equipment, the bronze bowl with its stand, the beautiful priestly clothes for Aaron and his sons, the oil for dedication and ordination services, and the sweet-smelling incense for the holy place.
EXO.31.12+EXO.31.13	Moses told the Israelites that the 
EXO.31.12+EXO.31.13	The Sabbath belongs to me. Now I command you and your descendants to always obey the laws of the Sabbath. By doing this, you will know that I have chosen you as my own. 
EXO.31.14+EXO.31.15	 Keep the Sabbath holy. You have six days to do your work, but the Sabbath is mine, and it must remain a day of rest. If you work on the Sabbath, you will no longer be part of my people, and you will be put to death.
EXO.31.16	Every generation of Israelites must respect the Sabbath. 
EXO.31.17	 This day will always serve as a reminder, both to me and to the Israelites, that I made the heavens and the earth in six days, then on the seventh day I rested and relaxed.
EXO.31.18	When God had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two flat stones on which he had written all his laws with his own hand.
EXO.32.2	Aaron told them, “Bring me the gold earrings that your wives and sons and daughters are wearing.” 
EXO.32.3	Everybody took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron, 
EXO.32.4	 then he melted them and made an idol in the shape of a young bull.
EXO.32.4	All the people said to one another, “This is the god who brought us out of Egypt!”
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw what was happening, he built an altar in front of the idol and said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate in honor of the 
EXO.32.6	 The people got up early the next morning and killed some animals to be used for sacrifices and others to be eaten. Then everyone ate and drank so much that they began to carry on like wild people.
EXO.32.7	The 
EXO.32.7	Hurry back down! Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools. 
EXO.32.8	They have already stopped obeying me and have made themselves an idol in the shape of a young bull. They have bowed down to it, offered sacrifices, and said that it is the god who brought them out of Egypt. 
EXO.32.9	Moses, I have seen how stubborn these people are, 
EXO.32.10	and I'm angry enough to destroy them, so don't try to stop me. But I will make your descendants into a great nation.
EXO.32.11	Our 
EXO.32.12	If you do, the Egyptians will say that you brought your people out here into the mountains just to get rid of them. Please don't be angry with your people. Don't destroy them!
EXO.32.14	So even though the 
EXO.32.15+EXO.32.16	Moses went back down the mountain with the two flat stones on which God had written all of his laws with his own hand, using both sides of the stones.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the noisy shouts of the people, he said to Moses, “A battle must be going on down in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	But Moses replied, “It doesn't sound like they are shouting because they have won or lost a battle. It sounds more like a wild party!”
EXO.32.19	As Moses got closer to the camp, he saw the idol, and he also saw the people dancing around. This made him so angry that he threw down the stones and broke them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	He melted the idol the people had made, and he ground it into powder. He scattered it in their water and made them drink it. 
EXO.32.21	Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to harm you? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way?”
EXO.32.22	Aaron answered:
EXO.32.22	Don't be angry with me. You know as well as I do that they are determined to do evil. 
EXO.32.23	They even told me, “That man Moses led us out of Egypt, but now we don't know what has happened to him. Make us a god to lead us.” 
EXO.32.24	Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings. They took them off and gave them to me. I threw the gold into a fire, and out came this bull.
EXO.32.25	Moses knew that the people were out of control and that it was Aaron's fault. And now they had made fools of themselves in front of their enemies. 
EXO.32.26	So Moses stood at the gate of the camp and shouted, “Everyone who is on the 
EXO.32.26	Then the men of the Levi tribe gathered around Moses, 
EXO.32.27	and he said to them, “The 
EXO.32.28	The men of the Levi tribe followed his orders, and that day they killed about 3,000 men. 
EXO.32.29	Moses said to them, “You obeyed the 
EXO.32.30	The next day Moses told the people, “This is a terrible thing you have done. But I will go back to the 
EXO.32.31	Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	 But I beg you to forgive them. If you don't, please wipe my name out of your book.”
EXO.32.33	The 
EXO.32.34	Now take my people to the place I told you about, and my angel will lead you. But when the time comes, I will punish them for this sin.”
EXO.32.35	So the 
EXO.33.1	You led the people of Israel out of Egypt. Now get ready to lead them to the land I promised their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.33.2+EXO.33.3	It is a land rich with milk and honey, and I will send an angel to force out those people who live there—the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I will not go with my people. They are so rebellious that I would destroy them before they get there.
EXO.33.4+EXO.33.5	Even before the 
EXO.33.6	and after leaving Mount Sinai,
EXO.33.7	Moses used to set up a tent far from camp. He called it the “meeting tent,” and whoever needed some message from the 
EXO.33.8	Each time Moses went out to this tent, everyone would stand at the entrance to their own tents and watch him enter. 
EXO.33.9+EXO.33.10+EXO.33.11	Then they would bow down because a thick cloud would come down in front of the tent, and the 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	If this is true, let me know what your plans are, then I can obey and continue to please you. And don't forget that you have chosen this nation to be your own.”
EXO.33.14	The 
EXO.33.15	Then Moses replied, “If you aren't going with us, please don't make us leave this place. 
EXO.33.16	But if you do go with us, everyone will know that you are pleased with your people and with me. That way, we will be different from the rest of the people on earth.”
EXO.33.17	So the 
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “I pray that you will let me see you in all of your glory.”
EXO.33.19	All right. I am the 
EXO.33.20	but I won't let you see my face, because anyone who sees my face will die. 
EXO.33.21	There is a rock not far from me. Stand beside it, 
EXO.33.22	and before I pass by in all of my shining glory, I will put you in a large crack in the rock. I will cover your eyes with my hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back. You will not see my face.
EXO.34.1	One day the 
EXO.34.2	Be ready tomorrow morning to come up Mount Sinai and meet me at the top. 
EXO.34.3	No one is to come with you or to be on the mountain at all. Don't even let the sheep and cattle graze at the foot of the mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two flat stones like the first ones, and early the next morning he carried them to the top of Mount Sinai, just as the 
EXO.34.5	The 
EXO.34.6	 Then he passed in front of Moses and called out, “I am the 
EXO.34.7	I keep my promises to my people forever, but I also punish anyone who sins. When people sin, I punish them and their children, and also their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.”
EXO.34.8	Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshiped the 
EXO.34.9	He prayed, “
EXO.34.10	The 
EXO.34.10	I promise to perform miracles for you that have never been seen anywhere on earth. Neighboring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvelous things. 
EXO.34.11	I will force out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, but you must do what I command you today. 
EXO.34.12	Don't make treaties with any of those people. If you do, it will be like falling into a trap. 
EXO.34.13	 Instead, you must destroy their altars and tear down the sacred poles
EXO.34.14	I demand your complete loyalty—you must not worship any other god! 
EXO.34.15	Don't make treaties with the people there, or you will soon find yourselves worshiping their gods and taking part in their sacrificial meals. 
EXO.34.16	Your men will even marry their women and be influenced to worship their gods.
EXO.34.20	Bring an offering every time you come to worship.
EXO.34.22	 Celebrate the Harvest Festival
EXO.34.23	Your men must come to worship me three times a year, because I am the 
EXO.34.24	As you advance, I will force the nations out of your land and enlarge your borders. Then no one will try to take your property when you come to worship me these three times each year.
EXO.34.26	Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
EXO.34.27	The 
EXO.34.28	Moses stayed on the mountain with the 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and the others looked at Moses, they saw this, and they were afraid to go near him. 
EXO.34.31	Moses called out for Aaron and the leaders to come to him, and he spoke with them. 
EXO.34.32	Then the rest of the people of Israel gathered around Moses, and he gave them the laws that the 
EXO.34.33	The face of Moses kept shining, and after he had spoken with the people, he covered his face with a veil. 
EXO.34.34	Moses would always remove the veil when he went into the sacred tent to speak with the 
EXO.34.35	They could see that his face was still shining. So after he had spoken with them, he would put the veil back on and leave it on until the next time he went to speak with the 
EXO.35.1	Moses called together the people of Israel and told them that the 
EXO.35.3	Don't even build a cooking fire at home on the Sabbath.
EXO.35.4	Moses told the people of Israel that the 
EXO.35.5	I will welcome an offering from anyone who wants to give something. You may bring gold, silver, or bronze; 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, or red wool; fine linen; goat hair; 
EXO.35.7	tanned ram skin or fine leather; acacia wood; 
EXO.35.8	olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices for the oil of dedication and for the incense; or 
EXO.35.9	onyx
EXO.35.10	If you have any skills, you should use them to help make what I have commanded: 
EXO.35.11	the sacred tent with its covering and hooks, its framework and crossbars, and its post and stands; 
EXO.35.12	the sacred chest with its carrying poles, its place of mercy, and the curtain in front of it;

EXO.35.20	Moses finished speaking, and everyone left. 
EXO.35.21	Then those who wanted to bring gifts to the 
EXO.35.22	Men and women came willingly and gave all kinds of gold jewelry such as pins, earrings, rings, and necklaces. 
EXO.35.23	Everyone brought their blue, purple, and red wool, their fine linen, and their cloth made of goat hair, as well as their ram skins dyed red and their fine leather. 
EXO.35.24	Anyone who had silver or bronze or acacia wood brought it as a gift to the 
EXO.35.25	The women who were good at weaving cloth brought the blue, purple, and red wool and the fine linen they had made. 
EXO.35.26	And the women who knew how to make cloth from goat hair were glad to do so.
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought different kinds of jewels to be sewn on the special clothes and the breastpiece for the high priest. 
EXO.35.28	They also brought sweet-smelling spices to be mixed with the incense and olive oil that were for the lamps and for ordaining the priests. 
EXO.35.29	Moses had told the people what the 
EXO.35.30	Moses said to the people of Israel:
EXO.35.30	The

EXO.35.34	The 
EXO.35.35	And he has given them all kinds of artistic skills, including the ability to design and embroider with blue, purple, and red wool and to weave fine linen.
EXO.36.1	The 
EXO.36.2	Then Moses brought together these workers who were eager to work, 
EXO.36.3	and he gave them the gifts that the people of Israel had donated for building the place of worship. In fact, so much was being given each morning, 
EXO.36.4	that finally everyone stopped working 
EXO.36.5	and said, “Moses, there is already more than we need for what the 
EXO.36.6	So Moses sent word for the people to stop giving, and they did. 
EXO.36.7	But there was already more than enough to do what needed to be done.
EXO.36.8+EXO.36.9	The skilled workers got together to make the sacred tent and its linen curtains that were woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures. Each of the ten panels was twelve meters long and two meters wide, 
EXO.36.10	and they were sewn together to make two curtains with five panels each. 
EXO.36.11+EXO.36.12+EXO.36.13	Then 50 loops of blue cloth were put along one of the wider sides of each curtain, and the two curtains were fastened together at the loops with 50 gold hooks.
EXO.36.14+EXO.36.15	As the material for protecting the tent, goat hair was used to weave eleven sections 13 meters by 2 meters each. 
EXO.36.16	These eleven sections were joined to make two panels, one with five and the other with six sections. 
EXO.36.17	Fifty loops were put along one of the wider sides of each panel, 
EXO.36.18	and the two panels were fastened at the loops with 50 bronze hooks. 
EXO.36.19	Two other coverings were made—one with fine leather and the other with ram skins dyed red.
EXO.36.20	Acacia wood was used to build the framework for the walls of the sacred tent. 
EXO.36.21	Each frame was 4 meters high and 66 centimeters wide 
EXO.36.22+EXO.36.23+EXO.36.24+EXO.36.25+EXO.36.26	with two wooden pegs near the bottom. Then two silver stands were placed under each frame with sockets for the pegs, so they could be joined together. Twenty of these frames were used along the south side and 20 more along the north. 
EXO.36.27	Six frames were used for the back wall along the west side 
EXO.36.28+EXO.36.29	with two more at the southwest and northwest corners. These corner frames were joined from top to bottom. 
EXO.36.30	Altogether, along the back wall there were eight frames with two silver stands under each of them.
EXO.36.31+EXO.36.32+EXO.36.33	Five crossbars were made for each of the wooden frames, with the center crossbar running the full length of the wall. 
EXO.36.34	The frames and crossbars were covered with gold, and gold rings were attached to the frames to run the crossbars through.

EXO.36.36	They also made four acacia wood posts and covered them with gold. Then gold rings were fastened to the posts, which were set on silver stands.
EXO.36.37	For the entrance to the tent, they used a curtain of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with fancy needlework.

EXO.37.2	He covered it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the top. 
EXO.37.3	He made four gold rings and attached one of them to each of the four legs of the chest. 
EXO.37.4	Then he made two poles of acacia wood, covered them with gold, 
EXO.37.5	and put them through the rings, so the chest could be carried by the poles.
EXO.37.6	The entire lid of the chest, which was made of pure gold, was the place of mercy.
EXO.37.7+EXO.37.8+EXO.37.9	On each of the two ends of the chest he made a winged creature of hammered gold. They faced each other, and their wings covered the place of mercy.
EXO.37.10	Bezalel built a table of acacia wood 88 centimeters long, 44 centimeters wide, and 66 centimeters high. 
EXO.37.11+EXO.37.12	He covered it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it with a border 75 millimeters thick.
EXO.37.13	He made four gold rings and attached one to each of the legs 
EXO.37.14	near the edging. The poles for carrying the table were placed through these rings 
EXO.37.15	and were made of acacia wood covered with gold. 
EXO.37.16	Everything that was to be set on the table was made of pure gold—the bowls, plates, jars, and cups for wine offerings.
EXO.37.17	Bezalel made a lampstand of pure gold. The whole lampstand, including its decorative flowers, was made from a single piece of hammered gold, 
EXO.37.18	with three branches on each of its two sides. 
EXO.37.19	There were three decorative almond blossoms on each branch 
EXO.37.20	and four on the stem.

EXO.37.25	For burning incense, Bezalel made an altar of acacia wood. It was 45 centimeters square and 90 centimeters high with each of its four corners sticking up like the horn of a bull. 
EXO.37.26	He covered it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it. 
EXO.37.27	Then below the edging on opposite sides he attached two gold rings through which he put the poles for carrying the altar. 
EXO.37.28	These poles were also made of acacia wood and covered with gold.
EXO.38.1	Bezalel built an altar of acacia wood for offering sacrifices. It was 2.25 meters square and 1.34 meters high 
EXO.38.2	with each of its four corners sticking up like the horn of a bull, and it was completely covered with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	The equipment for the altar was also made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the bowls, the meat forks, and the fire pans. 
EXO.38.4	About halfway up the altar he built a ledge around it and covered the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating. 
EXO.38.5	Then he attached a bronze ring beneath the ledge at the four corners to put the poles through. 
EXO.38.6	He covered two acacia wood poles with bronze and 
EXO.38.7	put them through the rings for carrying the altar, which was shaped like an open box.
EXO.38.9+EXO.38.10+EXO.38.11+EXO.38.12+EXO.38.13+EXO.38.14+EXO.38.15+EXO.38.16+EXO.38.17	Around the sacred tent Bezalel built a courtyard 44 meters long on the south and north and 22 meters wide on the east and west. He used 20 bronze posts on bronze stands for the south and north and 10 for the west. Then he hung a curtain of fine linen on the posts along each of these three sides by using silver hooks and rods. He placed three bronze posts on each side of the entrance at the east and hung a curtain 6.67 meters wide on each set of posts.
EXO.38.18+EXO.38.19	For the entrance to the courtyard, Bezalel made a curtain nine meters long, which he hung on four bronze posts that were set on bronze stands. This curtain was 2.25 meters high, the same height as the one for the rest of the courtyard, and was made of fine linen embroidered and woven with blue, purple, and red wool. He hung the curtain on the four posts, using silver hooks and rods. 
EXO.38.20	The pegs for the tent and for the curtain around the tent were made of bronze.
EXO.38.21+EXO.38.22+EXO.38.23	Bezalel had worked closely with Oholiab,
EXO.38.21+EXO.38.22+EXO.38.23	Moses put Aaron's son Ithamar in charge of the Levites who kept record of the metals used for the sacred tent. 
EXO.38.24	According to the official weights, the amount of gold given was a ton, 
EXO.38.25	 and the silver that was collected when the people were counted
EXO.38.26	 Everyone who was counted paid the required amount, and there was a total of 603,550 men who were 20 years old or older.
EXO.38.27	Thirty-four kilograms of the silver were used to make each of the 100 stands for the sacred tent and the curtain. 
EXO.38.28	The remaining 30 kilograms of silver were used for the hooks and rods and for covering the tops of the posts.
EXO.38.29	Two thousand four hundred and twenty-five kilograms of bronze were given. 
EXO.38.30	And it was used to make the stands for the entrance to the tent, the altar and its grating, the equipment for the altar, 
EXO.38.31	the stands for the posts that surrounded the courtyard, including those at the entrance to the courtyard, and the pegs for the tent and the courtyard.
EXO.39.1	Beautiful priestly clothes were made of blue, purple, and red wool for Aaron to wear when he performed his duties in the holy place. This was done exactly as the 
EXO.39.2+EXO.39.3	The entire priestly vest was made of fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool. Thin sheets of gold were hammered out and cut into threads that were skillfully woven into the vest. 
EXO.39.4+EXO.39.5	It had two shoulder straps to support it and a sash that fastened around the waist. 
EXO.39.6	Onyx
EXO.39.7	Then these were attached to the shoulder straps of the vest, so the 
EXO.39.8	The breastpiece was made with the same materials and designs as the priestly vest. 
EXO.39.9	It was 22 centimeters square and folded double 
EXO.39.10	with four rows of three precious stones: A carnelian, a chrysolite, and an emerald were in the first row; 
EXO.39.11	a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond were in the second row; 
EXO.39.12	a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst were in the third row;

EXO.39.19	Two other gold rings were attached to the lower inside corners next to the vest, 
EXO.39.20	and two more near the bottom of the shoulder straps right above the sash. 
EXO.39.21	To keep the breastpiece in place, a blue cord was used to tie the two lower rings on the breastpiece to those on the vest. These things were done exactly as the 
EXO.39.22	The priestly robe was made of blue wool 
EXO.39.23	with an opening in the center for the head. The material around the collar was bound so as to keep it from wearing out. 
EXO.39.24+EXO.39.25+EXO.39.26	Along the hem of the robe were woven pomegranates
EXO.39.27+EXO.39.28+EXO.39.29	Everything that Aaron and his sons wore was made of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool, including their robes and turbans, their fancy caps and underwear, and even their sashes that were embroidered with needlework.

EXO.40.1	The 
EXO.40.2	Set up my tent on the first day of the year
EXO.40.3	and put the chest with the Ten Commandments behind the inside curtain.
EXO.40.4	Bring in the table and set on it those things that are made for it. Also bring in the lampstand and attach the lamps to it. 
EXO.40.5	Then place the gold altar of incense in front of the sacred chest and hang a curtain at the entrance to the tent. 
EXO.40.6	Set the altar for burning sacrifices in front of the entrance to my tent. 
EXO.40.7	Put the large bronze bowl between the tent and the altar and fill the bowl with water. 
EXO.40.8	Surround the tent and the altar with the wall of curtains and hang the curtain that was made for the entrance.
EXO.40.9	Use the sacred olive oil to dedicate to me the tent and everything in it.

EXO.40.11	and with the bowl and its stand. 
EXO.40.12	Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent and tell them to wash themselves. 
EXO.40.13	Dress Aaron in the priestly clothes, then use the sacred olive oil to ordain him and dedicate him to me as my priest. 
EXO.40.14	Put the priestly robes on Aaron's sons 
EXO.40.15	and ordain them in the same way, so they and their descendants will always be my priests.
EXO.40.16	Moses followed the 
EXO.40.17	And on the first day of the first month
EXO.40.18	The posts, stands, and framework were put in place, 
EXO.40.19	then the two layers of coverings were hung over them. 
EXO.40.20	The stones with the Ten Commandments written on them were stored in the sacred chest, the place of mercy
EXO.40.21	The chest was brought into the tent and set behind the curtain in the most holy place. These things were done exactly as the 
EXO.40.22	The table for the sacred bread was put along the north wall of the holy place, 
EXO.40.23	after which the bread was set on the table. 
EXO.40.24	The lampstand was put along the south wall, 
EXO.40.25	then the lamps were attached to it there in the presence of the 
EXO.40.26	The gold incense altar was set up in front of the curtain, 
EXO.40.27	and sweet-smelling incense was burned on it. These things were done exactly as the 
EXO.40.28	The curtain was hung at the entrance to the sacred tent. 
EXO.40.29	Then the altar for offering sacrifices was put in front of the tent, and animal sacrifices and gifts of grain were offered there. 
EXO.40.30	The large bronze bowl was placed between the altar and the entrance to the tent. It was filled with water, 
EXO.40.31	then Moses and Aaron, together with Aaron's sons, washed their hands and feet. 
EXO.40.32	In fact, they washed each time before entering the tent or offering sacrifices at the altar. These things were done exactly as the 
EXO.40.33	Finally, Moses had the curtains hung around the courtyard and at the entrance.
EXO.40.35	And so, Moses could not enter the tent. 
EXO.40.36	Whenever the cloud moved from the tent, the people would break camp and follow; 
EXO.40.37	then they would set up camp and stay there, until it moved again. 
EXO.40.38	No matter where the people traveled, the 
LEV.1.1+LEV.1.2+LEV.1.3	The 
LEV.1.1+LEV.1.2+LEV.1.3	Sacrifices to please me
LEV.1.1+LEV.1.2+LEV.1.3	Bulls or rams or goats
LEV.1.4	Lay your hand on its head, and I will accept the animal as a sacrifice for taking away your sins.
LEV.1.5	After the bull is killed in my presence, some priests from Aaron's family will offer its blood to me by splattering it against the four sides of the altar.
LEV.1.6	Skin the bull and cut it up, 
LEV.1.7	while the priests pile wood on the altar fire to make it start blazing. 
LEV.1.8+LEV.1.9	Wash the bull's insides and hind legs, so the priests can lay them on the altar with the head, the fat, and the rest of the animal. A priest will then send all of it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
LEV.1.10	If you sacrifice a ram or a goat, it must not have anything wrong with it. 
LEV.1.11	Lead the animal to the north side of the altar, where it is to be killed in my presence. Then some of the priests will splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
LEV.1.12+LEV.1.13	Cut up the animal and wash its insides and hind legs. A priest will put these parts on the altar with the head, the fat, and the rest of the animal. Then he will send all of it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
LEV.1.14	If you offer a bird for this kind of sacrifice, it must be a dove or a pigeon. 
LEV.1.15	A priest will take the bird to the bronze altar, where he will wring its neck and put its head on the fire. Then he will drain out its blood on one side of the altar, 
LEV.1.16	remove the bird's craw with what is in it,
LEV.1.17	Finally, he will take the bird by its wings, tear it partially open,
LEV.2.1	When you offer sacrifices to give thanks to me,
LEV.2.2	and take it to the priests from Aaron's family. One of them will scoop up the incense together with a handful of the flour and oil. Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay this part on the bronze altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me. 
LEV.2.3	The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
LEV.2.4	If you bake bread in an oven for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour, but without any yeast. You may make the flour into a loaf mixed with olive oil, or you may make it into thin wafers and brush them with oil.
LEV.2.5	If you cook bread in a shallow pan for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour. Mix it with olive oil, but do not use any yeast. 
LEV.2.6	Then break the bread into small pieces and sprinkle them with oil. 
LEV.2.7	If you cook your bread in a pan with a lid on it, you must also use the finest flour mixed with oil.
LEV.2.8	You may prepare sacrifices to give thanks in any of these three ways. Bring your sacrifice to a priest, and he will take it to the bronze altar. 
LEV.2.9	Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay part of it on the altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me. 
LEV.2.10	The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
LEV.2.11	Yeast and honey must never be burned on the altar, so don't ever mix either of these in a grain sacrifice. 
LEV.2.12	You may offer either of them separately,
LEV.2.13	Salt is offered when you make an agreement with me, so sprinkle salt on these sacrifices.
LEV.2.14	Freshly cut grain, either roasted or coarsely ground,
LEV.2.15	You must mix in some olive oil and put incense on top, because this is a grain sacrifice. 
LEV.2.16	A priest will sprinkle all of the incense and some of the grain and oil on the altar and send them up in smoke to show that the whole offering belongs to me.
LEV.3.1	When you offer sacrifices to ask my blessing,
LEV.3.2	Lead it to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay your hand on its head, and have it killed there. A priest from Aaron's family will splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
LEV.3.3	Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides, 
LEV.3.4	as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat. 
LEV.3.5	Some of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me, together with the sacrifice that is offered to please me.
LEV.3.6	Instead of a bull or a cow, you may offer any sheep or goat that has nothing wrong with it. 
LEV.3.7	If you offer a sheep, you must present it to me at the entrance to the sacred tent. 
LEV.3.8	Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
LEV.3.9	Offer the fat on the tail, the tailbone, and the insides, 
LEV.3.10	as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat. 
LEV.3.11	One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering for me.
LEV.3.12	If you offer a goat, you must also present it to me 
LEV.3.13	at the entrance to the sacred tent. Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
LEV.3.14	Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides, 
LEV.3.15	as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat. 
LEV.3.16	One of the priests will put these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering with a smell that pleases me.
LEV.3.16	All fat belongs to me. 
LEV.3.17	So you and your descendants must never eat any fat or any blood, not even in the privacy of your own homes.
LEV.4.1	The 
LEV.4.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.4.2	Offer a sacrifice to ask forgiveness when you sin by accidentally doing something I have told you not to do.
LEV.4.3	When the high priest sins, he makes everyone else guilty too. And so, he must sacrifice a young bull that has nothing wrong with it. 
LEV.4.4	The priest will lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay his hand on its head, and kill it there. 
LEV.4.5	He will take a bowl of the blood inside the tent, 
LEV.4.6	dip a finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred chest behind the curtain. 
LEV.4.7	Then, in my presence, he will smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the bronze altar
LEV.4.8+LEV.4.9+LEV.4.10	The priest will remove the fat from the bull, just as he does when he sacrifices a bull to ask my blessing.
LEV.4.11+LEV.4.12	The skin and flesh of the bull, together with its legs, insides, and the food still in its stomach, are to be taken outside the camp and burned on a wood fire near the ash heap.
LEV.4.13	When the nation of Israel disobeys me without meaning to, the whole nation is still guilty. 
LEV.4.14	Once you realize what has happened, you must sacrifice a young bull to ask my forgiveness. Lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, 
LEV.4.15	where your tribal leaders will lay their hands on its head, before having it killed in my presence.
LEV.4.16	The priest will take a bowl of the animal's blood inside the sacred tent, 
LEV.4.17	dip a finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred chest behind the curtain. 
LEV.4.18	Then, in my presence, he must smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the bronze altar
LEV.4.19+LEV.4.20+LEV.4.21	After this, the priest will remove the fat from the bull and send it up in smoke on the altar. Finally, he will burn its remains outside the camp, just as he did with the other bull. By this sacrifice the sin of the whole nation will be forgiven.
LEV.4.22	Any tribal leader who disobeys me without knowing it is still guilty. 
LEV.4.23	As soon as the leader realizes what has happened, he must sacrifice a goat
LEV.4.24	This is a sacrifice for sin. So he will lay his hand on the animal's head, before having it killed in my presence at the north side of the bronze altar. 
LEV.4.25	The priest will dip a finger in the blood, smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar, and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar. 
LEV.4.26	Then he must send all of the fat up in smoke, just as he does when a sacrifice is offered to ask my blessing.
LEV.4.28	As soon as you realize what you have done, you must sacrifice a female goat that has nothing wrong with it. 
LEV.4.29	Lead the goat to the north side of the bronze altar and lay your hand on its head, before having it killed. 
LEV.4.30	Then a priest will dip a finger in the blood; he will smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar. 
LEV.4.31	After this, the priest will remove all of the fat, just as he does when an animal is sacrificed to ask my blessing.
LEV.4.32	If you offer a lamb instead of a goat as a sacrifice for sin, it must be a female that has nothing wrong with it. 
LEV.4.33	Lead the lamb to the altar and lay your hand on its head, before having it killed. 
LEV.4.34	The priest will dip a finger in the blood, smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar, and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar. 
LEV.4.35	After this, all of the fat must be removed, just as when an animal is sacrificed to ask my blessing. Then the priest will send it up in smoke to me, together with a food offering, and your sin will be forgiven.
LEV.5.1	If you refuse to testify in court about something you saw or know has happened, you have sinned and can be punished.
LEV.5.2	You are guilty and unfit to worship me, if you accidentally touch the dead body of any kind of unclean animal.
LEV.5.3	You are guilty if you find out that you have accidentally touched anything unclean that comes from a human body.
LEV.5.4	You are guilty the moment you realize that you have made a hasty promise to do something good or bad.
LEV.5.5	As soon as you discover that you have committed any of these sins, you must confess what you have done. 
LEV.5.6	Then you must bring a female sheep or goat to me as the price for your sin. A priest will sacrifice the animal, and you will be forgiven.
LEV.5.7	If you are poor and cannot afford to bring an animal, you may bring two doves or two pigeons. One of these will be a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, and the other will be a sacrifice to please me.
LEV.5.8	Give both birds to the priest, who will offer one as a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness. He will wring its neck without tearing off its head, 
LEV.5.9	splatter some of its blood on one side of the bronze altar, and drain out the rest at the foot of the altar. 
LEV.5.10	Then he will follow the proper rules for offering the other bird as a sacrifice to please me.
LEV.5.10	You will be forgiven when the priest offers these sacrifices as the price for your sin.
LEV.5.11	If you are so poor that you cannot afford doves or pigeons, you may bring one kilogram of your finest flour. This is a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, so don't sprinkle olive oil or sweet-smelling incense on it. 
LEV.5.12	Give the flour to a priest, who will scoop up a handful and send it up in smoke together with the other offerings. This is a reminder that all of the flour belongs to me. 
LEV.5.13	By offering this sacrifice, the priest pays the price for any of these sins you may have committed. The priest gets to keep the rest of the flour, just as he does with grain sacrifices.
LEV.5.14+LEV.5.15	The 
LEV.5.14+LEV.5.15	If this happens, you must either sacrifice a ram that has nothing wrong with it or else pay the price of a ram with the official money used by the priests. 
LEV.5.16	In addition, you must pay what you owe plus a fine of 20 percent. Then the priest will offer the ram as a sacrifice to make things right, and you will be forgiven.
LEV.5.17+LEV.5.18+LEV.5.19	If you break any of my commands without meaning to, you are still guilty, and you can be punished. When you realize what you have done, you must either bring to the priest a ram that has nothing wrong with it or else pay him for one. The priest will then offer it as a sacrifice to make things right, and you will be forgiven.
LEV.6.1+LEV.6.2+LEV.6.3	You have sinned if you rob or cheat someone, if you keep back money or valuables left in your care, or if you find something and claim not to have it.
LEV.6.4	When this happens, you must return what doesn't belong to you 
LEV.6.5	and pay the owner a fine of 20 percent. 
LEV.6.6+LEV.6.7	In addition, you must either bring to the priest a ram that has nothing wrong with it or else pay him for one. The priest will then offer it as a sacrifice to make things right, and you will be forgiven for what you did wrong.
LEV.6.8+LEV.6.9	The 
LEV.6.8+LEV.6.9	You must put the animal for the sacrifice on the altar in the evening and let it stay there all night. But make sure the fire keeps burning. 
LEV.6.10	The next morning you will dress in your priestly clothes, including your linen underwear. Then clean away the ashes left by the sacrifices and pile them beside the altar. 
LEV.6.11	Change into your everyday clothes, take the ashes outside the camp, and pile them in the special place.
LEV.6.12	The fire must never go out, so put wood on it each morning. After this, you are to lay an animal on the altar next to the fat that you sacrifice to ask my blessing.
LEV.6.13	The altar fire must always be kept burning—it must never go out.
LEV.6.14	When someone offers a sacrifice to give thanks to me,
LEV.6.15	where one of them will scoop up a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the incense on it. Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, he will lay all of this on the altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me. 
LEV.6.16+LEV.6.17	The rest of it is to be baked without yeast and eaten by the priests in the sacred courtyard of the sacred tent. This bread is very holy, just like the sacrifices for sin or the sacrifices for making things right, and I have given this part to the priests from what is offered to me on the altar.
LEV.6.18	Only the men in Aaron's family are allowed to eat this bread, and they must go through a ceremony to be made holy before touching it.
LEV.6.19	The 
LEV.6.20	and told him what sacrifices the priests must offer on the morning and evening of the day they are ordained:
LEV.6.20	It is the same as the regular morning and evening sacrifices—half a kilogram of flour 
LEV.6.21	mixed with olive oil and cooked in a shallow pan. The bread must then be crumbled into small pieces
LEV.6.22+LEV.6.23	Each of Aaron's descendants who is ordained as a priest must perform this ceremony and make sure that the bread is completely burned on the altar. None of it may be eaten!
LEV.6.24	The 
LEV.6.25	how the priests from Aaron's family were to offer the sacrifice for sin:
LEV.6.25	This sacrifice is very sacred, and the animal must be killed in my presence at the north side of the bronze altar. 
LEV.6.26	The priest who offers this sacrifice must eat it in the sacred courtyard of the sacred tent, 
LEV.6.27	and anyone or anything that touches the meat will be holy.
LEV.6.28	If the meat was cooked in a clay pot, the pot must be destroyed,
LEV.6.29	This sacrifice is very holy, and only the priests may have any part of it. 
LEV.6.30	None of the meat may be eaten from the sacrifices for sin that require blood to be brought into the sacred tent.
LEV.7.1	The sacrifice to make things right is very sacred. 
LEV.7.2	The animal must be killed in the same place where the sacrifice to please me
LEV.7.3	Offer all of the animal's fat, including the fat on its tail and on its insides, 
LEV.7.4	as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat. 
LEV.7.5	One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke to me. 
LEV.7.6	This sacrifice for making things right is very holy. Only the priests may eat it, and they must eat it in a holy place.
LEV.7.7	The ceremony for this sacrifice and the one for sin are the same, and the meat may be eaten only by the priest who performs this ceremony of forgiveness.
LEV.7.8	In fact, the priest who offers a sacrifice to please me
LEV.7.9	just as he may eat the bread from a sacrifice to give thanks to me.
LEV.7.10	All other grain sacrifices—with or without olive oil in them—are to be divided equally among the priests of Aaron's family.
LEV.7.11	Here are the instructions for offering a sacrifice to ask my blessing:
LEV.7.12	If you offer it to give thanks, you must offer some bread together with it. Use the finest flour to make three kinds of bread without yeast—two in the form of loaves mixed with olive oil and one in the form of thin wafers brushed with oil. 
LEV.7.13	You must also make some bread with yeast. 
LEV.7.14	Give me one loaf or wafer from each of these four kinds of bread, after which they will belong to the priest who splattered the blood against the bronze altar.
LEV.7.15	When you offer an animal to ask a blessing from me or to thank me, the meat belongs to you, but it must be eaten the same day. 
LEV.7.16	It is different with the sacrifices you offer when you make me a promise or voluntarily give me something. The meat from those sacrifices may be kept and eaten the next day, 
LEV.7.17+LEV.7.18	but any that is left over must be destroyed. If you eat any of it after the second day, your sacrifice will be useless and unacceptable, and you will be both disgusting and guilty.
LEV.7.19	Don't eat any of the meat that has touched something unclean. Instead, burn it. The rest of the meat may be eaten by anyone who is clean and acceptable to me. 
LEV.7.20+LEV.7.21	But don't eat any of this meat if you have become unclean by touching something unclean from a human or an animal or from any other creature. If you do, you will no longer belong to the community of Israel.
LEV.7.22	The 
LEV.7.23	to say to the people:
LEV.7.23	Don't eat the fat of cattle, sheep, or goats. 
LEV.7.24	If one of your animals dies or is killed by some wild animal, you may do anything with its fat except eat it. 
LEV.7.25	If you eat the fat of an animal that can be used as a sacrifice to me, you will no longer belong to the community of Israel. 
LEV.7.26	 And no matter where you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal, 
LEV.7.27	or you will no longer belong to the community of Israel.
LEV.7.28	The 
LEV.7.29+LEV.7.30	to say to the people of Israel:
LEV.7.29+LEV.7.30	If you want to offer a sacrifice to ask my blessing, you must bring the part to be burned and lay it on the bronze altar. But you must first lift up
LEV.7.31	A priest from Aaron's family will then send the fat up in smoke, but the ribs belong to the priests. 
LEV.7.32+LEV.7.33	The upper joint of the right hind leg is for the priest who offers the blood and the fat of the animal. 
LEV.7.34	I have decided that the people of Israel must always give the choice ribs and the upper joint of the right hind leg to Aaron's descendants 
LEV.7.35	who have been ordained as priests to serve me. 
LEV.7.36	This law will never change. I am the 
LEV.7.37	These are the ceremonies for sacrifices to please the 
LEV.7.38	While Moses and the people of Israel were in the desert at Mount Sinai, the 
LEV.8.1	The 
LEV.8.2	Send for Aaron and his sons, as well as their priestly clothes, the oil for ordination, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and a basket of bread made without yeast. 
LEV.8.3	Then bring the whole community of Israel together at the entrance to the sacred tent.
LEV.8.4	Moses obeyed the 
LEV.8.5	he said, “We are here to follow the 
LEV.8.6	After Moses told Aaron and his sons to step forward, he told them to wash themselves. 
LEV.8.7	He put the priestly shirt and robe on Aaron and wrapped the sash around his waist. Then he put the sacred vest on Aaron and fastened it with the finely woven belt. 
LEV.8.8	Next, he put on Aaron the sacred breastpiece that was used in finding out what the 
LEV.8.9	He placed the turban on Aaron's head, and on the front of the turban was the narrow strip of thin gold as a sign of his dedication to the 
LEV.8.10	Moses then dedicated the sacred tent and everything in it to the 
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled the bronze altar seven times, and he sprinkled its equipment, as well as the large bronze bowl and its base. 
LEV.8.12	He also poured some of the oil on Aaron's head to dedicate him to the 
LEV.8.13	Next, Moses dressed Aaron's sons in their shirts, then tied sashes around them and put special caps on them, just as the 
LEV.8.14	Moses led out the bull that was to be sacrificed for sin, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
LEV.8.15	After it was killed, Moses dipped a finger in the blood and smeared some of it on each of the four corners of the bronze altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the altar. This purified the altar and made it a fit place for offering the sacrifice for sin. 
LEV.8.16	Moses then took the fat on the bull's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and sent them up in smoke on the altar fire. 
LEV.8.17	Finally, he took the skin and the flesh of the bull, together with the food still in its stomach, and burned them outside the camp, just as the 
LEV.8.18	Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please the 
LEV.8.19	Moses killed the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar. 
LEV.8.20+LEV.8.21	Moses had the animal cut up, and he washed its insides and hind legs. Then he laid the head, the fat, and the rest of the ram on the altar and sent them up in smoke with a smell that pleased the 
LEV.8.22	Moses led out the ram for the ceremony of ordination. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head, 
LEV.8.23	and it was killed. Moses smeared some of its blood on Aaron's right earlobe, some on his right thumb, and some on the big toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	Moses did the same thing for Aaron's sons, before splattering the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar. 
LEV.8.25	He took the animal's fat tail, the fat on its insides, and the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and the right hind leg. 
LEV.8.26	Then he took from a basket some of each of the three kinds of bread
LEV.8.27	Moses placed the bread on top of the meat and gave it all to Aaron and his sons, who lifted it up
LEV.8.28	After this, Moses placed it on the fires of the altar and sent it up in smoke with a smell that pleased the 
LEV.8.29	Moses lifted up
LEV.8.30	Finally, Moses sprinkled the priestly clothes of Aaron and his sons with some of the oil for ordination and with some of the blood from the altar. So Aaron and his sons, together with their priestly clothes, were dedicated to the 
LEV.8.31	Moses said to Aaron and his sons:
LEV.8.31	The 
LEV.8.32	Burn what is left over 
LEV.8.33	and stay near the entrance to the sacred tent until the ordination ceremony ends seven days from now. 
LEV.8.34	We have obeyed the 
LEV.8.35	The 
LEV.8.36	Aaron and his sons obeyed everything that the 
LEV.9.1	Eight days later Moses called together Aaron, his sons, and Israel's leaders. 
LEV.9.2	Then he said to Aaron:
LEV.9.2	Find a young bull and a ram that have nothing wrong with them. Offer the bull to the 
LEV.9.3	Tell the people of Israel that they must offer sacrifices as well. They must offer a goat
LEV.9.4	Then the people must offer a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to ask the 
LEV.9.5	After the animals and the grain had been brought to the front of the sacred tent, and the people were standing there in the presence of the 
LEV.9.6	Moses said:
LEV.9.6	The 
LEV.9.7	 Aaron, step up to the altar and offer the sacrifice to please the 
LEV.9.8	Aaron stepped up to the altar and killed the bull that was to be the sacrifice for his sins. 
LEV.9.9	His sons brought him the blood. He dipped a finger in it, smeared some on the four corners of the bronze altar, and poured out the rest at its foot. 
LEV.9.10	But he sent up in smoke the fat, the kidneys, and the lower part of the liver, just as the 
LEV.9.11	Then Aaron burned the skin and the flesh outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	After Aaron had killed the ram that was sacrificed to please the 
LEV.9.13	They brought him each piece of the animal, including the head, and he burned them all on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He washed the insides and the hind legs and also sent them up in smoke.
LEV.9.15	Next, Aaron sacrificed the goat for the sins of the people, as he had done with the sacrifice for his own sins. 
LEV.9.16	And so, he burned this sacrifice on the altar in the proper way. 
LEV.9.17	He also presented the grain sacrifice and burned a handful of the flour on the altar as part of the morning sacrifice.
LEV.9.19	His sons placed all the fat, as well as the kidneys and the lower part of the liver 
LEV.9.20	on top of the choice ribs. 
LEV.9.21	Then Aaron burned the fat on the altar and lifted up
LEV.9.23	He and Moses went into the sacred tent, and when they came out, they gave the people their blessing. Then the 
LEV.9.24	The 
LEV.10.1	Nadab and Abihu were two of Aaron's sons, but they disobeyed the 
LEV.10.2	Suddenly the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses told Aaron that this was exactly what the 
LEV.10.3	“I demand respect
LEV.10.3	from my priests,
LEV.10.3	and I will be praised
LEV.10.3	by everyone!”
LEV.10.3	Aaron was speechless.
LEV.10.4	Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan, the two sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel. Then he told them, “Take these two dead relatives of yours outside the camp far from the entrance to the sacred tent.” 
LEV.10.5	So they dragged the dead men away by their clothes.
LEV.10.6	Then Moses told Aaron and his other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar:
LEV.10.6	Don't show your sorrow by messing up your hair and tearing your priestly clothes, or the 
LEV.10.7	But you are the 
LEV.10.7	Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses.
LEV.10.8	The 
LEV.10.9	When you or your sons enter the sacred tent, you must never drink beer or wine. If you do, you will die right there! This law will never change. 
LEV.10.10	You must learn the difference between what is holy and what isn't holy and between the clean and the unclean. 
LEV.10.11	You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them.
LEV.10.12	The grain sacrifice that was offered to give thanks to the 
LEV.10.13	The 
LEV.10.14+LEV.10.15	 But the choice ribs and the hind leg that were lifted up
LEV.10.16	When Moses asked around and learned that the ram for the sin sacrifice had already been burned on the altar, he became angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and said, 
LEV.10.17	 “Why didn't you eat the meat from this sacrifice in an acceptable place? It is very holy, and the 
LEV.10.18	Whenever an animal's blood isn't brought into the sacred tent, I commanded you to eat its meat in an acceptable place, but you burned it instead.”
LEV.10.19	Their father Aaron replied, “Today two of my sons offered the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice to please the 
LEV.10.20	Moses was satisfied with Aaron's reply.
LEV.11.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.11.2	You may eat 
LEV.11.3	any animal that has divided hoofs and chews the cud.
LEV.11.4+LEV.11.5+LEV.11.6+LEV.11.7+LEV.11.8	But you must not eat animals such as camels, rock badgers, and rabbits that chew the cud but don't have divided hoofs. And you must not eat pigs—they have divided hoofs, but don't chew the cud. All of these animals are unclean,
LEV.11.9+LEV.11.10+LEV.11.11+LEV.11.12	You may eat anything that lives in water and has fins and scales. But it would be disgusting for you to eat anything else that lives in water, and you must not even touch their dead bodies.
LEV.11.13+LEV.11.14+LEV.11.15+LEV.11.16+LEV.11.17+LEV.11.18+LEV.11.19	Eagles, vultures, buzzards, crows, ostriches, hawks, sea gulls, owls, pelicans, storks, herons, hoopoes,
LEV.11.20+LEV.11.21+LEV.11.22+LEV.11.23	The only winged insects you may eat are locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets. All other winged insects that crawl are too disgusting for you to eat.
LEV.11.24+LEV.11.25+LEV.11.26+LEV.11.27+LEV.11.28	Don't even touch the dead bodies of animals that have divided hoofs but don't chew the cud. And don't touch the dead bodies of animals that have paws. If you do, you must wash your clothes, but you are still unclean until evening.
LEV.11.29+LEV.11.30	Moles, rats, mice, and all kinds of lizards are unclean. 
LEV.11.31	Anyone who touches their dead bodies or anything touched by their dead bodies becomes unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.32	If something made of wood, cloth, or leather touches one of their dead bodies, it must be washed, but it is still unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.33	If any of these animals is found dead in a clay pot, the pot must be broken to pieces, and everything in it becomes unclean. 
LEV.11.34	If you pour water from this pot on any food, that food becomes unclean, and anything drinkable in the pot becomes unclean.
LEV.11.35	If the dead body of one of these animals touches anything else, including ovens and stoves, that thing becomes unclean and must be destroyed. 
LEV.11.36	A spring or a cistern where one of these dead animals is found is still clean, but anyone who touches the animal becomes unclean. 
LEV.11.37	If the dead body of one of these animals is found lying on seeds that have been set aside for planting, the seeds remain clean. 
LEV.11.38	But seeds that are soaking in water become unclean, if the dead animal is found in the water.
LEV.11.39	If an animal that may be eaten happens to die, and you touch it, you become unclean until evening. 
LEV.11.40	If you eat any of its meat or carry its body away, you must wash your clothes, but you are still unclean until evening.
LEV.11.41+LEV.11.42	Don't eat any of those disgusting little creatures that crawl or walk close to the ground. 
LEV.11.43	If you eat any of them, you will become just as disgusting and unclean as they are. 
LEV.11.44	 I am the 
LEV.11.45	I brought you out of Egypt so that I could be your God. Now you must become holy, because I am holy!
LEV.11.46+LEV.11.47	I have given these laws so that you will know what animals, birds, and fish are clean and may be eaten, and which ones are unclean and may not be eaten.
LEV.12.1	The 
LEV.12.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.12.2	If a woman gives birth to a son, she is unclean for seven days, just as she is during her monthly period. 
LEV.12.3	 Her son must be circumcised on the eighth day, 
LEV.12.4	but her loss of blood keeps her from being completely clean for another 33 days. During this time she must not touch anything holy or go to the place of worship. 
LEV.12.5	Any woman who gives birth to a daughter is unclean for two weeks, just as she is during her period. And she won't be completely clean for another 66 days.
LEV.12.6	When the mother has completed her time of cleansing, she must come to the front of the sacred tent and bring to the priest a year-old lamb as a sacrifice to please me
LEV.12.7	After the priest offers the sacrifices to me, the mother will become completely clean from her loss of blood, whether her child is a boy or a girl. 
LEV.12.8	 If she cannot afford a lamb, she can offer two doves or two pigeons, one as a sacrifice to please me and the other as a sacrifice for sin.
LEV.13.1	The 
LEV.13.2	If sores or boils or a skin rash should break out and start spreading on your body, you must be brought to Aaron or to one of the other priests. 
LEV.13.3	If the priest discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep, he will say, “This is leprosy
LEV.13.4	But if the infected area is white and only skin deep, and if the hair in it hasn't turned white, the priest will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days. 
LEV.13.5	If the disease hasn't spread by that time, he will order you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days. 
LEV.13.6	Then if the disease hasn't become any worse or spread, the priest will say, “You are clean. It is only a sore. After you wash your clothes, you may go home.”
LEV.13.7	However, if the disease comes back, you must return to the priest. 
LEV.13.8	If it is discovered that the disease has started spreading, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.”
LEV.13.9	Any of you with a skin disease must be brought to a priest. 
LEV.13.10	If he discovers that the sore spot is white with pus and that the hair around it has also turned white, 
LEV.13.11	he will say, “This is leprosy. You are unclean and must stay away from everyone else.” 
LEV.13.12+LEV.13.13	But if the disease has run its course and only the scars remain, he will say, “You are clean.” 
LEV.13.14+LEV.13.15	If the sores come back and turn white again, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.”
LEV.13.16+LEV.13.17	However, if the sores heal and only white spots remain, the priest will say, “You are now clean.”
LEV.13.18+LEV.13.19	If you have a sore that either swells or turns reddish-white after it has healed, then you must show it to a priest. 
LEV.13.20	If he discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.” 
LEV.13.21	But if the white area is only on the surface of the skin and hasn't become any worse, and if the hair in it hasn't turned white, he will tell you to stay away from everyone else for seven days.
LEV.13.22	If the sore begins spreading during this time, the priest will say, “You are unclean because you have a disease.” 
LEV.13.23	But if it doesn't spread, and only a scar remains, he will say, “You are now clean.”
LEV.13.24	If you have a burn that gets infected and turns red or reddish-white, 
LEV.13.25	a priest must examine it. Then if he discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep, he will say, “The burn has turned into leprosy, and you are unclean.” 
LEV.13.26	But if the priest finds that the hair in the infected area hasn't turned white and that the sore is only skin deep and it is healing, he will tell you to stay away from everyone else for seven days. 
LEV.13.27	On the seventh day the priest will examine you again, and if the infection is spreading, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.” 
LEV.13.28	However, if the infection hasn't spread and has begun to heal, and if only a scar remains, he will say, “Only a scar remains from the burn, and you are clean.”
LEV.13.29	If you have a sore on your head or chin, 
LEV.13.30	it must be examined by a priest. If the infection seems more than skin deep, and the hair in it has thinned out and lost its color, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.” 
LEV.13.31	On the other hand, if he discovers that the itchy spot is only skin deep, but that the hair still isn't healthy, he will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days. 
LEV.13.32	By that time, if the itch hasn't spread, if the hair seems healthy, and if the itch is only skin deep, 
LEV.13.33	you must shave off the hair around the infection, but not those on it. Then the priest will tell you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days. 
LEV.13.34	By that time, if the itch hasn't spread and seems no more than skin deep, he will say, “You are clean; now you must wash your clothes.”
LEV.13.35+LEV.13.36	Later, if the itch starts spreading, even though the hair is still healthy, the priest will say, “You are unclean.” 
LEV.13.37	But if he thinks you are completely well, he will say, “You are clean.”
LEV.13.38	If white spots break out on your skin, 
LEV.13.39	but the priest discovers that it is only a rash, he will say, “You are clean.”
LEV.13.40+LEV.13.41	If you become bald on any part of your head, you are still clean. 
LEV.13.42+LEV.13.43	But if a priest discovers that a reddish-white sore has broken out on the bald spot and looks like leprosy, he will say, 
LEV.13.44	“This is leprosy—you are unclean.”
LEV.13.45	If you ever have leprosy, you must tear your clothes, leave your hair uncombed, cover the lower part of your face, and go around shouting, “I'm unclean! I'm unclean!” 
LEV.13.46	As long as you have the disease, you are unclean and must live alone outside the camp.
LEV.13.47+LEV.13.48+LEV.13.49+LEV.13.50	If a greenish or reddish spot
LEV.13.51	and if the mildew has spread in that time, he will say, “This is unclean 
LEV.13.52	because the mildew has spread.” Then he will burn the clothing or the piece of leather.
LEV.13.53	If the priest discovers that the mildew hasn't spread, 
LEV.13.54	he will tell you to wash the clothing or leather and put it aside for another seven days, 
LEV.13.55	after which he will examine it again. If the spot hasn't spread, but is still greenish or reddish, the clothing or leather is unclean and must be burned. 
LEV.13.56	But if the spot has faded after being washed, he will tear away the spot. 
LEV.13.57	Later, if the spot reappears elsewhere on the clothing or the leather, you must burn it. 
LEV.13.58	Even if the spot completely disappears after being washed, it must be washed again before it is clean.
LEV.13.59	These are the rules for deciding if clothing is clean or unclean after a spot appears on it.
LEV.14.1	The 
LEV.14.4	he will order someone to bring out two live birds that are acceptable for sacrifice, together with a stick of cedar wood, a piece of red yarn, and a branch from a hyssop plant. 
LEV.14.5	The priest will order someone to kill one of the birds over a clay pot of spring water. 
LEV.14.6	Then he will dip the other bird, the cedar, the red yarn, and the hyssop in the blood of the dead bird. 
LEV.14.7	Next, he will sprinkle you seven times with the blood and say, “You are now clean.” Finally, he will release the bird and let it fly away.
LEV.14.8	After this you must wash your clothes, shave your entire body, and take a bath before you are completely clean. You may move back into camp, but you must not enter your tent for seven days. 
LEV.14.9	Then you must once again shave your head, face, and eyebrows, as well as the hair on the rest of your body. Finally, wash your clothes and take a bath, and you will be completely clean.
LEV.14.10	On the eighth day you must bring to the priest two rams and a year-old female lamb that have nothing wrong with them; also bring 300 milliliters of olive oil and 3 kilograms of your finest flour mixed with oil. 
LEV.14.11	Then the priest will present you and your offerings to me at the entrance to my sacred tent. 
LEV.14.12	There he will offer one of the rams, together with the oil, as a sacrifice to make things right.
LEV.14.13	This sacrifice is very holy. It belongs to the priest and must be killed in the same place where animals are killed as sacrifices for sins and as sacrifices to please me.
LEV.14.14	The priest will smear some of the blood from this sacrifice on your right ear lobe, some on your right thumb, and some on the big toe of your right foot. 
LEV.14.15	He will then pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his left hand, 
LEV.14.16	dip a finger of his right hand into the oil, and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred tent. 
LEV.14.17	Next, the priest will smear some of the oil on your right ear lobe, some on your right thumb, and some on the big toe of your right foot, 
LEV.14.18+LEV.14.19+LEV.14.20	and he will pour the rest of the oil from his palm on your head. Then he will offer the other two animals—one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me, together with a grain sacrifice. After this you will be completely clean.
LEV.14.21	If you are poor and cannot afford to offer this much, you may offer a ram as a sacrifice to make things right, together with 300 milliliters of olive oil and one kilogram of flour mixed with oil as a grain sacrifice. The priest will then lift these up
LEV.14.22	Depending on what you can afford, you must also offer either two doves or two pigeons, one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me. 
LEV.14.23	The priest will offer these to me in front of the sacred tent on the eighth day.
LEV.14.24+LEV.14.25	The priest will kill this ram for the sacrifice to make things right, and he will lift it up
LEV.14.26	The priest will pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his left hand, 
LEV.14.27	then dip a finger of his right hand in the oil and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred tent. 
LEV.14.28	He will smear some of the oil on your right ear lobe, some on your right thumb, and some on the big toe of your right foot, just as he did with the blood of the sacrifice to make things right. 
LEV.14.29+LEV.14.30+LEV.14.31	And he will pour the rest of the oil from his palm on your head.
LEV.14.29+LEV.14.30+LEV.14.31	Then, depending on what you can afford, he will offer either the doves or the pigeons together with the grain sacrifice. One of the birds is the sacrifice for sin, and the other is the sacrifice to please me. After this you will be completely clean.
LEV.14.32	These are the things you must do if you have leprosy and cannot afford the usual sacrifices to make you clean.
LEV.14.33	The 
LEV.14.34	After I have given you the land of Canaan as your permanent possession, here is what you must do, if I ever put mildew
LEV.14.35	First, you must say to a priest, “I think there is mildew on the wall of my house.”
LEV.14.36	The priest will reply, “Empty the house before I inspect it, or else everything in it will be unclean.”
LEV.14.37	If the priest discovers greenish or reddish spots that go deeper than the surface of the walls, 
LEV.14.38	he will have the house closed for seven days. 
LEV.14.39	Then he will return and check to see if the mildew has spread. 
LEV.14.40+LEV.14.41	If so, he will order someone to scrape the plaster from the walls, remove the stones covered with mildew, then haul everything off and dump it in an unclean place outside the town. 
LEV.14.42	Afterwards the wall must be repaired with new stones and fresh plaster.
LEV.14.43	If the mildew appears a second time, 
LEV.14.44	the priest will come and say, “This house is unclean. It's covered with mildew that can't be removed.” 
LEV.14.45	Then he will have the house torn down and every bit of wood, stone, and plaster hauled off to an unclean place outside the town. 
LEV.14.46	Meanwhile, if any of you entered the house while it was closed, you will be unclean until evening. 
LEV.14.47	And if you either slept or ate in the house, you must wash your clothes.
LEV.14.48	On the other hand, if the priest discovers that mildew hasn't reappeared after the house was newly plastered, he will say, “This house is clean—the mildew has gone.” 
LEV.14.49	Then, to show that the house is now clean, he will get two birds, a stick of cedar wood, a piece of red yarn, and a branch from a hyssop plant and bring them to the house. 
LEV.14.50	He will kill one of the birds over a clay pot of spring water 
LEV.14.51+LEV.14.52	and let its blood drain into the pot. Then he will dip the cedar, the hyssop, the yarn, and the other bird into the mixture of blood and water. Next, he will sprinkle the house seven times with the mixture, then the house will be completely clean. 
LEV.14.53	Finally, he will release the bird and let it fly away, ending the ceremony for purifying the house.
LEV.14.54+LEV.14.55+LEV.14.56+LEV.14.57	These are the things you must do if you discover that you are unclean because of an itch or a sore, or that your clothing or house is unclean because of mildew.
LEV.15.1	The 
LEV.15.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.15.2	Any man with an infected penis is unclean, 
LEV.15.3	whether it is stopped up or keeps dripping. 
LEV.15.4	Anything that he rests on or sits on is also unclean, 
LEV.15.5+LEV.15.6+LEV.15.7	and if you touch either these or him, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening.
LEV.15.8	If you are spit on by the man, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.9+LEV.15.10	Any saddle or seat on which the man sits is unclean. And if you touch or carry either of these, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.11	If the man touches you without first washing his hands, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.12	Any clay pot that he touches must be destroyed, and any wooden bowl that he touches must be washed.
LEV.15.13	Seven days after the man gets well, he will be considered clean, if he washes his clothes and takes a bath in spring water. 
LEV.15.14	On the eighth day he must bring either two doves or two pigeons to the front of my sacred tent and give them to a priest. 
LEV.15.15	The priest will offer one of the birds as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me,
LEV.15.16	Any man who has a flow of semen must take a bath, but he still remains unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.17	If the semen touches anything made of cloth or leather, these must be washed, but they still remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.18	After having sex, both the man and the woman must take a bath, but they still remain unclean until evening.
LEV.15.19	When a woman has her monthly period, she remains unclean for seven days, and if you touch her, you must take a bath, but you remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.20+LEV.15.21+LEV.15.22+LEV.15.23	Anything that she rests on or sits on is also unclean, and if you touch either of these, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening. 
LEV.15.24	Any man who has sex with her during this time becomes unclean for seven days, and anything he rests on is also unclean.
LEV.15.25	Any woman who has a flow of blood outside her regular monthly period is unclean until it stops, just as she is during her monthly period. 
LEV.15.26	Anything that she rests on or sits on during this time is also unclean, just as it would be during her period. 
LEV.15.27	If you touch either of these, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, but you still remain unclean until evening.
LEV.15.28	Seven days after the woman gets well, she will be considered clean. 
LEV.15.29	On the eighth day, she must bring either two doves or two pigeons to the front of my sacred tent and give them to a priest. 
LEV.15.30	He will offer one of the birds as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me; then I will consider the woman completely clean.
LEV.15.31	When any of you are unclean, you must stay away from the rest of the community of Israel. Otherwise, my sacred tent will become unclean, and the whole nation will die.
LEV.15.32+LEV.15.33	These are the things you men must do if you become unclean because of an infected penis or if you have a flow of semen. And these are the things you women must do when you become unclean either because of your monthly period or an unusual flow of blood. This is also what you men must do if you have sex with a woman who is unclean.
LEV.16.1+LEV.16.2	I, the 
LEV.16.4	You will take a bath and put on the sacred linen clothes, including the underwear, the robe, the sash, and the turban. 
LEV.16.5	Then the community of Israel will bring you a ram and two goats, both of them males. The goats are to be used as sacrifices for sin, and the ram is to be used as a sacrifice to please me.
LEV.16.6	Aaron, you must offer the bull as a sacrifice of forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family. 
LEV.16.7	Then you will lead the two goats into my presence at the front of the sacred tent, 
LEV.16.8	where I will show you
LEV.16.9	After you offer the first goat as a sacrifice for sin, 
LEV.16.10	the other one must be presented to me alive, before you send it into the desert to take away the sins of the people.
LEV.16.11	You must offer the bull as a sacrifice to ask forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family. 
LEV.16.12	Then you will take a fire pan of live coals from the bronze altar, together with two handfuls of finely ground incense, into the most holy place. 
LEV.16.13	There you will present them to me by placing the incense on the coals, so that the place of mercy will be covered with a cloud of smoke. Do this, or you will die right there! 
LEV.16.14	Next, use a finger to sprinkle some of the blood on the place of mercy, which is on the lid of the sacred chest; then sprinkle blood seven times in front of the chest.
LEV.16.16	By doing this, you will take away the sins that make both the most holy place and the people of Israel unclean. Do the same for the sacred tent, which is here among the people. 
LEV.16.17	Only you are allowed in the sacred tent from the time you enter until the time you come out. 
LEV.16.18	After leaving the tent, you will purify the bronze altar by smearing each of its four corners with some of the blood from the bull and from the goat. 
LEV.16.19	Use a finger to sprinkle the altar seven times with the blood, and it will be completely clean from the sins of the people.
LEV.16.20	After you have purified the most holy place, the sacred tent, and the bronze altar, you must bring the live goat to the front of the tent. 
LEV.16.21	 There you will lay your hands on its head, while confessing every sin the people have committed, and you will appoint someone to lead the goat into the desert, so that it can take away their sins. 
LEV.16.22	Finally, this goat that carries the heavy burden of Israel's sins must be released deep in the desert.
LEV.16.25	The fat from these sacrifices for sin must be sent up in smoke on the bronze altar.
LEV.16.26	The one who led the goat into the desert and sent it off to the demon Azazel must take a bath and wash his clothes before coming back into camp. 
LEV.16.27	 The remains of the bull and the goat whose blood was taken into the most holy place must be taken outside the camp and burned. 
LEV.16.28	And whoever does this must take a bath and change clothes before coming back into camp.
LEV.16.30	This is the day on which the sacrifice for the forgiveness of your sins will be made in my presence, 
LEV.16.31	and from now on, it must be celebrated each year. Go without eating and make this a day of complete rest just like the Sabbath. 
LEV.16.32	The high priest must offer the sacrifices for cleansing from sin, while wearing the sacred linen clothes. 
LEV.16.33	He will offer these sacrifices for the most holy place, the sacred tent, the bronze altar, all the priests, and for the whole community. 
LEV.16.34	You must celebrate this day each year—it is the Great Day of Forgiveness
LEV.16.34	Moses did exactly as the 
LEV.17.1	The 
LEV.17.2	to tell Aaron, his sons, and everyone else in Israel:
LEV.17.3+LEV.17.4	Whenever you kill any of your cattle, sheep, or goats as sacrifices to me, you must do it at the entrance to the sacred tent. If you don't, you will be guilty of pouring out blood, and you will no longer belong to the community of Israel. 
LEV.17.5	And so, when you sacrifice an animal to ask my blessing,
LEV.17.6	but in front of the sacred tent. Then a priest can splatter its blood against the bronze altar and send its fat up in smoke with a smell that pleases me. 
LEV.17.7	Don't ever turn from me again and offer sacrifices to goat-demons. This law will never change.
LEV.17.8	Remember! No one in Israel, including foreigners, is to offer a sacrifice anywhere 
LEV.17.9	except at the entrance to the sacred tent. If you do, you will no longer belong to my people.
LEV.17.11	 Life is in the blood, and I have given you the blood of animals to sacrifice in place of your own. 
LEV.17.12	That's also why I have forbidden you to eat blood. 
LEV.17.13	Even if you should hunt and kill a bird or an animal, you must drain out the blood and cover it with soil.
LEV.17.14	The life of every living creature is in its blood. That's why I have forbidden you to eat blood and why I have warned you that anyone who does will no longer belong to my people.
LEV.17.15	If you happen to find a dead animal and eat it, you must take a bath and wash your clothes, but you are still unclean until evening. 
LEV.17.16	If you don't take a bath, you will suffer for what you did wrong.
LEV.18.1	The 
LEV.18.2	to tell the people of Israel:
LEV.18.2	I am the 
LEV.18.3	So don't follow the customs of Egypt where you used to live or those of Canaan where I am bringing you. 
LEV.18.4	I am the 
LEV.18.5	 Obey them and you will live. I am the 
LEV.18.6	Don't have sex with any of your close relatives, 
LEV.18.7	especially your own mother. This would disgrace your father. 
LEV.18.8	 And don't disgrace him by having sex with any of his other wives. 
LEV.18.9	 Don't have sex with your sister or stepsister, whether you grew up together or not. 
LEV.18.10	Don't disgrace yourself by having sex with your granddaughter 
LEV.18.11	or half sister 
LEV.18.12+LEV.18.13	 or a sister of your father or mother. 
LEV.18.14	Don't disgrace your uncle by having sex with his wife. 
LEV.18.15	 Don't have sex with your daughter-in-law 
LEV.18.16	 or sister-in-law. 
LEV.18.17	 And don't have sex with the daughter or granddaughter of any woman that you have earlier had sex with. You will be having sex with her closest relatives, and that would make you unclean. 
LEV.18.18	As long as your wife is alive, don't cause trouble for her by taking one of her sisters as a second wife.
LEV.18.24	Don't make yourselves unclean by any of these disgusting practices of those nations that I am forcing out of the land for you. They made themselves 
LEV.18.25	and the land so unclean, that I punished the land because of their sins, and I made it vomit them up. 
LEV.18.26+LEV.18.27	Now don't do these sickening things that make the land filthy. Instead, obey my laws and teachings. 
LEV.18.28	Then the land won't become sick of you and vomit you up, just as it did them. 
LEV.18.29+LEV.18.30	If any of you do these vulgar, disgusting things, you will be unclean and no longer belong to my people. I am the 
LEV.19.1	The 
LEV.19.2	 to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.19.2	I am the 
LEV.19.3+LEV.19.4	 Respect your father and your mother, honor the Sabbath, and don't make idols or images. I am the 
LEV.19.5	When you offer a sacrifice to ask my blessing,
LEV.19.6	You may eat the meat either on the day of the sacrifice or on the next day, but you must burn anything left over on the third day. 
LEV.19.7	If you eat any of it on the third day, the sacrifice will be disgusting to me, and I will reject it. 
LEV.19.8	In fact, you will be punished for not respecting what I say is holy, and you will no longer belong to the community of Israel.
LEV.19.10	Don't strip your grapevines clean or gather the grapes that fall off the vines. Leave them for the poor and for those foreigners who live among you. I am the 
LEV.19.16	Don't be a gossip, but never hesitate to speak up in court, especially if your testimony can save someone's life.
LEV.19.18	 Don't be angry or try to take revenge. I am the 
LEV.19.20	If a man has sex with a slave woman who is promised in marriage to someone else, he must pay a fine, but they are not to be put to death. After all, she was still a slave at the time.
LEV.19.21+LEV.19.22	The man must bring a ram to the entrance of the sacred tent and give it to a priest, who will then offer it as a sacrifice to me, so the man's sins will be forgiven.
LEV.19.23	After you enter the land, you will plant fruit trees, but you are not to eat any fruit from them for the first three years. 
LEV.19.24	In the fourth year the fruit must be set apart, as an expression of thanks 
LEV.19.25	to me, the 
LEV.19.26	Don't practice any kind of witchcraft.
LEV.19.32	I command you to show respect for older people and to obey me with fear and trembling.
LEV.19.34	Instead, treat them as well as you treat your own people and love them as much as you love yourself. Remember, you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the 
LEV.19.35+LEV.19.36	I am the 
LEV.19.37	and I command you to obey my laws.
LEV.20.1	The 
LEV.20.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.20.2	Death by stoning is the penalty for any citizens or foreigners in the country who sacrifice their children to the god Molech. 
LEV.20.3	They have disgraced both the place where I am worshiped and my holy name, and so I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people. 
LEV.20.4	Some of you may let them get away with human sacrifice, 
LEV.20.5	but not me. If any of you worship Molech, I will turn against you and your entire family, and I will no longer let you belong to my people.
LEV.20.6	I will be your enemy if you go to someone who claims to speak with the dead, and I will destroy you from among my people. 
LEV.20.7	Dedicate yourselves to me and be holy because I am the 
LEV.20.8	I have chosen you as my people, and I expect you to obey my laws.
LEV.20.12	 It isn't natural to have sex with your daughter-in-law, and both of you will be put to death, just as you deserve. 
LEV.20.13	 It's disgusting for men to have sex with one another, and those who do will be put to death, just as they deserve. 
LEV.20.14	 It isn't natural for a man to marry both a woman and her daughter, and so all three of them will be burned to death. 
LEV.20.15+LEV.20.16	 If any of you have sex with an animal, both you and the animal will be put to death, just as you deserve.
LEV.20.18	 If you have sex with a woman during her monthly period, both you and the woman will be cut off from the people of Israel. 
LEV.20.19	 The sisters of your father and mother are your own relatives, and you will be punished for having sex with any of them. 
LEV.20.20	If you have sex with your uncle's wife, neither you nor she will ever have any children. 
LEV.20.21	 And if you marry your sister-in-law, neither of you will ever have any children.
LEV.20.22	Obey my laws and teachings. Or else the land I am giving you will become sick of you and throw you out. 
LEV.20.23	The nations I am chasing out did these disgusting things, and I hated them for it, so don't follow their example. 
LEV.20.24	I am the 
LEV.20.25	That's why you must make a difference between animals and birds that I have said are clean and unclean
LEV.20.26	I am the 
LEV.20.27	If you claim to receive messages from the dead, you will be put to death by stoning, just as you deserve.
LEV.21.1	The 
LEV.21.1	Touching a dead body will make you unclean. So don't go near a dead relative, 
LEV.21.2	except your mother, father, son, daughter, brother, 
LEV.21.3	or an unmarried sister, who has no husband to take care of her. 
LEV.21.4	Don't make yourself unclean by attending the funeral of someone related to you by marriage.
LEV.21.5	 Don't shave any part of your head or trim your beard or cut yourself to show that you are mourning. 
LEV.21.6	I am the 
LEV.21.7	Don't marry a divorced woman or a woman who has served as a temple prostitute. You are holy, 
LEV.21.8	because I am holy. And so, you must be treated with proper respect, since you offer food sacrifices to me, the God of holiness.
LEV.21.9	If any of you priests has a daughter who disgraces you by serving as a temple prostitute, she must be burned to death.
LEV.21.10	If you are the high priest, you must not mess up your hair or tear your clothes in order to mourn for the dead. 
LEV.21.11	Don't make yourself unclean by going near a dead body, not even that of your own father or mother. 
LEV.21.12	If you leave the sacred place to attend a funeral, both you and the sacred place become unclean, because you are the high priest.
LEV.21.13	If you are the high priest, you must marry only a virgin 
LEV.21.14	from your own tribe. Don't marry a divorced woman or any other woman who has already had sex, including a temple prostitute. 
LEV.21.15	In this way, your descendants will be qualified to serve me. Remember—I am the 
LEV.21.16	The 
LEV.21.17+LEV.21.18	to say to Aaron:
LEV.21.17+LEV.21.18	No descendant of yours can ever serve as my priest if he is blind or lame, if his face is disfigured, if one leg is shorter than the other, 
LEV.21.19	if either a foot or a hand is paralyzed, 
LEV.21.20	if he is a hunchback or a dwarf, if an eye or his skin is diseased, or if his testicles have been damaged. 
LEV.21.21	These men may not serve as my priests and burn sacrifices to me. 
LEV.21.22	They may eat the food offerings presented to me, 
LEV.21.23	but they may not enter the sacred place or serve me at the altar. Remember—I am the 
LEV.21.24	Moses told all of this to Aaron, his sons, and the people of Israel.
LEV.22.1	The 
LEV.22.2	to say to Aaron and his sons:
LEV.22.2	I am the 
LEV.22.3	If any of you are unclean when you accept an offering for me, I will no longer let you serve as a priest. 
LEV.22.4	None of you may take part in the sacred meals while you have a skin disease or an infected penis, or after you have been near a dead body or have had a flow of semen, 
LEV.22.5	or if you have touched an unclean creature of any sort, including an unclean person. 
LEV.22.6+LEV.22.7	Once you are unclean, you must take a bath, but you still cannot eat any of the sacred food until evening. 
LEV.22.8	I command you not to eat anything that is killed by a wild animal or dies a natural death. This would make you unclean. 
LEV.22.9	Obey me, or you will die on duty for disgracing the place of worship. Remember—I am the 
LEV.22.10	Only you priests and your families may eat the food offerings; these are too sacred for any of your servants. 
LEV.22.11	However, any slave that you own, including those born into your household, may eat this food. 
LEV.22.12	If your daughter marries someone who isn't a priest, she can no longer have any of this food. 
LEV.22.13	But if she returns to your home, either widowed or divorced, and has no children, she may join in the meal. Only members of a priestly family can eat this food, 
LEV.22.14	and anyone else who accidentally does so, must pay for the food plus a fine of 20 percent.
LEV.22.15	I warn you not to treat lightly the offerings that are brought by the people of Israel. 
LEV.22.16	Don't let them become guilty of eating this sacred food. Remember—I am the 
LEV.22.17	The 
LEV.22.18	to tell Aaron and his sons and everyone else the rules for offering sacrifices. He said:
LEV.22.18	The animals that are to be completely burned on the altar 
LEV.22.19+LEV.22.20	 must have nothing wrong with them, or else I won't accept them. Bulls or rams or goats
LEV.22.21	When you offer a sacrifice to ask my blessing,
LEV.22.22	Don't offer an animal that is blind or injured or that has an infection or a skin disease. 
LEV.22.23	If one of your cattle or lambs has a leg that is longer or shorter than the others, you may offer it voluntarily, but not as part of a promise. 
LEV.22.24	As long as you live in this land, don't offer an animal with injured testicles. 
LEV.22.25	And don't bring me animals you bought from a foreigner. I won't accept them, because they are no better than one that has something wrong with it.
LEV.22.26	The 
LEV.22.27	Newborn cattle, sheep, or goats must remain with their mothers for seven days, but on the eighth day, you may send them up in smoke to me, and I will accept the offering. 
LEV.22.28	Don't sacrifice a newborn animal and its mother on the same day.
LEV.22.29	When you offer a sacrifice to give thanks
LEV.22.30	Eat all of the meat that same day and don't save any for the next day. I am the 
LEV.22.31	Obey my laws and teachings—I am the 
LEV.22.32+LEV.22.33	I demand respect from the people of Israel, so don't disgrace my holy name. Remember—I am the one who chose you to be priests and rescued all of you from Egypt, so that I would be your 
LEV.23.1	The 
LEV.23.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.23.2	I have chosen certain times for you to come together and worship me.
LEV.23.7	On the first day of this festival you must rest from your work and come together for worship. 
LEV.23.8	Each day of this festival you must offer sacrifices. Then on the final day you must once again rest from your work and come together for worship.
LEV.23.9	The 
LEV.23.10	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.23.10	After you enter the land I am giving you, the first bundle of wheat from each crop must be given to me. So bring it to a priest 
LEV.23.11	on the day after the Sabbath. He will lift it up
LEV.23.12	You must also offer a sacrifice to please me.
LEV.23.13	and two kilograms of your finest flour mixed with olive oil. Then he will place these on the bronze altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me. Together with these, you must bring a liter of wine as a drink offering. 
LEV.23.14	I am your God, and I forbid you to eat any new grain or anything made from it until you have brought these offerings. This law will never change.
LEV.23.16	Do this exactly 50 days later, which is the day following the seventh Sabbath. 
LEV.23.17	Bring two loaves of bread to be lifted up
LEV.23.18	At this same time, the entire community of Israel must bring seven lambs that are a year old, a young bull, and two rams. These animals must have nothing wrong with them, and they must be offered as a sacrifice to please me.
LEV.23.19	Offer a goat
LEV.23.20	The priest will lift up
LEV.23.21	This is a day of celebration and worship, a time of rest from your work. You and your descendants must obey this law.
LEV.23.23	The 
LEV.23.24+LEV.23.25	to say to the people of Israel:
LEV.23.24+LEV.23.25	The first day of the seventh month
LEV.23.27	The tenth day of the seventh month
LEV.23.28	No one is to work on that day—it is the Great Day of Forgiveness, when sacrifices will be offered to me, so that I will forgive your sins. 
LEV.23.29	I will destroy anyone who refuses to go without eating. 
LEV.23.30+LEV.23.31	None of my people are ever to do any work on that day—not now or in the future. And I will wipe out those who do! 
LEV.23.32	This is a time of complete rest just like the Sabbath, and everyone must go without eating from the evening of the ninth to the evening of the tenth.
LEV.23.34	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.23.34	Beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
LEV.23.35	No one is to do any work on the first day of the festival—it is a time when everyone must come together for worship. 
LEV.23.36	For seven days, sacrifices must be offered on the altar. The eighth day is also to be a day of complete rest, as well as a time of offering sacrifices on the altar and of coming together for worship.
LEV.23.37	I have chosen these festivals as times when my people must come together for worship and when animals, grain, and wine are to be offered on the proper days. 
LEV.23.38	These festivals must be celebrated in addition to the Sabbaths and the times when you offer special gifts or sacrifices to keep a promise or as a voluntary offering.
LEV.23.39	Remember to begin the Festival of Shelters on the fifteenth day of the seventh month after you have harvested your crops. Celebrate this festival for seven days in honor of me and don't do any work on the first day or on the day following the festival. 
LEV.23.40	Pick the best fruit from your trees
LEV.23.41	I command you and all of your descendants to celebrate this festival during the seventh month of each year. 
LEV.23.42	For seven days every Israelite must live in a shelter, 
LEV.23.43	so future generations will know that I made their ancestors live in shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the 
LEV.23.44	This is how Moses instructed the people of Israel to celebrate the 
LEV.24.1	The 
LEV.24.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.24.2	You must supply the purest olive oil for the lamps in the sacred tent, so they will keep burning. 
LEV.24.3+LEV.24.4	Aaron will set up the gold lampstand in the holy place of the sacred tent. Then he will light the seven lamps that must be kept burning there in my presence, every night from now on. This law will never change.
LEV.24.6	then take them into the sacred tent and lay them on the gold table in two rows of six loaves. 
LEV.24.7	Alongside each row put some pure incense that will be sent up by fire in place of the bread as an offering to me. 
LEV.24.8	Aaron must lay fresh loaves on the table each Sabbath, and priests in all generations must continue this practice as part of Israel's agreement with me. 
LEV.24.9	 This bread will always belong to Aaron and his family; it is very holy because it was offered to me, and it must be eaten in a holy place.
LEV.24.10+LEV.24.11	Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan, had married an Egyptian, and they had a son. One day their son got into a fight with an Israelite man in camp and cursed the name of the 
LEV.24.12	who had him guarded while everyone waited for the 
LEV.24.13	Finally, the 
LEV.24.14	This man has cursed me! Take him outside the camp and tell the witnesses to lay their hands on his head. Then command the whole community of Israel to stone him to death. 
LEV.24.15+LEV.24.16	And warn the others that everyone else who curses me will die in the same way, whether they are Israelites by birth or foreigners living among you.
LEV.24.18	but the killing of an animal that belongs to someone else requires only that the animal be replaced. 
LEV.24.19	Personal injuries to others must be dealt with in keeping with the crime— 
LEV.24.20	 a broken bone for a broken bone, an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth. 
LEV.24.21	It's possible to pay the owner for an animal that has been killed, but death is the penalty for murder. 
LEV.24.22	 I am the 
LEV.24.23	When Moses finished speaking, the people did what the 
LEV.25.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.25.2	After you enter the land that I am giving you, it must be allowed to rest one year out of every seven. 
LEV.25.3	You may raise grain and grapes for six years, 
LEV.25.4	but the seventh year you must let your fields and vineyards rest in honor of me, your 
LEV.25.5	This is to be a time of complete rest for your fields and vineyards, so don't harvest anything they produce. 
LEV.25.6+LEV.25.7	However, you and your slaves and your hired workers, as well as any domestic or wild animals, may eat whatever grows on its own.
LEV.25.8	Once every 49 years 
LEV.25.9	on the tenth day of the seventh month,
LEV.25.10	This fiftieth year
LEV.25.11	This is a year of complete celebration, so don't plant any seed or harvest what your fields or vineyards produce. 
LEV.25.12	In this time of sacred celebration you may eat only what grows on its own.
LEV.25.13	During this year, all property must go back to its original owner. 
LEV.25.14+LEV.25.15	So when you buy or sell farmland, the price is to be determined by the number of crops it can produce before the next Year of Celebration. Don't try to cheat. 
LEV.25.16	If it is a long time before the next Year of Celebration, the price will be higher, because what is really being sold are the crops that the land can produce. 
LEV.25.17	I am the 
LEV.25.18+LEV.25.19	If you obey my laws and teachings, you will live safely in the land and enjoy its abundant crops. 
LEV.25.20	Don't ever worry about what you will eat during the seventh year when you are forbidden to plant or harvest. 
LEV.25.21	I will see to it that you harvest enough in the sixth year to last for three years. 
LEV.25.22	In the eighth year you will live on what you harvested in the sixth year, but in the ninth year you will eat what you plant and harvest in the eighth year.
LEV.25.23	No land may be permanently bought or sold. It all belongs to me—it isn't your land, and you only live there for a little while.
LEV.25.24	When property is being sold, the original owner must be given the first chance to buy it.
LEV.25.25	If any of you Israelites become so poor that you are forced to sell your property, your closest relative must buy it back, 
LEV.25.26	if that relative has the money. Later, if you can afford to buy it, 
LEV.25.27	you must pay enough to make up for what the present owner will lose on it before the next Year of Celebration, when the property would become yours again. 
LEV.25.28	But if you don't have the money to pay the present owner a fair price, you will have to wait until the Year of Celebration, when the property will once again become yours.
LEV.25.29	If you sell a house in a walled city, you have only one year in which to buy it back. 
LEV.25.30	If you don't buy it back before that year is up, it becomes the permanent property of the one who bought it, and it will not be returned to you in the Year of Celebration. 
LEV.25.31	But a house out in a village may be bought back at any time just like a field. And it must be returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration. 
LEV.25.32	If any Levites own houses inside a walled city, they will always have the right to buy them back. 
LEV.25.33	And any houses that they do not buy back will be returned to them in the Year of Celebration, because these homes are their permanent property among the people of Israel. 
LEV.25.34	No pastureland owned by the Levi tribe can ever be sold; it is their permanent possession.
LEV.25.36+LEV.25.37	 Don't take advantage of them by charging any kind of interest or selling them food for profit. Instead, honor me by letting them stay where they now live. 
LEV.25.38	Remember—I am the 
LEV.25.40	Then you must treat them as servants, rather than as slaves. And in the Year of Celebration they are to be set free, 
LEV.25.41	so they and their children may return home to their families and property. 
LEV.25.42	I brought them out of Egypt to be my servants, not to be sold as slaves. 
LEV.25.43	So obey me, and don't be cruel to the poor.
LEV.25.44	If you want slaves, buy them from other nations 
LEV.25.45	or from the foreigners who live in your own country, and make them your property. 
LEV.25.46	You can own them, and even leave them to your children when you die, but do not make slaves of your own people or be cruel to them.
LEV.25.47	Even if some of you Israelites become so much in debt that you must sell yourselves to foreigners in your country, 
LEV.25.48	you still have the right to be set free by a relative, such as a brother 
LEV.25.49	or uncle or cousin, or some other family member. In fact, if you ever get enough money, you may buy your own freedom 
LEV.25.50	by paying your owner for the number of years you would still be a slave before the next Year of Celebration. 
LEV.25.51+LEV.25.52	The longer the time until then, the more you will have to pay. 
LEV.25.53	And even while you are the slaves of foreigners in your own country, your people must make sure that you are not mistreated. 
LEV.25.54	If you cannot gain your freedom in any of these ways, both you and your children will still be set free in the Year of Celebration. 
LEV.25.55	People of Israel, I am the 
LEV.26.2	Respect the Sabbath and honor the place where I am worshiped, because I am the 
LEV.26.4	and I will send rain to make your crops grow and your trees produce fruit. 
LEV.26.5	Your harvest of grain and grapes will be so abundant, that you won't know what to do with it all. You will eat and be satisfied, and you will live in safety. 
LEV.26.6	I will bless your country with peace, and you will rest without fear. I will wipe out the dangerous animals and protect you from enemy attacks. 
LEV.26.7	You will chase and destroy your enemies, 
LEV.26.8	even if there are only 5 of you and 100 of them, or only 100 of you and 10,000 of them. 
LEV.26.9	I will treat you with such kindness that your nation will grow strong, and I will also keep my promises to you. 
LEV.26.10	Your barns will overflow with grain each year. 
LEV.26.11	I will live among you and never again look on you with disgust. 
LEV.26.12	 I will walk with you—I will be your God, and you will be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I am the 
LEV.26.16	I will punish you terribly, and you will be ruined. You will be struck with incurable diseases and with fever that leads to blindness and depression. Your enemies will eat the crops you plant, 
LEV.26.17	and I will turn from you and let you be destroyed by your attackers. You will even run at the very rumor of attack. 
LEV.26.18	Then, if you still refuse to obey me, I will punish you seven times for each of your sins, 
LEV.26.19	until your pride is completely crushed. I will hold back the rain, so the sky above you will be like iron, and the ground beneath your feet will be like copper. 
LEV.26.20	All of your hard work will be for nothing—and there will be no harvest of grain or fruit.
LEV.26.21	If you keep rebelling against me, I'll punish you seven times worse, just as your sins deserve! 
LEV.26.22	I'll send wild animals to attack you, and they will gobble up your children and livestock. So few of you will be left that your roads will be deserted.
LEV.26.23	If you remain my enemies after this, 
LEV.26.24	I'll remain your enemy and punish you even worse. 
LEV.26.25	War will break out because you broke our agreement, and if you escape to your walled cities, I'll punish you with horrible diseases, and you will be captured by your enemies. 
LEV.26.26	You will have such a shortage of bread, that ten women will be able to bake their bread in the same oven. Each of you will get only a few crumbs, and you will go hungry.
LEV.26.27	Then if you don't stop rebelling, 
LEV.26.28	I'll really get furious and punish you terribly for your sins! 
LEV.26.29	In fact, you will be so desperate for food that you will eat your own children. 
LEV.26.30	I'll destroy your shrines and tear down your incense altars, leaving your dead bodies piled on top of your idols. And you will be disgusting to me. 
LEV.26.31	I'll wipe out your towns and your places of worship and will no longer be pleased with the smell of your sacrifices. 
LEV.26.32	Your land will become so desolate that even your enemies who settle there will be shocked when they see it. 
LEV.26.33	After I destroy your towns and ruin your land with war, I'll scatter you among the nations.
LEV.26.34+LEV.26.35	While you are prisoners in foreign lands, your own land will enjoy years of rest and refreshment, as it should have done each seventh year when you lived there. 
LEV.26.36+LEV.26.37	In the land of your enemies, you will tremble at the rustle of a leaf, as though it were a sword. And you will become so weak that you will stumble and fall over each other, even when no one is chasing you. 
LEV.26.38	Many of you will die in foreign lands, 
LEV.26.39	and others of you will waste away in sorrow as the result of your sins and the sins of your ancestors.
LEV.26.40+LEV.26.41	Then suppose you realize that I turned against you and brought you to the land of your enemies because both you and your ancestors had stubbornly sinned against me. If you humbly confess what you have done and start living right, 
LEV.26.42	 I'll keep the promise I made to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will bless your land 
LEV.26.43	and let it rest during the time that you are in a foreign country, paying for your rebellion against me and my laws.
LEV.26.45	While nations watched, I rescued your ancestors from Egypt so that I would be their God. Yes, I am your 
LEV.26.46	Moses was on Mount Sinai when the 
LEV.27.1	The 
LEV.27.2	to say to the community of Israel:
LEV.27.2	If you ever want to free someone who has been promised to me, 
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	you may do so by paying the following amounts, weighed according to the official standards:
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	50 pieces of silver for men
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	ages 20 to 60,
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	and 30 pieces for women;
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	20 pieces of silver
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	for young men ages 5 to 20,
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	and 10 pieces
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	for young women;
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	15 pieces of silver for men
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	ages 60 and above
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	and 10 pieces for women;
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	5 pieces of silver for boys
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	ages 1 month to 5 years,
LEV.27.3+LEV.27.4+LEV.27.5+LEV.27.6+LEV.27.7	and 3 pieces for girls.
LEV.27.8	If you have promised to give someone to me and can't afford to pay the full amount for that person's release, you will be taken to a priest, and he will decide how much you can afford.
LEV.27.9	If you promise to sacrifice an animal to me, it becomes holy, and there is no way you can set it free. 
LEV.27.10	If you try to substitute any other animal, no matter how good, for the one you promised, they will both become holy and must be sacrificed. 
LEV.27.11	Donkeys are unfit for sacrifice, so if you promise me a donkey,
LEV.27.12	and let him determine its value. 
LEV.27.13	But if you want to buy it back, you must pay an additional 20 percent.
LEV.27.14	If you promise a house to me, a priest will set the price, whatever the condition of the house. 
LEV.27.15	But if you decide to buy it back, you must pay an additional 20 percent.
LEV.27.16	If you promise part of your family's land to me, its value must be determined by the amount of seed needed to plant the land, and the rate will be ten pieces of silver for every 20 kilograms of seed. 
LEV.27.17	If this promise is made in the Year of Celebration,
LEV.27.18	But any time after that, the price will be figured according to the number of years before the next Year of Celebration. 
LEV.27.19	If you decide to buy back the land, you must pay the price plus an additional 20 percent, 
LEV.27.20	but you cannot buy it back once someone else has bought it. 
LEV.27.21	When the Year of Celebration comes, the land becomes holy because it belongs to me, and it will be given to the priests.
LEV.27.22	If you promise me a field that you have bought, 
LEV.27.23	its value will be decided by a priest, according to the number of years before the next Year of Celebration, and the money you pay will be mine. 
LEV.27.24	However, on the next Year of Celebration, the land will go back to the family of its original owner. 
LEV.27.25	Every price will be set by the official standards.
LEV.27.26	All first-born animals of your flocks and herds are already mine, and so you cannot promise any of them to me. 
LEV.27.27	If you promise me a donkey,
LEV.27.29	In fact, any humans who have been promised to me in this way must be put to death.
LEV.27.31	If you want to buy back this part of your harvest, you may do so by paying what it is worth plus an additional 20 percent.
LEV.27.32	When you count your flocks and herds, one out of ten of every newborn animal
LEV.27.33	no matter how good or bad it is. If you substitute one animal for another, both of them become holy, and neither can be bought back.

NUM.3.22	and they had 7,500 men and boys at least one month old. 
NUM.3.23+NUM.3.24	The Gershonites, under the leadership of Eliasaph son of Lael, were to camp on the west side of the sacred tent.

NUM.3.26	the curtains hanging inside the courtyard around the tent, as well as the curtain and ropes for the entrance to the courtyard and its altar. The Gershonites were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down.

NUM.3.31	Their duties at the tent included taking care of the sacred chest, the table for the sacred bread, the lampstand, the altars, the objects used for worship, and the curtain in front of the most holy place. The Kohathites were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down.
NUM.3.32	Eleazar son of Aaron was the head of the Levite leaders, and he made sure that the work at the sacred tent was done.
NUM.3.33	The two Merari clans were the Mahlites and the Mushites, 
NUM.3.34	and they had 6,200 men and boys at least one month old. 
NUM.3.35	The Merarites, under the leadership of Zuriel son of Abihail, were to camp on the north side of the sacred tent. 
NUM.3.36+NUM.3.37	Their duties included taking care of the tent frames and the pieces that held the tent up: the bars, the posts, the stands, and its other equipment. They were also in charge of the posts that supported the courtyard, as well as their stands, tent pegs, and ropes. The Merari clans were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down.
NUM.3.38	Moses, Aaron, and his sons were to camp in front of the sacred tent, on the east side, and to make sure that the Israelites worshiped in the proper way. Anyone else who tried to do the work of Moses and Aaron was to be put to death.
NUM.3.39	So Moses and Aaron obeyed the 
NUM.3.40	The 
NUM.3.41	They belong to me, but I will accept the Levites as substitutes for them, and I will accept the Levites' livestock as substitutes for the Israelites' first-born livestock.”
NUM.3.42	Moses obeyed the

NUM.3.44	Then the 
NUM.3.45	“The Levites will belong to me and will take the place of the first-born sons; their livestock will take the place of the Israelites' first-born livestock. 
NUM.3.46	But since there are more first-born sons than Levites, the extra 273 men and boys must be bought back from me. 
NUM.3.47	For each one, you are to collect five pieces of silver, weighed according to the official standards. 
NUM.3.48	This money must then be given to Aaron and his sons.”
NUM.3.49	Moses collected the silver from the extra 273 first-born men and boys, 
NUM.3.50	and it amounted to 1,365 pieces of silver, weighed according to the official standards.

NUM.4.5	When the Israelites are ready to move their camp, Aaron and his sons will enter the tent and take down the curtain that separates the sacred chest from the rest of the tent. They will cover the chest with this curtain, 
NUM.4.6	and then with a piece of fine leather, and cover it all with a solid blue cloth. After this they will put the carrying poles in place.
NUM.4.7	Next, Aaron and his sons will use another blue cloth to cover the table for the sacred bread.
NUM.4.8	They are to cover all of this with a bright red cloth, and then with a piece of fine leather, before putting the carrying poles in place.
NUM.4.9	With another blue cloth they will cover the lampstand, along with the lamps, the lamp snuffers, the fire pans, and the jars of oil for the lamps. 
NUM.4.10	All of this will then be covered with a piece of fine leather and placed on a carrying frame.
NUM.4.11	The gold incense altar
NUM.4.12	Next, Aaron and his sons will take blue cloth and wrap all the objects used in worship at the sacred tent. These will need to be covered with a piece of fine leather, then placed on a carrying frame.
NUM.4.13	They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and cover it with a purple cloth. 
NUM.4.14	On that cloth will be placed the utensils used at the altar, including the fire pans, the meat forks, the shovels, and the sprinkling bowls. All of this will then be covered with a piece of fine leather, before the carrying poles are put in place.
NUM.4.15	When the camp is ready to be moved, the Kohathites will be responsible for carrying the sacred objects and the furnishings of the sacred tent. But Aaron and his sons must have already covered those things so the Kohathites won't touch them and die.
NUM.4.16	Eleazar son of Aaron the priest will be in charge of the oil for the lamps, the sweet-smelling incense, the grain for the sacrifices, and the olive oil used for dedications and ordinations. Eleazar is responsible for seeing that the sacred tent, its furnishings, and the sacred objects are taken care of.
NUM.4.17+NUM.4.18+NUM.4.19+NUM.4.20	The Kohathites must not go near or even look at the sacred objects until Aaron and his sons have covered those objects. If they do, their entire clan will be wiped out. So make sure that Aaron and his sons go into the tent with them and tell them what to carry.

NUM.6.3	 you must no longer drink any wine or beer or use any kind of vinegar. Don't drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins— 
NUM.6.4	not even the seeds or skins.
NUM.6.5	The hair of a Nazirite is sacred to me, and as long as you are a Nazirite, you must never cut your hair.
NUM.6.6	During the time that you are a Nazirite, you must never go close to a dead body, 
NUM.6.7+NUM.6.8	not even that of your father, mother, brother, or sister. That would make you unclean. Your hair is the sign that you are dedicated to me, so remain holy.
NUM.6.9	If someone suddenly dies near you, your hair is no longer sacred, and you must shave it seven days later during the ceremony to make you clean. 
NUM.6.10	Then on the next day, bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the sacred tent. 
NUM.6.11	He will offer one of the birds as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me.
NUM.6.12	But the dead body made you unacceptable, so you must make another vow to become a Nazirite and be dedicated once more. Finally, a year-old ram must be offered as the sacrifice to make things right.
NUM.6.14	and offer three animals that have nothing wrong with them: a year-old ram as a sacrifice to please me, a year-old female lamb as a sacrifice for sin, and a full-grown ram as a sacrifice to ask my blessing.
NUM.6.15	Wine offerings and grain sacrifices must also be brought with these animals. Finally, you are to bring a basket of bread made with your finest flour and olive oil, but without yeast. Also bring some thin wafers brushed with oil.
NUM.6.16	The priest will take these gifts to my altar and offer them, so that I will be pleased and will forgive you. 
NUM.6.17	Then he will sacrifice the ram and offer the wine, grain, and bread.
NUM.6.18	After that, you will stand at the entrance to the sacred tent, shave your head, and put the hair in the fire where the priest has offered the sacrifice to ask my blessing.
NUM.6.19	Once the meat from the ram's shoulder has been boiled, the priest will take it, along with one loaf of bread and one wafer brushed with oil, and give them to you. 
NUM.6.20	You will hand them back to the priest, who will lift them up
NUM.6.21	These are the requirements for Nazirites. However, if you can afford to offer more, you must do so.
NUM.6.22	The 
NUM.6.23	“When Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel, they must say:
NUM.6.24	I pray that the 
NUM.6.24	will bless and protect you,
NUM.6.25	and that he will show you mercy
NUM.6.25	and kindness.
NUM.6.26	May the 
NUM.6.26	and give you peace.”
NUM.6.27	Then the 
NUM.7.1	When Moses had finished setting up the sacred tent, he dedicated it to the 
NUM.7.2	Then the twelve tribal leaders of Israel, the same men who had been in charge of counting the people,
NUM.7.3	with gifts for the 
NUM.7.4	The 
NUM.7.5	“Accept these gifts, so the Levites can use them here at the sacred tent for carrying the sacred things.”
NUM.7.6	Then Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites, 
NUM.7.7+NUM.7.8	who were under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron. Moses gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites for their work, and four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites for their work. 
NUM.7.9	But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were in charge of the sacred objects that had to be carried on their shoulders.
NUM.7.10	On the day the altar was dedicated, the twelve leaders brought offerings for its dedication.

NUM.13.17	Before Moses sent them into Canaan, he said:
NUM.13.17	After you go through the Southern Desert of Canaan, continue north into the hill country 
NUM.13.18	and find out what those regions are like. Be sure to remember how many people live there, how strong they are, 
NUM.13.19+NUM.13.20	and if they live in open towns or walled cities. See if the land is good for growing crops and find out what kinds of trees grow there. It's time for grapes to ripen, so try to bring back some of the fruit that grows there.
NUM.13.21	The twelve men left to explore Canaan from the Zin Desert in the south all the way to the town of Rehob near Lebo-Hamath in the north. 
NUM.13.22	As they went through the Southern Desert, they came to the town of Hebron, which was seven years older than the Egyptian town of Zoan. In Hebron, they saw the three Anakim
NUM.13.23+NUM.13.24	When they got to Bunch Valley,
NUM.13.25	After exploring the land of Canaan for 40 days, 
NUM.13.26	the twelve men returned to Kadesh in the Paran Desert and told Moses, Aaron, and the people what they had seen. They showed them the fruit 
NUM.13.27	and said:
NUM.13.27	Look at this fruit! The land we explored is rich with milk and honey. 
NUM.13.28	But the people who live there are strong, and their cities are large and walled. We even saw the three Anakim
NUM.13.29	Besides that, the Amalekites live in the Southern Desert; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are in the hill country; and the Canaanites
NUM.13.30	Caleb calmed down the crowd and said, “Let's go and take the land. I know we can do it!”
NUM.13.31	But the other men replied, “Those people are much too strong for us.” 
NUM.13.32	Then they started spreading rumors and saying, “We won't be able to grow anything in that soil. And the people are like giants. 
NUM.13.33	 In fact, we saw the Nephilim who are the ancestors of the Anakim. They were so big that we felt as small as grasshoppers.”
NUM.14.1	After the Israelites heard the report from the twelve men who had explored Canaan, the people cried all night 
NUM.14.2	and complained to Moses and Aaron, “We wish we had died in Egypt or somewhere out here in the desert! 
NUM.14.3	Is the 
NUM.14.4	Then they said to one another, “Let's choose our own leader and go back.”
NUM.14.5	Moses and Aaron bowed down to pray in front of the crowd. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in sorrow 
NUM.14.7	and said:
NUM.14.7	We saw the land ourselves, and it's very good. 
NUM.14.8	If we obey the 
NUM.14.9	 So don't rebel. We have no reason to be afraid of the people who live there. The 
NUM.14.10	The crowd threatened to stone Moses and Aaron to death. But just then, the 
NUM.14.11	The 
NUM.14.12	So they will no longer be my people. I will destroy them, but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs.”
NUM.14.13+NUM.14.14+NUM.14.15+NUM.14.16	With your mighty power you rescued your people from Egypt, so please don't destroy us here in the desert. If you do, the Egyptians will hear about it and tell the people of Canaan. Those Canaanites already know that we are your people, and that we see you face to face. And they have heard how you lead us with a thick cloud during the day and flaming fire at night. But if you kill us, they will claim it was because you weren't powerful enough to lead us into Canaan as you promised.
NUM.14.17	Show us your great power, 
NUM.14.18	 that you love to show mercy and kindness. And you said that you are very patient, but that you will punish everyone guilty of doing wrong—not only them but their children and grandchildren as well.
NUM.14.19	You are merciful, and you treat people better than they deserve. So please forgive these people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.
NUM.14.20	Then the 
NUM.14.20	In answer to your prayer, I do forgive them. 
NUM.14.21	 But as surely as I live and my power has no limit, 
NUM.14.22+NUM.14.23	I swear that not one of these Israelites will enter the land I promised to give their ancestors. These people have seen my power in Egypt and in the desert, but they will never see Canaan. They have disobeyed and tested me too many times.
NUM.14.25	Now listen, Moses! The Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys of Canaan.
NUM.14.26	The 
NUM.14.27+NUM.14.28	to give this message to the people of Israel:
NUM.14.27+NUM.14.28	You sinful people have complained against me too many times! Now I swear by my own life that I will give you exactly what you wanted.
NUM.14.29	 You will die right here in the desert, and your dead bodies will cover the ground. You have insulted me, and none of you men who are over 20 years old 
NUM.14.30	will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give you as your own—only Caleb and Joshua
NUM.14.31	You were worried that your own children would be captured. But I, the 
NUM.14.32	You will die here in the desert! 
NUM.14.33	 Your children will wander around in this desert 40 years, suffering because of your sins, until all of you are dead. 
NUM.14.34	I will punish you severely every day for the next 40 years—one year for each day that the land was explored. 
NUM.14.35	You sinful people who ganged up against me will die here in the desert.
NUM.14.36	Ten of the men sent to explore the land had brought back bad news and had made the people complain against the 
NUM.14.37	So he sent a deadly disease that killed those men, 
NUM.14.38	but he let Joshua and Caleb live.
NUM.14.39	The people of Israel were very sad after Moses gave them the 
NUM.14.40	So they got up early the next morning and got ready to head toward the hill country of Canaan. They said, “We were wrong to complain about the 
NUM.14.41	But Moses replied, “You're disobeying the 
NUM.14.42+NUM.14.43	so don't even try it. The 
NUM.14.44	But the Israelites ignored Moses
NUM.14.45	The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down from the hill country, defeated the Israelites, and chased them as far as the town of Hormah.
NUM.15.1	The 
NUM.15.2	to give the Israelites the following laws about offering sacrifices:
NUM.15.3	Bulls or rams or goats
NUM.15.4+NUM.15.5	If you sacrifice a young ram or goat, you must also offer a kilogram of your finest flour mixed with a liter of olive oil as a grain sacrifice. A liter of wine must also be poured on the altar.
NUM.15.6+NUM.15.7	And if the animal is a full-grown ram, you must offer two kilograms of flour mixed with one and a half liters of olive oil. One and a half liters of wine must also be poured on the altar. The smell of this smoke is pleasing to me.
NUM.15.8	If a bull is offered as a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing,
NUM.15.9	you must offer three kilograms of flour mixed with two liters of olive oil. 
NUM.15.10	Two liters of wine must also be poured on the altar. The smell of this smoke is pleasing to me.
NUM.15.11+NUM.15.12+NUM.15.13	If you are a native Israelite, you must obey these rules each time you offer a bull, a ram, or a goat as a sacrifice. 
NUM.15.14	And the foreigners who live among you must also follow these rules. 
NUM.15.15+NUM.15.16	 This law will never change. I am the 
NUM.15.17+NUM.15.18+NUM.15.19	When you eat food in the land that I am giving you, remember to set aside some of it as an offering to me. 
NUM.15.20	From the first batch of bread dough that you make after each new grain harvest, make a loaf of bread and offer it to me, just as you offer grain. 
NUM.15.21	All your descendants must follow this law and offer part of the first batch of bread dough.
NUM.15.22+NUM.15.23	The 
NUM.15.24	If all of you disobey one of my laws without knowing it, you must offer a bull as a sacrifice to please me, together with a grain sacrifice, a wine offering, and a goat as a sacrifice for sin. 
NUM.15.25	Then the priest will pray and ask me to forgive you. And since you did not mean to do wrong, and you offered sacrifices, 
NUM.15.26	the sin of everyone—both Israelites and foreigners among you—will be forgiven.
NUM.15.28	The priest will then ask me to forgive you, and your sin will be forgiven.
NUM.15.29	The law will be the same for anyone who does wrong without meaning to, whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you.
NUM.15.30+NUM.15.31	But if one of you does wrong on purpose, whether Israelite or foreigner, you have sinned against me by disobeying my laws. You will no longer belong to my people.
NUM.15.32	Once, while the Israelites were traveling through the desert, a man was caught gathering firewood on the Sabbath.
NUM.15.33	He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the rest of the community. 
NUM.15.34	But no one knew what to do with him, so he was not allowed to leave.
NUM.15.35	Then the 
NUM.15.36	So he was killed, just as the 
NUM.15.37	The 
NUM.15.38	 to say to the people of Israel, “Sew tassels onto the bottom edge of your clothes and tie a blue string to each tassel. 
NUM.15.39+NUM.15.40	These will remind you that you must obey my laws and teachings. And when you do, you will be dedicated to me and won't follow your own sinful desires. 
NUM.15.41	I am the 
NUM.16.3	and Aaron and said, “Why do you think you're so much better than everyone else? We're part of the 
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard this, he knelt down to pray.
NUM.16.5	Then he said to Korah and his followers:
NUM.16.5	Tomorrow morning the 
NUM.16.6+NUM.16.7	Korah, here is what you and your followers must do: Get some fire pans, fill them with coals and incense, and place them near the sacred tent. And the man the 
NUM.16.8+NUM.16.9	You know that the God of Israel has chosen you Levites from all Israel to serve him by being in charge of the sacred tent and by helping the community to worship in the proper way. What more do you want? 
NUM.16.10	The 
NUM.16.11	You and your followers have rebelled against the 
NUM.16.12	Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they sent back this message: “We won't come! 
NUM.16.13	It's bad enough that you took us from our rich farmland in Egypt to let us die here in the desert. Now you also want to boss us around! 
NUM.16.14	You keep promising us rich farmlands with fertile fields and vineyards—but where are they? Stop trying to trick these people. No, we won't come to see you.”
NUM.16.15	Moses was very angry and said to the 
NUM.16.16	Then he said to Korah, “Tomorrow you and your followers must go with Aaron to the 
NUM.16.17	Each of you take along your fire pan with incense in it and offer the incense to the 
NUM.16.18	The next day the men placed incense and coals in their fire pans and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the sacred tent. 
NUM.16.19	Meanwhile, Korah had convinced the rest of the Israelites to rebel against their two leaders.
NUM.16.19	When that happened, the 
NUM.16.20	and said to Moses and Aaron, 
NUM.16.21	“Get away from the rest of the Israelites so I can kill them at once!”
NUM.16.22	But the two men bowed down and prayed, “Our God, you gave these people life. Why would you punish everyone here when only one man has sinned?”
NUM.16.23	The 
NUM.16.24	“Tell the people to stay away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
NUM.16.25	Moses walked over to Dathan and Abiram, and the other leaders of Israel followed. 
NUM.16.26	Then Moses warned the people, “Get away from the tents of these sinful men! Don't touch anything that belongs to them or you'll be wiped out.” 
NUM.16.27	So everyone moved away from those tents, except Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their families.
NUM.16.28	Moses said to the crowd, “The 
NUM.16.29	If these men die a natural death, it means the 
NUM.16.30	But suppose the 
NUM.16.31	As soon as Moses said this, the ground under the men opened up 
NUM.16.32+NUM.16.33	and swallowed them alive, together with their families and everything they owned. Then the ground closed back up, and they were gone.
NUM.16.34	The rest of the Israelites heard their screams, so they ran off, shouting, “We don't want that to happen to us!”
NUM.16.35	Suddenly the 
NUM.16.36	Then the 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Aaron's son Eleazar to take the fire pans from the smoldering fire and scatter the coals. The pans are now sacred, 
NUM.16.38	because they were used for offering incense to me. Have them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar. Those men died because of their sin, and now their fire pans will become a warning for the rest of the community.”
NUM.16.39	Eleazar collected the pans and had them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar, 
NUM.16.40	just as the 
NUM.16.41	The next day the people of Israel again complained against Moses and Aaron, “The two of you killed some of the 
NUM.16.42	As the people crowded around them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the sacred tent, and the 
NUM.16.43	So Moses and Aaron walked to the front of the tent, 
NUM.16.44	 where the 
NUM.16.45	“Stand back! I am going to wipe out these Israelites once and for all.”
NUM.16.45	They immediately bowed down and prayed. 
NUM.16.46	Then Moses told Aaron, “Grab your fire pan and fill it with hot coals from the altar. Put incense in it, then quickly take it to where the people are and offer it to the 
NUM.16.47+NUM.16.48	Aaron did exactly what he had been told. He ran over to the crowd of people and stood between the dead bodies and the people who were still alive. He placed the incense on the pan, then offered it to the 
NUM.16.49	But 14,700 Israelites were dead, not counting those who had died with Korah and his followers.
NUM.16.50	Aaron walked back and stood with Moses at the sacred tent.
NUM.17.1	The 
NUM.17.2+NUM.17.3	Call together the twelve tribes of Israel and tell the leader of each tribe to write his name on the walking stick he carries as a symbol of his authority. Make sure Aaron's name is written on the one from the Levi tribe, then collect all the sticks.
NUM.17.4	Place these sticks in the tent right in front of the sacred chest where I appear to you. 
NUM.17.5	I will then choose a man to be my priest, and his stick will sprout. After that happens, I won't have to listen to any more complaints about you.
NUM.17.6	Moses told the people what the 
NUM.17.7	Moses took them and placed them in the 
NUM.17.9	Moses brought the twelve sticks out of the tent and showed them to the people. Each of the leaders found his own and took it.
NUM.17.10	But the 
NUM.17.11	Moses did what he was told.
NUM.17.12	The Israelites cried out to Moses, “We're done for 
NUM.17.13	and doomed if we even go near the sacred tent!”
NUM.18.1	The 
NUM.18.1	You, your sons, and the other Levites of the Kohath clan, are responsible for what happens at the sacred tent.
NUM.18.2	The Levites are your relatives and are here to help you in your service at the tent. 
NUM.18.3	You must see that they perform their duties. But if they go near any of the sacred objects or the altar, all of you will die. 
NUM.18.4	No one else is allowed to take care of the sacred tent or do anything connected with it. 
NUM.18.5	Follow these instructions, so I won't become angry and punish the Israelites ever again.
NUM.18.6	I alone chose the Levites from all the other tribes to belong to me, and I have given them to you as your helpers. 
NUM.18.7	But only you and your sons can serve as priests at the altar and in the most holy place. Your work as priests is a gift from me, and anyone else who tries to do that work must be put to death.
NUM.18.8+NUM.18.9	The 
NUM.18.8+NUM.18.9	I have put you in charge of the sacred gifts and sacrifices that the Israelites bring to me. And from now on, you, your sons, and your descendants will receive part of the sacrifices for sin, as well as part of the grain sacrifices, and the sacrifices to make things right. Your share of these sacrifices will be the parts not burned on the altar. 
NUM.18.10	Since these things are sacred, they must be eaten near the sacred tent, but only men are allowed to eat them.
NUM.18.11	You will also receive part of the special gifts and offerings that the Israelites bring to me. Any member of your family who is clean and acceptable for worship can eat these things. 
NUM.18.12	For example, when the Israelites bring me the first batches of oil, wine, and grain, you can have the best parts of those gifts. 
NUM.18.13	And the first part of the crops from their fields and vineyards also belongs to you. The people will offer this to me, then anyone in your family who is clean may have some of it.
NUM.18.15	The first-born son in every Israelite family, as well as the first-born males of their flocks and herds, belong to me. But every first-born son and first-born donkey
NUM.18.16	The price for a first-born son who is at least one month old will be five pieces of silver, weighed according to the official standards. 
NUM.18.17	However, all first-born cattle, sheep, and goats belong to me and cannot be bought back. Splatter their blood on the altar and send their fat up in smoke, so I can smell it and be pleased. 
NUM.18.18	You are allowed to eat the meat of those animals, just as you can eat the choice ribs and the right hind leg of the special sacrifices.
NUM.18.19	From now on, the sacred offerings that the Israelites give to me will belong to you, your sons, and your daughters. This is my promise to you and your descendants, and it will never change.
NUM.18.20	You will not receive any land in Israel as your own. I am the 
NUM.18.22+NUM.18.23	They are the only ones allowed to work at the tent, and they must not let anyone else come near it. Those who do come near must be put to death, and the Levites will also be punished. This law will never change.
NUM.18.22+NUM.18.23	Since the Levites won't be given any land in Israel as their own, 
NUM.18.24	they will be given the crops and newborn animals that the Israelites offer to me.
NUM.18.25	The 
NUM.18.26	to say to the Levites:
NUM.18.26	When you receive from the people of Israel ten percent of their crops and newborn animals, you must offer a tenth of that to me. 
NUM.18.27	Just as the Israelites give me part of their grain and wine, you must set aside part of what you receive 
NUM.18.28	as an offering to me. That amount must then be given to Aaron, 
NUM.18.29	so the best of what you receive will be mine.
NUM.18.30	After you have dedicated the best parts to me, you can eat the rest, just as the Israelites eat part of their grain and wine after offering them to me.
NUM.18.31	Your share may be eaten anywhere by anyone in your family, because it is your pay for working at the sacred tent. 
NUM.18.32	You won't be punished for eating it, as long as you have already offered the best parts to me.
NUM.18.32	The gifts and sacrifices brought by the people must remain sacred, and if you eat any part of them before they are offered to me, you will be put to death.
NUM.19.1+NUM.19.2	The 
NUM.19.1+NUM.19.2	The people of Israel must bring Moses a reddish-brown cow that has nothing wrong with it and that has never been used for plowing. 
NUM.19.3	Moses will give it to Eleazar the priest, then it will be led outside the camp and killed while Eleazar watches. 
NUM.19.4	He will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the direction of the sacred tent. 
NUM.19.5	Then the whole cow, including its skin, meat, blood, and insides must be burned. 
NUM.19.6	A priest
NUM.19.7	After the ceremony, the priest is to take a bath and wash his clothes. Only then can he go back into the camp, but he remains unclean and unfit for worship until evening. 
NUM.19.8	The man who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and take a bath, but he is also unclean until evening.
NUM.19.10	The man who collects the ashes must wash his clothes, but will remain unclean until evening. This law must always be obeyed by the people of Israel and the foreigners living among them.
NUM.19.11	If you touch a dead body, you will be unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.12	But if you wash with the water mixed with the cow's ashes on the third day and again on the seventh day, you will be clean and acceptable for worship. You must wash yourself on those days; if you don't, you will remain unclean. 
NUM.19.13	Suppose you touch a dead body, but refuse to be made clean by washing with the water mixed with ashes. You will be guilty of making my sacred tent unclean and will no longer belong to the people of Israel.
NUM.19.14	If someone dies in a tent while you are there, you will be unclean for seven days. And anyone who later enters the tent will also be unclean. 
NUM.19.15	Any open jar in the tent is unclean.
NUM.19.16	If you touch the body of someone who died or was killed, or if you touch a human bone or a grave, you will be unclean for seven days.
NUM.19.17+NUM.19.18	Before you can be made clean, someone who is clean must take some of the ashes from the burnt cow and stir them into a pot of spring water. That same person must dip a hyssop branch in the water and ashes, then sprinkle it on the tent and everything in it, including everyone who was inside. If you have touched a human bone, a grave, or a dead body, you must be sprinkled with that water. 
NUM.19.19	If this is done on the third day and on the seventh day, you will be clean. Then after you take a bath and wash your clothes, you can worship that evening.
NUM.19.20	If you are unclean and refuse to be made clean by washing with the water mixed with ashes, you will be guilty of making my sacred tent unclean, and you will no longer belong to the people of Israel. 
NUM.19.21	These laws will never change.
NUM.19.21	The man who sprinkled the water and the ashes on you when you were unclean must also wash his clothes. And whoever touches this water is unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.22	When you are unclean, everything you touch becomes unclean, and anyone who touches you will be unclean until evening.
NUM.20.1	The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month
NUM.20.3	and complained, “Moses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the 
NUM.20.4	You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die! 
NUM.20.5	Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates.
NUM.20.6	Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The 
NUM.20.7+NUM.20.8	and said, “Moses, get your walking stick.
NUM.20.9	Moses obeyed and took his stick from the sacred tent. 
NUM.20.10	After he and Aaron had gathered the people around the rock, he said, “Look, you rebellious people, and you will see water flow from this rock!” 
NUM.20.11	 He raised his stick in the air and struck the rock two times. At once, water gushed from the rock, and the people and their livestock had water to drink.
NUM.20.12	But the 
NUM.20.13	The Israelites had complained against the 
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Israel's camp near Kadesh with this message for the king of Edom:
NUM.20.14	We are Israelites, your own relatives, and we're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us. 
NUM.20.15	Our ancestors settled in Egypt and lived there a long time. But later the Egyptians were cruel to us, 
NUM.20.16	and when we begged our 
NUM.20.16	Now we are camped at the border of your territory, near the town of Kadesh. 
NUM.20.17	Please let us go through your country. We won't go near your fields or vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. We will stay on the main road
NUM.20.18	But the king of Edom answered, “No, I won't let you go through our country! And if you try, we will attack you.”
NUM.20.19	Moses sent back this message: “We promise to stay on the main road, and if any of us or our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We just want to pass through.”
NUM.20.20	But the king insisted, “You can't go through our land!”
NUM.20.20	Then Edom sent out its strongest troops 
NUM.20.21	to keep Israel from passing through its territory. So the Israelites had to go in another direction.
NUM.20.22	After the Israelites had left Kadesh and had gone as far as Mount Hor 
NUM.20.23	on the Edomite border, the 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron, this is where you will die. You and Moses disobeyed me at Meribah, and so you will not enter the land I promised the Israelites. 
NUM.20.25	Moses, go with Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of the mountain. 
NUM.20.26	Then take Aaron's priestly robe from him and place it on Eleazar. Aaron will die there.”
NUM.20.27	Moses obeyed, and everyone watched as he and Aaron and Eleazar walked to the top of Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.28	 Moses then took the priestly robe from Aaron and placed it on Eleazar. Aaron died there.
NUM.20.28	When Moses and Eleazar came down, 
NUM.20.29	the people knew that Aaron had died, and they mourned his death for 30 days.
NUM.21.2	The Israelites prayed, “Our 
NUM.21.3	The 
NUM.21.5	 that they complained against God and said to Moses, “Did you bring us out of Egypt, just to let us die in the desert? There's no water out here, and we can't stand this awful food!”
NUM.21.6	Then the 
NUM.21.7	Some of the people went to Moses and admitted, “It was wrong of us to insult you and the 
NUM.21.7	Moses prayed, 
NUM.21.8	and the 
NUM.21.10	As the Israelites continued their journey to Canaan, they camped at Oboth, 
NUM.21.11	then at Iye-Abarim in the desert east of Moab, 
NUM.21.12	and then in the Zered Gorge. 
NUM.21.13	After that, they crossed the Arnon River gorge and camped in the Moabite desert bordering Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	A song in 
NUM.21.15	with its valleys that lie alongside the Moabite border and extend to the town of Ar.
NUM.21.16	From the Arnon, the Israelites went to the well near the town of Beer, where the 
NUM.21.17	That's also the same well the Israelites sang about in this song:
NUM.21.17	Let's celebrate!
NUM.21.17	The well has given us water.
NUM.21.18	With their royal scepters,
NUM.21.18	our leaders pointed out
NUM.21.18	where to dig the well.
NUM.21.18	The Israelites left the desert and camped near the town of Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	then at Nahaliel, and then at Bamoth. 
NUM.21.20	Finally, they reached Moabite territory, where they camped near Mount Pisgah
NUM.21.21	The Israelites sent this message to King Sihon of the Amorites:
NUM.21.22	Please let us pass through your territory. We promise to stay away from your fields and vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. As long as we're in your land, we'll stay on the main road.
NUM.21.23	But Sihon refused to let Israel travel through his land. Instead, he called together his entire army and marched into the desert to attack Israel near the town of Jahaz. 
NUM.21.24	Israel defeated them and took over the Amorite territory from the Arnon River gorge in the south to the Jabbok River gorge in the north. Beyond the Jabbok was the territory of the Ammonites, who were much stronger than Israel.
NUM.21.25	The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns, including the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages. 
NUM.21.26	King Sihon had ruled from Heshbon, after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge. 
NUM.21.27	That's why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon:
NUM.21.27	Come and rebuild Heshbon,
NUM.21.27	King Sihon's capital city!
NUM.21.28	like fiery flames,
NUM.21.28	burning down the town of Ar
NUM.21.28	and destroying
NUM.21.28	along the Arnon River.
NUM.21.29	You Moabites are done for!
NUM.21.29	Your god Chemosh
NUM.21.29	deserted your people;
NUM.21.29	they were captured, taken away
NUM.21.29	by King Sihon the Amorite.
NUM.21.30	We completely defeated Moab.
NUM.21.30	The towns of Heshbon and Dibon,
NUM.21.30	of Nophah and Medeba
NUM.21.30	are ruined and gone.
NUM.21.31	After the Israelites had settled in the Amorite territory, 
NUM.21.32	Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there.
NUM.21.33	The Israelites headed toward the region of Bashan, where King Og ruled, and he led his entire army to Edrei to meet Israel in battle.
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	So the Israelites wiped out Og, his family, and his entire army—there were no survivors. Then Israel took over the land of Bashan.
NUM.22.1	Israel moved from there to the hills of Moab, where they camped across the Jordan River from the town of Jericho.
NUM.22.2+NUM.22.3	When King Balak
NUM.22.4	They said to the Midianite leaders, “That huge mob of Israelites will wipe out everything in sight, like a bull eating grass in a field.”
NUM.22.4	So King Balak 
NUM.22.5	 sent a message to Balaam son of Beor who lived among his relatives in the town of Pethor near the Euphrates River. It said:
NUM.22.5	I need your help. A large group of people has come here from Egypt and settled near my territory. 
NUM.22.6	They are too powerful for us to defeat, so would you come and place a curse on them? Maybe then we can run them off. I know that anyone you bless will be successful, but anyone you curse will fail.
NUM.22.7	The leaders of Moab and Midian left and took along money to pay Balaam. When they got to his house, they gave him Balak's message.
NUM.22.8	“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and tomorrow I will tell you the 
NUM.22.9	During the night, God asked Balaam, “Who are these people at your house?”
NUM.22.10	“They are messengers from King Balak of Moab,” Balaam answered. “He sent them 
NUM.22.11	to ask me to go to Moab and put a curse on the people who have come there from Egypt. They have settled everywhere around him, and he wants to run them off.”
NUM.22.12	But God replied, “Don't go with Balak's messengers. I have blessed those people who have come from Egypt, so don't curse them.”
NUM.22.13	The next morning, Balaam said to Balak's officials, “Go on back home. The 
NUM.22.14	The officials left and told Balak that Balaam refused to come.
NUM.22.15	Then Balak sent a larger group of officials, who were even more important than the first ones. 
NUM.22.16	They went to Balaam and told him that Balak had said, “Balaam, if you come to Moab, 
NUM.22.17	I'll pay you very well and do whatever you ask. Just come and place a curse on these people.”
NUM.22.18	Balaam answered, “Even if Balak offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I wouldn't do anything to disobey the 
NUM.22.19	You are welcome to spend the night here, just as the others did. I will find out if the 
NUM.22.20	That night, God said, “Balaam, I'll let you go to Moab with Balak's messengers, but do only what I say.”
NUM.22.21	So Balaam got up the next morning and saddled his donkey, then left with the Moabite officials.
NUM.22.22	Balaam was riding his donkey to Moab, and two of his servants were with him. But God was angry that Balaam had gone, so one of the 
NUM.22.23	When Balaam's donkey saw the angel standing there with a sword, it walked off the road and into an open field. Balaam had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road.
NUM.22.24	Then the angel stood between two vineyards, in a narrow path with a stone wall on each side. 
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel, it walked so close to one of the walls that Balaam's foot scraped against the wall. Balaam beat the donkey again.
NUM.22.26	The angel moved once more and stood in a spot so narrow that there was no room for the donkey to go around. 
NUM.22.27	So it just lay down. Balaam lost his temper, then picked up a stick and whacked the donkey.
NUM.22.28	When that happened, the 
NUM.22.29	“You made me look stupid!” Balaam answered. “If I had a sword, I'd kill you here and now!”
NUM.22.30	“But you're my owner,” answered the donkey, “and you've ridden me many times. Have I ever done anything like this before?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” Balaam admitted.
NUM.22.31	Just then, the 
NUM.22.32	The angel said, “You had no right to treat your donkey like that! I was the one who blocked your way, because I don't think you should go to Moab.
NUM.22.33	If your donkey had not seen me and stopped those three times, I would have killed you and let the donkey live.”
NUM.22.34	Balaam replied, “I was wrong. I didn't know you were trying to stop me. If you don't think I should go, I'll return home at once.”
NUM.22.35	“It's all right for you to go,” the 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at the town of Ir on the Arnon River, which is the northern border of Moab. 
NUM.22.37	Balak asked, “Why didn't you come when I invited you the first time? Did you think I wasn't going to pay you?”
NUM.22.38	“I'm here now,” Balaam answered. “But I will say only what God tells me to say.”
NUM.22.39	They left and went to the town of Kiriath-Huzoth, 
NUM.22.40	where Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him.
NUM.22.41	The next morning, Balak took Balaam to the town of Bamoth-Baal. From there, Balaam could see some of the Israelites.
NUM.23.1	Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here, then bring seven bulls and seven rams.”
NUM.23.2	After Balak had done this, they sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said, “Wait here beside your offerings, and I'll go somewhere to be alone. Maybe the 
NUM.23.4	When God appeared to him, Balaam said, “I have built seven altars and have sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one.”
NUM.23.5	The 
NUM.23.6	When Balaam returned, he found Balak and his officials standing beside the offerings.
NUM.23.7	Balaam said:
NUM.23.7	“King Balak of Moab brought me
NUM.23.7	from the hills of Syria
NUM.23.7	to curse Israel
NUM.23.7	and announce its doom.
NUM.23.8	But I can't go against God!
NUM.23.8	He did not curse
NUM.23.8	or condemn Israel.
NUM.23.8	* 
NUM.23.9	“From the mountain peaks,
NUM.23.9	I look down and see Israel,
NUM.23.9	the obedient people of God.
NUM.23.10	They are living alone in peace.
NUM.23.10	And though they are many,
NUM.23.10	they don't bother
NUM.23.10	the other nations.
NUM.23.10	“I hope to obey God
NUM.23.10	for as long as I live
NUM.23.10	and to die in such peace.”
NUM.23.11	Balak said, “What are you doing? I asked you to come and place a curse on my enemies. But you have blessed them instead!”
NUM.23.12	Balaam answered, “I can say only what the 
NUM.23.13	Balak said to Balaam, “Let's go somewhere else. Maybe if you see a smaller part of the Israelites, you will be able to curse them for me.” 
NUM.23.14	So he took Balaam to a field on top of Mount Pisgah where lookouts were stationed.
NUM.23.15	“Wait here beside your offerings,” Balaam said. “The 
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	Balaam went back and saw him and his officials standing beside the offerings.
NUM.23.17	Balak asked, “What did the 
NUM.23.18	Balaam answered:
NUM.23.18	“Pay close attention
NUM.23.18	to my words—
NUM.23.19	God is no mere human!
NUM.23.19	He doesn't tell lies
NUM.23.19	or change his mind.
NUM.23.19	God always keeps his promises.
NUM.23.20	“My command from God
NUM.23.20	was to bless these people,
NUM.23.20	and there's nothing I can do
NUM.23.20	to change what he has done.
NUM.23.21	Israel's king is the 
NUM.23.21	He lives there with them
NUM.23.21	and intends them no harm.
NUM.23.22	With the strength of a wild ox,
NUM.23.22	God led Israel out of Egypt.
NUM.23.23	No magic charms can work
NUM.23.23	against them—
NUM.23.23	just look what God has done
NUM.23.23	for his people.
NUM.23.24	They are like angry lions
NUM.23.24	ready to attack;
NUM.23.24	and they won't rest
NUM.23.24	until their victim
NUM.23.24	is gobbled up.”
NUM.23.25	Balak shouted, “If you're not going to curse Israel, then at least don't bless them.”
NUM.23.26	“I've already told you,” Balaam answered. “I will say only what the 
NUM.23.27	Balak said to Balaam, “Come on, let's try another place. Maybe God will let you curse Israel from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So he took Balaam to Mount Peor overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea.
NUM.23.29	Balaam said, “Build seven altars here, then bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”
NUM.23.30	After Balak had done what Balaam asked, he sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	Balaam was sure that the 
NUM.24.2	and saw the tribes of Israel camped below. Just then, God's Spirit took control of him, 
NUM.24.3	and Balaam said:
NUM.24.3	“I am the son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	and my words are true,
NUM.24.3	so listen to my message!
NUM.24.4	It comes from the 
NUM.24.4	the God All-Powerful.
NUM.24.4	I bowed down to him
NUM.24.4	and saw a vision of Israel.
NUM.24.5	“People of Israel,
NUM.24.5	your camp is lovely.
NUM.24.6	It's like a grove of palm trees
NUM.24.6	or a garden beside a river.
NUM.24.6	You are like tall aloe trees
NUM.24.6	that the 
NUM.24.6	or like cedars
NUM.24.6	growing near water.
NUM.24.7	You and your descendants
NUM.24.7	will prosper like an orchard
NUM.24.7	beside a stream.
NUM.24.7	Your king will rule with power
NUM.24.7	and be a greater king
NUM.24.7	than Agag the Amalekite.
NUM.24.8	With the strength of a wild ox,
NUM.24.8	God led you out of Egypt.
NUM.24.8	You will defeat your enemies,
NUM.24.8	shooting them with arrows
NUM.24.8	and crushing their bones.
NUM.24.9	resting after an attack.
NUM.24.9	Who would dare disturb you?
NUM.24.9	“Anyone who blesses you
NUM.24.9	will be blessed;
NUM.24.9	anyone who curses you
NUM.24.9	will be cursed.”
NUM.24.10	When Balak heard this, he was so furious that he pounded his fist against his hand and said, “I called you here to place a curse on my enemies, and you've blessed them three times. 
NUM.24.11	Leave now and go home! I told you I would pay you well, but since the 
NUM.24.12	Balaam answered, “I told your messengers 
NUM.24.13	that even if you offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I would still obey the 
NUM.24.14	So I'm going back home, but I'm leaving you with a warning about what the Israelites will someday do to your nation.”
NUM.24.15	Balaam said:
NUM.24.15	“I am the son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	and my words are true,
NUM.24.15	so listen to my message!
NUM.24.16	My knowledge comes
NUM.24.16	from God Most High,
NUM.24.16	the 
NUM.24.16	I bowed down to him
NUM.24.16	and saw a vision of Israel.
NUM.24.17	“What I saw in my vision
NUM.24.17	hasn't happened yet.
NUM.24.17	But someday, a king of Israel
NUM.24.17	will appear like a star.
NUM.24.17	He will wipe out you Moabites
NUM.24.17	and destroy
NUM.24.17	who live in the desert.
NUM.24.18	Israel will conquer Edom
NUM.24.18	and capture the land
NUM.24.18	of that enemy nation.
NUM.24.19	The king of Israel will rule
NUM.24.19	and destroy the survivors
NUM.24.19	of every town there.
NUM.24.20	“And I saw this vision
NUM.24.20	about the Amalekites:
NUM.24.20	Their nation is now great,
NUM.24.20	but it will someday
NUM.24.20	disappear forever.
NUM.24.21	“And this is what I saw
NUM.24.21	about the Kenites:
NUM.24.21	They think they're safe,
NUM.24.21	living among the rocks,
NUM.24.22	but they will be wiped out
NUM.24.22	when Assyria conquers them.
NUM.24.23	“No one can survive
NUM.24.23	if God plans destruction.
NUM.24.24	Ships will come from Cyprus,
NUM.24.24	bringing people who will invade
NUM.24.24	the lands of Assyria and Eber.
NUM.24.24	But finally, Cyprus itself
NUM.24.24	will be ruined.”
NUM.24.25	After Balaam finished, he started home, and Balak also left.
NUM.25.1	While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men had sex with Moabite women. 
NUM.25.2	These women then invited the men to ceremonies where sacrifices were offered to their gods. The men ate the meat from the sacrifices and worshiped the Moabite gods.
NUM.25.3	The 
NUM.25.4	So he said to Moses, “Take the Israelite leaders who are responsible for this and have them killed in front of my sacred tent where everyone can see. Maybe then I will stop being angry with the Israelites.”
NUM.25.5	Moses told Israel's officials,
NUM.25.6	Later, Moses and the people were at the sacred tent, crying, when one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite
NUM.25.7	Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron
NUM.25.8	and followed the man into his tent, where he ran the spear through the man and into the woman's stomach. The 
NUM.25.9	but 24,000 Israelites had already died.
NUM.25.10	The 
NUM.25.11	“In my anger, I would have wiped out the Israelites if Phinehas had not been faithful to me. 
NUM.25.12+NUM.25.13	But instead of punishing them, I forgave them. So because of the loyalty that Phinehas showed, I solemnly promise that he and his descendants will always be my priests.”
NUM.25.14	The Israelite man that was killed was Zimri son of Salu, who was one of the leaders of the Simeon tribe. 
NUM.25.15	And the Midianite woman killed with him was Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite clan leader named Zur.
NUM.25.16	The 
NUM.25.17+NUM.25.18	“The Midianites are now enemies of Israel, so attack and defeat them! They tricked the people of Israel into worshiping their god at Peor, and they are responsible for the death of Cozbi, the daughter of one of their own leaders.”
NUM.26.2	“I want you to find out how many Israelites are in each family. Then make a list of every man 20 years and older who is able to serve in Israel's army.”
NUM.26.3	Israel was now camped in the hills of Moab across the Jordan River from the town of Jericho. Moses and Eleazar told them 
NUM.26.4	what the

NUM.30.14	If her husband hears about a promise and says nothing about it for a whole day, she must do what she said—since he did not object, the promise must be kept.

NUM.30.16	These are the laws that the

NUM.31.2	“Before you die, make sure that the Midianites are punished for what they did to Israel.”
NUM.31.3	Then Moses told the people, “The 
NUM.31.4	Each tribe will send 1,000 men to fight.”
NUM.31.5	Twelve thousand men were picked from the tribes of Israel, and after they were prepared for battle, 
NUM.31.6	Moses sent them off to war. Phinehas the son of Eleazar went with them and took along some things from the sacred tent

NUM.31.8	including Balaam son of Beor and the five Midianite kings, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. 
NUM.31.9	The Israelites captured every woman and child, then led away the Midianites' cattle and sheep, and took everything else that belonged to them. 
NUM.31.10	They also burned down the Midianite towns and villages.
NUM.31.11	Israel's soldiers gathered together everything they had taken from the Midianites, including the captives and the animals. 
NUM.31.12+NUM.31.13	Then they returned to their own camp in the hills of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho, where Moses, Eleazar, and the other Israelite leaders met the troops outside camp.
NUM.31.14	Moses became angry with the army commanders 
NUM.31.15	and said, “I can't believe you let the women live! 
NUM.31.16	 They are the ones who followed Balaam's advice and invited our people to worship the god Baal Peor. That's why the 
NUM.31.17	You must put to death every boy and all the women who have ever had sex. 
NUM.31.18	But do not kill the young women who have never had sex. You may keep them for yourselves.”
NUM.31.19	Then Moses said to the soldiers, “If you killed anyone or touched a dead body, you are unclean and have to stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third and seventh days, you must go through a ceremony to make yourselves and your captives clean. 
NUM.31.20	Then wash your clothes and anything made from animal skin, goat's hair, or wood.”
NUM.31.21+NUM.31.22+NUM.31.23	Eleazar then explained, “If you need to purify something that won't burn, such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead, you must first place it in a hot fire. After you take it out, sprinkle it with the water that purifies. Everything else should only be sprinkled with the water. Do all of this, just as the 
NUM.31.24	Wash your clothes on the seventh day, and after that, you will be clean and may return to the camp.”
NUM.31.25	The

NUM.31.31	Moses and Eleazar followed the 
NUM.31.32+NUM.31.33+NUM.31.34+NUM.31.35	and listed everything that had been taken from the Midianites. The list included 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 young women who had never had sex.

NUM.31.52	and its total weight was over 200 kilograms. 
NUM.31.53	This did not include the things that the soldiers had kept for themselves. 
NUM.31.54	So Moses and Eleazar placed the gold in the 
NUM.32.1	The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned a lot of cattle and sheep, and they saw that the regions of Jazer and Gilead had good pastureland. 
NUM.32.2	So they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of Israel and said, 
NUM.32.3+NUM.32.4	“The 
NUM.32.5	would you let us stay here east of the Jordan River and have this land as our own?”
NUM.32.6	Moses answered:
NUM.32.6	You mean you'd stay here while the rest of the Israelites go into battle? 
NUM.32.7	If you did that, it would discourage the others from crossing over into the land the 
NUM.32.8	 This is exactly what happened when I sent your ancestors from Kadesh-Barnea to explore the land. 
NUM.32.9	They went as far as Eshcol Valley, then returned and told the people that we should not enter it. 
NUM.32.10	 The 
NUM.32.11	And he said that no one who was 20 years or older when they left Egypt would enter the land he had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Not one of those people believed in the 
NUM.32.12	except Caleb and Joshua.
NUM.32.13	but he was so angry with the others that he forced them to wander around in the desert for 40 years. By that time everyone who had sinned against him had died.
NUM.32.14	Now you people of Reuben and Gad are doing the same thing and making the 
NUM.32.15	If you reject the 
NUM.32.16	The men from Reuben and Gad replied:
NUM.32.16	Let us build places to keep our sheep and goats, and towns for our wives and children, 
NUM.32.17	where they can stay and be safe. Then we'll prepare to fight and lead the other tribes into battle. 
NUM.32.18	We will stay with them until they have settled in their own tribal lands. 
NUM.32.19	The land on this side of the Jordan River will be ours, so we won't expect to receive any on the other side.
NUM.32.20	Moses said:
NUM.32.20	You promised that you would be ready to fight for the 
NUM.32.21	You also agreed to cross the Jordan and stay with the rest of the Israelites, until the 
NUM.32.22	then after the 
NUM.32.23	But if you don't keep your promise, you will sin against the 
NUM.32.24	Go ahead and build towns for your wives and children, and places for your sheep and goats. Just be sure to do what you have promised.
NUM.32.25	The men from Reuben and Gad answered:
NUM.32.25	Sir, we will do just what you have said. 
NUM.32.26	Our wives and children and sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead. 
NUM.32.27	But those of us who are prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for the 
NUM.32.29	“Make sure that the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you. If they do, then after the land is in your control, give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land. 
NUM.32.30	But if they break their promise, they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan, like the rest of the tribes.”
NUM.32.31	The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We are your servants and will do whatever the 
NUM.32.32	We will cross the Jordan River, ready to fight for the 
NUM.32.33	So Moses gave the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh

NUM.32.39	The clan of Machir from the tribe of East Manasseh went to the region of Gilead, captured its towns, and forced out the Amorites.

NUM.34.29	These are the men the 
NUM.35.2	to say to them:
NUM.35.2	When you receive your tribal lands, you must give towns and pastures to the Levi tribe. 
NUM.35.3	That way, the Levites will have towns to live in and pastures for their animals. 
NUM.35.4+NUM.35.5	The pasture around each of these towns must be in the shape of a square, with the town itself in the center. The pasture is to measure 900 meters on each side, with 450 meters of land outside each of the town walls. This will be the Levites' pastureland.
NUM.35.6	Six of the towns you give them will be Safe Towns where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection. But you will also give the Levites 42 other towns, 
NUM.35.7	so they will have a total of 48 towns with their surrounding pastures.
NUM.35.8	Since the towns for the Levites must come from Israel's own tribal lands, the larger tribes will give more towns than the smaller ones.
NUM.35.10	to tell the people of Israel:
NUM.35.10	After you have crossed the Jordan River and are settled in Canaan, 
NUM.35.11	choose Safe Towns, where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection. 
NUM.35.12	If the victim's relatives think it was murder, they might try to take revenge.
NUM.35.13	There are to be six of these Safe Towns, 
NUM.35.14	three on each side of the Jordan River. 
NUM.35.15	They will be places of protection for anyone who lives in Israel and accidentally kills someone.
NUM.35.16+NUM.35.17+NUM.35.18	Suppose you hit someone with a piece of iron or a large stone or a dangerous wooden tool. If that person dies, then you are a murderer and must be put to death 
NUM.35.19	by one of the victim's relatives. He will take revenge
NUM.35.20+NUM.35.21	Or suppose you get angry and kill someone by pushing or hitting or by throwing something. You are a murderer and must be put to death by one of the victim's relatives.
NUM.35.22+NUM.35.23+NUM.35.24	But if you are not angry and accidentally kill someone in any of these ways, the townspeople must hold a trial and decide if you are guilty. 
NUM.35.25	If they decide that you are innocent, you will be protected from the victim's relative and sent to stay in one of the Safe Towns until the high priest dies. 
NUM.35.26	But if you ever leave the Safe Town 
NUM.35.27	and are killed by the victim's relative, he cannot be punished for killing you. 
NUM.35.28	You must stay inside the town until the high priest dies; only then can you go back home.
NUM.35.29	The community of Israel must always obey these laws.
NUM.35.31	You cannot give someone money to escape the death penalty; you must pay with your own life! 
NUM.35.32	And if you have been proven innocent of murder and are living in a Safe Town, you cannot pay to go back home; you must stay there until the high priest dies.
NUM.35.33+NUM.35.34	I, the 
NUM.36.1	One day the family leaders from the Gilead clan of the Manasseh tribe went to Moses and the other family leaders of Israel 
NUM.36.2	 and said, “Sir, the 
NUM.36.3	But if they marry men from other tribes of Israel, the land they receive will become part of that tribe's inheritance and will no longer belong to us. 
NUM.36.4	Even when land is returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration,
NUM.36.5	So Moses told the people that the 
NUM.36.5	These men from the Manasseh tribe are right. 
NUM.36.6	I will allow Zelophehad's daughters to marry anyone, as long as those men belong to one of the clans of the Manasseh tribe.
NUM.36.7	Tribal land must not be given to another tribe—it will remain the property of the tribe that received it. 
NUM.36.8+NUM.36.9	In the future, any daughter who inherits land must marry someone from her own tribe. Israel's tribal land is never to be passed from one tribe to another.
NUM.36.10+NUM.36.11	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad obeyed the 
NUM.36.12	and remained part of the Manasseh tribe. So their land stayed in their father's clan.
NUM.36.13	These are the laws that the 
DEU.1.1+DEU.1.2+DEU.1.3+DEU.1.4+DEU.1.5	Earlier, Moses had defeated the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon. Moses had also defeated King Og of Bashan, who used to live in Ashtaroth for part of the year and in Edrei for the rest of the year.
DEU.1.1+DEU.1.2+DEU.1.3+DEU.1.4+DEU.1.5	Although it takes only eleven days to walk from Mount Sinai
DEU.1.1+DEU.1.2+DEU.1.3+DEU.1.4+DEU.1.5	The 
DEU.1.6	People of Israel, when we were in our camp at Mount Sinai,
DEU.1.6	You have stayed here long enough. 
DEU.1.7	Leave this place and go into the land that belongs to the Amorites and their neighbors the Canaanites. This land includes the Jordan River valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Southern Desert, the Mediterranean seacoast, the Lebanon Mountains, and all the territory as far as the Euphrates River. 
DEU.1.8	I give you this land, just as I promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now you must go and take the land.
DEU.1.9	Right after the 
DEU.1.9	Israel, being your leader is too big a job for one person. 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	God has even promised to bless us a thousand times more, and I pray that he will. 
DEU.1.12	But I cannot take care of all your problems and settle all your arguments alone. 
DEU.1.13	Each tribe must choose some experienced men who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will make those men the official leaders of their tribes.
DEU.1.14	You answered, “That's a good idea!” 
DEU.1.15	Then I took these men, who were already wise and respected leaders, and I appointed them as your official leaders. Some of them became military officers in charge of groups of 1,000, or 100, or 50, or 10, 
DEU.1.16	and others became judges. I gave these judges the following instructions:
DEU.1.16	When you settle legal cases, your decisions must be fair. It doesn't matter if the case is between two Israelites, or between an Israelite and a foreigner living in your community. 
DEU.1.17	And it doesn't matter if one is helpless and the other is powerful. Don't be afraid of anyone! No matter who shows up in your court, God will help you make a fair decision.
DEU.1.17	If any case is too hard for you, bring the people to me, and I will make the decision.
DEU.1.18	After I gave these instructions to the judges, I taught you the 
DEU.1.19	The 
DEU.1.20+DEU.1.21	and I told you, “We have reached the hill country. It belongs to the Amorites now, but the 
DEU.1.22	Then all of you came to me and said, “Before we go into the land, let's send some men to explore it. When they come back, they can tell us about the towns we will find and what roads we should take to get there.”
DEU.1.23	It seemed like a good idea, so I chose twelve men, one from each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They explored the hill country as far as Bunch Valley
DEU.1.25	and even brought back some of the fruit. They said, “The 
DEU.1.27	You stayed in your tents and grumbled, “The 
DEU.1.28	We are afraid, because the men who explored the land told us that the cities are large, with walls that reach to the sky. The people who live there are taller and stronger than we are,
DEU.1.29	Then I said, “Don't worry! 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	 And you know that the 
DEU.1.33	even though he had always been with us in the desert. During the daytime, the 
DEU.1.35	You people of this generation are evil, and I refuse to let you go into the good land that I promised your ancestors. 
DEU.1.36	Caleb son of Jephunneh is the only one of your generation that I will allow to go in. He obeyed me completely, so I will give him and his descendants the land he explored.
DEU.1.37	The 
DEU.1.38	Instead, I will let Joshua
DEU.1.39	Then the 
DEU.1.39	People of Israel, you said that your innocent young children would be taken prisoner in the battle for the land. But someday I will let them go into the land, and with my help they will conquer it and live there.
DEU.1.40	Now, turn around and go back into the desert by way of Red Sea
DEU.1.41	Then you told me, “We disobeyed the 
DEU.1.42	But the 
DEU.1.43	I told you what the 
DEU.1.44	But when the Amorites in the hill country attacked from their towns, you ran from them as you would run from a swarm of bees. The Amorites chased your troops into Seir
DEU.1.45	Then you came back to the place of worship at Kadesh-Barnea and wept, but the 
DEU.1.46	After we had been in Kadesh for a few months, we obeyed the 
DEU.2.2	until the 
DEU.2.2	Moses, 
DEU.2.3	Israel has wandered in these hills long enough. Turn and go north. 
DEU.2.4	 And give the people these orders: “Be very careful, because you will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau.
DEU.2.5	but don't start a war with them. I have given them the hill country of Seir, so I won't give any of it to you, not even enough to set a foot on. 
DEU.2.6	And as you go through their land, you will have to buy food and water from them.”
DEU.2.7	The 
DEU.2.8	We went past the territory that belonged to our relatives, the descendants of Esau.
DEU.2.10	Before the 
DEU.2.11	The Moabites called them Emim, though others sometimes used the name Rephaim
DEU.2.12	The Horites used to live in Seir, but the Edomites
DEU.2.13	When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab, the 
DEU.2.14	 This was 38 years after we left Kadesh-Barnea, and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as the 
DEU.2.15+DEU.2.16	The 
DEU.2.17	Then the 
DEU.2.18	“Moses, now go past the town of Ar and cross Moab's northern border 
DEU.2.19	 into Ammon. But don't start a war with the Ammonites. I gave them
DEU.2.20	Before the Ammonites conquered the land that the 
DEU.2.21	The Zamzummim were a large and powerful tribe and were as tall as the Anakim.
DEU.2.22	The 
DEU.2.23	A group called the Avvim used to live in villages as far south as Gaza, but the Philistines
DEU.2.24	After we went through Ammon, the 
DEU.2.24	Israel, pack up your possessions, take down your tents, and cross the Arnon River gorge.
DEU.2.25	Today I will start making all other nations afraid of you. They will tremble with fear when anyone mentions you, and they will be terrified when you show up.
DEU.2.26	After we had crossed the Arnon and had set up camp in the Kedemoth Desert, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon, telling him that his nation and ours could be at peace. I said:
DEU.2.27	Please let Israel go across your country. We will walk straight through, without turning off the road. 
DEU.2.28+DEU.2.29	You can even sell us food and water, and we will pay with silver. We need to reach the Jordan River and cross it, because the 
DEU.2.30+DEU.2.31	But Sihon refused to let us go across his country, because the 
DEU.2.32	We met Sihon and his army in battle at Jahaz, 
DEU.2.33	and the 
DEU.2.34	Then we captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom, killing everyone, 
DEU.2.35	but keeping the livestock and everything else of value. 
DEU.2.36	The 
DEU.2.37	However, we stayed away from all the Ammonite towns, both in the hill country and near the Jabbok River, just as the 
DEU.3.1	When we turned onto the road that leads to Bashan, King Og of Bashan led out his whole army to fight us at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	But the 
DEU.3.3+DEU.3.4+DEU.3.5+DEU.3.6	The 
DEU.3.7	but keeping the livestock and everything else of value.
DEU.3.8	Sihon and Og had ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, and we captured it all. 
DEU.3.9	Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon, and it is called Mount Senir by the Amorites. 
DEU.3.10	We captured all the towns in the highlands, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, two of the towns that Og had ruled.
DEU.3.11	King Og was the last of the Rephaim,
DEU.3.12+DEU.3.13+DEU.3.14+DEU.3.15+DEU.3.16+DEU.3.17	I gave some of the land and towns we captured to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. Their share started at the Arnon River gorge in the south, took in the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge, and went far enough north to include the southern half of the Gilead region. The northern part of their land went as far east as the upper Jabbok River gorge, which formed their border with the Ammonites.
DEU.3.12+DEU.3.13+DEU.3.14+DEU.3.15+DEU.3.16+DEU.3.17	I gave the northern half of Gilead and all of the Bashan region to half the tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.3.18+DEU.3.19	The 
DEU.3.20	The 
DEU.3.21+DEU.3.22	Then I told Joshua, “You saw how the 
DEU.3.24	“Our 
DEU.3.25	The land west of the Jordan is such good land. Please let me cross the Jordan and see the hills and the Lebanon Mountains.”
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look north, south, east, and west. Take a good look, but you are not going to cross the Jordan River. 
DEU.3.28	Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land, so help him be strong and brave and tell him what he must do.”
DEU.3.29	After this we stayed in the valley at Beth-Peor.
DEU.4.1	Israel, listen to these laws and teachings! If you obey them, you will live, and you will go in and take the land that the 
DEU.4.2	 and now he is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded, so don't add anything or take anything away.
DEU.4.4	But all of you that were faithful to the 
DEU.4.9	You must be very careful not to forget the things you have seen God do for you. Keep reminding yourselves, and tell your children and grandchildren as well. 
DEU.4.10	Do you remember the day you stood in the 
DEU.4.12	and the 
DEU.4.13	 The 
DEU.4.15	When God spoke to you from the fire, he was invisible. So be careful 
DEU.4.16	 not to commit the sin of worshiping idols. Don't make idols to be worshiped, whether they are shaped like men, women, 
DEU.4.17	 animals, birds, 
DEU.4.18	reptiles, or fish. 
DEU.4.19	And when you see the sun or moon or stars, don't be tempted to bow down and worship them. The 
DEU.4.20	 But you are the 
DEU.4.22	So I must stay here and die on this side of the Jordan, but you will cross the river and take the land.
DEU.4.23	Always remember the agreement that the 
DEU.4.24	 The 
DEU.4.25+DEU.4.26	Soon you will cross the Jordan River and settle down in the land. Then in the years to come, you will have children, and they will give you grandchildren. After many years, you might lose your sense of right and wrong and make idols, even though the 
DEU.4.27	 Only a few of you will survive, and the 
DEU.4.28	There you will have to worship gods made of wood and stone, and these are nothing but idols that can't see or hear or eat or smell.
DEU.4.31	The 
DEU.4.32+DEU.4.33+DEU.4.34	When the 
DEU.4.37	The 
DEU.4.38	Now you face other nations more powerful than you are, but the 
DEU.4.39	So remember that the 
DEU.4.40	Today I am explaining his laws and teachings. And if you always obey them, you and your descendants will live long and be successful in the land the 
DEU.4.44+DEU.4.45+DEU.4.46	The Israelites had come from Egypt and were camped east of the Jordan River near Beth-Peor, when Moses gave these laws and teachings. The land around their camp had once belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites defeated him 
DEU.4.47	and King Og of Bashan, and took their lands. These two Amorite kings had ruled the territory east of the Jordan River 
DEU.4.48	from the town of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon River gorge, north to Mount Hermon.
DEU.4.49	Their land included the eastern side of the Jordan River valley, as far south as the Dead Sea
DEU.5.1	Moses called together the people of Israel and said:
DEU.5.1	Today I am telling you the laws and teachings that you must follow, so listen carefully. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	That agreement wasn't only with
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	but you were afraid of the fire and refused to go up the mountain. So I spoke with the 
DEU.5.6	I am the 
DEU.5.7	Do not worship any god except me.
DEU.5.9	 Don't bow down and worship idols. I am the 
DEU.5.10	But if you love me and obey my laws, I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations.
DEU.5.13	 You have six days when you can do your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day of the week belongs to me, your God. No one is to work on that day—not you, your children, your oxen or donkeys or any other animal, not even those foreigners who live in your towns. And don't make your slaves do any work. 
DEU.5.15	This special day of rest will remind you that I reached out my mighty arm and rescued you from slavery in Egypt.
DEU.5.23	When fire blazed from the mountain, and you heard the voice coming from the darkness, your tribal leaders came to me 
DEU.5.24	and said:
DEU.5.24	Today the 
DEU.5.25	But we don't want to take a chance on being killed by that terrible fire, and if we keep on hearing the 
DEU.5.26	Has anyone else ever heard the only true God speaking from fire, as we have? And even if they have, would they live to tell about it? 
DEU.5.27	Moses, go up close and listen to the 
DEU.5.28	The 
DEU.5.28	Moses, I heard what the people said to you, and I approve. 
DEU.5.29	I wish they would always worship me with fear and trembling and be this willing to obey me! Then they and their children would always enjoy a successful life.
DEU.5.30	Now, tell them to return to their tents, 
DEU.5.31	but you come back here to me. After I tell you my laws and teachings, you will repeat them to the people, so they can obey these laws in the land I am giving them.
DEU.5.32	Israel, you must carefully obey the 
DEU.5.33	Follow them, because they make a path that will lead to a long successful life in the land the 
DEU.6.1	The 
DEU.6.2	And if you and your descendants want to live a long time, you must always worship the 
DEU.6.3	Pay attention, Israel! Our ancestors worshiped the 
DEU.6.5	 So love the 
DEU.6.6	 Memorize his laws 
DEU.6.7	and tell them to your children over and over again. Talk about them all the time, whether you're at home or walking along the road or going to bed at night, or getting up in the morning. 
DEU.6.8	Write down copies and tie them to your wrists and foreheads to help you obey them. 
DEU.6.9	Write these laws on the door frames of your homes and on your town gates.
DEU.6.11	and houses full of good things that you didn't put there. The 
DEU.6.12	don't forget it was the 
DEU.6.13	 Worship and obey the 
DEU.6.14	Don't have anything to do with gods that are worshiped by the nations around you. 
DEU.6.15	If you worship other gods, the 
DEU.6.16	 so don't try to make him prove that he can help you, as you did at Massah.
DEU.6.17	Always obey the laws that the 
DEU.6.18+DEU.6.19	and live in a way that pleases him. Then you will be able to go in and take this good land from your enemies, just as he promised your ancestors.
DEU.6.20	Someday your children will ask, “Why did the 
DEU.6.21	Then you will answer:
DEU.6.21	We were slaves of the king of Egypt, but the 
DEU.6.22	We saw him perform miracles and make horrible things happen to the king, his officials, and everyone else. 
DEU.6.23	The 
DEU.6.24+DEU.6.25	That's why the 
DEU.7.2	the 
DEU.7.3	and don't let your sons and daughters marry any of them. 
DEU.7.4	If you do, those people will lead your descendants to worship other gods and to turn their backs on the 
DEU.7.7	You were the weakest of all nations, 
DEU.7.8	but the 
DEU.7.10	But if you turn against the 
DEU.7.11	So be sure to obey his laws and teachings I am giving you today.
DEU.7.13	The 
DEU.7.14	God will bless you more than any other nation—your families will grow and your livestock increase. 
DEU.7.15	You will no longer suffer with the same horrible diseases that you sometimes had in Egypt. You will be healthy, but the 
DEU.7.16	When the 
DEU.7.17	You may be thinking, “How can we destroy these nations? They are more powerful than we are.” 
DEU.7.18	But stop worrying! Just remember what the 
DEU.7.19	You saw how the 
DEU.7.20	Some of them may try to survive by hiding from you, but the 
DEU.7.21	So don't be frightened when you meet them in battle. The 
DEU.7.22	As you attack these nations, the 
DEU.7.23+DEU.7.24	But when you attack your enemies, the 
DEU.7.25	After you conquer a nation, burn their idols. Don't get trapped into wanting the silver or gold on an idol. Even the metal on an idol is disgusting to the 
DEU.7.26	so destroy it. If you bring it home with you, both you and your house will be destroyed. Stay away from those disgusting idols!
DEU.8.1	Israel, do you want to go into the land the 
DEU.8.2	Don't forget how the 
DEU.8.3	 so he made you go hungry. Then he gave you manna,
DEU.8.4	Over the past 40 years, your clothing hasn't worn out, and your feet haven't swollen. 
DEU.8.5	 So keep in mind that the 
DEU.8.6	Obey the commands the 
DEU.8.7	The 
DEU.8.8+DEU.8.9	You can dig for copper in those hills, and the stones are made of iron ore. And you won't go hungry. Wheat and barley fields are everywhere, and so are vineyards and orchards full of fig, pomegranate,
DEU.8.10	After you eat and are full, give praise to the 
DEU.8.11	 Make sure that you never forget the 
DEU.8.12	you will have plenty to eat, and you will build good houses to live in. 
DEU.8.13	You will get more and more cattle, sheep, silver, gold, and other possessions.
DEU.8.14	But when all this happens, don't be proud! Don't forget that you were once slaves in Egypt and that it was the 
DEU.8.15	Remember how he led you in that huge and frightening desert where poisonous snakes and scorpions live. There was no water, but the 
DEU.8.16	He also gave you manna,
DEU.8.17	When you become successful, don't say, “I'm rich, and I've earned it all myself.” 
DEU.8.18	Instead, remember that the 
DEU.8.19+DEU.8.20	But I'm warning you—if you forget the 
DEU.9.1	Israel, listen to me! You will soon cross the Jordan River and go into the land to force out the nations that live there. They are more powerful than you are, and the walls around their cities reach to the sky. 
DEU.9.2	Some of these nations are descendants of the Anakim.
DEU.9.3	But the 
DEU.9.4+DEU.9.5+DEU.9.6	After the 
DEU.9.7	Don't ever forget how you kept rebelling and making the 
DEU.9.8	At Mount Sinai
DEU.9.9+DEU.9.10+DEU.9.11	 It happened during those 40 days and nights that I was on the mountain, without anything to eat or drink. He had told me to come up there so he could give me the agreement he made with us. And this agreement was actually the same Ten Commandments
DEU.9.12	he said:
DEU.9.12	Moses, hurry down the mountain to those people you led out of Egypt. They have already disobeyed me and committed the terrible sin of making an idol.
DEU.9.13	I've been watching the Israelites, and I've seen how stubborn and rebellious they are. 
DEU.9.14	So don't try to stop me! I am going to wipe them out, and no one on earth will remember they ever lived. Then I will let your descendants become an even bigger and more powerful nation than Israel.
DEU.9.15	Fire was raging on the mountaintop as I went back down, carrying the two stones with the commandments on them. 
DEU.9.16	I saw how quickly you had sinned and disobeyed the 
DEU.9.17	So I threw down the two stones and smashed them before your very eyes.
DEU.9.18+DEU.9.19+DEU.9.20	I bowed down at the place of worship and prayed to the 
DEU.9.21	It was a sin for you to make that idol, so I threw it into the fire to melt it down. Then I took the lump of gold, ground it into powder, and threw the powder into the stream flowing down the mountain.
DEU.9.23	 Then at Kadesh-Barnea the 
DEU.9.24	In fact, you've rebelled against the 
DEU.9.25	After you had made the idol in the shape of a calf, the 
DEU.9.26	and prayed:
DEU.9.26	Our 
DEU.9.27	Israel's ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob obeyed you faithfully. Think about them, and not about Israel's stubbornness, evil, and sin. 
DEU.9.28	If you destroy your people, the Egyptians will say, “The 
DEU.9.29	But you, our 
DEU.10.1	The 
DEU.10.2	He told me that he would write on the new stones the same words he had written on the ones I broke, and that I could put these stones in this sacred chest.
DEU.10.3	So I made a chest out of acacia wood, and I chiseled two flat stones like the ones I broke. Then I carried the stones up the mountain, 
DEU.10.4	where the 
DEU.10.4	After the 
DEU.10.5	I took them down the mountainside and put them in the chest, just as he had commanded. And they are still there.
DEU.10.7	Next, we camped at Gudgodah and then at Jotbathah, where there are flowing streams.
DEU.10.9	The 
DEU.10.11	Instead, he told me, “Moses, get ready to lead the people into the land that I promised their ancestors.”
DEU.10.12	People of Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	and to obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you today. Do this, and all will go well for you.
DEU.10.14	Everything belongs to the 
DEU.10.15	Yet the 
DEU.10.16	Remember your agreement with the 
DEU.10.17	 The 
DEU.10.18	 The 
DEU.10.19	And you should also care for them, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
DEU.10.20	Respect the 
DEU.10.21	Offer your praises to him, because you have seen him work such terrifying miracles for you.
DEU.11.1	The 
DEU.11.2	Remember, he corrected you and not your children. You are the ones who saw the 
DEU.11.3	 when he worked miracles in Egypt, making terrible things happen to the king and all his people. 
DEU.11.4	 And when the Egyptian army chased you in their chariots, you saw the 
DEU.11.5	You saw what the 
DEU.11.6	 And you saw how the 
DEU.11.7	With your own eyes, you saw the 
DEU.11.8	Soon you will cross the Jordan River, and if you obey the laws and teachings I'm giving you today, you will be strong enough to conquer the land 
DEU.11.9	that the 
DEU.11.10	It's better land than you had in Egypt, where you had to struggle just to water your crops.
DEU.11.11	But the hills and valleys in the promised land are watered by rain from heaven,
DEU.11.12	because the 
DEU.11.14+DEU.11.15	he will send rain at the right seasons,
DEU.11.16	But watch out! You will be tempted to turn your backs on the 
DEU.11.17	the 
DEU.11.19	Teach them to your children. Talk about them all the time—whether you're at home or walking along the road or going to bed at night, or getting up in the morning. 
DEU.11.20	Write them on the door frames of your homes and on your town gates. 
DEU.11.21	Then you and your descendants will live a long time in the land that the 
DEU.11.22	Love the 
DEU.11.23	he will help you take the land. And even though the nations there are more powerful than you, the 
DEU.11.24	 You will capture the land everywhere you go, from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains, and from the Euphrates River west to the Mediterranean Sea. 
DEU.11.25	No one will be able to stand up to you. The 
DEU.11.26	You have a choice—do you want the 
DEU.11.27	Today I am giving you his laws, and if you obey him, he will bless you. 
DEU.11.28	But if you disobey him and worship those gods that have never done anything for you, the 
DEU.11.30	You know that these two mountains are west of the Jordan River in land now controlled by the Canaanites living in the Jordan River valley. The mountains are west of the road near the sacred trees of Moreh on the other side of Gilgal.
DEU.11.31	Soon you will cross the Jordan River to conquer the land that the 
DEU.11.32	be careful to obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you today.
DEU.12.1	Now I'll tell you the laws and teachings that you have to obey as long as you live. Your ancestors worshiped the 
DEU.12.2	But the nations that live there worship other gods. So after you capture the land, you must completely destroy their places of worship—on mountains and hills or in the shade of large trees. 
DEU.12.3	 Wherever these nations worship their gods, you must tear down their altars, break their sacred stones, burn the sacred poles
DEU.12.4	Don't worship the 
DEU.12.5+DEU.12.6+DEU.12.7+DEU.12.8+DEU.12.9+DEU.12.10+DEU.12.11+DEU.12.12+DEU.12.13+DEU.12.14+DEU.12.15+DEU.12.16+DEU.12.17+DEU.12.18+DEU.12.19	Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice. If the 
DEU.12.20+DEU.12.21	The 
DEU.12.22	It is the same as eating the meat from a deer or a gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And in this way, anyone who is unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat.
DEU.12.25	Do you want the 
DEU.12.26+DEU.12.27	All sacrifices and offerings to the 
DEU.12.28	If you obey these laws, you will be doing what the 
DEU.12.29	Israel, as you go into the land and attack the nations that are there, the 
DEU.12.30	But that's when you must be especially careful not to ask, “How did those nations worship their gods? Shouldn't we worship the 
DEU.12.31	No, you should not! The 
DEU.13.1+DEU.13.2	Someday a prophet
DEU.13.3	If the prophet says this, don't listen! The 
DEU.13.4	You must be completely faithful to the 
DEU.13.5	because he rescued you from slavery in Egypt.
DEU.13.5	If a prophet tells you to disobey the 
DEU.13.6+DEU.13.7+DEU.13.8+DEU.13.9+DEU.13.10	The gods worshiped by other nations have never done anything for you or your ancestors. People who ask you to worship other gods are trying to get you to stop worshiping the 
DEU.13.11	And when the rest of Israel hears about it, they will be afraid, and no one else will ever do such an evil thing again.
DEU.13.12	After the 
DEU.13.13	You may hear that some worthless people have talked everyone there into worshiping other gods, even though these gods had never done anything for them. 
DEU.13.14	You must carefully find out if the rumor is true. Then if the people of that town have actually done such a disgusting thing in your own country, 
DEU.13.15	you must take your swords and kill every one of them, and their livestock too. 
DEU.13.16+DEU.13.17	Gather all the possessions of the people who lived there, and pile them up in the marketplace, without keeping anything for yourself. Set the pile and the whole town on fire, and don't ever rebuild the town. The whole town will be a sacrifice to the 
DEU.13.18	That's why you must do what the 
DEU.14.2	 Out of all the nations on this earth, the 
DEU.14.4+DEU.14.5	You may eat the meat of cattle, sheep, and goats; wild sheep and goats; and gazelles, antelopes, and all kinds of deer. 
DEU.14.6	It is all right to eat meat from any animals that have divided hoofs and also chew the cud.
DEU.14.7	But don't eat camels, rabbits, and rock badgers. These animals chew the cud but do not have divided hoofs. You must treat them as unclean. 
DEU.14.8	And don't eat pork, since pigs have divided hoofs, but they do not chew their cud. Don't even touch a dead pig!
DEU.14.9	You can eat any fish that has fins and scales. But there are other creatures that live in the water, 
DEU.14.10	and if they do not have fins and scales, you must not eat them. Treat them as unclean.
DEU.14.11	You can eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.12+DEU.14.13+DEU.14.14+DEU.14.15+DEU.14.16+DEU.14.17+DEU.14.18	But don't eat the meat of any of the following birds: eagles, vultures, falcons, kites, ravens, ostriches, owls, sea gulls, hawks, pelicans, ospreys, cormorants, storks, herons, and hoopoes.
DEU.14.19	Swarming insects are unclean, so don't eat them. 
DEU.14.20	However, you are allowed to eat certain kinds of winged insects.
DEU.14.21	Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
DEU.14.23	Also set aside ten percent of your wine and olive oil, and the first-born of every cow, sheep, and goat. Take these to the place where the 
DEU.14.24	But suppose you can't carry that ten percent of your harvest to the place where the 
DEU.14.25	then sell this part and take the money there instead. 
DEU.14.26	When you and your family arrive, spend the money on food for a big celebration. Buy cattle, sheep, goats, wine, beer, and if there are any other kinds of food that you want, buy those too. 
DEU.14.27	And since people of the Levi tribe won't own any land for growing crops, remember to ask the Levites to celebrate with you.
DEU.14.28	Every third year, instead of using the ten percent of your harvest for a big celebration, bring it into town and put it in a community storehouse. 
DEU.14.29	The Levites have no land of their own, so you must give them food from the storehouse. You must also give food to the poor who live in your town, including orphans, widows, and foreigners. If they have enough to eat, then the 
DEU.15.1+DEU.15.2	Every seven years you must announce, “The 
DEU.15.3	This law applies only to loans you have made to other Israelites. Foreigners will still have to pay back what you have loaned them.
DEU.15.4+DEU.15.5+DEU.15.6	No one in Israel should ever be poor. The 
DEU.15.8	Instead, be kind and lend them what they need. 
DEU.15.9	Be careful! Don't say to yourself, “Soon it will be the seventh year, and then I won't be able to get my money back.” It would be horrible for you to think that way and to be so selfish that you refuse to help the poor. They are your relatives, and if you don't help them, they may ask the 
DEU.15.10	You should be happy to give the poor what they need, because then the 
DEU.15.13	And don't just tell them they are free to leave— 
DEU.15.14	give them sheep and goats and a good supply of grain and wine. The more the 
DEU.15.15	I am commanding you to obey the 
DEU.15.16	But one of your slaves may say, “I love you and your family, and I would be better off staying with you, so please don't make me leave.” 
DEU.15.17	Take the slave to the door of your house and push a sharp metal rod through one earlobe and into the door. Such slaves will belong to you for life, whether they are men or women.
DEU.15.18	Don't complain when you have to set a slave free. After all, you got six years of service at half the cost of hiring someone to do the work.
DEU.15.20	Instead, each year you must take the first-born of these animals to the place where the 
DEU.15.21	But if the animal is lame or blind or has something else wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the 
DEU.15.22	You can butcher it where you live, and eat it just like the meat of a deer or gazelle that you kill while hunting. Even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some. 
DEU.15.23	 But you must never eat the blood of an animal—let it drain out on the ground.
DEU.16.2	The Passover sacrifice must be a cow, a sheep, or a goat, and you must offer it at the place where the 
DEU.16.3+DEU.16.4	Eat all of the meat of the Passover sacrifice that same night. But don't serve bread made with yeast at the Passover meal. Serve the same kind of thin bread that you ate when you were slaves suffering in Egypt
DEU.16.3+DEU.16.4	For seven days following Passover,
DEU.16.5	Don't offer the Passover sacrifice in just any town where you happen to live. 
DEU.16.6	It must be offered at the place where the 
DEU.16.7	Then cook it and eat it there at the place of worship, returning to your tents the next morning.
DEU.16.8	Eat thin bread for the next six days. Then on the seventh day, don't do any work. Instead, come together and worship the 
DEU.16.10+DEU.16.11	go to the place where the 
DEU.16.12	Remember that you used to be slaves in Egypt, so obey these laws.
DEU.16.13+DEU.16.14+DEU.16.15	The 
DEU.16.16	Each year there are three festivals when all Israelite men must go to the place where the 
DEU.16.17	The bigger the harvest the 
DEU.16.20	People of Israel, if you want to enjoy a long and successful life, make sure that everyone is treated with justice in the land the 
DEU.16.22	 And don't set up a sacred stone! The 
DEU.17.1	If an ox or a sheep has something wrong with it, don't offer it as a sacrifice to the 
DEU.17.4	So when you hear that someone in your town is committing this disgusting sin, you must carefully find out if that person really is guilty. 
DEU.17.5+DEU.17.6+DEU.17.7	 But you will need two or three witnesses—one witness isn't enough to prove a person guilty.
DEU.17.5+DEU.17.6+DEU.17.7	Get rid of those who are guilty of such evil. Take them outside your town gates and everyone must stone them to death. But the witnesses must be the first to throw stones.
DEU.17.8+DEU.17.9+DEU.17.10+DEU.17.11+DEU.17.12	It may be difficult to find out the truth in some legal cases in your town. You may not be able to decide if someone was killed accidentally or murdered. Or you may not be able to tell whether an injury or some property damage was done by accident or on purpose. If the case is too difficult, take it to the court at the place where the 
DEU.17.8+DEU.17.9+DEU.17.10+DEU.17.11+DEU.17.12	This court will be made up of one judge and several priests
DEU.17.13	When other Israelites hear about it, they will be afraid and obey the decisions of the court.
DEU.17.15	Go ahead and appoint a king, but make sure that he is an Israelite and that he is the one the 
DEU.17.17	 And the king must not have a lot of wives—they might tempt him to be unfaithful to the 
DEU.17.18	The official copy of God's laws
DEU.17.19	Each day the king must read and obey these laws, so that he will learn to worship the 
DEU.17.20	and not think that he's better than everyone else.
DEU.17.20	If the king completely obeys the 
DEU.18.1	The people of the Levi tribe, including the priests, will not receive any land. Instead, they will receive part of the sacrifices that are offered to the 
DEU.18.2	 because he has promised to provide for them in this way.
DEU.18.3	When you sacrifice a bull or sheep, the priests will be given the shoulder, the jaws, and the stomach.
DEU.18.4	In addition, they will receive the first part of your grain harvest and part of your first batches of wine and olive oil.
DEU.18.5	Give these gifts to the priests, because the 
DEU.18.6	Any Levite can leave his hometown, and go to the place where the 
DEU.18.7	and then be a special servant of the 
DEU.18.8	Some Levites may have money from selling family possessions, and others may not. But all Levites serving at the place of worship will receive the same amount of food from the sacrifices and gifts brought by the people.
DEU.18.9	Soon you will go into the land that the 
DEU.18.10+DEU.18.11	 Don't sacrifice your son or daughter. And don't try to use any kind of magic or witchcraft to tell fortunes
DEU.18.12	The 
DEU.18.13	 Never be guilty of doing any of these disgusting things!
DEU.18.14	You will go in and take the land from nations that practice magic and witchcraft. But the 
DEU.18.15	 Instead, he will choose one of your own people to be a prophet just like me, and you must do what that prophet says. 
DEU.18.16	You were asking for a prophet the day you were gathered at Mount Sinai
DEU.18.17	Then the 
DEU.18.17	Moses, they have said the right thing. 
DEU.18.18	So when I want to speak to them, I will choose one of them to be a prophet like you. I will give my message to that prophet, who will tell the people exactly what I have said. 
DEU.18.19	 Since the message comes from me, anyone who doesn't obey the message will have to answer to me.
DEU.18.20	But if I haven't spoken, and a prophet claims to have a message from me, you must kill that prophet, and you must also kill any prophet who claims to have a message from another god.
DEU.18.21	You may be asking yourselves, “How can we tell if a prophet's message really comes from the 
DEU.18.22	You will know, because if the 
DEU.19.2+DEU.19.3+DEU.19.4	you must choose three of your towns to be Safe Towns. Divide the land into three regions with one Safe Town near the middle of each, so that a Safe Town can be easily reached from anywhere in your land.
DEU.19.2+DEU.19.3+DEU.19.4	Then, if one of you accidentally kills someone, you can run to a Safe Town and find protection from being put to death. But you must not have been angry with the person you killed.
DEU.19.5	For example, suppose you and a friend go into the forest to cut wood. You are chopping down a tree with an ax, when the ax head slips off the handle, hits your friend, and kills him. You can run to one of the Safe Towns and save your life. 
DEU.19.6	You don't deserve to die, since you did not mean to harm your friend. But he did get killed, and his relatives might be very angry. They might even choose one of the men from their family to track you down and kill you. If it is too far to one of the Safe Towns, the victim's relative might be able to catch you and kill you. 
DEU.19.7	That's why I said there must be three Safe Towns.
DEU.19.8+DEU.19.9	Israel, the 
DEU.19.10	You will need them, so innocent people won't be killed on your land while they are trying to reach a Safe Town that is too far away. You will be guilty of murder, if innocent people lose their lives because you didn't name enough Safe Towns in the land the 
DEU.19.11	But what if you really do commit murder? Suppose one of you hates a neighbor. So you wait in a deserted place, kill the neighbor, and run to a Safe Town. 
DEU.19.12	If that happens, the leaders of your town must send messengers to bring you back from the Safe Town. They will hand you over to one of the victim's relatives, who will put you to death.
DEU.19.13	Israel, for the good of the whole country, you must kill anyone who murders an innocent person. Never show mercy to a murderer!
DEU.19.16	If you accuse someone of a crime, but seem to be lying, 
DEU.19.17+DEU.19.18	then both you and the accused must be taken to the court at the place where the 
DEU.19.17+DEU.19.18	If you are lying and the accused is innocent, 
DEU.19.19+DEU.19.20+DEU.19.21	 then you will be punished without mercy. You will receive the same punishment the accused would have received if found guilty, whether it means losing an eye, a tooth, a hand, a foot, or even your life.
DEU.19.19+DEU.19.20+DEU.19.21	Israel, the crime of telling lies in court must be punished. And when people hear what happens to witnesses that lie, everyone else who testifies in court will tell the truth.
DEU.20.1	If you have to go to war, you may find yourselves facing an enemy army that is bigger than yours and that has horses and chariots. But don't be afraid! The 
DEU.20.2	Before you march into battle, a priest will go to the front of the army 
DEU.20.3	and say, “Soldiers of Israel, listen to me! Today when you go into battle, don't be afraid of the enemy, and when you see them, don't panic. 
DEU.20.4	The 
DEU.20.5	Then the tribal officials will say to the troops:
DEU.20.5	If any of you have built a new house, but haven't yet moved in, you may go home. It isn't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to live in your new house.
DEU.20.6	If any of you have planted a vineyard but haven't had your first grape harvest, you may go home. It isn't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to enjoy your grapes.
DEU.20.7	If any of you are engaged to be married, you may go back home and get married. It isn't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to marry the woman you are engaged to.
DEU.20.8	Finally, if any of you are afraid, you may go home. We don't want you to discourage the other soldiers.
DEU.20.9	When the officials are finished giving these orders, they will appoint officers to be in command of the army.
DEU.20.10+DEU.20.11+DEU.20.12+DEU.20.13+DEU.20.14+DEU.20.15	Before you attack a town that is far from your land, offer peace to the people who live there. If they surrender and open their town gates, they will become your slaves. But if they reject your offer of peace and try to fight, surround their town and attack. Then, after the 
DEU.20.16	Whenever you capture towns in the land the 
DEU.20.17	He has commanded you to completely wipe out the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
DEU.20.18	If you allow them to live, they will persuade you to worship their disgusting gods, and you will be unfaithful to the 
DEU.20.19	When you are attacking a town, don't chop down its fruit trees, not even if you have had the town surrounded for a long time. Fruit trees aren't your enemies, and they produce food that you can eat, so don't cut them down. 
DEU.20.20	You may need wood to make ladders and towers to help you get over the walls and capture the town. But use only trees that you know are not fruit trees.
DEU.21.1	Suppose the body of a murder victim is found in a field in the land the 
DEU.21.2	The judges and other leaders from the towns around there must find out what town is the closest to where the body was found. 
DEU.21.3	The leaders from that town will go to their cattle herds and choose a young cow that has never been put to work.
DEU.21.4+DEU.21.5	They and some of the priests will take this cow to a nearby valley where there is a stream, but no crops. Once they reach the valley, the leaders will break the cow's neck.
DEU.21.4+DEU.21.5	The priests must be there, because the 
DEU.21.6	The town leaders will wash their hands over the body of the dead cow 
DEU.21.7	and say, “We had no part in this murder, and we don't know who did it. 
DEU.21.8+DEU.21.9	But since an innocent person was murdered, we beg you, our 
DEU.21.8+DEU.21.9	If you obey the 
DEU.21.10	From time to time, you men will serve as soldiers and go off to war. The 
DEU.21.11+DEU.21.12+DEU.21.13	One of these prisoners may be a beautiful woman, and you may want to marry her. But first you must bring her into your home, and have her shave her head, cut her nails, get rid of her foreign clothes, and start wearing Israelite clothes. She will mourn a month for her father and mother, then you can marry her.
DEU.21.14	Later on, if you are not happy with the woman, you can divorce her, and she can go free. But you have slept with her as your wife, so you cannot sell her as a slave or make her into your own slave.
DEU.21.15+DEU.21.16+DEU.21.17	Suppose a man has two wives and loves one more than the other. The first son of either wife is the man's first-born son, even if the boy's mother is the wife the man doesn't love. Later, when the man is near death and is dividing up his property, he must give a double share to his first-born son, simply because he was the first to be born.
DEU.21.18	A father and a mother may have a stubborn and rebellious son who refuses to obey them even after he has been punished. 
DEU.21.19	If a son is like that, his parents must drag him to the town gate, where the leaders of the town hold their meetings. 
DEU.21.20	The parents will tell the leaders, “This son of ours is stubborn and never obeys. He spends all his time drinking and partying.”
DEU.21.21	The men of the town will stone that son to death, because they must get rid of the evil he brought into the community. Everyone in Israel will be afraid when they hear how he was punished.
DEU.21.22	If a criminal is put to death, and you hang the dead body on a tree, 
DEU.21.23	 you must not leave it there overnight. Bury it the same day, because the dead body of a criminal hanging on a tree will bring God's curse on the land. The 
DEU.22.2	If the owner lives too far away, or if you don't know who the owner is, take the animal home with you and take care of it. The owner will come looking for the animal, and then you can give it back. 
DEU.22.3	That's what you should do if you find anything that belongs to someone else. Do whatever you can to help, whether you find a cow or sheep or donkey or some clothing.
DEU.22.4	Oxen and donkeys that carry heavy loads can stumble and fall, and be unable to get up by themselves. So as you walk along the road, help anyone who is trying to get an ox or donkey back on its feet.
DEU.22.5	Women must not pretend to be men, and men must not pretend to be women.
DEU.22.6+DEU.22.7	As you walk along the road, you might see a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground. If the mother bird is in the nest with either her eggs or her baby birds, you are allowed to take the baby birds or the eggs, but not the mother bird. Let her go free, and the 
DEU.22.8	If you build a house, make sure to put a low wall around the edge of the flat roof.
DEU.22.10	Don't hitch an ox and a donkey to your plow at the same time.
DEU.22.11	When you weave cloth for clothing, you can use thread made of flax
DEU.22.12	 And when you make a coat, sew a tassel on each of the four corners.
DEU.22.13	Suppose a man starts hating his wife soon after they are married. 
DEU.22.14	He might tell ugly lies about her, and say, “I married this woman, but when we slept together, I found out she wasn't a virgin.”
DEU.22.15	If this happens, the bride's father and mother must go to the town gate to show the town leaders the proof that the woman was a virgin. 
DEU.22.16	Her father will say, “I let my daughter marry this man, but he started hating her 
DEU.22.17	and accusing her of not being a virgin. But he is wrong, because here is proof that she was a virgin!” Then the bride's parents will show them the bed sheet from the woman's wedding night.
DEU.22.18	The town leaders will beat the man with a whip 
DEU.22.19	because he accused his bride of not being a virgin. He will have to pay her father 100 pieces of silver and will never be allowed to divorce her.
DEU.22.20	But if the man was right and there is no proof that his bride was a virgin, 
DEU.22.21	the men of the town will take the woman to the door of her father's house and stone her to death.
DEU.22.21	This woman brought evil into your community by sleeping with someone before she got married, and you must get rid of that evil by killing her.
DEU.22.22	People of Israel, if a man is caught having sex with someone else's wife, you must put them both to death. That way, you will get rid of the evil they have done in Israel.
DEU.22.23+DEU.22.24	If a man is caught in town having sex with an engaged woman who isn't screaming for help, they both must be put to death. The man is guilty of having sex with a married woman.
DEU.22.26	Do not punish the woman at all; she has done nothing wrong, and certainly nothing deserving death. This crime is like murder, 
DEU.22.27	because the woman was alone out in the country when the man attacked her. She screamed, but there was no one to help her.
DEU.22.29	they will be forced to get married. He must give her father 50 pieces of silver as a bride-price and
DEU.23.1	If a man's private parts have been crushed or cut off,
DEU.23.2	No one born outside of a legal marriage, or any of their descendants for ten generations, can fully belong to the 
DEU.23.4	 This is because when you came out of Egypt, they refused to provide you with food and water. And besides, they hired Balaam
DEU.23.5	 But the 
DEU.23.6	Don't even think of signing a peace treaty with Moab or Ammon.
DEU.23.7	But Edomites are your relatives, and you lived as foreigners in the country of Egypt. Now you must be kind to Edomites and Egyptians 
DEU.23.8	and let their great-grandchildren become part of Israel, the 
DEU.23.9	When you men go off to fight your enemies, make sure your camp is acceptable to the 
DEU.23.10	For example, if something happens at night that makes a man unclean and unfit for worship, he
DEU.23.11	until late afternoon. Then he must take a bath, and at sunset he can go back into camp.
DEU.23.12	Set up a place outside the camp to be used as a toilet area. 
DEU.23.13	And make sure that you have a small shovel in your equipment. When you go out to the toilet area, use the shovel to dig a hole. Then, after you relieve yourself, bury the waste in the hole. 
DEU.23.14	You must keep your camp clean of filthy and disgusting things. The 
DEU.23.15	When runaway slaves from other countries come to Israel and ask for protection, you must not hand them back to their owners. 
DEU.23.16	Instead, you must let them choose which one of your towns they want to live in. Don't be cruel to runaway slaves.
DEU.23.18	The 
DEU.23.20	You can charge a foreigner interest. But if you charge other Israelites interest, the 
DEU.23.22	On the other hand, if you never make a sacred promise, you can't be guilty of breaking it. 
DEU.23.23	You must keep whatever promises you make to the 
DEU.23.24	If you go into a vineyard that belongs to someone else, you are allowed to eat as many grapes as you want while you are there. But don't take any with you when you leave. 
DEU.23.25	In the same way, if you are in a grain field that belongs to someone else, you can pick heads of grain and eat the kernels. But don't cut down the stalks of grain and take them with you.
DEU.24.2	Later she married another man, 
DEU.24.3	who then either divorced her in the same way or died. 
DEU.24.4	Since she has slept with her second husband, she cannot marry her first husband again. Their marriage would pollute the land that the 
DEU.24.5	If a man and a woman have been married less than one year, he must not be sent off to war or sent away to do forced labor. He must be allowed to stay home for a year and be happy with his wife.
DEU.24.6	When you lend money to people, you are allowed to keep something of theirs as a guarantee that they will pay back the loan. But don't take one or both of their millstones, or else they may starve. They need these stones for grinding grain into flour to make bread.
DEU.24.9	 And remember what the 
DEU.24.11	Wait outside, and they will bring out the item you have agreed on.
DEU.24.12	Suppose someone is so poor that a coat is the only thing that can be offered as a guarantee on a loan. Don't keep the coat overnight. 
DEU.24.13	Instead, give it back before sunset, so the owner can keep warm and sleep and ask the 
DEU.24.15	Pay them their wages at the end of each day, because they live in poverty and need the money to survive. If you don't pay them on time, they will complain about you to the 
DEU.24.18	You were slaves in Egypt until the 
DEU.24.20	When you harvest your olives, don't try to get them all for yourself, but leave some for the poor. 
DEU.24.21	And when you pick your grapes, go over the vines only once, then let the poor have what is left. 
DEU.24.22	You lived in poverty as slaves in Egypt until the 
DEU.25.1+DEU.25.2	Suppose you and someone else each accuse the other of doing something wrong, and you go to court, where the judges decide you are guilty. If your punishment is to be beaten with a whip,
DEU.25.3	 Forty lashes is the most that you can be given, because more than that might make other Israelites think you are worthless.
DEU.25.8	The leaders will call the living brother to the town gate and try to persuade him to marry the widow. But if he doesn't change his mind and marry her, 
DEU.25.9	she must go over to him while the town leaders watch. She will pull off one of his sandals and spit in his face, while saying, “That's what happens to a man who won't help provide descendants for his dead brother.” 
DEU.25.10	From then on, that man's family will be known as “the family of the man whose sandal was pulled off.”
DEU.25.11	If two men are fighting, and the wife of one man tries to rescue her husband by grabbing the other man's private parts, 
DEU.25.12	you must cut off her hand. Don't have any mercy.
DEU.25.15	If you weigh and measure things honestly, the 
DEU.25.16	But the 
DEU.25.18	You were tired, and they followed along behind, attacking those who could not keep up with the others. This showed that the Amalekites have no respect for God.
DEU.25.19	The 
DEU.26.1	The 
DEU.26.2	 and plant crops. And when you begin harvesting each of your crops, the very first things you pick must be put in a basket. Take them to the place where the 
DEU.26.3	and tell the priest, “Long ago the 
DEU.26.4	The priest will take the basket and set it in front of the 
DEU.26.5	Then, standing there in front of the place of worship, you must pray:
DEU.26.5	My ancestor was homeless,
DEU.26.5	an Aramean who went to live
DEU.26.5	in Egypt.
DEU.26.5	There were only a few
DEU.26.5	in his family then,
DEU.26.5	but they became great
DEU.26.5	and powerful,
DEU.26.5	a nation of many people.
DEU.26.6	The Egyptians were cruel
DEU.26.6	and had no pity on us.
DEU.26.6	They mistreated our people
DEU.26.6	and forced us into slavery.
DEU.26.7	We called out for help
DEU.26.7	to you, the 
DEU.26.7	of our ancestors.
DEU.26.7	You heard our cries;
DEU.26.7	you knew we were in trouble
DEU.26.7	and abused.
DEU.26.8	Then you terrified the Egyptians
DEU.26.8	with your mighty miracles
DEU.26.8	and rescued us from Egypt.
DEU.26.9	You brought us here
DEU.26.9	and gave us this land
DEU.26.9	rich with milk and honey.
DEU.26.10	Now, 
DEU.26.10	the best of the crops
DEU.26.10	that you have given me.
DEU.26.10	After you say these things, place the basket in front of the 
DEU.26.11	Then you and your family must celebrate by eating a meal at the place of worship to thank the 
DEU.26.13	Then you must pray:
DEU.26.13	Our 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten any of this sacred food while I was in mourning; in fact, I never touched it when I was unclean.
DEU.26.15	Our 
DEU.26.16	Today the 
DEU.26.17	In response, you have agreed that the 
DEU.26.19	The 
DEU.27.1	Moses stood together with the leaders and told the people of Israel:
DEU.27.1	Obey all the laws and teachings that I am giving you today. 
DEU.27.2+DEU.27.3+DEU.27.4	 Soon you will enter the land that the 
DEU.27.2+DEU.27.3+DEU.27.4	After you cross the Jordan River, go to Mount Ebal. Set up large slabs of stone, then cover them with white plaster and write on them a copy of these laws.
DEU.27.6	Look for stones that can be used without being cut. Then offer sacrifices to please the 
DEU.27.7	Next, offer sacrifices to ask the 
DEU.27.8	Don't forget to write out a copy of these laws on the stone slabs that you are going to set up. Make sure that the writing is easy to read.
DEU.27.9	Moses stood together with the priests
DEU.27.10	So you must obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you.”
DEU.27.11	That same day, Moses gave them the following instructions:

DEU.28.3	The 
DEU.28.4	You will have many children. You will harvest large crops, and your herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats will produce many young.
DEU.28.5	You will have plenty of bread

DEU.28.15	Israel, today I am giving you the laws and teachings of the 
DEU.28.16	Your businesses and farms will fail.
DEU.28.17	You won't have enough bread
DEU.28.18	You'll have only a few children, your crops will be small, and your herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats won't produce many young.

DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	You will become insane and go blind. The 
DEU.28.29	that even in bright sunshine you will have to feel your way around like a blind person, who cannot tell day from night. For the rest of your life, people will beat and rob you, and no one will be able to stop them.
DEU.28.30	A man will be engaged to a woman, but before they can get married, she will be raped by enemy soldiers. Some of you will build houses, but never get to live in them. If you plant a vineyard, you won't be around long enough to enjoy the first harvest. 
DEU.28.31	Your cattle will be killed while you watch, but you won't get to eat any of the meat. Your donkeys and sheep will be stolen from you, and no one will be around to force your enemies to give them back. 
DEU.28.32	Your sons and daughters will be dragged off to a foreign country, while you stand there helpless. And even if you watch for them until you go blind, you will never see them again.
DEU.28.33	You will work hard on your farms, but everything you harvest will be eaten by foreigners, who will mistreat you and abuse you for the rest of your life.
DEU.28.34	What you see will be so horrible that you will go insane, 
DEU.28.35	and the 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	People of nearby countries will shudder when they see your terrible troubles, but they will still make fun of you.
DEU.28.38	You will plant a lot of seed, but gather a small harvest, because locusts
DEU.28.39	You will plant vineyards and work hard at taking care of them, but you won't gather any grapes, much less get any wine, because the vines themselves will be eaten by worms. 
DEU.28.40	Even if your olive trees grow everywhere in your country, the olives will fall off before they are ready, and there won't be enough olive oil for combing your hair.
DEU.28.41	Even your children will be taken as prisoners of war.
DEU.28.42	Locusts
DEU.28.43	Foreigners in your towns will become wealthy and powerful, while you become poor and powerless. 
DEU.28.44	You will be so short of money that you will have to borrow from those foreigners. They will be the leaders in the community, and you will be the followers.
DEU.28.45	Israel, if you don't obey the laws and teachings that the 
DEU.28.46	Then everyone will look at you and your descendants and realize that the 
DEU.28.47	If the 
DEU.28.48	he will send enemies to attack you and make you their slaves. Then you will live in poverty with nothing to eat, drink, or wear, and your owners will work you to death.
DEU.28.49	Foreigners who speak a strange language will be sent to attack you without warning, just like an eagle swooping down. 
DEU.28.50	They won't show any mercy, and they will have no respect for old people or pity for children. 
DEU.28.51	They will take your cattle, sheep, goats, grain, wine, and olive oil, then leave you to starve.
DEU.28.52	All over the land that the 
DEU.28.53	while you wait in horror. Finally, you will get so hungry that you will eat the sons and daughters that the 
DEU.28.54+DEU.28.55	Because of hunger, a man who had been gentle and kind will eat his own children and refuse to share the meal with his brother or wife or with his other children. 
DEU.28.56+DEU.28.57	 A woman may have grown up in such luxury that she never had to put a foot on the ground. But times will be so bad that she will secretly eat both her newborn baby and the afterbirth, without sharing any with her husband or her other children.
DEU.28.58	You must obey everything in 
DEU.28.59	he will punish you and your descendants with incurable diseases, 
DEU.28.60	like those you were so afraid of in Egypt. 
DEU.28.61	Remember! If the 
DEU.28.62	There are as many of you now as the stars in the sky, but if you disobey the 
DEU.28.63	The 
DEU.28.64	Those of you that survive will be scattered to every nation on earth, and you will have to worship stone and wood idols
DEU.28.65	You will be restless—always longing for home, but never able to return. 
DEU.28.66	You will live in constant fear of death. 
DEU.28.67	Each morning you will wake up to such terrible sights that you will say, “I wish it were night!” But at night you will be terrified and say, “I wish it were day!”
DEU.28.68	I told you never to go back to Egypt. But now the 
DEU.29.1	So Moses finished telling the Israelites what they had to do in order to keep the agreement the 
DEU.29.2+DEU.29.3	Moses called the nation of Israel together and told them:
DEU.29.2+DEU.29.3	When you were in Egypt, you saw the 
DEU.29.4+DEU.29.5+DEU.29.6	He has even told you, “For 40 years I, the 
DEU.29.4+DEU.29.5+DEU.29.6	But the 
DEU.29.8	 Then we captured their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh.
DEU.29.9	Israel, the 
DEU.29.10+DEU.29.11+DEU.29.12	Today everyone in our nation is standing here in the 
DEU.29.13+DEU.29.14+DEU.29.15	In this agreement, the 
DEU.29.16+DEU.29.17	When we lived in Egypt, you saw the Egyptians worship disgusting idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold. Then as we traveled through other nations, you saw those people worship other disgusting idols. 
DEU.29.18	 So make sure that everyone in your tribe remains faithful to the 
DEU.29.18	If even one of you worships idols, you will be like the root of a plant that produces bitter, poisonous fruit. 
DEU.29.19	You may be an Israelite and know all about the 
DEU.29.20+DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	The 
DEU.29.23	 has become a scorching desert of salt and sulfur, where nothing is planted, nothing sprouts, and nothing grows. It will be as lifeless as the land around the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, after the 
DEU.29.24	People from other nations will ask, “Why did the 
DEU.29.25	And they will be given this answer:
DEU.29.25	Our ancestors worshiped the 
DEU.29.26	and decided to worship gods that had never helped them. The 
DEU.29.27+DEU.29.28	and so he became furious and punished the land with all the curses in 
DEU.29.29	The 
DEU.30.2	return to him with all your heart and soul and start obeying the commands I have given to you today. 
DEU.30.3+DEU.30.4	Then he will stop punishing you and treat you with kindness. He may have scattered you to the farthest countries on earth, but he will bring you back 
DEU.30.5	to the land that had belonged to your ancestors and make you even more successful and powerful than they ever were.
DEU.30.6	You and your descendants are stubborn, but the 
DEU.30.7	Then the 
DEU.30.8	You will again obey the laws and teachings of the 
DEU.30.9	and he will bless you with many children, large herds and flocks, and abundant crops. The 
DEU.30.10	But you must decide once and for all to worship him with all your heart and soul and to obey everything in 
DEU.30.11	You know God's laws, and it isn't impossible to obey them. 
DEU.30.12	 His commands aren't in heaven, so you can't excuse yourselves by saying, “How can we obey the 
DEU.30.13	And you can't say, “How can we obey the 
DEU.30.14	No, these commands are nearby and you know them by heart. All you have to do is obey!
DEU.30.16+DEU.30.17+DEU.30.18	I am commanding you to be loyal to the 
DEU.30.16+DEU.30.17+DEU.30.18	On the other hand, you might choose to disobey the 
DEU.30.19	Now I call the sky and the earth to be witnesses that I am offering you this choice. Will you choose for the 
DEU.30.20	 Be completely faithful to the 
DEU.31.1	Moses again spoke to the whole nation of Israel:
DEU.31.3+DEU.31.4+DEU.31.5	 But he has promised that he and Joshua will lead you across the Jordan to attack the nations that live on the other side. The 
DEU.31.6	Be brave and strong! Don't be afraid of the nations on the other side of the Jordan. The 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses called Joshua up in front of the crowd and said:
DEU.31.7	Joshua, be brave and strong as you lead these people into their land. The 
DEU.31.8	 The 
DEU.31.9	Moses wrote down all of these laws and teachings and gave them to the priests and the leaders of Israel. The priests were from the Levi tribe, and they carried the sacred chest that belonged to the 
DEU.31.10+DEU.31.11	 Moses told these priests and leaders:
DEU.31.10+DEU.31.11	Each year the Israelites must come together to celebrate the Festival of Shelters at the place where the 
DEU.31.12+DEU.31.13	Everyone must come—men, women, children, and even the foreigners who live in your towns. And each new generation will listen and learn to worship the 
DEU.31.14	The 
DEU.31.14	Moses and Joshua went to the sacred tent, 
DEU.31.15	and the 
DEU.31.16	The 
DEU.31.16	Moses, you will soon die. But Israel is going into a land where other gods are worshiped, and Israel will reject me and start worshiping these gods. The people will break the agreement I made with them, 
DEU.31.17	and I will be so furious that I will abandon them and ignore their prayers. I will send disasters and suffering that will nearly wipe them out. Finally, they will realize that the disasters happened because I abandoned them. 
DEU.31.18	They will pray to me, but I will ignore them because they were evil and started worshiping other gods.
DEU.31.19	Moses and Joshua, I am going to give you the words to a new song. Write them down and teach the song to the Israelites. If they learn it, they will know what I want them to do, and so they will have no excuse for not obeying me. 
DEU.31.20	I am bringing them into the land that I promised their ancestors. It is a land rich with milk and honey, and the Israelites will have more than enough food to eat. But they will get fat and turn their backs on me and start worshiping other gods. The Israelites will reject me and break the agreement that I made with them.
DEU.31.21	When I punish the Israelites and their descendants with suffering and disasters, I will remind them that they know the words to this song, so they have no excuse for not obeying me.
DEU.31.21	I will give them the land that I promised, but I know the way they are going to live later on.
DEU.31.22	Moses at once wrote down the words to the song,
DEU.31.24	Moses wrote down all these laws and teachings in a book, 
DEU.31.25	then he went to the Levites who carried the sacred chest and said:
DEU.31.26	This is 
DEU.31.27	I know how stubborn and rebellious you and the rest of the Israelites are. You have rebelled against the 
DEU.31.28	So call together the leaders and officials of the tribes of Israel. I will bring this book and read every word of it to you, and I will call the sky and the earth as witnesses that all of you know what you are supposed to do.
DEU.31.29	I am going to die soon, and I know that in the future you will stop caring about what is right and what is wrong, and so you will disobey the 
DEU.31.30	Moses called a meeting of all the people of Israel, so he could teach them the words to the song that the 
DEU.32.1	Earth and Sky,
DEU.32.1	listen to what I say!
DEU.32.2	Israel, I will teach you.
DEU.32.2	My words will be like gentle rain
DEU.32.2	on tender young plants,
DEU.32.2	or like dew on the grass.
DEU.32.3	Join with me in praising
DEU.32.3	the wonderful name
DEU.32.3	of the 
DEU.32.4	The 
DEU.32.4	and he never does wrong.
DEU.32.4	God can always be trusted
DEU.32.4	to bring justice.
DEU.32.5	But you lie and cheat
DEU.32.5	and are unfaithful to him.
DEU.32.5	You have disgraced yourselves
DEU.32.5	and are no longer worthy
DEU.32.5	to be his children.
DEU.32.6	Israel, the 
DEU.32.6	the one who created you,
DEU.32.6	but you repaid him
DEU.32.6	by being foolish.
DEU.32.7	Think about past generations.
DEU.32.7	Ask your parents
DEU.32.7	or any of your elders.
DEU.32.7	They will tell you
DEU.32.8	gave land to every nation.
DEU.32.8	He assigned a guardian angel
DEU.32.8	to each of them,
DEU.32.9	but the 
DEU.32.9	takes care of Israel.
DEU.32.10	Israel, the 
DEU.32.10	in a barren desert
DEU.32.10	filled with howling winds.
DEU.32.10	God became your fortress,
DEU.32.10	protecting you as though
DEU.32.10	you were his own eyes.
DEU.32.11	The 
DEU.32.11	teaching its young to fly,
DEU.32.11	always ready to swoop down
DEU.32.11	and catch them on its back.
DEU.32.12	Israel, the 
DEU.32.12	and without the aid
DEU.32.12	of a foreign god,
DEU.32.13	he helped you
DEU.32.13	capture the land.
DEU.32.13	Your fields were rich
DEU.32.13	with grain.
DEU.32.13	Olive trees grew
DEU.32.13	in your stony soil,
DEU.32.13	and honey was found
DEU.32.13	among the rocks.
DEU.32.14	Your flocks and herds
DEU.32.14	produced milk and yogurt,
DEU.32.14	and you got choice meat
DEU.32.14	from your sheep and goats
DEU.32.14	that grazed in Bashan.
DEU.32.14	Your wheat was the finest,
DEU.32.14	and you drank the best wine.
DEU.32.15	Israel,
DEU.32.15	against God, your Creator
DEU.32.15	you rejected the Mighty Rock,
DEU.32.15	your only place of safety.
DEU.32.16	You made God jealous and angry
DEU.32.16	by worshiping disgusting idols
DEU.32.16	and foreign gods.
DEU.32.17	to demons, those useless gods
DEU.32.17	that never helped you,
DEU.32.17	new gods that your ancestors
DEU.32.17	never worshiped.
DEU.32.18	You turned away
DEU.32.18	from God, your Creator;
DEU.32.18	you forgot the Mighty Rock,
DEU.32.18	the source of your life.
DEU.32.19	You were the 
DEU.32.19	but you made him angry.
DEU.32.19	Then he rejected you 
DEU.32.20	and said,
DEU.32.20	“You are unfaithful
DEU.32.20	and can't be trusted.
DEU.32.20	So I won't answer your prayers;
DEU.32.20	I'll just watch and see
DEU.32.20	what happens to you.
DEU.32.21	and made me jealous
DEU.32.21	and angry!
DEU.32.21	Now I will send a cruel
DEU.32.21	and worthless nation
DEU.32.21	to make you jealous and angry.
DEU.32.22	“My people, I will breathe out fire
DEU.32.22	that sends you down
DEU.32.22	to the world of the dead.
DEU.32.22	It will scorch your farmlands
DEU.32.22	and burn deep down
DEU.32.22	under the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I'll send disaster after disaster
DEU.32.23	to strike you like arrows.
DEU.32.24	You'll be struck by starvation
DEU.32.24	and deadly diseases,
DEU.32.24	by the fangs of wild animals
DEU.32.24	and poisonous snakes.
DEU.32.25	Young and old alike
DEU.32.25	will be killed in the streets
DEU.32.25	and terrified at home.
DEU.32.26	“I wanted to scatter you,
DEU.32.26	so no one would remember
DEU.32.26	that you had ever lived.
DEU.32.27	But I dreaded the sound
DEU.32.27	of your enemies saying,
DEU.32.27	‘We defeated Israel with no help
DEU.32.27	from the 
DEU.32.28	People of Israel,
DEU.32.28	that's what the 
DEU.32.28	has said to you.
DEU.32.28	But you don't have good sense,
DEU.32.28	and you never listen
DEU.32.28	to advice.
DEU.32.29	If you did, you could see
DEU.32.29	where you are headed.
DEU.32.30	How could one enemy soldier
DEU.32.30	chase a thousand
DEU.32.30	of Israel's troops?
DEU.32.30	Or how could two of theirs
DEU.32.30	pursue ten thousand of ours?
DEU.32.30	It can only happen if the 
DEU.32.30	stops protecting Israel
DEU.32.30	and lets the enemy win.
DEU.32.31	Even our enemies know
DEU.32.31	that only our God
DEU.32.31	is a Mighty Rock.
DEU.32.32	Our enemies are grapevines
DEU.32.32	rooted in the fields
DEU.32.32	of Sodom and Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	The grapes they produce
DEU.32.32	are full of bitter poison;
DEU.32.33	their wine is more deadly
DEU.32.33	than cobra venom.
DEU.32.34	But the 
DEU.32.34	a list of their sins
DEU.32.34	and locked it in his vault.
DEU.32.35	what they deserve
DEU.32.35	suddenly they will slip,
DEU.32.35	and total disaster
DEU.32.35	will quickly follow.
DEU.32.36	of the 
DEU.32.36	when their strength is gone,
DEU.32.36	and some of them are slaves,
DEU.32.36	the 
DEU.32.36	and give them justice.
DEU.32.37	But first the 
DEU.32.37	“You ran for safety to other gods—
DEU.32.37	couldn't they help you?
DEU.32.38	You offered them wine
DEU.32.38	and your best sacrifices.
DEU.32.38	Can't those gods help you now
DEU.32.38	or give you protection?
DEU.32.39	Don't you understand?
DEU.32.39	I am the only God;
DEU.32.39	there are no others.
DEU.32.39	I am the one who takes life
DEU.32.39	and gives it again.
DEU.32.39	I punished you with suffering.
DEU.32.39	But now I will heal you,
DEU.32.39	and nothing can stop me!
DEU.32.40	“I make this solemn promise:
DEU.32.40	Just as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	I will take revenge
DEU.32.41	on my hateful enemies.
DEU.32.41	I will sharpen my sword
DEU.32.41	and let it flash
DEU.32.41	like lightning.
DEU.32.42	My arrows will get drunk
DEU.32.42	on enemy blood;
DEU.32.42	my sword will taste the flesh
DEU.32.42	and the blood of the enemy.
DEU.32.42	It will kill prisoners,
DEU.32.42	and cut off the heads
DEU.32.42	of their leaders.”
DEU.32.43	and all gods to bow down
DEU.32.43	to the 
DEU.32.43	because he will take revenge
DEU.32.43	on those hateful enemies
DEU.32.43	who killed his people.
DEU.32.43	He will forgive the sins of Israel
DEU.32.43	and purify their land.
DEU.32.44+DEU.32.45	Moses spoke the words of the song so that all the Israelites could hear, and Joshua
DEU.32.46	he said, “Always remember this song I have taught you today. And let it be a warning that you must teach your children to obey everything written in 
DEU.32.47	The Law isn't empty words. It can give you a long life in the land that you are going to take.”
DEU.32.49	Go up into the Abarim Mountain range here in Moab across the Jordan River valley from Jericho. And when you reach the top of Mount Nebo, you will be able to see the land of Canaan, which I am giving to Israel. 
DEU.32.50	Then you will die and be buried on the mountaintop, just as your brother Aaron died and was buried on Mount Hor. 
DEU.32.51	Both of you were unfaithful to me at Meribah Spring near Kadesh in the Zin Desert.
DEU.32.52	So I will give the land to the people of Israel, but you will only get to see it from a distance.
DEU.33.1	Moses was a prophet, and before he died, he blessed the tribes of Israel by saying:
DEU.33.2	The 
DEU.33.2	From Edom, he gave light
DEU.33.2	to his people,
DEU.33.2	and his glory was shining
DEU.33.2	from Mount Paran.
DEU.33.2	Thousands of his warriors
DEU.33.2	were with him, and fire
DEU.33.2	was at his right hand.
DEU.33.3	of Israel,
DEU.33.3	and he protects his people.
DEU.33.3	They listen to his words
DEU.33.3	and worship at his feet.
DEU.33.3	* 
DEU.33.4	I called a meeting
DEU.33.4	of the tribes of Israel
DEU.33.4	and gave you God's Law.
DEU.33.5	Then you and your leaders
DEU.33.5	made the 
DEU.33.6	Tribe of Reuben, you will live,
DEU.33.6	even though your tribe
DEU.33.6	will always be small.
DEU.33.7	The 
DEU.33.7	tribe of Judah, as you beg
DEU.33.7	to come safely home.
DEU.33.7	You fought your enemies alone;
DEU.33.7	now the 
DEU.33.8	the 
DEU.33.8	tribe of Levi.
DEU.33.8	You were faithful,
DEU.33.8	and so the priesthood
DEU.33.8	to the Levi tribe.
DEU.33.9	Protecting Israel's agreement
DEU.33.9	with the 
DEU.33.9	was more important to you
DEU.33.9	than the life of your father
DEU.33.9	or mother,
DEU.33.9	or brothers or sisters,
DEU.33.9	or your own children.
DEU.33.10	You teach God's laws to Israel,
DEU.33.10	and at the place of worship
DEU.33.10	you offer sacrifices
DEU.33.10	and burn incense.
DEU.33.11	I pray that the 
DEU.33.11	everything you do,
DEU.33.11	and make you strong enough
DEU.33.11	to crush your enemies.

DEU.33.13	with precious water
DEU.33.13	from deep wells
DEU.33.13	and with dew from the sky.
DEU.33.14	Month by month, your fruit
DEU.33.14	will ripen in the sunshine.
DEU.33.15	You will have a rich harvest
DEU.33.15	from the slopes
DEU.33.15	of the ancient hills.
DEU.33.16	The 
DEU.33.16	in the burning bush

DEU.33.16	on Joseph's head.
DEU.33.17	The armies of Ephraim
DEU.33.17	and Manasseh
DEU.33.17	are majestic and fierce
DEU.33.17	like a bull or a wild ox.
DEU.33.17	They will run their spears
DEU.33.17	through faraway nations.
DEU.33.18	Be happy, Zebulun,
DEU.33.18	as your boats set sail;
DEU.33.18	be happy, Issachar,
DEU.33.18	in your tents.
DEU.33.19	The sea will make you wealthy,
DEU.33.19	and from the sandy beach
DEU.33.19	you will get treasure.
DEU.33.19	So invite the other tribes
DEU.33.19	to celebrate with you
DEU.33.19	and offer sacrifices to God.
DEU.33.20	Tribe of Gad,
DEU.33.20	the 
DEU.33.20	with more land.
DEU.33.20	So shout his praises!
DEU.33.20	Your tribe is like a lion
DEU.33.20	ripping up its victim.
DEU.33.21	Your leaders met together
DEU.33.21	and chose the best land
DEU.33.21	for your tribe,
DEU.33.21	but you obeyed the 
DEU.33.21	and helped the other tribes.

DEU.33.24	of all the other tribes.

DEU.33.25	for as long as they live.
DEU.33.26	Israel,
DEU.33.26	is like ours—

DEU.34.1	Sometime later, Moses left the lowlands of Moab. He went up Mount Pisgah to the peak of Mount Nebo,
DEU.34.2	He let Moses see the territories that would soon belong to the tribes of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah, as far west as the Mediterranean Sea. 
DEU.34.3	The 
DEU.34.5	And so, Moses the 
DEU.34.6	The 
DEU.34.7	Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was still good, and his body was strong.
DEU.34.8	The people of Israel stayed in the lowlands of Moab, where they mourned and grieved 30 days for Moses, as was their custom.
DEU.34.9	Before Moses died, he had placed his hands on Joshua, and the 
DEU.34.11	and sent him to perform powerful miracles in the presence of the king of Egypt and his entire nation. 
DEU.34.12	No one else has ever had the power to do such great things as Moses did for everyone to see.
JOS.1.1	Moses, the 
JOS.1.2	My servant Moses is dead. Now you must lead Israel across the Jordan River into the land I'm giving to all of you. 
JOS.1.3	 Wherever you go, I'll give you that land, as I promised Moses. 
JOS.1.4	It will reach from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and to the northeast as far as the great Euphrates River. It will include the land of the Hittites,
JOS.1.5	 Joshua, I will always be with you and help you as I helped Moses, and no one will ever be able to defeat you.
JOS.1.9	I've commanded you to be strong and brave. Don't ever be afraid or discouraged! I am the 
JOS.1.10	Joshua ordered the tribal leaders 
JOS.1.11	to go through the camp and tell everyone:
JOS.1.11	In a few days we will cross the Jordan River to take the land that the 
JOS.1.13+JOS.1.14	The 
JOS.1.15	conquer the land that the 
JOS.1.16	The men answered:
JOS.1.16	We'll cross the Jordan River and help our relatives. We'll fight anywhere you send us. 
JOS.1.17+JOS.1.18	If the 
JOS.2.1	The two spies left the Israelite camp at Acacia and went to Jericho, where they decided to spend the night at the house of a prostitute
JOS.2.2	But someone found out about them and told the king of Jericho, “Some Israelite men came here tonight, and they are spies.” 
JOS.2.3+JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6+JOS.2.7	So the king sent soldiers to Rahab's house to arrest the spies.
JOS.2.3+JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6+JOS.2.7	Meanwhile, Rahab had taken the men up to the flat roof of her house and had hidden them under some piles of flax plants
JOS.2.3+JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6+JOS.2.7	The soldiers came to her door and demanded, “Let us have the men who are staying at your house. They are spies.”
JOS.2.3+JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6+JOS.2.7	She answered, “Some men did come to my house, but I didn't know where they had come from. They left about sunset, just before it was time to close the town gate.
JOS.2.3+JOS.2.4+JOS.2.5+JOS.2.6+JOS.2.7	The guards at the town gate let the soldiers leave Jericho, but they closed the gate again as soon as the soldiers went through. Then the soldiers headed toward the Jordan River to look for the spies at the place where people cross the river.
JOS.2.8	Rahab went back up to her roof. The spies were still awake, so she told them:
JOS.2.9	I know that the 
JOS.2.10	 We heard how the 
JOS.2.11	We know that the 
JOS.2.12	Please promise me in the 
JOS.2.13	that you won't let your people kill my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and their families.
JOS.2.14	“Rahab,” the spies answered, “if you keep quiet about what we're doing, we promise to be kind to you when the 
JOS.2.15	Rahab's house was built into the town wall,
JOS.2.16	Then hide in the hills. The men who are looking for you won't be able to find you there. They'll give up and come back after a few days, and you can be on your way.”
JOS.2.17+JOS.2.18+JOS.2.19+JOS.2.20	The spies said:
JOS.2.17+JOS.2.18+JOS.2.19+JOS.2.20	You made us promise to let you and your family live. We will keep our promise, but you can't tell anyone why we were here. You must tie this red rope on your window when we attack, and your father and mother, your brothers, and everyone else in your family must be here with you. We'll take the blame if anyone who stays in this house gets hurt. But anyone who leaves your house will be killed, and it won't be our fault.
JOS.2.21	“I'll do exactly what you said,” Rahab promised. Then she sent them on their way and tied the red rope to the window.
JOS.2.22	The spies hid in the hills for three days while the king's soldiers looked for them along the roads. As soon as the soldiers gave up and returned to Jericho, 
JOS.2.23	the two spies went down into the Jordan valley and crossed the river. They reported to Joshua and told him everything that had happened. 
JOS.2.24	“We're sure the 
JOS.3.1	Early the next morning, Joshua and the Israelites packed up and left Acacia. They went to the Jordan River and camped there that night. 
JOS.3.2	Two days later
JOS.3.3+JOS.3.4	shouting, “When you see some of the priests
JOS.3.5	Joshua told the people, “Make yourselves acceptable
JOS.3.6	Then Joshua turned to the priests and said, “Take the chest and cross the Jordan River ahead of us.” So the priests picked up the chest by its carrying poles and went on ahead.
JOS.3.7	The 
JOS.3.8	Now, tell the priests who are carrying the chest to go a little way into the river and stand there.”
JOS.3.9	Joshua spoke to the people:
JOS.3.9	Come here and listen to what the 
JOS.3.10	The Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites control the land on the other side of the river. But the living God will be with you and will force them out of the land when you attack. And now, God is going to prove that he's powerful enough to force them out. 
JOS.3.11+JOS.3.12+JOS.3.13	Just watch the sacred chest that belongs to the 
JOS.3.11+JOS.3.12+JOS.3.13	The 
JOS.3.14	The Israelites packed up and left camp. The priests carrying the chest walked in front, 
JOS.3.15	until they came to the Jordan River. The water in the river had risen over its banks, as it often does in springtime.
JOS.3.16+JOS.3.17	the river stopped flowing, and the water started piling up at the town of Adam near Zarethan. No water flowed toward the Dead Sea, and the priests stood in the middle of the dry riverbed near Jericho while everyone else crossed over.
JOS.4.1	After Israel had crossed the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2+JOS.4.3	Tell
JOS.4.4	Joshua chose twelve men; then he called them together 
JOS.4.5	and said:
JOS.4.5	Go to the middle of the riverbed where the sacred chest is, and pick up a large rock. Carry it on your shoulder to our camp. There are twelve of you, so there will be one rock for each tribe. 
JOS.4.6+JOS.4.7	Someday your children will ask, “Why are these rocks here?” Then you can tell them how the water stopped flowing when the chest was being carried across the river. These rocks will always remind our people of what happened here today.
JOS.4.8	The men followed the instructions that the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua set up a monument next to the place where the priests were standing. This monument was also made of twelve large rocks, and it is still there in the middle of the river.
JOS.4.10+JOS.4.11+JOS.4.12+JOS.4.13	The army got ready for battle and crossed the Jordan with everyone else. They marched quickly past the sacred chest
JOS.4.10+JOS.4.11+JOS.4.12+JOS.4.13	The priests stayed right where they were until the people had followed the orders that the 
JOS.4.14+JOS.4.15+JOS.4.16+JOS.4.17+JOS.4.18	“Joshua,” the 
JOS.4.14+JOS.4.15+JOS.4.16+JOS.4.17+JOS.4.18	That's how the 
JOS.4.19	It was the tenth day of the first month
JOS.4.20	The men who had carried the twelve rocks from the Jordan brought them to Joshua, and they made them into a monument. 
JOS.4.21	Then Joshua told the people:
JOS.4.21	Years from now your children will ask you why these rocks are here. 
JOS.4.22+JOS.4.23	Tell them, “The 
JOS.4.24	because he wants everyone on earth to know how powerful he is. And he wants us to worship only him.”
JOS.5.1	The Amorite kings west of the Jordan River and the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea lost their courage and their will to fight, when they heard how the 
JOS.5.2	While Israel was camped at Gilgal, the 
JOS.5.3	Joshua made the knives, then circumcised those men and boys at Haaraloth Hill.
JOS.5.4+JOS.5.5+JOS.5.6+JOS.5.7	 This had to be done, because none of Israel's baby boys had been circumcised during the 40 years that Israel had wandered through the desert after leaving Egypt.
JOS.5.4+JOS.5.5+JOS.5.6+JOS.5.7	And why had they wandered for 40 years? It was because right after they left Egypt, the men in the army had disobeyed the 
JOS.5.8	Everyone who had been circumcised needed time to heal, and they stayed in camp.
JOS.5.9	The 
JOS.5.13	One day, Joshua was near Jericho when he saw a man standing some distance in front of him. The man was holding a sword, so Joshua walked up to him and asked, “Are you on our side or on our enemies' side?”
JOS.5.14	“Neither,” he answered. “I am here because I am the commander of the 
JOS.5.14	Joshua fell to his knees and bowed down to the ground. “I am your servant,” he said. “Tell me what to do.”
JOS.5.15	“Take off your sandals,” the commander answered. “This is a holy place.”
JOS.5.15	So Joshua took off his sandals.
JOS.6.1	Meanwhile, the people of Jericho had been locking the gates in their town wall because they were afraid of the Israelites. No one could go out or come in.
JOS.6.2+JOS.6.3	The 
JOS.6.2+JOS.6.3	With my help, you and your army will defeat the king of Jericho and his army, and you will capture the town. Here is how to do it: March slowly around Jericho once a day for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Take along the sacred chest and tell seven priests to walk in front of it, carrying trumpets.
JOS.6.4	But on the seventh day, march slowly around the town seven times while the priests blow their trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	Then the priests will blast on their trumpets, and everyone else will shout. The wall will fall down, and your soldiers can go straight in from every side.
JOS.6.6	Joshua called the priests together and said, “Take the chest and tell seven priests to carry trumpets and march ahead of it.”
JOS.6.7+JOS.6.8+JOS.6.9+JOS.6.10	Next, he gave the army their orders: “March slowly around Jericho. A few of you will go ahead of the chest to guard it, but most of you will follow it. Don't shout the battle cry or yell or even talk until the day I tell you to. Then let out a shout!”
JOS.6.7+JOS.6.8+JOS.6.9+JOS.6.10	As soon as Joshua finished giving the orders, the army started marching. One group of soldiers led the way, with seven priests marching behind them and blowing trumpets. Then came the priests carrying the chest, followed by the rest of the soldiers. 
JOS.6.11	They obeyed Joshua's orders and carried the chest once around the town before returning to camp for the night.
JOS.6.12+JOS.6.13+JOS.6.14	Early the next morning, Joshua and everyone else started marching around Jericho in the same order as the day before. One group of soldiers was in front, followed by the seven priests with trumpets and the priests who carried the chest. The rest of the army came next. The seven priests blew their trumpets while everyone marched slowly around Jericho and back to camp. They did this once a day for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day, the army got up at daybreak. They marched slowly around Jericho the same as they had done for the past six days, except on this day they went around seven times. 
JOS.6.16	Then the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua yelled:
JOS.6.16	Get ready to shout! The 
JOS.6.17	But you must destroy it and everything in it, to show that it now belongs to the 
JOS.6.18+JOS.6.19	The silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron belong to the 
JOS.6.21+JOS.6.22+JOS.6.23+JOS.6.24+JOS.6.25	 They killed everyone, men and women, young and old, everyone except Rahab and the others in her house. They even killed every cow, sheep, and donkey.
JOS.6.21+JOS.6.22+JOS.6.23+JOS.6.24+JOS.6.25	Joshua said to the two men who had been spies, “Rahab kept you safe when I sent you to Jericho. We promised to protect her and her family, and we will keep that promise. Now go into her house and bring them out.”
JOS.6.21+JOS.6.22+JOS.6.23+JOS.6.24+JOS.6.25	The two men went into Rahab's house and brought her out, along with her father and mother, her brothers, and her other relatives. Rahab and her family had to stay in a place just outside the Israelite army camp.
JOS.6.21+JOS.6.22+JOS.6.23+JOS.6.24+JOS.6.25	The Israelites took the silver and gold and the things made of bronze and iron and put them with the rest of the treasure that was kept at the 
JOS.6.27	The 
JOS.7.1	The 
JOS.7.2	While Israel was still camped near Jericho, Joshua sent some spies with these instructions: “Go to the town of Ai
JOS.7.2	The spies left and went to Ai, which is east of Bethel and near Beth-Aven. 
JOS.7.3	They went back to Joshua and reported, “You don't need to send the whole army to attack Ai—2,000 or 3,000 troops will be enough. Why bother the whole army for a town that small?”
JOS.7.4+JOS.7.5	Joshua sent about 3,000 soldiers to attack Ai. But the men of Ai fought back and chased the Israelite soldiers away from the town gate and down the hill to the stone quarries.
JOS.7.6	Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes and put dirt on their heads to show their sorrow. They lay facedown on the ground in front of the sacred chest until sunset. 
JOS.7.7	Then Joshua said:
JOS.7.7	Our 
JOS.7.8	I don't even know what to say to you, since Israel's army has turned and run from the enemy. 
JOS.7.9	Everyone will think you weren't strong enough to protect your people. Now the Canaanites and everyone else who lives in the land will surround us and wipe us out.
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.10	Stop lying there on the ground! Get up! 
JOS.7.11	I said everything in Jericho belonged to me and had to be destroyed. But the Israelites have kept some of the things for themselves. They stole from me and hid what they took. Then they lied about it. 
JOS.7.12	What they stole was supposed to be destroyed, and now Israel itself must be destroyed. I cannot help you anymore until you do exactly what I have said. That's why Israel turns and runs from its enemies instead of standing up to them.
JOS.7.13	Tell the people of Israel, “Tomorrow you will meet with the 
JOS.7.14	“Tomorrow morning everyone must gather near the place of worship. You will come forward tribe by tribe, and the 
JOS.7.15	and the 
JOS.7.16	Joshua got up early the next morning and brought each tribe to the place of worship, where the 
JOS.7.17	Then Joshua brought the clans of Judah to the 
JOS.7.18	Finally, Joshua brought each man in Zabdi's family to the 
JOS.7.19	“Achan,” Joshua said, “the 
JOS.7.20	“It's true,” Achan answered. “I sinned and disobeyed the 
JOS.7.21+JOS.7.22	While we were in Jericho, I saw a beautiful Babylonian robe, 200 pieces of silver, and a gold bar that weighed the same as 50 pieces of gold. I wanted them for myself, so I took them. I dug a hole under my tent and hid the silver, the gold, and the robe.”
JOS.7.21+JOS.7.22	Joshua told some people to run to Achan's tent, where they found the silver, the gold, and the robe. 
JOS.7.23	They brought them back and put them in front of the sacred chest, so Joshua and the rest of the Israelites could see them. 
JOS.7.24	Then everyone took Achan and the things he had stolen to Trouble Valley.
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Achan, you caused us a lot of trouble. Now the 
JOS.7.25	The people of Israel then stoned to death Achan and his family. They made a fire and burned the bodies, together with what Achan had stolen, and all his possessions. 
JOS.7.26	They covered the remains with a big pile of rocks, which is still there. Then the 
JOS.7.26	That's how the place came to be called Trouble Valley.
JOS.8.1+JOS.8.2	The 
JOS.8.1+JOS.8.2	Don't be afraid, and don't be discouraged by what happened at the town of Ai. Take the army and attack again. But first, order part of the army to set up an ambush on the other side of the town. I will help you defeat the king of Ai and his army, and you will capture the town and the land around it. Destroy Ai and kill its king as you did at Jericho. But you may keep the livestock and everything else you want.
JOS.8.3+JOS.8.4	Joshua quickly got the army ready to attack Ai. He chose 30,000 of his best soldiers and gave them these orders:
JOS.8.3+JOS.8.4	Tonight, while it is dark, march to Ai and take up a position behind the town. Get as close to the town as you can without being seen, and be ready to attack.
JOS.8.5+JOS.8.6	The rest of the army will come with me and attack near the gate. When the people of Ai come out to fight, we'll run away and let them chase us. They will think we are running from them just like the first time. But when we've let them chase us far enough away, 
JOS.8.7	you come out of hiding. The 
JOS.8.8	Then set it on fire, as the 
JOS.8.9	now go!
JOS.8.9	The 30,000 soldiers went to a place on the west side of Ai, between Ai and Bethel, where they could hide and wait to attack.
JOS.8.9	That night, Joshua stayed in camp with the rest of the army. 
JOS.8.10	Early the next morning he got his troops ready to move out, and he and the other leaders of Israel led them to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	They set up camp in full view of the town, across the valley to the north. 
JOS.8.12	Joshua had already sent 5,000 soldiers to the west side of the town to hide and wait to attack. 
JOS.8.13	Now all his troops were in place. Part of the army was in the camp to the north of Ai, and the others were hiding to the west, ready to make a surprise attack. That night, Joshua went into the valley.
JOS.8.14+JOS.8.15	The king of Ai saw Joshua's army, so the king and his troops hurried out early the next morning to fight them. Joshua and his army pretended to be beaten, and they let the men of Ai chase them toward the desert. The king and his army were facing the Jordan valley as Joshua had planned.
JOS.8.14+JOS.8.15	The king did not realize that some Israelite soldiers were hiding behind the town. 
JOS.8.16+JOS.8.17	So he called out every man in Ai to go after Joshua's troops. They all rushed out to chase the Israelite army, and they left the town gates wide open. Not one man was left in Ai or in Bethel.
JOS.8.16+JOS.8.17	Joshua let the men of Ai chase him and his army farther and farther away from Ai. 
JOS.8.18	Finally, the 
JOS.8.18	As soon as Joshua pointed his sword at the town, 
JOS.8.19	the soldiers who had been hiding jumped up and ran into the town. They captured it and set it on fire.
JOS.8.20+JOS.8.21	When Joshua and his troops saw smoke rising from the town, they knew that the other part of their army had captured it. So they turned and attacked.
JOS.8.20+JOS.8.21	The men of Ai looked back and saw smoke rising from their town. But they could not escape, because the soldiers they had been chasing had suddenly turned and started fighting. 
JOS.8.22+JOS.8.23+JOS.8.24	Meanwhile, the other Israelite soldiers had come from the town and attacked the men of Ai from the rear. The Israelites captured the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua. They also chased the rest of the men of Ai into the desert and killed them.
JOS.8.22+JOS.8.23+JOS.8.24	The Israelite army went back to Ai and killed everyone there. 
JOS.8.25+JOS.8.26	Joshua kept his sword pointed at the town of Ai until every last one of Ai's 12,000 people was dead. 
JOS.8.27	But the Israelites took the animals and the other possessions of the people of Ai, because this was what the 
JOS.8.28+JOS.8.29	Joshua made sure every building in Ai was burned to the ground. He told his men to kill the king of Ai and hang his body on a tree. Then at sunset he told the Israelites to take down the body,
JOS.8.30+JOS.8.31+JOS.8.32	Joshua offered sacrifices to please the 
JOS.9.1+JOS.9.2	The kings west of the Jordan River heard about Joshua's victories, so they got together and decided to attack Joshua and Israel. These kings were from the hill country and from the foothills to the west, as well as from the Mediterranean seacoast as far north as the Lebanon Mountains. Some of them were Hittites, others were Amorites or Canaanites, and still others were Perizzites, Hivites, or Jebusites.
JOS.9.3	The people of Gibeon had also heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai. 
JOS.9.4	So they decided that some of their men should pretend to be messengers to Israel from a faraway country.
JOS.9.5	Their sandals were old and patched, and their clothes were worn out. They even took along some dry and crumbly bread. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to the Israelite camp at Gilgal, where they said to Joshua and the men of Israel, “We have come from a country that is far from here. Please make a peace treaty with us.”
JOS.9.7+JOS.9.8	The Gibeonites
JOS.9.7+JOS.9.8	“Who are you?” Joshua asked. “Where do you come from?”
JOS.9.7+JOS.9.8	They answered:
JOS.9.9	We are your servants, and we live far from here. We came because the 
JOS.9.10	 and what he did to those two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan: King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, and King Sihon of Heshbon.
JOS.9.11	Our leaders and everyone who lives in our country told us to meet with you and tell you that all of us are your servants. They said to ask you to make a peace treaty with our people. They told us to be sure and take along enough food for our journey. 
JOS.9.12	See this dry, crumbly bread of ours? It was hot out of the oven when we packed the food on the day we left our homes. 
JOS.9.13	These cracked wineskins were new when we filled them, and our clothes and sandals are worn out because we have traveled so far.
JOS.9.14	The Israelites tried some of the food,
JOS.9.15	So Joshua made a peace treaty with the messengers and promised that Israel would not kill their people. Israel's leaders swore that Israel would keep this promise.
JOS.9.16+JOS.9.17	A couple of days later,
JOS.9.18	But they did not attack the towns, because the Israelite leaders had sworn in the name of the 
JOS.9.18	The Israelites complained about their leaders' decision not to attack, 
JOS.9.19+JOS.9.20+JOS.9.21	but the leaders reminded them, “We promised these people in the name of the 
JOS.9.22	Joshua told some of his soldiers, “I want to meet with the Gibeonite leaders. Bring them here.”
JOS.9.22	When the Gibeonites came, Joshua said, “You live close to us. Why did you lie by claiming you lived far away? 
JOS.9.23	So now you are under a curse, and from now on your people will have to send workers to cut wood and carry water for the place of worship.”
JOS.9.24	The Gibeonites answered, “The 
JOS.9.25	and you are strong enough to do anything to us that you want. We just ask you to do what seems right.”
JOS.9.26	Joshua did not let the Israelites kill the Gibeonites, 
JOS.9.27	but he did tell the Gibeonites that they would have to be servants of the nation of Israel. They would have to cut firewood and bring it for the priests to use for burning sacrifices on the 
JOS.10.1	King Adonizedek of Jerusalem
JOS.10.2	This frightened Adonizedek and his people. They knew that Gibeon was a large town, as big as the towns that had kings, and even bigger than the town of Ai had been. And all of the men of Gibeon were warriors. 
JOS.10.3	So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns: King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The messages said, 
JOS.10.4	“The Gibeonites have signed a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites. Come and help me attack Gibeon!”
JOS.10.5	When these five Amorite kings called their armies together and attacked Gibeon, 
JOS.10.6	the Gibeonites sent a message to the Israelite camp at Gilgal: “Joshua, please come and rescue us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have joined together and are attacking us. We are your servants, so don't let us down. Please hurry!”
JOS.10.7	Joshua and his army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal. 
JOS.10.8	“Joshua,” the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua marched all night from Gilgal to Gibeon and made a surprise attack on the Amorite camp. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	And while these troops were going down through Beth-Horon Pass,
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	“Our 
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	in the sky over Gibeon,
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	and the moon stand still
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	over Aijalon Valley.”
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	So the sun and the moon
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	stopped and stood still
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	until Israel defeated its enemies.
JOS.10.12+JOS.10.13	This poem can be found in 
JOS.10.14	Never before and never since has the 
JOS.10.15	After the battle, Joshua and the Israelites went back to their camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	While the enemy soldiers were running from the Israelites, the five enemy kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	Joshua's soldiers told him, “The five kings have been found in a cave near Makkedah.”
JOS.10.18	Joshua answered, “Roll some big stones over the mouth of the cave and leave a few soldiers to guard it. 
JOS.10.19	But you and everyone else must keep going after the enemy troops, because they will be safe if they reach their walled towns. Don't let them get away! The 
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the Israelites almost wiped out the enemy soldiers. Only a few safely reached their walled towns.
JOS.10.21	The Israelite army returned to their camp at Makkedah, where Joshua was waiting for them. No one around there dared say anything bad about the Israelites. 
JOS.10.22	Joshua told his soldiers, “Now, move the rocks from the entrance to the cave and bring those five kings to me.”
JOS.10.23	The soldiers opened the entrance to the cave and brought out the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	After Joshua had called the army together, he forced the five kings to lie down on the ground. Then he called his officers forward and told them, “You fought these kings along with me, so put your feet on their necks.” The officers did this, 
JOS.10.25	and Joshua continued, “Don't ever be afraid or discouraged. Be brave and strong. This is what the 
JOS.10.26	Joshua killed the five kings and told his men to hang each body on a tree. Then at sunset 
JOS.10.27	he told some of his troops, “Take the bodies down and throw them into the cave where the kings were found. Cover the entrance to the cave with big rocks.”
JOS.10.27	Joshua's troops obeyed his orders, and those rocks are still there.
JOS.10.28	Later that day, Joshua captured Makkedah and killed its king and everyone else in the town, just as he had done at Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Joshua and his army left Makkedah and attacked the town of Libnah. 
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	Joshua then led his army to Lachish, and they set up camp around the town. They attacked, 
JOS.10.32	and the next day the 
JOS.10.33	King Horam of Gezer arrived to help Lachish, but Joshua and his troops attacked and destroyed him and his army.
JOS.10.34	From Lachish, Joshua took his troops to Eglon, where they set up camp surrounding the town. They attacked, 
JOS.10.35	captured it that same day, then killed everyone, as they had done at Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Joshua and his army left Eglon and attacked Hebron. 
JOS.10.37	They captured the town and the nearby villages, then killed everyone, including the king. They destroyed Hebron in the same way they had destroyed Eglon.
JOS.10.38	Joshua and the Israelite army turned and attacked Debir. 
JOS.10.39	They captured the town, and its nearby villages. Then they destroyed Debir and killed its king, together with everyone else, just as they had done with Hebron and Libnah.
JOS.10.40	Joshua captured towns everywhere in the land: In the central hill country and the foothills to the west, in the Southern Desert and the region that slopes down toward the Dead Sea. Whenever he captured a town, he would kill the king and everyone else, as the 
JOS.10.41	Joshua wiped out towns from Kadesh-Barnea to Gaza, everywhere in the region of Goshen,
JOS.10.42+JOS.10.43	The 
JOS.11.1	King Jabin of Hazor heard about Joshua's victories, so he sent messages to many nearby kings and asked them to join him in fighting Israel. He sent these messages to King Jobab of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	the kings in the northern hill country and in the Jordan River valley south of Lake Galilee,
JOS.11.3	He sent messages to the Canaanite kings in the east and the west, to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, and Jebusite kings in the hill country, and to the Hivite kings in the region of Mizpah, near the foot of Mount Hermon.
JOS.11.4+JOS.11.5	The kings and their armies went to Merom Pond,
JOS.11.6	The 
JOS.11.6	Don't let them frighten you! I'll help you defeat them, and by this time tomorrow they will be dead.
JOS.11.6	When you attack, the first thing you have to do is to cripple their horses. Then after the battle is over,
JOS.11.7	Joshua and his army made a surprise attack against the enemy camp at Merom Pond
JOS.11.8+JOS.11.9	and crippled the enemies' horses.
JOS.11.10	Up to this time, the king of Hazor had controlled the kingdoms that had joined together to attack Israel, so Joshua led his army back and captured Hazor. They killed its king 
JOS.11.11	and everyone else, then they set the town on fire.
JOS.11.12+JOS.11.13+JOS.11.14+JOS.11.15	Joshua captured all the towns where the enemy kings had ruled. These towns were built on small hills,
JOS.11.16	Joshua and his army took control of the northern and southern hill country, the foothills to the west, the Southern Desert, the whole region of Goshen,
JOS.11.17+JOS.11.18	They took control of the land from Mount Halak near the country of Edom in the south to Baal-Gad in Lebanon Valley at the foot of Mount Hermon in the north. Joshua and his army were at war with the kings in this region for a long time, but finally they captured and put to death the last king.
JOS.11.21	During this same time, Joshua and his army killed the Anakim
JOS.11.22	There were not any Anakim left in the regions where the Israelites lived, although there were still some in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
JOS.11.23	That's how Joshua captured the land, just as the 
JOS.11.23	Finally, there was peace in the land.
JOS.12.2	The first king that Moses and the Israelites defeated was an Amorite, King Sihon of Heshbon.
JOS.12.3	Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan River valley from Lake Galilee
JOS.12.4	Next, Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan,
JOS.12.5	His kingdom stretched north to Mount Hermon, east to the town of Salecah, and included the land of Bashan as far west as the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. He also ruled the northern half of Gilead.
JOS.12.7+JOS.12.8	Later, Joshua and the Israelites defeated many kings west of the Jordan River, from Baal-Gad in Lebanon Valley in the north to Mount Halak near the country of Edom in the south. This region included the hill country and the foothills, the Jordan River valley and its western slopes, and the Southern Desert. Joshua and the Israelites took this land from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Joshua divided up the land among the tribes of Israel.
JOS.12.7+JOS.12.8	The Israelites defeated the kings of the following towns west of the Jordan River:
JOS.12.9+JOS.12.10+JOS.12.11+JOS.12.12+JOS.12.13+JOS.12.14+JOS.12.15+JOS.12.16+JOS.12.17+JOS.12.18+JOS.12.19+JOS.12.20+JOS.12.21+JOS.12.22+JOS.12.23+JOS.12.24	Jericho, Ai near Bethel, Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, Eglon, Gezer, Debir, Geder, Hormah, Arad, Libnah, Adullam, Makkedah, Bethel, Tappuah, Hepher, Aphek, Lasharon,
JOS.12.9+JOS.12.10+JOS.12.11+JOS.12.12+JOS.12.13+JOS.12.14+JOS.12.15+JOS.12.16+JOS.12.17+JOS.12.18+JOS.12.19+JOS.12.20+JOS.12.21+JOS.12.22+JOS.12.23+JOS.12.24	There were 31 of these kings in all.
JOS.13.1	Many years later, the 
JOS.13.1	Now you are very old, but there is still a lot of land that Israel has not yet taken. 
JOS.13.2+JOS.13.3+JOS.13.4+JOS.13.5+JOS.13.6+JOS.13.7	 First, there is the Canaanite territory that starts at the Shihor River just east of Egypt and goes north to Ekron. The southern part of this region belongs to the Avvites and the Geshurites,
JOS.13.2+JOS.13.3+JOS.13.4+JOS.13.5+JOS.13.6+JOS.13.7	The other Canaanite territory is in the north. Its northern border starts at the town of Arah, which belongs to the Sidonians. From there, it goes to Aphek,
JOS.13.2+JOS.13.3+JOS.13.4+JOS.13.5+JOS.13.6+JOS.13.7	With my help, Israel will capture these Canaanite territories and force out the people who live there. But you must divide up the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea
JOS.13.9	This region stretched north from the town in the middle of the Arnon River valley, and included the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the valley. It covered the flatlands of Medeba north of Dibon, 
JOS.13.10	and took in the towns that had belonged to Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon. Some of these towns were as far east as the Ammonite border.
JOS.13.11+JOS.13.12	Geshur and Maacah were part of this region, and so was the whole territory that King Og had ruled, that is, Gilead, Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far east as Salecah. Og had lived in Ashtaroth part of each year, and he had lived in Edrei the rest of the year. Og had been one of the last of the Rephaim,
JOS.13.13	However, the Israelites did not force the people of Geshur and Maacah to leave, and they still live there among the Israelites.
JOS.13.15	Moses gave land to each of the clans in the Reuben tribe. 
JOS.13.16	Their land started in the south at the town in the middle of the Arnon River valley, took in the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the valley, and went as far north as the flatlands around Medeba. 
JOS.13.17+JOS.13.18+JOS.13.19+JOS.13.20+JOS.13.21	The Amorite King Sihon had lived in Heshbon and had ruled the towns in the flatlands. Now Heshbon belonged to Reuben, and so did the following towns in the flatlands: Dibon, Bamoth-Baal, Beth-Baal-Meon, Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-Shahar on the hill in the valley, Beth-Peor, Slopes of Mount Pisgah, and Beth-Jeshimoth.
JOS.13.17+JOS.13.18+JOS.13.19+JOS.13.20+JOS.13.21	Moses defeated Sihon and killed him and the Midianite chiefs who ruled parts of his kingdom for him. Their names were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. 
JOS.13.22	The Israelites also killed Balaam the son of Beor, who had been a fortuneteller.
JOS.13.23	This region with its towns and villages was the land for the Reuben tribe, and the Jordan River was its western border.
JOS.13.24	Moses also gave land to each of the clans in the Gad tribe. 
JOS.13.25	It included the town of Jazer, and in the Gilead region their territory took in the land and towns as far east as the town of Aroer
JOS.13.26	The land given to Gad stretched from Heshbon in the south to Ramath-Mizpeh and Betonim in the north, and even further north to Mahanaim and Lidebor.
JOS.13.27	Gad also received the eastern half of the Jordan River valley, which had been ruled by King Sihon of Heshbon. This territory stretched as far north as Lake Galilee,
JOS.13.28	These regions with their towns and villages were given to the Gad tribe.
JOS.13.29	Moses gave land east of the Jordan River to half of the clans from the Manasseh tribe. 
JOS.13.30+JOS.13.31	Their land started at Mahanaim and took in the region that King Og of Bashan had ruled, including Ashtaroth and Edrei, the two towns where he had lived. The villages where the Jair clan settled were part of Manasseh's land, and so was the northern half of the region of Gilead. The clans of this half of Manasseh had 60 towns in all.
JOS.13.30+JOS.13.31	The Manasseh tribe is sometimes called the Machir tribe, after Manasseh's son Machir.
JOS.13.32	That was how Moses divided up the Moab Plains to the east of Jericho on the other side of the Jordan River, so these two and a half tribes would have land of their own. 
JOS.13.33	 But Moses did not give any land to the Levi tribe, because the 
JOS.14.1+JOS.14.2+JOS.14.3+JOS.14.4+JOS.14.5	When the priest Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of the families and tribes of Israel met to divide up the land of Canaan, the 
JOS.14.6	You know that back in Kadesh-Barnea the 
JOS.14.7	 I was 40 years old at the time Moses sent me from Kadesh-Barnea into Canaan as a spy. When I came back and told him about the land, everything I said was true. 
JOS.14.8	The other spies said things that made our people afraid, but I completely trusted the 
JOS.14.9	 The same day I came back, Moses told me, “Since you were faithful to the 
JOS.14.10	Joshua, it was 45 years ago that the 
JOS.14.11	I'm just as strong today as I was then, and I can still fight as well in battle.
JOS.14.12	So I'm asking you for the hill country that the 
JOS.14.13	Joshua prayed that God would help Caleb, then he gave Hebron to Caleb and his descendants. 
JOS.14.14	And Hebron still belongs to Caleb's descendants, because he was faithful to the 
JOS.14.15	Hebron used to be called Arba's Town,
JOS.14.15	There was peace in the land.
JOS.15.1	The clans of the Judah tribe were given land that went south along the border of Edom, and at its farthest point south it even reached the Zin Desert. 
JOS.15.2	Judah's southern border started at the south end of the Dead Sea. 
JOS.15.3	As it went west from there, it ran south of Scorpion Pass
JOS.15.4	and ran along to Azmon. After that, it followed the Egyptian Gorge and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was also Israel's southern border.
JOS.15.5	Judah's eastern border ran the full length of the Dead Sea.
JOS.15.5	The northern border started at the northern end of the Dead Sea.
JOS.15.6	From there it went west up to Beth-Hoglah, continued north of Beth-Arabah, and went up to the Monument of Bohan,
JOS.15.7	From there, it went to Trouble Valley
JOS.15.8	and up through Hinnom Valley on the land sloping south from Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem itself belonged to the Jebusites.
JOS.15.8	Next, the border went up to the top of the mountain on the west side of Hinnom Valley and at the north end of Rephaim Valley. 
JOS.15.9	At the top of the mountain it turned and went to Nephtoah Spring and then to the ruins
JOS.15.10	From Baalah the northern border curved west to Mount Seir and then ran along the northern ridge of Mount Jearim, where Chesalon is located. Then it went down to Beth-Shemesh
JOS.15.11	It continued along to the hillside north of Ekron, curved around to Shikkeron, and then went to Mount Baalah. After going to Jabneel, the border finally ended at the Mediterranean Sea, 
JOS.15.12	which was Judah's western border.
JOS.15.12	The clans of Judah lived within these borders.
JOS.15.14	Caleb attacked Hebron and forced the three Anakim clans of
JOS.15.15	Next, Caleb started a war with the town of Debir, which at that time was called Kiriath-Sepher. 
JOS.15.16	He told his men, “The man who captures Kiriath-Sepher can marry my daughter Achsah.”
JOS.15.17	Caleb's nephew Othniel
JOS.15.18	Right after the wedding, Achsah started telling Othniel that he
JOS.15.19	She answered, “I need your help. The land you gave me is in the Southern Desert, so I really need some spring-fed ponds
JOS.15.19	Caleb gave her a couple of small ponds, named Higher Pond and Lower Pond.
JOS.15.20	The following is a list of the towns in each region given to the Judah clans:

JOS.16.1+JOS.16.2+JOS.16.3+JOS.16.4	Ephraim and Manasseh are the two tribes descended from Joseph, and the following is a description of the land they received. The southern border of their land started at the Jordan River east of the spring at Jericho. From there it went west through the desert up to the hill country around Bethel. From Bethel it went to Luz and then
JOS.16.5	The following is a description of the land that was divided among the clans of the Ephraim tribe. Their southern border started at Ataroth-Addar and went west to Upper Beth-Horon 
JOS.16.6+JOS.16.7+JOS.16.8	and the Mediterranean Sea. Their northern border started on the east at Janoah, curved a little to the north, then came back south to Michmethath and Tappuah, where it followed the Kanah Gorge west to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.16.6+JOS.16.7+JOS.16.8	The eastern border started on the north near Janoah and went between Janoah on the southwest and Taanath-Shiloh on the northeast. Then it went south to Ataroth, Naarah, and on as far as the edge of the land that belonged to Jericho. At that point it turned east and went to the Jordan River. The clans of Ephraim received this region as their tribal land. 
JOS.16.9	Ephraim also had some towns and villages that were inside Manasseh's tribal land.
JOS.17.1+JOS.17.2+JOS.17.3+JOS.17.4+JOS.17.5+JOS.17.6	Hepher's son Zelophehad did not have any sons, but he did have five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. One day the clans that were descendants of Zelophehad's five daughters went to the priest Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel. The people of these clans said, “The 
JOS.17.1+JOS.17.2+JOS.17.3+JOS.17.4+JOS.17.5+JOS.17.6	Joshua followed the 
JOS.17.7	The land of the Manasseh tribe went from its northern border with the Asher tribe south to Michmethath, which is to the east of Shechem. The southern border started there, but curved even farther south to include the people who lived around Tappuah Spring.
JOS.17.8	The town of Tappuah was on Manasseh's border with Ephraim. Although the land around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, the town itself belonged to Ephraim.
JOS.17.9+JOS.17.10	Then the border went west to the Kanah Gorge and ran along the northern edge of the gorge to the Mediterranean Sea. The land south of the gorge belonged to Ephraim. And even though there were a few towns that belonged to Ephraim north of the gorge, the land north of the gorge belonged to Manasseh.
JOS.17.9+JOS.17.10	The western border of Manasseh was the Mediterranean Sea, and the tribe shared a border with the Asher tribe on the northwest and with the Issachar tribe on the northeast.
JOS.17.11	Manasseh was supposed to have the following towns with their surrounding villages inside the borders of Issachar's and Asher's tribal lands:
JOS.17.11	Beth-Shan, Ibleam, Endor, Taanach, Megiddo, and Dor, which is also called Naphath.
JOS.17.13	When the Israelites grew stronger, they made the Canaanites in these towns work as their slaves, though they never did force them to leave.
JOS.17.14	One day the Joseph tribes
JOS.17.15	Joshua replied, “If there's not enough room for you in the hill country of Ephraim, then go into the forest that belonged to the Perizzites and the Rephaim.
JOS.17.16	“Even if we do that,” they answered, “there still won't be enough land for us in the hill country. And we can't move down into Jezreel Valley, because the Canaanites who live in Beth-Shan and in other parts of the valley have iron chariots.”
JOS.17.17	“Your tribes do have a lot of people,” Joshua admitted. “I'll give you more land. Your tribes are powerful, 
JOS.17.18	so you can have the rest of the hill country, but it's a forest, and you'll have to cut down the trees and clear the land. You can also have Jezreel Valley. Even though the Canaanites there are strong and have iron chariots, you can force them to leave the valley.”
JOS.18.1	After Israel had captured the land, they met at Shiloh and set up the sacred tent.
JOS.18.2	There were still seven tribes without any land, 
JOS.18.3+JOS.18.4+JOS.18.5+JOS.18.6+JOS.18.7	so Joshua told the people:
JOS.18.3+JOS.18.4+JOS.18.5+JOS.18.6+JOS.18.7	The Judah tribe has already settled in its land in the south, and the Joseph tribes
JOS.18.3+JOS.18.4+JOS.18.5+JOS.18.6+JOS.18.7	But the rest of you haven't done a thing to take over any land. The 
JOS.18.3+JOS.18.4+JOS.18.5+JOS.18.6+JOS.18.7	Seven tribes still don't have any land. Each of these tribes should choose three men, and I'll send them to explore the remaining land. They will divide it into seven regions, write a description of each region, and bring these descriptions back to me. I will find out
JOS.18.8	Just before the men left camp, Joshua repeated their orders: “Explore the land and write a description of it. Then come back to Shiloh, and I will find out from the 
JOS.18.9	The men left and went across the land, dividing it into seven regions. They wrote down a description of each region, town by town, and returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua found out from the 
JOS.18.11	Benjamin was the first tribe chosen to receive land. The region for its clans lay between the Judah tribe on the south and the Joseph tribes
JOS.18.12	Benjamin's northern border started at the Jordan River and went up the ridge north of Jericho, then on west into the hill country as far as the Beth-Aven Desert. 
JOS.18.13+JOS.18.14	From there it went to Luz, which is now called Bethel. The border ran along the ridge south of Luz, then went to Ataroth-Orech
JOS.18.15	Benjamin's southern border started at the edge of Kiriath-Jearim and went east to the ruins
JOS.18.16	From there it went to the bottom of the hill at the northern end of Rephaim Valley. The other side of this hill faces Hinnom Valley, which is on the land that slopes south from Jerusalem.
JOS.18.17	At Enrogel the border curved north and went to Enshemesh and on east to Geliloth,
JOS.18.18	The border ran along the hillside north of Beth-Arabah,
JOS.18.19	Inside the valley it went south as far as the northern hillside of Beth-Hoglah. The last section of the border went from there to the northern end of the Dead Sea,
JOS.18.20	The Jordan River itself was Benjamin's eastern border.
JOS.18.20	These were the borders of Benjamin's tribal land, where the clans of Benjamin lived.
JOS.18.21+JOS.18.22+JOS.18.23+JOS.18.24	One region of Benjamin's tribal land had twelve towns with their surrounding villages. Those towns were Jericho, Beth-Hoglah, Emek-Keziz, Beth-Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, Chephar-Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba.

JOS.19.7	Enrimmon,
JOS.19.8	Simeon's land also included all the other towns and villages as far south as Baalath-Beer, which is also called Ramah of the South.
JOS.19.9	Simeon's tribal land was actually inside Judah's territory. Judah had received too much land for the number of people in its tribe, so part of Judah's land was given to Simeon.
JOS.19.10+JOS.19.11+JOS.19.12	Zebulun was the third tribe chosen to receive land. The southern border for its clans started in the west at the edge of the gorge near Jokneam. It went east to the edge of the land that belongs to the town of Dabbesheth, and continued on to Maralah and Sarid. It took in the land that belongs to Chislothtabor, then ended at Daberath.
JOS.19.10+JOS.19.11+JOS.19.12	The eastern border went up to Japhia 
JOS.19.13	and continued north to Gath-Hepher, Ethkazin, and Rimmonah,
JOS.19.14	and became the northern border. Then it curved south around Hannathon and went as far west as Iphtahel Valley.
JOS.19.15	Zebulun had twelve towns with their surrounding villages. Some of these were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Jiralah,
JOS.19.16	This is the tribal land, and these are the towns and villages of the Zebulun clans.

JOS.19.24+JOS.19.25+JOS.19.26	Asher's southern border ran from the Mediterranean Sea southeast along the Shihor-Libnath River at the foot of Mount Carmel, 
JOS.19.27	then east to Beth-Dagon. On the southeast, Asher shared a border with Zebulun along the Iphtahel Valley. On the eastern side their border ran north to Beth-Emek, went east of Cabul, and then on to Neiel, 
JOS.19.28	Abdon,
JOS.19.29+JOS.19.30+JOS.19.31	Then it turned west to become the northern border and went to Ramah
JOS.19.29+JOS.19.30+JOS.19.31	Asher had a total of 22 towns with their surrounding villages, including Mahalab,
JOS.19.32+JOS.19.33+JOS.19.34	Naphtali was the sixth tribe chosen to receive land. The southern border for its clans started in the west, where the tribal lands of Asher and Zebulun meet near Hukkok. From that point it ran east and southeast along the border with Zebulun as far as Aznoth-Tabor. From there the border went east to Heleph, Adami-Nekeb, Jabneel,
JOS.19.35+JOS.19.36+JOS.19.37+JOS.19.38+JOS.19.39	The Naphtali clans received this region as their tribal land, and it included 19 towns with their surrounding villages. The following towns had walls around them:

JOS.20.3+JOS.20.4	If a person accidentally kills someone and the victim's relatives say it was murder, they might try to take revenge.
JOS.20.5	One of the victim's relatives might come to the town, looking for revenge. But the town leaders must not simply hand over the person accused of murder. After all, the accused and the victim had been neighbors, not enemies. 
JOS.20.6	The citizens of that Safe Town must come together and hold a trial. They may decide that the victim was killed accidentally and that the accused is not guilty of murder.
JOS.20.6	Everyone found not guilty
JOS.20.7	The Israelites decided that the following three towns west of the Jordan River would be Safe Towns:
JOS.20.7	Kedesh in Galilee in Naphtali's hill country, Shechem in Ephraim's hill country, and Kiriath-Arba in Judah's hill country. Kiriath-Arba is now called Hebron.
JOS.20.8	The Israelites had already decided on the following three towns east of the Jordan River:
JOS.20.8	Bezer in the desert flatlands of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, which was a town that belonged to Gad, and Golan in Bashan, which belonged to Manasseh.
JOS.20.9	These Safe Towns were set up, so that if Israelites or even foreigners who lived in Israel accidentally killed someone, they could run to one of these towns. There they would be safe until a trial could be held, even if one of the victim's relatives came looking for revenge.

JOS.22.1	Joshua held a meeting with the men of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, and he told them:
JOS.22.4	The 
JOS.22.5	Moses taught you to love the 
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8+JOS.22.9	You've become rich from what you've taken from your enemies. You have big herds of cattle, lots of silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and plenty of clothes. Take everything home with you and share with the people of your tribe.
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8+JOS.22.9	I pray that God will be kind to you. You are now free to go home.
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8+JOS.22.9	The tribes of Reuben and Gad started back to Gilead, their own land. Moses had given the land of Bashan to the East Manasseh tribe, so they started back along with Reuben and Gad. God had told Moses that these two and a half tribes should conquer Gilead and Bashan, and they had done so.
JOS.22.6+JOS.22.7+JOS.22.8+JOS.22.9	Joshua had given land west of the Jordan River to the other half of the Manasseh tribe, so they stayed at Shiloh in the land of Canaan with the rest of the Israelites.
JOS.22.10+JOS.22.11	The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh reached the western side of the Jordan River valley
JOS.22.10+JOS.22.11	When the rest of the Israelites heard what these tribes had done,
JOS.22.12	the Israelite men met at Shiloh to get ready to attack the two and a half tribes. 
JOS.22.13	But first they sent a priest, Phinehas the son of Eleazar, to talk with the two and a half tribes. 
JOS.22.14	Each of the ten tribes at Shiloh sent the leader of one of its families along with Phinehas.
JOS.22.15	Phinehas and these leaders went to Gilead and met with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. They said:
JOS.22.17	 Wasn't our people's sin at Peor
JOS.22.18	Now you are turning your backs on the 
JOS.22.18	If you don't stop rebelling against the 
JOS.22.19	If you don't think your land is a fit place to serve God, then move across the Jordan and live with us in the 
JOS.22.20	 Don't you remember what happened when Achan was unfaithful
JOS.22.21	The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered:
JOS.22.22	The 
JOS.22.23	and we ask the 
JOS.22.24+JOS.22.25	We built that altar because we were worried. Someday your descendants might tell our descendants, “The 
JOS.22.24+JOS.22.25	Your descendants might say that and try to make our descendants stop worshiping and obeying the 
JOS.22.26	That's why we decided to build the altar. It isn't for offering sacrifices, not even sacrifices to please the 
JOS.22.27+JOS.22.28+JOS.22.29	To build another altar for offering sacrifices would be the same as turning our backs on the 
JOS.22.27+JOS.22.28+JOS.22.29	But if they do say this, our descendants can answer back, “Look at this altar our ancestors built! It's like the 
JOS.22.30+JOS.22.31	Phinehas and the clan leaders were pleased when they heard the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh explain why they had built the altar. Then Phinehas told them, “Today we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Phinehas and the clan leaders left Gilead and went back to Canaan to tell the Israelites about their meeting with the Reuben and Gad tribes. 
JOS.22.33	The Israelites were happy and praised God. There was no more talk about going to war and wiping out the tribes of Reuben and Gad.
JOS.22.34	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “A Reminder to Us All That the

JOS.23.2	One day he called a meeting of the leaders of the tribes of Israel, including the old men, the judges, and the officials. Then he told them:
JOS.23.2	I am now very old. 
JOS.23.3	You have seen how the 
JOS.23.4+JOS.23.5	There are still some nations left, but the 
JOS.23.6	Be sure that you carefully obey everything written in 
JOS.23.7	Don't have anything to do with the nations that live around you. Don't worship their gods or pray to their idols or make promises in the names of their gods. 
JOS.23.8	Be as faithful to the 
JOS.23.9	When you attacked powerful nations, the 
JOS.23.10	 Any one of you can defeat a thousand enemy soldiers, because the

JOS.23.12+JOS.23.13	Don't ever turn your backs on him by marrying people from the nations that are left in the land. Don't even make friends with them. I tell you that if you are friendly with those nations, the 
JOS.23.14	I will soon die, as everyone must. But deep in your hearts you know that the 
JOS.23.15+JOS.23.16	Yes, when the 
JOS.24.1	Joshua called the tribes of Israel together for a meeting at Shechem. He asked the leaders, including the old men, the judges, and the officials, to come up and stand near the sacred tent.
JOS.24.2	 Then Joshua told everyone to listen to this message from the 
JOS.24.2	Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River, and they worshiped other gods. This continued until the time of your ancestor Terah and his two sons, Abraham and Nahor. 
JOS.24.3	 But I brought Abraham across the Euphrates River and led him through the land of Canaan. I blessed him by giving him Isaac, the first in a line of many descendants. 
JOS.24.4	 Then I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Mount Seir, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt.
JOS.24.7	Your people cried to me for help, so I put a dark cloud between them and the Egyptians. Then I opened up the sea and let your people walk across on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, I commanded the sea to swallow them, and they drowned while you watched.
JOS.24.7	You lived in the desert for a long time, 
JOS.24.8	 then I brought you into the land east of the Jordan River. The Amorites were living there, and they fought you. But with my help, you defeated them, wiped them out, and took their land. 
JOS.24.9	 King Balak decided that his nation Moab would go to war against you, so he asked Balaam
JOS.24.10	But I wouldn't listen to Balaam, and I rescued you by making him bless you instead of curse you.
JOS.24.12	 Your enemies ran from you, but not because you had swords and bows and arrows. I made your enemies panic and run away, as I had done with the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River.
JOS.24.14	Then Joshua told the people:
JOS.24.14	Worship the 
JOS.24.15	But if you don't want to worship the 
JOS.24.16	The people answered:
JOS.24.16	We could never worship other gods or stop worshiping the 
JOS.24.17	The 
JOS.24.18	And when we fought the Amorites and the other nations that lived in this land, the 
JOS.24.19	Joshua said:
JOS.24.19	The 
JOS.24.20	If you turn your backs on the 
JOS.24.21	But the people shouted, “We won't worship any other gods. We will worship and obey only the 
JOS.24.22	Joshua said, “You have heard yourselves say that you will worship and obey the 
JOS.24.22	“Yes, it's true,” they answered.
JOS.24.23	Joshua said, “But you still have some idols, like those the other nations worship. Get rid of your idols! You must decide once and for all that you really want to obey the 
JOS.24.24	The people said, “The

JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the 
JDG.1.2	“Judah!” the 
JDG.1.3	The people of Judah went to their relatives, the Simeon tribe, and said, “Canaanites live in the land God gave us. Help us fight them, and we will help you.”
JDG.1.3	Troops from Simeon came to help Judah. 
JDG.1.4+JDG.1.5	Together they attacked an army of 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites at Bezek, and the 
JDG.1.6	The king tried to escape, but soldiers from Judah caught him. They cut off his thumbs and big toes, 
JDG.1.7	and he said, “I've cut off the thumbs and big toes of 70 kings and made those kings crawl around under my table for scraps of food. Now God is paying me back.”
JDG.1.7	The army of Judah took the king of Bezek along with them to Jerusalem, where he died. 
JDG.1.8	They attacked Jerusalem,
JDG.1.9	Judah's army fought the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, the Southern Desert, and the foothills to the west. 
JDG.1.10	After that, they attacked the Canaanites who lived at Hebron, defeating the three clans called

JDG.1.13	Caleb's nephew Othniel captured Kiriath-Sepher, so Caleb let him marry Achsah. Othniel was the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz.
JDG.1.14	Right after the wedding, Achsah started telling Othniel that he
JDG.1.15	She answered, “I need your help. The land you gave me is in the Southern Desert, so please give me some spring-fed ponds for a water supply.”
JDG.1.15	Caleb gave her a couple of small ponds named Higher Pond and Lower Pond.
JDG.1.16	The people who belonged to the Kenite clan were the descendants of the father-in-law of Moses. They left Jericho
JDG.1.17	Judah's army helped Simeon's army attack the Canaanites who lived at Zephath. They completely destroyed

JDG.1.22+JDG.1.23	The Ephraim and Manasseh tribes
JDG.1.24	While the spies were watching the town, a man came out, and they told him, “If you show us how our army can get into the town,
JDG.1.25	The man showed them, and the two Israelite tribes attacked Bethel, killing everyone except the man and his family. The two tribes made the man and his family leave, 
JDG.1.26	so they went to the land of the Hittites,
JDG.1.30	The Zebulun tribe did not get rid of the Canaanites who lived in Kitron and Nahalol, and the Canaanites stayed there with Israelites around them. But the people of Zebulun did force the Canaanites into slave labor.
JDG.1.31+JDG.1.32	The Asher tribe did not get rid of the Canaanites who lived in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob, and the Asher tribe lived with Canaanites all around them.
JDG.1.33	The Naphtali tribe did not get rid of the Canaanites who lived in Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath, but they did force the Canaanites into slave labor. The Naphtali tribe lived with Canaanites around them.
JDG.1.34	The Amorites
JDG.1.35	The Amorites on Mount Heres and in Aijalon and Shaalbim were also determined to stay. Later on, as Ephraim and Manasseh grew more powerful, they forced those Amorites into slave labor.

JDG.2.1	The 
JDG.2.1	I promised your ancestors that I would give this land to their families, and I brought your people here from Egypt. We made an agreement that I promised never to break, 
JDG.2.2	 and you promised not to make any peace treaties with the other nations that live in the land. Besides that, you agreed to tear down the altars where they sacrifice to their idols. Why haven't you kept your promise?
JDG.2.3	And so, I'll stop helping you defeat your enemies. Instead, they will be there to trap
JDG.2.4	The Israelites started crying loudly, 
JDG.2.5	and they offered sacrifices to the 
JDG.2.10	After a while the people of Joshua's generation died, and the next generation did not know the

JDG.2.17	In years gone by, the Israelites had been faithful to the 
JDG.2.18	When enemies made life miserable for the Israelites, the 
JDG.2.19	But afterwards, the Israelites would become even more sinful than their ancestors had been. The Israelites were stubborn—they simply would not stop worshiping other gods or following their teachings.
JDG.2.20	The 
JDG.2.20	The Israelites have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors. They won't obey me, 
JDG.2.21	so I'll stop helping them defeat their enemies. Israel still had a lot of enemies when Joshua died, 
JDG.2.22	and I'm going to let those enemies stay. I'll use them to test Israel, because then I can find out if Israel will worship and obey me as their ancestors did.
JDG.2.23	That's why the 
JDG.3.1+JDG.3.2	And the 
JDG.3.3	the Philistines and their five rulers, as well as the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites that lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal-Hermon to Hamath Pass.
JDG.3.4	Moses had told the Israelites what the 
JDG.3.5+JDG.3.6	But they refused. And some of them even married Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites who lived all around them. That's how they started worshiping foreign gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites sinned against the 
JDG.3.8	This made the 
JDG.3.9	The Israelites begged the 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the

JDG.3.12	Once more the Israelites started disobeying the 
JDG.3.13	who had joined forces with the Ammonites and the Amalekites to attack Israel. Eglon and his army captured Jericho.
JDG.3.14	Then he ruled Israel for 18 years and forced the Israelites to pay heavy taxes.
JDG.3.15+JDG.3.16	The Israelites begged the 
JDG.3.17+JDG.3.18	Ehud and some other Israelites took the taxes to Eglon, who was a very fat man. As soon as they gave the taxes to Eglon, Ehud said it was time to go home.
JDG.3.19+JDG.3.20	Ehud went with the other Israelites as far as the statues
JDG.3.19+JDG.3.20	Eglon replied, “Don't say anything yet!” His officials left the room, and Eglon stood up as Ehud came closer.
JDG.3.19+JDG.3.20	“Yes,” Ehud said, “I have a message for you from God!” 
JDG.3.21	Ehud pulled out the dagger with his left hand and shoved it so far into Eglon's stomach 
JDG.3.22+JDG.3.23	that even the handle was buried in his fat. Ehud left the dagger there. Then after closing and locking the doors to the room, he climbed through a window onto the porch
JDG.3.24	and left.
JDG.3.24	When the king's officials came back and saw that the doors were locked, they said, “The king is probably inside relieving himself.” 
JDG.3.25	They stood there waiting until they felt foolish, but Eglon still didn't open the doors. Finally, they unlocked the doors and found King Eglon lying dead on the floor. 
JDG.3.26	But by that time, Ehud had already escaped past the statues.
JDG.3.26	Ehud went to the town of Seirah 
JDG.3.27+JDG.3.28	in the hill country of Ephraim and started blowing a trumpet as a signal to call the Israelites together. When they came, he shouted, “Follow me! The 
JDG.3.27+JDG.3.28	The Israelites followed Ehud down to the Jordan valley, and they captured the places where people cross the river on the way to Moab. They would not let anyone go across, 
JDG.3.29	and before the fighting was over, they killed about 10,000 Moabite warriors—not one escaped alive.
JDG.3.30	Moab was so badly defeated that it was a long time before they were strong enough to attack Israel again. And Israel was at peace for 80 years.
JDG.3.31	Shamgar the son of Anath was the next to rescue Israel. In one battle, he used a sharp wooden pole
JDG.4.1	After the death of Ehud, the Israelites again started disobeying the 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	Jabin's army had 900 iron chariots, and for 20 years he made life miserable for the Israelites, until finally they begged the 
JDG.4.4	Deborah the wife of Lappidoth was a prophet and a leader
JDG.4.5	She would sit under Deborah's Palm Tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where Israelites would come and ask her to settle their legal cases.
JDG.4.6	One day, Barak the son of Abinoam was in Kedesh in Naphtali, and Deborah sent word for him to come and talk with her. When he arrived, she said:
JDG.4.6	I have a message for you from the 
JDG.4.7	The 
JDG.4.8	“I'm not going unless you go!” Barak told her.
JDG.4.9	“All right, I'll go!” she replied. “But I'm warning you that the 
JDG.4.9	Deborah and Barak left for Kedesh, 
JDG.4.10	where Barak called together the troops from Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand soldiers gathered there, and Barak led them out from Kedesh. Deborah went too.
JDG.4.11	At this time, Heber of the Kenite clan was living near the village of Oak in Zaanannim,
JDG.4.12	When Sisera learned that Barak had led an army to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	he called his troops together and got all 900 iron chariots ready. Then he led his army away from Harosheth-Ha-Goiim to the Kishon River.
JDG.4.14	Deborah shouted, “Barak, it's time to attack Sisera! Because today the 
JDG.4.14	Barak led his 10,000 troops down from Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.15	And during the battle, the 
JDG.4.16	Barak's forces went after Sisera's chariots and army as far as Harosheth-Ha-Goiim.
JDG.4.16	Sisera's entire army was wiped out. 
JDG.4.17	Only Sisera escaped. He ran to Heber's camp, because Heber and his family had a peace treaty with the king of Hazor. Sisera went to the tent that belonged to Jael, Heber's wife. 
JDG.4.18	She came out to greet him and said, “Come in, sir! Please come on in. Don't be afraid.”
JDG.4.18	After they had gone inside, Sisera lay down, and Jael covered him with a blanket. 
JDG.4.19	“Could I have a little water?” he asked. “I'm thirsty.”
JDG.4.19	Jael opened a leather bottle and poured him some milk, then she covered him back up.
JDG.4.20	“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” Sisera told her. “If someone comes by and asks if anyone is inside, tell them ‘No.’ ”
JDG.4.21	Sisera was exhausted and soon fell fast asleep. Jael took a hammer and drove a tent-peg through his head into the ground, and he died.
JDG.4.22	Meanwhile, Barak had been following Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “The man you're looking for is inside,” she said. “Come in and I'll show him to you.”
JDG.4.22	They went inside, and there was Sisera—dead and stretched out with a tent-peg through his skull.
JDG.4.23	That same day God defeated the Canaanite King Jabin while the Israelites looked on, and his army was no longer powerful enough to attack the Israelites. 
JDG.4.24	Jabin grew weaker while the Israelites kept growing stronger, until at last the Israelites destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	After the battle was over that day, Deborah and Barak sang this song:
JDG.5.2	We praise you, 
JDG.5.2	Our soldiers volunteered,
JDG.5.2	ready to follow you.
JDG.5.3	Listen, kings and rulers,
JDG.5.3	while I sing for the 
JDG.5.3	the God of Israel.
JDG.5.4	Our 
JDG.5.4	when you came from Seir,
JDG.5.4	where the Edomites live,
JDG.5.5	the earth trembled,
JDG.5.5	and mountains shook.
JDG.5.6	In the time of Shamgar
JDG.5.6	son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	and now again in Jael's time,
JDG.5.6	roads were too dangerous
JDG.5.6	for caravans.
JDG.5.6	Travelers had to take
JDG.5.6	the back roads,
JDG.5.7	and villagers couldn't work
JDG.5.7	in their fields.
JDG.5.7	Then Deborah
JDG.5.7	protecting Israel as a mother
JDG.5.7	protects her children.
JDG.5.8	The Israelites worshiped
JDG.5.8	other gods,
JDG.5.8	and the gates of their towns
JDG.5.8	were then attacked.
JDG.5.8	But they had no shields
JDG.5.8	or spears to fight with.
JDG.5.9	I praise you, 
JDG.5.9	and I am grateful
JDG.5.9	for those leaders and soldiers
JDG.5.9	who volunteered.
JDG.5.10	Listen, everyone!
JDG.5.10	Whether you ride a donkey
JDG.5.10	with a padded saddle
JDG.5.10	or have to walk.
JDG.5.11	Even those who carry water
JDG.5.11	to the animals will tell you,
JDG.5.11	“The 
JDG.5.11	and so has Israel.”
JDG.5.11	Then the 
JDG.5.11	down to the town gates
JDG.5.12	and said, “Deborah, let's go!
JDG.5.12	Let's sing as we march.
JDG.5.12	Barak, capture our enemies.”
JDG.5.13	The 
JDG.5.13	joined with their leaders
JDG.5.13	and fought at my side.
JDG.5.14	Troops came from Ephraim,
JDG.5.14	where Amalekites once lived.
JDG.5.14	Others came from Benjamin;
JDG.5.14	officers and leaders came
JDG.5.14	from Machir and Zebulun.
JDG.5.15	The rulers of Issachar
JDG.5.15	came along with Deborah,
JDG.5.15	and Issachar followed Barak
JDG.5.15	into the valley.
JDG.5.15	But the tribe of Reuben
JDG.5.15	was no help at all!
JDG.5.16	Reuben, why did you stay
JDG.5.16	among your sheep pens?
JDG.5.16	Was it to listen to shepherds
JDG.5.16	whistling for their sheep?
JDG.5.16	No one could figure out
JDG.5.16	why Reuben wouldn't come.
JDG.5.17	The people of Gilead stayed
JDG.5.17	across the Jordan.
JDG.5.17	Why did the tribe of Dan
JDG.5.17	remain on their ships
JDG.5.17	and the tribe of Asher
JDG.5.17	stay along the coast
JDG.5.17	near the harbors?
JDG.5.18	But soldiers of Zebulun
JDG.5.18	and Naphtali
JDG.5.18	risked their lives
JDG.5.18	to attack the enemy.
JDG.5.19	Canaanite kings fought us
JDG.5.19	at Taanach by the stream
JDG.5.19	near Megiddo
JDG.5.19	but they couldn't rob us
JDG.5.19	of our silver.
JDG.5.20	From their pathways in the sky
JDG.5.20	the stars
JDG.5.21	and his soldiers were swept away
JDG.5.21	by the ancient Kishon River.
JDG.5.21	I will march on and be brave.
JDG.5.22	Sisera's horses galloped off,
JDG.5.22	their hoofs thundering
JDG.5.22	in retreat.
JDG.5.23	The 
JDG.5.23	“Put a curse on Meroz Town!
JDG.5.23	Its people refused
JDG.5.23	to help the 
JDG.5.23	his powerful enemies.”
JDG.5.24	But honor Jael,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber
JDG.5.24	from the Kenite clan.
JDG.5.24	Give more honor to her
JDG.5.24	than to any other woman
JDG.5.24	who lives in tents.
JDG.5.24	Yes, give more honor to her
JDG.5.24	than to any other woman.
JDG.5.25	Sisera asked for water,
JDG.5.25	but Jael gave him milk—
JDG.5.25	cream in a fancy cup.
JDG.5.26	She reached for a tent-peg
JDG.5.26	and held a hammer
JDG.5.26	in her right hand.
JDG.5.26	And with a blow to the head,
JDG.5.26	she crushed his skull.
JDG.5.27	Sisera sank to his knees
JDG.5.27	and fell dead at her feet.
JDG.5.28	Sisera's mother looked out
JDG.5.28	through her window.
JDG.5.28	“Why is he taking so long?”
JDG.5.28	she asked.
JDG.5.28	“Why haven't we heard
JDG.5.28	his chariots coming?”
JDG.5.29	She and her wisest women
JDG.5.29	gave the same answer:
JDG.5.30	“Sisera and his troops
JDG.5.30	are finding treasures
JDG.5.30	to bring back—
JDG.5.30	a woman, or maybe two,
JDG.5.30	for each man,
JDG.5.30	and beautiful dresses
JDG.5.30	for those women to wear.”
JDG.5.31	Our 
JDG.5.31	that all your enemies
JDG.5.31	will die like Sisera.
JDG.5.31	But let everyone who loves you
JDG.5.31	shine brightly like the sun
JDG.5.31	at dawn.
JDG.5.31	There was peace in Israel for about 40 years.
JDG.6.1	Then once again the Israelites started disobeying the 
JDG.6.2	The Midianites were so cruel that many Israelites ran to the mountains and hid in caves.
JDG.6.3	Every time the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites invaded Israel together with the Amalekites and other eastern nations. 
JDG.6.4+JDG.6.5	They rode in on their camels, set up their tents, and then let their livestock eat the crops as far as the town of Gaza. The Midianites stole food, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. Like a swarm of locusts,
JDG.6.6+JDG.6.7	The Midianites took almost everything that belonged to the Israelites, and the Israelites begged the 
JDG.6.8+JDG.6.9	Then the 
JDG.6.8+JDG.6.9	I am the 
JDG.6.10	I am your God, and I told you not to worship Amorite gods, even though you are living in the land of the Amorites. But you refused to listen.
JDG.6.11	One day an angel from the 
JDG.6.12	The angel appeared and spoke to Gideon, “The 
JDG.6.13	Gideon answered, “Please don't take this wrong, but if the 
JDG.6.14	Then the 
JDG.6.15	Gideon replied, “But how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest one in Manasseh, and everyone else in my family is more important than I am.”
JDG.6.16	“Gideon,” the 
JDG.6.17	Gideon said, “It's hard to believe that I'm actually talking to the 
JDG.6.18	And wait here until I bring you an offering.”
JDG.6.18	“All right, I'll wait,” the 
JDG.6.19	Gideon went home and killed a young goat, then started boiling the meat. Next, he opened a big sack of flour and made it into thin bread.
JDG.6.20	God's angel said, “Gideon, put the meat and the bread on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” Gideon did as he was told. 
JDG.6.21	The angel was holding a walking stick, and he touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick. Flames jumped from the rock and burned up the meat and the bread.
JDG.6.21	When Gideon looked, the angel was gone. 
JDG.6.22	Gideon realized that he had seen one of the 
JDG.6.23	“Calm down!” the 
JDG.6.24	Gideon built an altar for worshiping the 
JDG.6.25	That night the 
JDG.6.25	Get your father's second-best bull, the one that's seven years old. Use it to pull down the altar where your father worships Baal and cut down the sacred pole
JDG.6.26	Then build an altar for worshiping me on the highest part of the hill where your town is built. Use layers of stones for my altar, not just a pile of rocks. Cut up the wood from the pole, make a fire, kill the bull, and burn it as a sacrifice to me.
JDG.6.27	Gideon chose ten of his servants to help him, and they did everything God had said. But since Gideon was afraid of his family and the other people in Ophrah, he did it all at night.
JDG.6.28	When the people of the town got up the next morning, they saw that Baal's altar had been knocked over, and the sacred pole next to it had been cut down. Then they noticed the new altar covered with the remains of the sacrificed bull.
JDG.6.29	“Who could have done such a thing?” they asked. And they kept on asking, until finally someone told them, “Gideon the son of Joash did it.”
JDG.6.30	The men of the town went to Joash and said, “Your son Gideon knocked over Baal's altar and cut down the sacred pole next to it. Hand him over, so we can kill him!”
JDG.6.31	The crowd pushed closer and closer, but Joash replied, “Are you trying to take revenge for Baal? Are you trying to rescue Baal? If you are, you will be the ones who are put to death, and it will happen before another day dawns. If Baal really is a god, let him take his own revenge on someone who tears down his altar.”
JDG.6.32	That same day, Joash changed Gideon's name to Jerubbaal, explaining, “He tore down Baal's altar, so let Baal take revenge himself.”
JDG.6.33	All the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations got together and crossed the Jordan River. Then they invaded the land of Israel and set up camp in Jezreel Valley.
JDG.6.34	The 
JDG.6.35	He also sent messengers to the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, telling the men of these tribes to come and join his army. Then they set out toward the enemy camp.
JDG.6.36+JDG.6.37	Gideon prayed to God, “I know that you promised to help me rescue Israel, but I need proof. Tonight I'll spread a sheep skin on the stone floor of that threshing-place over there. If you really will help me rescue Israel, then tomorrow morning let there be dew on the skin, but let the stone floor be dry.”
JDG.6.38	And that's just what happened. Early the next morning, Gideon got up and checked the sheep skin. He squeezed out enough water to fill a bowl. 
JDG.6.39	But Gideon prayed to God again. “Don't be angry with me,” Gideon said. “Let me try this just one more time, so I'll really be sure you'll help me. Only this time, let the skin be dry and the stone floor be wet.”
JDG.6.40	That night, God made the stone floor wet with dew, but he kept the sheep skin dry.
JDG.7.1	Early the next morning, Gideon and his army got up and moved their camp to Fear Spring.
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	 So call your troops together and tell them that anyone who is really afraid can leave Mount Gilead
JDG.7.3	Twenty-two thousand men returned home, leaving Gideon with only 10,000 soldiers.
JDG.7.4	“Gideon,” the 
JDG.7.5	When Gideon led his army down to the spring, the 
JDG.7.6	Three hundred men scooped up water in their hands and lapped it, and the rest knelt to get a drink. 
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	Then Gideon gave these orders, “You 300 men stay here. The rest of you may go home, but leave your food and trumpets with us.”
JDG.7.8	Gideon's army camp was on top of a hill overlooking the Midianite camp in the valley.
JDG.7.9	That night, the 
JDG.7.10	but if you're still afraid, you and your servant Purah should sneak down to their camp. 
JDG.7.11	When you hear what the Midianites are saying, you'll be brave enough to attack.”
JDG.7.11	Gideon and Purah worked their way to the edge of the enemy camp, where soldiers were on guard duty. 
JDG.7.12	The camp was huge. The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations covered the valley like a swarm of locusts.
JDG.7.13	Gideon overheard one enemy guard telling another, “I had a dream about a flat
JDG.7.14	The other soldier answered, “Your dream must have been about Gideon, the Israelite commander. It means God will let him and his army defeat the Midianite army and everyone else in our camp.”
JDG.7.15	As soon as Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he bowed down to praise God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, “Let's go! The 
JDG.7.16	Gideon divided his little army into three groups of 100 men, and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside. 
JDG.7.17+JDG.7.18	Gideon said, “When we get to the enemy camp, spread out and surround it. Then wait for me to blow a signal on my trumpet. As soon as you hear it, blow your trumpets and shout, ‘Fight for the 
JDG.7.19	Gideon and his group reached the edge of the enemy camp a few hours after dark, just after the new guards had come on duty.
JDG.7.20	The rest of Gideon's soldiers blew the trumpets they were holding in their right hands. Then they smashed the jars and held the burning torches in their left hands. Everyone shouted, “Fight with your swords for the 
JDG.7.21	The enemy soldiers started yelling and tried to run away. Gideon's troops stayed in their positions surrounding the camp 
JDG.7.22	and blew their trumpets again. As they did, the 
JDG.7.22	The enemy army tried to escape from the camp. They ran to Acacia Tree Town, toward Zeredah,
JDG.7.23	Gideon sent word for more Israelite soldiers to come from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both halves of Manasseh
JDG.7.24	He also sent messengers to tell all the men who lived in the hill country of Ephraim, “Come and help us fight the Midianites! Put guards at every spring, stream, and well, as far as Beth-Barah before the Midianites can get to them. And guard the Jordan River.”
JDG.7.24	Troops from Ephraim did exactly what Gideon had asked, 
JDG.7.25	and they even helped chase the Midianites on the east side of the Jordan River. These troops captured Raven and Wolf,
JDG.7.25	The men of Ephraim brought the heads of the two Midianite leaders to Gideon.
JDG.8.1	But the men were really upset with Gideon and complained, “When you went to war with Midian, you didn't ask us to help! Why did you treat us like that?”
JDG.8.2	Gideon answered:
JDG.8.2	Don't be upset! Even though you came later, you were able to do much more than I did. It's just like the grape harvest: The grapes your tribe doesn't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow. 
JDG.8.3	 Besides, God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf. I didn't do a thing compared to you.
JDG.8.3	By the time Gideon had finished talking, the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him.
JDG.8.4	After Gideon and his 300 troops had chased the Midianites across the Jordan River, they were exhausted. 
JDG.8.5	The town of Succoth was nearby, so he went there and asked, “Please give my troops some food. They are worn out, but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings.”
JDG.8.6	The town leaders of Succoth answered, “Why should we feed your army? We don't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna.”
JDG.8.7	“Just wait!” Gideon said. “After the 
JDG.8.8	After leaving Succoth, Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food. But he got the same answer as he did at Succoth. 
JDG.8.9	“I'll come back safe and sound,” Gideon said, “but when I do, I'm going to tear down your tower!”
JDG.8.10	Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor
JDG.8.11	Gideon reached the enemy camp by going east along Nomad
JDG.8.12	and the enemy panicked. Zebah and Zalmunna tried to escape, but Gideon chased and captured them.
JDG.8.13	After the battle, Gideon set out for home. As he was going through Heres Pass, 
JDG.8.14	he caught a young man who lived in Succoth. Gideon asked him who the town officials of Succoth were, and the young man wrote down 77 names.
JDG.8.15	Gideon went to the town officials and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. Remember how you made fun of me? You said, ‘We don't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings. So why should we feed your worn-out army?’ ”
JDG.8.16	Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials. 
JDG.8.17	Afterwards he went to Penuel, where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials.
JDG.8.18	Then Gideon said, “Zebah and Zalmunna, tell me about the men you killed at Tabor.”
JDG.8.18	“They were a lot like you,” the two kings answered. “They were dignified, almost like royalty.”
JDG.8.19	“They were my very own brothers!” Gideon said. “I swear by the living 
JDG.8.20	Gideon turned to Jether, his oldest son. “Kill them!” Gideon said.
JDG.8.20	But Jether was young,
JDG.8.21	“What's the matter, Gideon?” Zebah and Zalmunna asked. “Do it yourself, if you're not too much of a coward!”
JDG.8.21	Gideon jumped up and killed them both. Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels.
JDG.8.22	After the battle with the Midianites, the Israelites said, “Gideon, you rescued us! Now we want you to be our king. Then after your death, your son and then your grandson will rule.”
JDG.8.23	“No,” Gideon replied, “I won't be your king, and my son won't be king either. Only the 
JDG.8.24	But I will ask you to do one thing: Give me all the earrings you took from the enemy.”
JDG.8.24	The enemy soldiers had been Ishmaelites,
JDG.8.25	The Israelite soldiers replied, “Of course we will give you the earrings.” Then they spread out a robe on the ground and tossed the earrings on it. 
JDG.8.26	The total weight of this gold was nearly 20 kilograms. In addition, there was the gold from the camels' ornaments and from the beautiful jewelry worn by the Midianite kings. Gideon also took their purple robes.
JDG.8.27+JDG.8.28+JDG.8.29	Gideon returned to his home in Ophrah and had the gold made into a statue, which the Israelites soon started worshiping. They were unfaithful to God, and even Gideon and his family were trapped into worshiping the statue.
JDG.8.27+JDG.8.28+JDG.8.29	The Midianites had been defeated so badly that they were no longer strong enough to attack Israel. And so Israel was at peace for the remaining 40 years of Gideon's life.
JDG.8.30	Gideon had many wives and 70 sons. 
JDG.8.31	He even had a wife
JDG.8.32	Gideon lived to be an old man. And when he died, he was buried in the family tomb in his hometown of Ophrah, which belonged to the Abiezer clan.
JDG.8.33	Soon after Gideon's death, the Israelites turned their backs on God again. They set up idols of Baal and worshiped Baal Berith
JDG.8.34	The Israelites forgot that the 
JDG.8.35	Besides all that, the Israelites were unkind to Gideon's family, even though Gideon had done so much for Israel.
JDG.9.1	Abimelech the son of Gideon
JDG.9.2	and told them to say to the leaders of Shechem, “Do you think it would be good to have all 70 of Gideon's sons ruling us? Wouldn't you rather have just one man be king? Abimelech would make a good king, and he's related to us.”
JDG.9.3	Abimelech's uncles talked it over with the leaders of Shechem who agreed, “Yes, it would be better for one of our relatives to be king.” 
JDG.9.4	Then they gave Abimelech 70 pieces
JDG.9.4	Abimelech used the silver to hire a gang of rough soldiers who would do anything for money. 
JDG.9.5	Abimelech and his soldiers went to his father's home in Ophrah and brought out Gideon's other sons to a large rock, where they murdered all 70 of them. Gideon's youngest son Jotham hid from the soldiers, but he was the only one who escaped.
JDG.9.6	The leaders of Shechem, including the priests and the military officers,
JDG.9.7	Jotham heard what they were doing. So he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted down to the people who were there at the meeting:
JDG.9.7	Leaders of Shechem,
JDG.9.7	listen to me,
JDG.9.7	and maybe God
JDG.9.7	will listen to you.
JDG.9.8	Once the trees searched
JDG.9.8	for someone to be king;
JDG.9.8	they asked the olive tree,
JDG.9.8	“Will you be our king?”
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree replied,
JDG.9.9	“My oil brings honor
JDG.9.9	to people and gods.
JDG.9.9	I won't stop making oil,
JDG.9.9	just so my branches can wave
JDG.9.9	above the other trees.”
JDG.9.10	Then they asked the fig tree,
JDG.9.10	“Will you be our king?”
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree replied,
JDG.9.11	“I won't stop growing
JDG.9.11	my delicious fruit,
JDG.9.11	just so my branches can wave
JDG.9.11	above the other trees.”
JDG.9.12	Next they asked the grape vine,
JDG.9.12	“Will you be our king?”
JDG.9.13	But the grape vine replied,
JDG.9.13	“My wine brings cheer
JDG.9.13	to people and gods.
JDG.9.13	I won't stop making wine,
JDG.9.13	just so my branches can wave
JDG.9.13	above the other trees.”
JDG.9.14	Finally, they went
JDG.9.14	to the thornbush and asked,
JDG.9.14	“Will you be our king?”
JDG.9.15	The thornbush replied,
JDG.9.15	“If you really want me
JDG.9.15	to be your king,
JDG.9.15	then come into my shade
JDG.9.15	and I will protect you.
JDG.9.15	But if you're deceiving me,
JDG.9.15	I'll start a fire
JDG.9.15	that will spread out and destroy
JDG.9.15	the cedars of Lebanon.”
JDG.9.15	After Jotham had finished telling this story, he said:
JDG.9.16+JDG.9.17+JDG.9.18	My father Gideon risked his life for you when he fought to rescue you from the Midianites. Did you reward Gideon by being kind to his family? No, you did not! You attacked his family and killed all 70 of his sons on that rock.
JDG.9.16+JDG.9.17+JDG.9.18	And was it right to make Abimelech your king? He's merely the son of my father's slave girl.
JDG.9.19	So, you leaders of Shechem, if you treated Gideon and his family the way you should have, then I hope you and Abimelech will make each other very happy. 
JDG.9.20	But if it was wrong to treat Gideon and his family the way you did, then I pray that Abimelech will destroy you with fire, and I pray that you will do the same to him.
JDG.9.21	Jotham ran off and went to live in the town of Beer, where he could be safe from his brother Abimelech.
JDG.9.22	Abimelech had been a military commander of Israel for three years, 
JDG.9.23+JDG.9.24	when God decided to punish him and the leaders of Shechem for killing Gideon's 70 sons.
JDG.9.23+JDG.9.24	So God turned the leaders of Shechem against Abimelech. 
JDG.9.25	Then they sent some men to hide on the hilltops and watch for Abimelech and his troops, while they sent others to rob everyone that went by on the road. But Abimelech found out what they were doing.
JDG.9.26	One day, Gaal son of Ebed went to live in Shechem. His brothers moved there too, and soon the leaders of Shechem started trusting him.
JDG.9.27	The time came for the grape harvest, and the people of Shechem went into their vineyards and picked the grapes. They gathered the grapes and made wine. Then they went into the temple of their god and threw a big party. There was a lot of eating and drinking, and before long they were cursing Abimelech.
JDG.9.28	Gaal said:
JDG.9.28	Hamor was the founder of Shechem, and one of his descendants should be our ruler. But Abimelech's father was Gideon, so Abimelech isn't really one of us. He shouldn't be our king, and we shouldn't have to obey him or Zebul, who rules Shechem for him. 
JDG.9.29	If I were the ruler of Shechem, I'd get rid of that Abimelech. I'd tell him, “Get yourself an even bigger army, and we will still defeat you.”
JDG.9.30	Zebul was angry when he found out what Gaal had said. 
JDG.9.31	And so he sent some messengers to Abimelech. But they had to pretend to be doing something else, or they would not have been allowed to leave Shechem.
JDG.9.31	Gaal the son of Ebed has come to Shechem along with his brothers, and they have persuaded the people to let Gaal rule Shechem instead of you. 
JDG.9.32	This is what I think you should do. Lead your army here during the night and hide in the fields. 
JDG.9.33	Get up the next morning at sunrise and rush out of your hiding places to attack the town. Gaal and his followers will come out to fight you, but you will easily defeat them.
JDG.9.34	So one night, Abimelech led his soldiers to Shechem. He divided them into four groups, and they all hid near the town.
JDG.9.35	The next morning, Gaal went out and stood in the opening of the town gate. Abimelech and his soldiers left their hiding places, 
JDG.9.36	and Gaal saw them. Zebul was standing there with Gaal, and Gaal remarked, “Zebul, that looks like a crowd of people coming down from the mountaintops.”
JDG.9.36	“No,” Zebul answered, “it's just the shadows of the mountains. It only looks like people moving.”
JDG.9.37	“But Zebul, look over there,” Gaal said. “There's a crowd coming down from the sacred mountain,
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul replied, “What good is all of your bragging now? You were the one who said Abimelech shouldn't be the ruler of Shechem. Out there is the army that you made fun of. So go out and fight them!”
JDG.9.39	Gaal and the leaders of Shechem went out and fought Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Soon the people of Shechem turned and ran back into the town. However, Abimelech and his troops were close behind and killed many of them along the way.
JDG.9.41	Abimelech stayed at Arumah,
JDG.9.42	The next morning, the people of Shechem were getting ready to work in their fields as usual, but someone told Abimelech about it. 
JDG.9.43	Abimelech divided his army into three groups and set up an ambush in the fields near Shechem. When the people came out of the town, he and his army rushed out from their hiding places and attacked. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and the troops with him ran to the town gate and took control of it, while two other groups attacked and killed the people who were in the fields. 
JDG.9.45	He and his troops fought in Shechem all day, until they had killed everyone in town. Then he and his men tore down the houses and buildings and scattered salt
JDG.9.46	Earlier that day, the leaders of the temple of El Berith
JDG.9.47	but Abimelech found out where they were. 
JDG.9.48	He led his troops to Mount Zalmon, where he took an ax and chopped off a tree branch. He lifted the branch onto his shoulder and shouted, “Hurry! Cut off a branch just as I did.”
JDG.9.49	When they all had branches, they followed Abimelech back to Shechem. They piled the branches against the fortress and set them on fire, burning down the fortress and killing about 1,000 men and women.
JDG.9.50	After destroying Shechem, Abimelech went to Thebez. He surrounded the town and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a tall fortress in the middle of the town, and the town leaders and everyone else went inside. Then they barred the gates and went up to the flat roof.
JDG.9.52	Abimelech and his army rushed to the fortress and tried to force their way inside. Abimelech himself was about to set the heavy wooden doors on fire, 
JDG.9.53	 when a woman on the roof dropped a large rock
JDG.9.54	The soldier who carried his weapons was nearby, and Abimelech told him, “Take out your sword and kill me. I don't want people to say that I was killed by a woman!”
JDG.9.54	So the soldier ran his sword through Abimelech. 
JDG.9.55	And when the Israelite soldiers saw that their leader was dead, they went back home.
JDG.9.56	That's how God punished Abimelech for killing his brothers and bringing shame on his father's family. 
JDG.9.57	God also punished the people of Shechem for helping Abimelech.
JDG.10.1	Tola was the next person to rescue Israel. He belonged to the Issachar tribe, but he lived in Shamir, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His father was Puah, and his grandfather was Dodo. 
JDG.10.2	Tola was a leader
JDG.10.3	The next leader
JDG.10.4	He had 30 sons, and each son had his own mule
JDG.10.5	When he died, he was buried in the town of Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Before long, the Israelites began disobeying the 
JDG.10.7	The 
JDG.10.8	So the same year that Jair died, Israel's army was crushed by these two nations. For 18 years, Ammon was cruel to the Israelites who lived in Gilead, the region east of the Jordan River that had once belonged to the Amorites. 
JDG.10.9	Then the Ammonites began crossing the Jordan and attacking the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Life was miserable for the Israelites. 
JDG.10.10	They begged the 
JDG.10.11+JDG.10.12	The 
JDG.10.11+JDG.10.12	In the past when you came crying to me for help, I rescued you. At one time or another I've rescued you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines, the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites.
JDG.10.13+JDG.10.14	But I'm not going to rescue you any more! You've left me and gone off to worship other gods. If you're in such big trouble, go and cry to them for help!
JDG.10.15	“We have been unfaithful to you,” the Israelites admitted. “If we must be punished, do it yourself, but please rescue us from the Ammonites.”
JDG.10.16	Then the Israelites got rid of the idols of the foreign gods, and they began worshiping only the 
JDG.10.17	The rulers of Ammon called their soldiers together and led them to Gilead, where they set up camp.
JDG.10.17	The Israelites gathered at Mizpah
JDG.10.18	The leaders of Gilead asked each other, “Who can lead an attack on the Ammonites?” Then they agreed, “If we find someone who can lead the attack, we'll make him the ruler of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1+JDG.11.2+JDG.11.3+JDG.11.4+JDG.11.5	The leaders of the Gilead clan decided to ask a brave warrior named Jephthah son of Gilead to lead the attack against the Ammonites.
JDG.11.1+JDG.11.2+JDG.11.3+JDG.11.4+JDG.11.5	Even though Jephthah belonged to the Gilead clan, he had earlier been forced to leave the region where they had lived. Jephthah was the son of a prostitute, but his half brothers were the sons of his father's wife.
JDG.11.1+JDG.11.2+JDG.11.3+JDG.11.4+JDG.11.5	One day his half brothers told him, “You don't really belong to our family, so you can't have any of the family property.” Then they forced Jephthah to leave home.
JDG.11.1+JDG.11.2+JDG.11.3+JDG.11.4+JDG.11.5	Jephthah went to the country of Tob, where he was joined by a number of men who would do anything for money.
JDG.11.1+JDG.11.2+JDG.11.3+JDG.11.4+JDG.11.5	So the leaders of Gilead went to Jephthah and said, 
JDG.11.6	“Please come back to Gilead! If you lead our army, we will be able to fight off the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	“Didn't you hate me?” Jephthah replied. “Weren't you the ones who forced me to leave my family? You're only coming to me now because you're in trouble.”
JDG.11.8	“But we do want you to come back,” the leaders said. “And if you lead us in battle against the Ammonites, we will make you the ruler of Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	“All right,” Jephthah said. “If I go back with you and the 
JDG.11.10	“You have our word,” the leaders answered. “And the 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went back to Mizpah
JDG.11.12	After the ceremony, Jephthah sent messengers to say to the king of Ammon, “Are you trying to start a war? You have invaded my country, and I want to know why!”
JDG.11.13	The king of Ammon replied, “Tell Jephthah that the land really belongs to me, all the way from the Arnon River in the south, to the Jabbok River in the north, and west to the Jordan River. When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they stole it. Tell Jephthah to return it to me, and there won't be any war.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent the messengers back to the king of Ammon, 
JDG.11.15	and they told him that Jephthah had said:
JDG.11.15	Israel hasn't taken any territory from Moab or Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	When the Israelites came from Egypt, they traveled across the desert to the Red Sea
JDG.11.17	 They sent messengers to the king of Edom and said, “Please, let us go through your country.” But the king of Edom refused. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he wouldn't let them cross his country either. And so the Israelites stayed at Kadesh.
JDG.11.20	Sihon didn't think the Israelites could be trusted, so he called his army together. They set up camp at Jahaz, then they attacked the Israelite camp. 
JDG.11.21	But the 
JDG.11.22	from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and from the desert in the east to the Jordan River in the west.
JDG.11.23	The messengers also told the king of Ammon that Jephthah had said:
JDG.11.23	The 
JDG.11.24	If Chemosh your god
JDG.11.26	For 300 years, Israelites have been living in Heshbon and Aroer and the nearby villages, and in the towns along the Arnon River gorge. If the land really belonged to you Ammonites, you wouldn't have waited until now to try to get it back.
JDG.11.27	I haven't done anything to you, but it's certainly wrong of you to start a war. I pray that the 
JDG.11.28	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah's message.
JDG.11.29	Then the 
JDG.11.30	he promised the 
JDG.11.31	and come home safely, I will sacrifice to you whoever comes out to meet me first.”
JDG.11.32	From Mizpah, Jephthah attacked the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.11.33	Jephthah and his army destroyed the 20 towns between Aroer and Minnith, and others as far as Abel-Keramim. After that, the Ammonites could not invade Israel any more.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, the first one to meet him was his daughter. She was playing a tambourine and dancing to celebrate his victory, and she was his only child.
JDG.11.36	“Father,” she said, “you made a sacred promise to the 
JDG.11.37	But first, please let me spend two months, wandering in the hill country with my friends. We will cry together, because I can never get married and have children.”
JDG.11.38	“Yes, you may have two months,” Jephthah said.
JDG.11.38	She and some other girls left, and for two months they wandered in the hill country, crying because she could never get married and have children. 
JDG.11.39	Then she went back to her father. He did what he had promised, and she never got married.
JDG.11.39	That's why 
JDG.11.40	every year, Israelite girls walk around for four days, weeping for
JDG.12.1	The men of the Ephraim tribe got together an army and went across the Jordan River to Zaphon to meet with Jephthah. They said, “Why did you go to war with the Ammonites without asking us to help? Just for that, we're going to burn down your house with you inside!”
JDG.12.2	“But I did ask for your help,” Jephthah answered. “That was back when the people of Gilead and I were having trouble with the Ammonites, and you wouldn't do a thing to help us. 
JDG.12.3	So when we realized you weren't coming, we risked our lives and attacked the Ammonites. And the 
JDG.12.4	But the men from Ephraim said, “You people of Gilead are nothing more than refugees from Ephraim. You even live on land that belongs to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.”
JDG.12.4	So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead, then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim. 
JDG.12.5	The army of Gilead also posted guards at all the places where the soldiers from Ephraim could cross the Jordan River to return to their own land.
JDG.12.5	Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river, the guards would say, “Are you from Ephraim?”
JDG.12.5	“No,” the man would answer, “I'm not from Ephraim.”
JDG.12.6	The guards would then tell them to say “Shibboleth,” because they knew that people of Ephraim could say “Sibboleth,” but not “Shibboleth.”
JDG.12.6	If the man said “Sibboleth,” the guards would grab him and kill him right there. Altogether, 42,000 men from Ephraim were killed in the battle and at the Jordan.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah was a leader
JDG.12.8	Ibzan, the next leader
JDG.12.9	He had 30 daughters and 30 sons, and he let them all marry outside his clan.
JDG.12.9	Ibzan was a leader for seven years, 
JDG.12.10	before he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	Elon from the Zebulun tribe was the next leader
JDG.12.12	before he died and was buried in Aijalon that belonged to the Zebulun tribe.
JDG.12.13+JDG.12.14+JDG.12.15	Abdon the son of Hillel was the next leader
JDG.13.1	Once again the Israelites started disobeying the 
JDG.13.2	Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was not able to have children, 
JDG.13.3+JDG.13.4+JDG.13.5	 but one day an angel from the 
JDG.13.3+JDG.13.4+JDG.13.5	You have never been able to have any children, but very soon you will be pregnant and have a son. He will belong to God
JDG.13.3+JDG.13.4+JDG.13.5	Your son will begin to set Israel free from the Philistines.
JDG.13.6	She went to Manoah and said, “A prophet who looked like an angel of God came and talked to me. I was so frightened, that I didn't even ask where he was from. He didn't tell me his name, 
JDG.13.7	but he did say that I'm going to have a baby boy. I'm not supposed to drink any wine or beer or eat any food forbidden by God's laws. Our son will belong to God for as long as he lives.”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed, “Our 
JDG.13.9	God answered Manoah's prayer, and the angel went back to Manoah's wife while she was resting in the fields. Manoah wasn't there at the time, 
JDG.13.10	so she found him and said, “That same man is here again! He's the one I saw the other day.”
JDG.13.11	Manoah went with his wife and asked the man, “Are you the one who spoke to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	“Yes, I am,” he answered.
JDG.13.12	Manoah then asked, “When your promise comes true, what rules must he obey and what will be his work?”
JDG.13.13	“Your wife must be careful to do everything I told her,” the 
JDG.13.14	“She must not eat or drink anything made from grapes. She must not drink wine or beer or eat anything forbidden by God's laws. I told her exactly what to do.”
JDG.13.15	“Please,” Manoah said, “stay here with us for just a little while, and we'll fix a young goat for you to eat.” 
JDG.13.16	Manoah didn't realize that he was really talking to one of the 
JDG.13.16	The angel answered, “I can stay for a little while, although I won't eat any of your food. But if you would like to offer the goat as a sacrifice to the 
JDG.13.17	Manoah said, “Tell us your name, so we can honor you after our son is born.”
JDG.13.18	“No,” the angel replied. “You don't need to know my name. And if you did, you couldn't understand it.”
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took a young goat over to a large rock he had chosen for an altar, and he built a fire on the rock. Then he killed the goat, and offered it with some grain as a sacrifice to the 
JDG.13.20	The fire blazed up toward the sky, and the 
JDG.13.21	Although the angel didn't appear to them again, they realized he was one of the 
JDG.13.22	Manoah said, “We have seen an angel.
JDG.13.23	“The 
JDG.13.24	Later, Manoah's wife did give birth to a son, and she named him Samson. As the boy grew, the 
JDG.13.25	Then, while Samson was staying at Dan's Camp
JDG.14.1	One day, Samson went to Timnah, where he saw a Philistine woman. 
JDG.14.2	When he got back home, he told his parents, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah, and I want to marry her. Get her for me!”
JDG.14.3	His parents answered, “There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel. Those Philistines are pagans. Why would you want to marry one of their women?”
JDG.14.3	“She looks good to me,” Samson answered. “Get her for me!”
JDG.14.4	At that time, the Philistines were in control of Israel, and the 
JDG.14.5	As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah, a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson. 
JDG.14.6	But the 
JDG.14.7	When they got to Timnah, Samson talked to the woman, and he was sure that she was the one for him.
JDG.14.8	Later,
JDG.14.9	He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some of the honey, and they ate it too. But he didn't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion.
JDG.14.10	While Samson's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family, Samson threw a big party,
JDG.14.11	When the Philistines saw what Samson was like, they told 30 of their young men to stay with him at the party.
JDG.14.12	Samson told the 30 young men, “This party will last for seven days. Let's make a bet: I'll tell you a riddle, and if you can tell me the answer before the party is over, I'll give each of you a shirt and a full change of clothing. 
JDG.14.13	But if you can't tell me the answer, then each of you will have to give me a shirt and a full change of clothing.”
JDG.14.13	“It's a bet!” the Philistines said. “Tell us the riddle.”
JDG.14.14	Samson said:
JDG.14.14	Once so strong and mighty—
JDG.14.14	now so sweet and tasty!
JDG.14.14	Three days went by, and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer. 
JDG.14.15	Finally, on the seventh
JDG.14.16	Samson's bride went to him and started crying in his arms. “You must really hate me,” she sobbed. “If you loved me at all, you would have told me the answer to your riddle.”
JDG.14.16	“But I haven't even told my parents the answer!” Samson replied. “Why should I tell you?”
JDG.14.17	For the entire seven days of the party, she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him. But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer. She went straight to the young men and told them.
JDG.14.18	Before sunset that day, the men of the town went to Samson with this answer:
JDG.14.18	A lion is the strongest—
JDG.14.18	honey is the sweetest!
JDG.14.18	Samson replied,
JDG.14.18	This answer you have given me
JDG.14.18	doubtless came
JDG.14.18	from my bride-to-be.
JDG.14.19	Then the 
JDG.14.20	The father of the bride made Samson's wife marry one of the 30 young men that had been at Samson's party.
JDG.15.1	Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit the young woman he thought was still his wife.
JDG.15.1	“You can't do that,” he replied. 
JDG.15.2	“When you left the way you did, I thought you were divorcing
JDG.15.3	“This time,” Samson answered, “I have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines.”
JDG.15.4	Samson went out and caught 300 foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails. 
JDG.15.5	Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested. He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go. The wheat fields went up in flames, and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut. Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burned.
JDG.15.6	Some of the Philistines started asking around, “Who could have done such a thing?”
JDG.15.6	“It was Samson,” someone told them. “He married the daughter of that man in Timnah, but then the man gave Samson's wife to one of the men at the wedding.”
JDG.15.6	The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burned to death Samson's wife and her father.
JDG.15.7	When Samson found out what they had done, he went to them and said, “You killed them! And I won't rest until I get even with you.” 
JDG.15.8	Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword.
JDG.15.8	Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock. 
JDG.15.9	But it wasn't long before the Philistines invaded Judah
JDG.15.10	The people of Judah asked, “Why have you invaded our land?”
JDG.15.10	The Philistines answered, “We've come to get Samson. We're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people.”
JDG.15.11	Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, “Don't you know that the Philistines rule us, and they will punish us for what you did?”
JDG.15.11	“I was only getting even with them,” Samson replied. “They did the same things to me first.”
JDG.15.12	“We came here to tie you up and turn you over to them,” said the men of Judah.
JDG.15.12	“I won't put up a fight,” Samson answered, “but you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13+JDG.15.14	“We promise,” the men said. “We will only tie you up and turn you over to the Philistines. We won't kill you.” Then they tied up his hands and arms with two brand-new ropes and led him away from Etam Rock.
JDG.15.13+JDG.15.14	When the Philistines saw that Samson was being brought to their camp at Jawbone, they started shouting and ran toward him. But the 
JDG.15.15	Samson glanced around and spotted the jawbone of a donkey. The jawbone had not yet dried out, so it was still hard and heavy. Samson grabbed it and started hitting Philistines—he killed 1,000 of them! 
JDG.15.16	After the fighting was over, he made up this poem about what he had done to the Philistines:
JDG.15.16	I used a donkey's jawbone
JDG.15.16	to kill a thousand men;
JDG.15.16	I beat them with this jawbone
JDG.15.16	over and over again.
JDG.15.17	Samson tossed the jawbone on the ground and decided to call the place Jawbone Hill.
JDG.15.18	Samson was so thirsty that he prayed, “Our 
JDG.15.19	Samson was tired and weary, but God sent water gushing from a rock.
JDG.15.19	Samson named the place Caller Spring,
JDG.15.20	Samson was a leader
JDG.16.1	One day while Samson was in Gaza, he saw a prostitute and went to her house to spend the night. 
JDG.16.2	The people who lived in Gaza found out he was there, and they decided to kill him at sunrise. So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate.
JDG.16.3	But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate. He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron,
JDG.16.4	Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley. 
JDG.16.5	The Philistine rulers
JDG.16.6	The next time Samson was at Delilah's house, she asked, “Samson, what makes you so strong? How can I tie you up so you can't get away? Come on, you can tell me.”
JDG.16.7	Samson answered, “If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried,
JDG.16.8+JDG.16.9	The Philistine rulers gave seven new bowstrings to Delilah. They also told some of their soldiers to go to Delilah's house and hide in the room where Samson and Delilah were. If the bowstrings made Samson weak, they would be able to capture him.
JDG.16.8+JDG.16.9	Delilah tied up Samson with the bowstrings and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!”
JDG.16.8+JDG.16.9	Samson snapped the bowstrings, as though they were pieces of scorched string. The Philistines had not found out why Samson was so strong.
JDG.16.10	“You lied and made me look like a fool,” Delilah said. “Now tell me. How can I really tie you up?”
JDG.16.11	Samson answered, “Use some new ropes. If I'm tied up with ropes that have never been used, I'll be just as weak as anyone else.”
JDG.16.12	Delilah got new ropes, and again some Philistines hid in the room. Then she tied up Samson's arms and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!”
JDG.16.12	Samson snapped the ropes as if they were threads.
JDG.16.13	“You're still lying and making a fool of me,” Delilah said. “Tell me how I can tie you up!”
JDG.16.13	“My hair is in seven braids,” Samson replied. “If you weave my braids into the threads on a loom and nail the loom
JDG.16.14	While Samson was asleep, Delilah wove his braids into the threads on a loom and nailed the loom to a wall.
JDG.16.14	Samson woke up and pulled the loom free from its posts in the ground and from the nails in the wall. Then he pulled his hair free from the woven cloth.
JDG.16.15	“Samson,” Delilah said, “you claim to love me, but you don't mean it! You've made me look like a fool three times now, and you still haven't told me why you are so strong.” 
JDG.16.16	Delilah started nagging and pestering him day after day, until he couldn't stand it any longer.
JDG.16.17	Finally, Samson told her the truth. “I have belonged to God
JDG.16.18	Delilah realized that he was telling the truth. So she sent someone to tell the Philistine rulers, “Come to my house one more time. Samson has finally told me the truth.”
JDG.16.18	The Philistine rulers went to Delilah's house, and they brought along the silver they had promised her. 
JDG.16.19	Delilah had lulled Samson to sleep with his head resting in her lap. She signaled to one of the Philistine men as she began cutting off Samson's seven braids. And by the time she was finished, Samson's strength was gone. Delilah tied him up 
JDG.16.20	and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!”
JDG.16.20	Samson woke up and thought, “I'll break loose and escape, just as I always do.” He did not realize that the 
JDG.16.21	The Philistines grabbed Samson and poked out his eyes. They took him to the prison in Gaza and chained him up. Then they put him to work, turning a millstone to grind grain. 
JDG.16.22	But they didn't cut his hair any more, so it started growing back.
JDG.16.23	The Philistine rulers threw a big party and sacrificed a lot of animals to their god Dagon. The rulers said:
JDG.16.23	Samson was our enemy,
JDG.16.23	but our god Dagon
JDG.16.23	helped us capture him!
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	Everyone there was having a good time, and they shouted, “Bring out Samson—he's still good for a few more laughs!”
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	The rulers had Samson brought from the prison, and when the people saw him, this is how they praised their god:
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	Samson ruined our crops
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	and killed our people.
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	He was our enemy,
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	but our god helped us
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	capture him.
JDG.16.24+JDG.16.25	They made fun of Samson for a while, then they told him to stand near the columns that supported the roof. 
JDG.16.26	A young man was leading Samson by the hand, and Samson said to him, “I need to lean against something. Take me over to the columns that hold up the roof.”
JDG.16.27	The Philistine rulers were celebrating in a temple packed with people and with 3,000
JDG.16.28	Samson prayed, “Please remember me, 
JDG.16.29	Samson was standing between the two middle columns that held up the roof. He felt around and found one column with his right hand, and the other with his left hand. 
JDG.16.30	Then he shouted, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He pushed against the columns as hard as he could, and the temple collapsed with the Philistine rulers and everyone else still inside. Samson killed more Philistines when he died than he had killed during his entire life.
JDG.16.31	His brothers and the rest of his family went to Gaza and took his body back home. They buried him in his father's tomb,
JDG.16.31	Samson was a leader
JDG.17.1	Micah
JDG.17.2	One day he told his mother, “Do you remember those 1,100 pieces of silver
JDG.17.2	His mother answered, “I pray that the 
JDG.17.3+JDG.17.4	Micah returned the silver to his mother, and she said, “I give this silver to the 
JDG.17.3+JDG.17.4	But Micah handed it back to his mother. She took 200 pieces
JDG.17.5	He had a shrine for worshiping God there at his home, and he had made some idols and a sacred priestly vest. Micah chose one of his own sons to be the priest for his shrine.
JDG.17.7+JDG.17.8	One day a young Levite came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. He had been staying with one of the clans of Judah in Bethlehem, but he had left Bethlehem to find a new place to live
JDG.17.9	“Where are you from?” Micah asked.
JDG.17.9	“I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” the man answered, “and I'm on my way to find a new place to live.”
JDG.17.10	Micah said, “Why don't you stay here with me? You can be my priest and tell me what God wants me to do. Every year I'll give you ten pieces of silver and one complete set of clothes, and I'll provide all your food.”
JDG.17.10	The young man went for a walk, 
JDG.17.11+JDG.17.12	then he agreed to stay with Micah and be his priest. He lived in Micah's house, and Micah treated him like one of his own sons. 
JDG.17.13	Micah said, “I have a Levite as my own priest. Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	These things happened before kings ruled Israel.
JDG.18.1	About this time, the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live. The other tribes had land, but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own. 
JDG.18.2	The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them, “Go and find some land where we can live.”
JDG.18.2	The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim. One night they stayed at Micah's house, 
JDG.18.3	because they heard the young Levite talking, and they knew from his accent that he was from the south. They asked him, “What are you doing here? Who brought you here?”
JDG.18.4	The Levite replied, “Micah hired me as his priest.” Then he told them how well Micah had treated him.
JDG.18.5	“Please talk to God for us,” the men said. “Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do.”
JDG.18.6	“Don't worry,” answered the priest. “The 
JDG.18.7	The five men left and went to the town of Laish, whose people were from Sidon,
JDG.18.8	The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol, where their relatives asked, “Did you find any land?”
JDG.18.9+JDG.18.10	“Let's go!” the five men said. “We saw some very good land with enough room for all of us, and it has everything we will ever need. What are you waiting for? Let's attack and take it. You'll find that the people think they're safe, but God is giving the land to us.”
JDG.18.11	Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan strapped on their weapons and left Zorah and Eshtaol with their families.
JDG.18.12	One night they camped near Kiriath-Jearim in the territory of Judah, and that's why the place just west of Kiriath-Jearim is still known as Dan's Camp.
JDG.18.13	Then they went into the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.18.13	When they came close to Micah's house, 
JDG.18.14	the five men who had been spies asked the other warriors, “Did you know that someone in this village has several idols and a sacred priestly vest? What do you think we should do about it?”
JDG.18.15+JDG.18.16+JDG.18.17+JDG.18.18	The 600 warriors left the road and went to the house on Micah's property where the young Levite priest lived. They stood at the gate and greeted the priest. Meanwhile, the five men who had been there before went into Micah's house and took the sacred priestly vest and the idols.
JDG.18.15+JDG.18.16+JDG.18.17+JDG.18.18	“Hey!” the priest shouted. “What do you think you're doing?”
JDG.18.19	“Quiet!” the men said. “Keep your mouth shut and listen. Why don't you come with us and be our priest, so you can tell us what God wants us to do? You could stay here and be a priest for one man's family, but wouldn't you rather be the priest for a clan or even a whole tribe of Israel?”
JDG.18.20	The priest really liked that idea. So he took the vest and the idols and joined the others 
JDG.18.21	from the tribe of Dan. Then they turned and left, after putting their children, their cattle, and the rest of their other possessions in front.
JDG.18.22	They had traveled for some time before Micah asked his neighbors to help him get his things back. He and his men caught up with the people of Dan 
JDG.18.23	and shouted for them to stop.
JDG.18.23	They turned to face him and asked, “What's wrong? Why did you bring all these men?”
JDG.18.24	Micah answered, “You know what's wrong. You stole the gods
JDG.18.25	“We don't want to hear any more about it,” the people of Dan said. “And if you make us angry, you'll only get yourself and your family killed.” 
JDG.18.26	After saying this, they turned and left.
JDG.18.26	Micah realized there was no way he could win a fight with them, and so he went back home.
JDG.18.27+JDG.18.28	The tribe of Dan took Micah's priest and the things Micah had made, and headed for Laish, which was located in a valley controlled by the town of Beth-Rehob. Laish was defenseless, because it had no walls and was too far from Sidon for the Sidonians to help defend it. The leaders of Laish had not even asked nearby towns to help them in case of an attack.
JDG.18.27+JDG.18.28	The warriors from Dan made a surprise attack on Laish, killing everyone and burning it down. Then they rebuilt the town and settled there themselves. 
JDG.18.29	But they named it Dan, after one of Israel's
JDG.18.30+JDG.18.31	Even though the place of worship
JDG.19.1	Before kings ruled Israel, a Levite
JDG.19.2	but she was unfaithful and went back to live with her family in Bethlehem.
JDG.19.2	Four months later 
JDG.19.3	her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back. So he went to Bethlehem, taking along a servant and two donkeys. He talked with his wife, and she invited him into her family's home. Her father was glad to see him 
JDG.19.4	and did not want him to leave. So the man stayed three days, eating and drinking with his father-in-law.
JDG.19.5	When everyone got up on the fourth day, the Levite started getting ready to go home. But his father-in-law said, “Don't leave until you have a bite to eat. You'll need strength for your journey.”
JDG.19.6	The two men sat down together and ate a big meal. “Come on,” the man's father-in-law said. “Stay tonight and have a good time.”
JDG.19.7	The Levite tried to leave, but his father-in-law insisted, and he spent one more night there. 
JDG.19.8	The fifth day, the man got up early to leave, but his wife's father said, “You need to keep up your strength! Why don't you leave right after lunch?” So the two of them started eating.
JDG.19.9	Finally, the Levite got up from the meal, so he and his wife and servant could leave. “Look,” his father-in-law said, “it's already late afternoon, and if you leave now, you won't get very far before dark. Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself. Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home.”
JDG.19.10	But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again. He had the saddles put on his two donkeys, then he and his wife and servant traveled as far as Jebus, which is now called Jerusalem. 
JDG.19.11	It was beginning to get dark, and the man's servant said, “Let's stop and spend the night in this town where the Jebusites live.”
JDG.19.12	“No,” the Levite answered. “They aren't Israelites, and I refuse to spend the night there. We'll stop for the night at Gibeah, 
JDG.19.13	or maybe we can even reach Ramah
JDG.19.14	They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset. 
JDG.19.15	They left the road and went into Gibeah. But the Levite couldn't find a house where anyone would let them spend the night, and they sat down in the open area just inside the town gates.
JDG.19.16	Soon an old man came in through the gates on his way home from working in the fields. Most of the people who lived in Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, but this man was originally from the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.19.17	He noticed that the Levite was just in town to spend the night. “Where are you going?” the old man asked. “Where did you come from?”
JDG.19.18	“We've come from Bethlehem in Judah,” the Levite answered. “We went there on a visit. Now we're going to the place where the 
JDG.19.19	We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves, so we don't need anything except a place to sleep.”
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “You are welcome to spend the night in my home and to be my guest, but don't stay out here!”
JDG.19.21	The old man brought them into his house and fed their donkeys. Then he and his guests washed their feet
JDG.19.22	 They were having a good time, when some worthless men of that town surrounded the house and started banging on the door and shouting, “A man came to your house tonight. Send him out, so we can have sex with him!”
JDG.19.23	The old man went outside and said, “My friends, please don't commit such a horrible crime against a man who is a guest in my house. 
JDG.19.24	Let me send out my daughter instead. She's a virgin. And I'll even send out the man's wife.
JDG.19.25	The men refused to listen, so the Levite grabbed his wife and shoved her outside. The men raped her and abused her all night long. Finally, they let her go just before sunrise, 
JDG.19.26	and it was almost daybreak when she went back to the house where her husband
JDG.19.27	About that time, her husband woke up and got ready to leave. He opened the door and went outside, where he found his wife lying at the door with her hands on the doorstep. 
JDG.19.28	“Get up!” he said. “It's time to leave.”
JDG.19.28	But his wife didn't move.
JDG.19.28	He lifted her body onto his donkey and left. 
JDG.19.29	 When he got home, he took a butcher knife and cut her body into twelve pieces. Then he told some messengers, “Take one piece to each tribe of Israel 
JDG.19.30	and ask everyone if anything like this has ever happened since Israel left Egypt. Tell them to think about it, talk it over, and tell us what should be done.”
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw a piece of the body said, “This is horrible! Nothing like this has ever happened since the day Israel left Egypt.”
JDG.20.1+JDG.20.2+JDG.20.3	The Israelites called a meeting of the nation. And since they were God's people, the meeting was held at the place of worship in Mizpah. Men who could serve as soldiers came from everywhere in Israel—from Dan in the north, Beersheba in the south, and Gilead east of the Jordan River. Four hundred thousand of them came to Mizpah, and they each felt the same about what those men from the tribe of Benjamin had done.
JDG.20.1+JDG.20.2+JDG.20.3	News about the meeting at Mizpah reached the tribe of Benjamin.
JDG.20.1+JDG.20.2+JDG.20.3	As soon as the leaders of the tribes of Israel took their places, the Israelites said, “How could such a horrible thing happen?”
JDG.20.4	The husband of the murdered woman answered:
JDG.20.4	My wife
JDG.20.5	Later that night, the men of Gibeah surrounded the house. They wanted to kill me, but instead they raped and killed my wife. 
JDG.20.6	It was a terrible thing for Israelites to do! So I cut up her body and sent the pieces everywhere in Israel.
JDG.20.7	You are the people of Israel, and you must decide today what to do about the men of Gibeah.
JDG.20.8	The whole army was in agreement, and they said, “None of us will go home. 
JDG.20.9+JDG.20.10	We'll send one tenth of the men from each tribe to get food for the army. And we'll ask God
JDG.20.11	Everyone agreed that Gibeah had to be punished.
JDG.20.12	The tribes of Israel sent messengers to every town and village in Benjamin. And wherever the messengers went, they said, “How could those worthless men in Gibeah do such a disgusting thing? 
JDG.20.13	We can't allow such a terrible crime to go unpunished in Israel! Hand the men over to us, and we will put them to death.”
JDG.20.13	But the people of Benjamin refused to listen to the other Israelites. 
JDG.20.14	Men from towns all over Benjamin's territory went to Gibeah and got ready to fight Israel. 
JDG.20.15	The Benjamin tribe had 26,000 soldiers, not counting the 700 who were Gibeah's best warriors. 
JDG.20.16	In this army there were 700 left-handed experts who could sling a rock
JDG.20.17	The other Israelite tribes organized their army and found they had 400,000 experienced soldiers. 
JDG.20.18	So they went to the place of worship at Bethel
JDG.20.18	“Judah,” the 
JDG.20.19	The next morning the Israelite army moved its camp to a place near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	Then they left their camp and got into position to attack the army of Benjamin.
JDG.20.21	Benjamin's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked, and when the day was over, 22,000 Israelite soldiers lay dead on the ground.
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23+JDG.20.24	The people of Israel went to the place of worship and cried until sunset. Then they asked the 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23+JDG.20.24	“Yes,” the 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23+JDG.20.24	The Israelite soldiers encouraged each other to be brave and to fight hard. Then the next day they went back to Gibeah and took up the same positions as they had before.
JDG.20.25	That same day, Benjamin's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked, leaving another 18,000 Israelite soldiers dead on the battlefield.
JDG.20.26+JDG.20.27+JDG.20.28	The people of Israel went to the place of worship at Bethel,
JDG.20.26+JDG.20.27+JDG.20.28	“Attack!” the 
JDG.20.29	The Israelites surrounded Gibeah, but stayed where they could not be seen. 
JDG.20.30	Then the next day, they took the same positions as twice before, 
JDG.20.31+JDG.20.32+JDG.20.33+JDG.20.34+JDG.20.35+JDG.20.36+JDG.20.37+JDG.20.38+JDG.20.39+JDG.20.40+JDG.20.41	but this time they had a different plan. They said, “When the men of Benjamin attack, we will run off and let them chase us away from the town and into the country roads.”
JDG.20.31+JDG.20.32+JDG.20.33+JDG.20.34+JDG.20.35+JDG.20.36+JDG.20.37+JDG.20.38+JDG.20.39+JDG.20.40+JDG.20.41	The soldiers of Benjamin attacked the Israelite army and started pushing it back from the town. They killed about 30 Israelites in the fields and along the road between Gibeah and Bethel. The men of Benjamin were thinking, “We're mowing them down like we did before.”
JDG.20.31+JDG.20.32+JDG.20.33+JDG.20.34+JDG.20.35+JDG.20.36+JDG.20.37+JDG.20.38+JDG.20.39+JDG.20.40+JDG.20.41	The Israelites were running away, but they headed for Baal-Tamar, where they regrouped. They had set an ambush, and they were sure it would work. Ten thousand of Israel's best soldiers had been hiding west of Gibeah,
JDG.20.31+JDG.20.32+JDG.20.33+JDG.20.34+JDG.20.35+JDG.20.36+JDG.20.37+JDG.20.38+JDG.20.39+JDG.20.40+JDG.20.41	The fighting had been so heavy around the soldiers of Benjamin, that they did not know the trouble they were in. But then they looked back and saw clouds of smoke rising from the town. They looked in front and saw the soldiers of Israel turning to attack. This terrified them, because they realized that something horrible was happening. And it was horrible—over 25,000
JDG.20.42	The men of Benjamin headed down the road toward the desert, trying to escape from the Israelites. But the Israelites stayed right behind them, keeping up their attack. Men even came out of the nearby towns to help kill the men of Benjamin, 
JDG.20.43	who were having to fight on all sides. The Israelite soldiers never let up their attack.
JDG.20.44	until 18,000 of these warriors lay dead.
JDG.20.45	Some other warriors of Benjamin turned and ran down the road toward Rimmon Rock in the desert. The Israelites killed 5,000 of them on the road, then chased the rest until they had killed
JDG.20.46	Twenty-five thousand soldiers of Benjamin died that day, all of them experienced warriors. 
JDG.20.47	Only 600 of them finally made it into the desert to Rimmon Rock, where they stayed for four months.
JDG.20.48	The Israelites turned back and went to every town in Benjamin's territory, killing all the people and animals, and setting the towns on fire.
JDG.21.1	When the Israelites had met at Mizpah before the war with Benjamin,
JDG.21.2	After the war with Benjamin, the Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel and sat there until sunset. They cried loudly and bitterly 
JDG.21.3	and prayed, “Our 
JDG.21.4	Early the next morning, the Israelites built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the 
JDG.21.5	Then they asked each other, “Did any of the tribes of Israel fail to come to the place of worship? We made a sacred promise that anyone who didn't come to the meeting at Mizpah would be put to death.”
JDG.21.6	The Israelites were sad about what had happened to the Benjamin tribe, and they said, “One of our tribes was almost wiped out. 
JDG.21.7	Only a few men of Benjamin weren't killed in the war. We need to get wives for them, so the tribe won't completely disappear. But how can we do that, after promising in the 
JDG.21.8+JDG.21.9	Again the Israelites asked, “Did any of the tribes stay away from the meeting at Mizpah?”
JDG.21.8+JDG.21.9	After asking around, they discovered that no one had come from Jabesh in Gilead. 
JDG.21.10+JDG.21.11	So they sent 12,000 warriors with these orders: “Attack Jabesh in Gilead and kill everyone, except the women who have never been married.”
JDG.21.12	The warriors attacked Jabesh in Gilead, and returned to their camp at Shiloh in Canaan
JDG.21.13	The Israelites met and sent messengers to the men of Benjamin at Rimmon Rock, telling them that the Israelites were willing to make peace with them. 
JDG.21.14	So the men of Benjamin came back from Rimmon Rock, and the Israelites let them marry the young women from Jabesh. But there weren't enough women.
JDG.21.15	The Israelites were very sad, because the 
JDG.21.16	Then their leaders said:
JDG.21.16	All the women of the Benjamin tribe were killed. How can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are left? 
JDG.21.17	If they don't have children, one of the Israelite tribes will die out. 
JDG.21.18	But we can't let the men of Benjamin marry any of our daughters. We made a sacred promise not to do that, and if we break our promise, we will be under our own curse.
JDG.21.19	Then someone suggested, “What about the 
JDG.21.20	The leaders told the men of Benjamin who still did not have wives:
JDG.21.20	Go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards near the festival. 
JDG.21.21	Wait there for the young women of Shiloh to come out and perform their dances. Then rush out and grab one of the young women, then take her home as your wife. 
JDG.21.22	If the fathers or brothers of these women complain about this, we'll say, “Be kind enough to let those men keep your daughter. After all, we couldn't get enough wives for all the men of Benjamin in the battle at Jabesh. And because you didn't give them permission to marry your daughters, you won't be under the curse we earlier agreed on.”
JDG.21.23	The men of Benjamin went to Shiloh and hid in the vineyards. The young women soon started dancing, and each man grabbed one of them and carried her off. Then the men of Benjamin went back to their own land and rebuilt their towns and started living in them again.
JDG.21.24	Afterwards, the rest of the Israelites returned to their homes and families.
RUT.1.1+RUT.1.2	Before Israel was ruled by kings, Elimelech from the clan of Ephrath lived in the town of Bethlehem. His wife was named Naomi, and their two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. But when their crops failed in Israel, they moved to the country of Moab.
RUT.1.3	Elimelech died, leaving Naomi with only her two sons.
RUT.1.4	Later, Naomi's sons married Moabite women. One was named Orpah and the other Ruth. About ten years later, 
RUT.1.5	Mahlon and Chilion also died. Now Naomi had no husband or sons.
RUT.1.6+RUT.1.7	When Naomi heard that the 
RUT.1.8	Naomi said to them, “Don't you want to go back home to your own mothers? You were kind to my husband and sons, and you've always been kind to me. I pray that the 
RUT.1.9	May he give each of you another husband and a home of your own.”
RUT.1.9	Naomi kissed them. They cried 
RUT.1.10	and said, “We want to go with you and live among your people.”
RUT.1.11	But she replied, “My daughters, why don't you return home? What good will it do you to go with me? Do you think I could have more sons for you to marry?
RUT.1.12	You must go back home, because I am too old to marry again. Even if I got married tonight and later had more sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you wait for them to become old enough to marry? No, my daughters! Life is harder for me than it is for you, because the 
RUT.1.14	They cried again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth held on to her. 
RUT.1.15	Naomi then said to Ruth, “Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and to her gods! Why don't you go with her?”
RUT.1.16	Ruth answered,
RUT.1.16	“Please don't tell me
RUT.1.16	to leave you
RUT.1.16	and return home!
RUT.1.16	I will go where you go,
RUT.1.16	I will live where you live;
RUT.1.16	your people will be my people,
RUT.1.16	your God will be my God.
RUT.1.17	I will die where you die
RUT.1.17	and be buried beside you.
RUT.1.17	May the 
RUT.1.17	if we are ever separated,
RUT.1.17	even by death!”
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth had made up her mind to go with her, she stopped urging her to go back.
RUT.1.19	They reached Bethlehem, and the whole town was excited to see them. The women who lived there asked, “Can this really be Naomi?”
RUT.1.20	Then she told them, “Don't call me Naomi any longer! Call me Mara,
RUT.1.21	I had everything when I left, but the 
RUT.1.22	The barley harvest was just beginning when Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, arrived in Bethlehem.
RUT.2.1+RUT.2.2+RUT.2.3	Naomi answered, “Go ahead, my daughter.” So immediately Ruth went out to pick up grain in a field. She didn't know it was owned by Boaz, a relative of Naomi's husband Elimelech, as well as a rich and important man.
RUT.2.4	When Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and went out to his field, he said to the harvest workers, “The 
RUT.2.4	They replied, “And may the 
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz asked the man in charge of the harvest workers, “Who is that young woman?”
RUT.2.6	The man answered, “She is the one who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
RUT.2.7	She asked if she could pick up grain left by the harvest workers, and she has been working all morning without a moment's rest.”
RUT.2.8	Boaz went over to Ruth and said, “I think it would be best for you not to pick up grain in anyone else's field. Stay here with the women 
RUT.2.9	and follow along behind them, as they gather up what the men have cut. I have warned the men not to bother you, and whenever you are thirsty, you can drink from their water jars.”
RUT.2.10	Ruth bowed down to the ground and said, “You know I come from another country. Why are you so good to me?”
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered, “I've heard how you've helped your mother-in-law ever since your husband died. You even left your own father and mother to come and live in a foreign land among people you don't know. 
RUT.2.12	I pray that the 
RUT.2.13	Ruth replied, “Sir, it's good of you to speak kindly to me and make me feel so welcome. I'm not even one of your servants.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come, eat with us. Have some bread and dip it in the sauce.” At once she sat down with the workers, and Boaz handed her some roasted grain. Ruth ate all she wanted and had some left over.
RUT.2.15	When Ruth left to start picking up grain, Boaz told his men, “Don't stop her, even if she picks up grain from where it is stacked. 
RUT.2.16	Be sure to pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles and leave them on the ground for her. And don't speak harshly to her!”
RUT.2.17	Ruth worked in the field until evening. Then after she had pounded the grain off the stalks, she had a large basket full of grain. 
RUT.2.18	She took the grain to town and showed Naomi how much she had picked up. Ruth also gave her the food left over from her lunch.
RUT.2.19	Naomi said, “Where did you work today? Whose field was it? God bless the man who treated you so well!” Then Ruth told her that she had worked in the field of a man named Boaz.
RUT.2.21	Ruth told her, “Boaz even said I could stay in the field with his workers until they had finished harvesting all his grain.”
RUT.2.22	Naomi replied, “My daughter, it's good that you can pick up grain alongside the women who work in his field. Who knows what might happen to you in someone else's field!” 
RUT.2.23	And so, Ruth stayed close to the women, while picking up grain in his field.
RUT.2.23	Ruth worked in the fields until the barley and wheat were harvested. And all this time she lived with Naomi.
RUT.3.1	One day, Naomi said to Ruth:
RUT.3.1	It's time I found you a husband, who will give you a home and take care of you.
RUT.3.2	You have been picking up grain alongside the women who work for Boaz, and you know he is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be threshing the grain. 
RUT.3.3	Now take a bath and put on some perfume, then dress in your best clothes. Go where he is working, but don't let him see you until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	Watch where he goes to spend the night, then when he is asleep, lift the cover and lie down at his feet.
RUT.3.5	Ruth answered, “I'll do whatever you say.” 
RUT.3.6	She went out to the place where Boaz was working and did what Naomi had told her.
RUT.3.7	After Boaz finished eating and drinking and was feeling happy, he went over and fell asleep near the pile of grain. Ruth slipped over quietly. She lifted the cover and lay down near his feet.
RUT.3.8	In the middle of the night, Boaz suddenly woke up and was shocked to see a woman lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	“Who are you?” he asked.
RUT.3.9	“Sir, I am Ruth,” she answered, “and you are the relative who is supposed to take care of me. So spread the edge of your cover over me.”
RUT.3.10	Boaz replied:
RUT.3.10	The 
RUT.3.11	Don't worry, I'll do what you have asked. You are respected by everyone in town.
RUT.3.13	Stay here until morning, then I will find out if he is willing to look after you. If he isn't, I promise by the living God to do it myself. Now go back to sleep until morning.
RUT.3.14	Ruth lay down again, but she got up before daylight, because Boaz did not want anyone to know she had been there. 
RUT.3.15	Then he told her to spread out her cape. And he filled it with grain and placed it on her shoulder.
RUT.3.15	When Ruth got back to town, 
RUT.3.16	Naomi asked her
RUT.3.17	She also said, “Boaz gave me this grain, because he didn't want me to come back without something for you.”
RUT.3.18	Naomi replied, “Just be patient and don't worry about what will happen. He won't rest until everything is settled today!”
RUT.4.1	In the meanwhile, Boaz had gone to the meeting place at the town gate and was sitting there when the other close relative came by. So Boaz invited him to come over and sit down, and he did. 
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz got ten of the town leaders and also asked them to sit down. After they had sat down, 
RUT.4.3	he said to the man:
RUT.4.3	Naomi has come back from Moab and is selling the land that belonged to her husband Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	I'm telling you about this, since you are his closest relative and have the right to buy the property. If you want it, you can buy it now. These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses. But if you don't want the property, let me know, because I am next in line.
RUT.4.4	The man replied, “I'll buy it!”
RUT.4.5	“If you do buy it from Naomi,” Boaz told him, “you must also marry Ruth. Then if you have a son by her, the property will stay in the family of Ruth's first husband.”
RUT.4.6	The man answered, “If that's the case, I don't want to buy it! That would make problems with the property I already own.
RUT.4.8	So after the man had agreed to let Boaz buy the property, he took off one of his sandals and handed it to Boaz.
RUT.4.9	Boaz told the town leaders and everyone else:
RUT.4.9	All of you are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi the property that belonged to Elimelech and his two sons, Chilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	 You are also witnesses that I have agreed to marry Mahlon's widow Ruth, the Moabite woman. This will keep the property in his family's name, and he will be remembered in this town.
RUT.4.11	We are witnesses to this. And we pray that the 
RUT.4.12	 May the children you have by this young woman make your family as famous as the family of Perez,
RUT.4.13	Boaz married Ruth, and the 
RUT.4.14	After his birth, the women said to Naomi:
RUT.4.14	Praise the 
RUT.4.15	He will
RUT.4.16	Naomi loved the boy and took good care of him. 
RUT.4.17	The neighborhood women named him Obed, but they called him “Naomi's Boy.”
RUT.4.17	When Obed grew up he had a son named Jesse, who later became the father of King David. 
RUT.4.18+RUT.4.19+RUT.4.20+RUT.4.21+RUT.4.22	Here is a list of the ancestors of David: Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salmon, Nahshon, Amminadab, Ram, Hezron, and Perez.
1SA.1.1	Elkanah lived in Ramah,
1SA.1.2	Elkanah had two wives,
1SA.1.3	Once a year Elkanah traveled from his hometown to Shiloh, where he worshiped the 
1SA.1.4	Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he gave some of the meat
1SA.1.5	But he gave Hannah even more, because
1SA.1.6	Peninnah liked to make Hannah feel miserable about not having any children, 
1SA.1.7	especially when the family went to the house of the 
1SA.1.7	One day, Elkanah was there offering a sacrifice, when Hannah began crying and refused to eat. 
1SA.1.8	So Elkanah asked, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why do you feel so bad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?”
1SA.1.9	When the sacrifice had been offered, and they had eaten the meal, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli was sitting in his chair near the door to the place of worship. 
1SA.1.10	Hannah was heartbroken and was crying as she prayed, 
1SA.1.11	 “
1SA.1.12+1SA.1.13	Hannah prayed silently to the 
1SA.1.14	“How long are you going to stay drunk?” he asked. “Sober up!”
1SA.1.15+1SA.1.16	“Sir, please don't think I'm no good!” Hannah answered. “I'm not drunk, and I haven't been drinking. But I do feel miserable and terribly upset. I've been praying all this time, telling the 
1SA.1.17	Eli replied, “Go home. Everything will be fine. The God of Israel will answer your prayer.”
1SA.1.18	“Sir, thank you for being so kind to me,” Hannah said. Then she left, and after eating something, she felt much better.
1SA.1.19	Elkanah and his family got up early the next morning and worshiped the 
1SA.1.20	with a son. She named him Samuel because she had asked the 
1SA.1.21	The next time Elkanah and his family went to offer their yearly sacrifice, he took along a gift that he had promised to give to the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah stayed home, because she had told Elkanah, “Samuel and I won't go until he's old enough for me to stop nursing him. Then I'll give him to the 
1SA.1.23	“You know what's best,” Elkanah said. “Stay here until it's time to stop nursing him. I'm sure the

1SA.1.26	“Sir,” Hannah said, “a few years ago I stood here beside you and asked the 
1SA.1.27	to give me a child. Here he is! The

1SA.2.1	and laugh at my enemies.
1SA.2.2	No other god
1SA.2.2	And with you we are safer
1SA.2.2	than on a high mountain.
1SA.2.3	I can tell those proud people,

1SA.2.4	to everyone who stumbles.
1SA.2.5	People who once
1SA.2.5	had plenty to eat
1SA.2.5	must now hire themselves out
1SA.2.5	for only a piece of bread.
1SA.2.5	But you give the hungry more
1SA.2.5	than enough to eat.
1SA.2.5	A woman did not have a child,
1SA.2.5	and you gave her seven,
1SA.2.5	but a woman who had many
1SA.2.5	was left with none.

1SA.2.10	You will judge the whole earth
1SA.2.10	and give power and strength
1SA.2.10	to your chosen king.
1SA.2.11	Elkanah and Hannah went back home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed to help Eli serve the 
1SA.2.12+1SA.2.13	Eli's sons were priests, but they were dishonest and refused to obey the 
1SA.2.14	The servant would stick the fork into the cooking pot, and whatever meat came out on the fork was taken back to Eli's two sons. That was how they treated every Israelite who came to offer sacrifices in Shiloh. 
1SA.2.15	Sometimes, when people were offering sacrifices, the servant would come over, even before the fat had been cut off and sacrificed to the 
1SA.2.15	Then the servant would tell them, “The priest doesn't want his meat boiled! Give him some raw meat that he can roast!”
1SA.2.16	Usually the people answered, “Take what you want. But first, let us sacrifice the fat to the 
1SA.2.16	“No,” the servant would reply. “If you don't give it to me now, I'll take it by force.”
1SA.2.17	Eli's sons did not show any respect for the sacrifices that the people offered. This was a terrible sin, and it made the 
1SA.2.18	The boy Samuel served the 
1SA.2.19	and the clothes
1SA.2.20	Eli always blessed Elkanah and his wife and said, “Samuel was born in answer to your prayers. Now you have given him to the 
1SA.2.21	The 
1SA.2.22	Eli was now very old, and he heard what his sons were doing to the people of Israel.
1SA.2.23+1SA.2.24	“Why are you doing these awful things?” he asked them. “I've been hearing nothing but complaints about you from all of the 
1SA.2.25	If you harm another person, God can help make things right between the two of you. But if you commit a crime against the 
1SA.2.25	But the 
1SA.2.27	One day a prophet came to Eli and gave him this message from the 
1SA.2.27	When your ancestors were slaves of the king of Egypt, I came and showed them who I am. 
1SA.2.28+1SA.2.29	 Out of all the tribes of Israel, I chose your family to be my priests. I wanted them to offer sacrifices and burn incense to me and to find out from me what I want my people to do. I commanded everyone to bring their sacrifices here where I live, and I allowed you and your family to keep those that were not offered to me on the altar.
1SA.2.28+1SA.2.29	But you honor your sons instead of me! You don't respect
1SA.2.30	I am the 
1SA.2.31	The time will come when I will kill you and everyone else in your family. Not one of you will live to an old age.

1SA.2.34	 To prove to you that I will do these things, your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will die on the same day.
1SA.2.35	I have chosen someone else to be my priest, someone who will be faithful and obey me. I will always let his family serve as priests and help my chosen king. 
1SA.2.36	But if anyone is left from your family, he will come to my priest and beg for money or a little bread. He may even say to my priest, “Please let me be a priest, so I will at least have something to eat.”
1SA.3.1+1SA.3.2	Samuel served the 
1SA.3.3	and Samuel was sleeping on a mat near the sacred chest in the 
1SA.3.4	when the 
1SA.3.4	“Here I am!” Samuel answered. 
1SA.3.5	Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. What do you want?”
1SA.3.5	“I didn't call you,” Eli answered. “Go back to bed.”
1SA.3.5	Samuel went back.
1SA.3.6	Again the 
1SA.3.6	Eli told him, “Son, I didn't call you. Go back to sleep.”
1SA.3.7	The 
1SA.3.8	When the 
1SA.3.8	Eli finally realized that it was the 
1SA.3.9	So he said, “Go back and lie down! If someone speaks to you again, answer, ‘I'm listening, 
1SA.3.9	Once again Samuel went back and lay down.
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.10	“I'm listening,” Samuel answered. “What do you want me to do?”
1SA.3.11	The 
1SA.3.11	Samuel, I am going to do something in Israel that will shock everyone who hears about it! 
1SA.3.12	I will punish Eli and his family, just as I promised. 
1SA.3.13	He knew that his sons refused to respect me,
1SA.3.14	I warned Eli that sacrifices or offerings could never make things right! His family has done too many disgusting things.
1SA.3.15	The next morning, Samuel got up and opened the doors to the 
1SA.3.16	But Eli told him, “Samuel, my boy, come here!”
1SA.3.16	“Yes, sir!” Samuel answered.
1SA.3.17	Eli said, “What did God say to you? Tell me everything. I'll ask God to punish you terribly if you don't tell me every word he said!”
1SA.3.18	Samuel told Eli everything. Then Eli said, “He is the 
1SA.3.19	As Samuel grew up, the 
1SA.3.20	From the town of Dan in the north to the town of Beersheba in the south, everyone in the country knew that Samuel was truly the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	Then Samuel would speak to the whole nation of Israel.
1SA.4.1	One day the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They set up camp near Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines made a fierce attack. They defeated the Israelites and killed about 4,000 of them.
1SA.4.3	The Israelite army returned to their camp, and the leaders said, “Why did the 
1SA.4.4	As Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, 
1SA.4.5	brought the chest into camp, the army cheered so loudly that the ground shook. 
1SA.4.6	The Philistines heard the noise and said, “What are those Hebrews shouting about?”
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines learned that the sacred chest had been brought into the camp, 
1SA.4.7	they were scared to death and said:
1SA.4.7	The gods have come into their camp. Now we're in real trouble! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before. 
1SA.4.8	We're in big trouble! Who can save us from these powerful gods? They're the same gods who made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians in the desert.
1SA.4.9	Philistines, be brave and fight hard! If you don't, those Hebrews will rule us, just as we've been ruling them. Fight and don't be afraid.
1SA.4.10	The Philistines did fight. They killed 30,000 Israelite soldiers, and all the rest ran off to their homes. 
1SA.4.11	Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and the sacred chest was captured.
1SA.4.12	That same day a soldier from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefront to Shiloh. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show his sorrow. 
1SA.4.13	He went into town and told the news about the battle, and everyone started crying.
1SA.4.13	Eli was afraid that something might happen to the sacred chest. So he was sitting on his chair beside the road, just waiting. 
1SA.4.14+1SA.4.15	He was 98 years old and blind, but he could hear everyone crying, and he asked, “What's all that noise?”
1SA.4.14+1SA.4.15	The soldier hurried over and told Eli, 
1SA.4.16	“I escaped from the fighting today and ran here.”
1SA.4.16	“Young man, what happened?” Eli asked.
1SA.4.17	“Israel ran away from the Philistines,” the soldier answered. “Many of our people were killed, including your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. But worst of all, the sacred chest was captured.”
1SA.4.18	Eli was still sitting on a chair beside the wall of the town gate. And when the man said that the Philistines had taken the sacred chest, Eli fell backwards. He was a very heavy old man, and the fall broke his neck and killed him. He had been a leader
1SA.4.19	The wife of Phinehas was about to give birth. And soon after she heard that the sacred chest had been captured and that her husband and his father had died, her baby came. The birth was very hard, 
1SA.4.20	and she was dying. But the women taking care of her said, “Don't be afraid—it's a boy!”
1SA.4.20	She didn't pay any attention to them. 
1SA.4.21+1SA.4.22	Instead she kept thinking about losing her husband and her father-in-law. So she said, “My son will be named Ichabod,
1SA.5.1	The Philistines took the sacred chest from near Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	They brought it into the temple of their god Dagon and put it next to the statue of Dagon, which they worshiped.
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, they found the statue lying facedown on the floor in front of the sacred chest. They put the statue back where it belonged. 
1SA.5.4	But early the next morning, it had fallen over again and was lying facedown on the floor in front of the chest. The body of the statue was still in one piece, but its head and both hands had broken off and were lying on the stone floor in the doorway. 
1SA.5.5	This is why the priests and everyone else step over that part of the doorway when they enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod.
1SA.5.6	The 
1SA.5.7	Finally, they said, “The God of Israel did this. He is the one who caused all this trouble for us and our god Dagon. We've got to get rid of this chest.”
1SA.5.8	The people of Ashdod invited all the Philistine rulers to come to Ashdod, and they asked them, “What can we do with the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	“Send it to Gath,” the rulers answered. But after they took it there, 
1SA.5.9	the 
1SA.5.10	so they sent the sacred chest to Ekron. But before they could take it through the town gates, the people of Ekron started screaming, “They've brought the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel! It will kill us and our families too!”
1SA.5.11	The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them, “Send this chest back where it belongs. Then it won't kill us.”
1SA.5.11	Everyone was in a panic, because God was causing a lot of people to die, 
1SA.5.12	and those who had survived were suffering from the sores. They all cried to their gods for help.
1SA.6.1	After the sacred chest had been in Philistia for seven months,
1SA.6.2	the Philistines called in their priests and fortunetellers, and asked, “What should we do with this sacred chest? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs!”
1SA.6.3	“Don't send it back without a gift,” the priests and fortunetellers answered. “Send along something to Israel's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place. Then you will be healed, and you will find out why the 
1SA.6.4	“What should we send?” the Philistines asked.
1SA.6.4	The priests and fortunetellers answered:
1SA.6.4	There are five Philistine rulers, and they all have the same disease that you have. 
1SA.6.5	So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops. If you honor the God of Israel with this gift, maybe he will stop causing trouble for you and your gods and your crops. 
1SA.6.6	Don't be like the Egyptians and their king. They were stubborn, but when Israel's God was finished with them, they had to let Israel go.
1SA.6.7	Get a new cart and two cows that have young calves and that have never pulled a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take the calves back to their barn. 
1SA.6.8	Then put the chest on the cart. Put the gold rats and sores into a bag and put it on the cart next to the chest. Then send it on its way.
1SA.6.9	Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh. If it goes back to its own country, you will know that it was the 
1SA.6.10	The Philistines followed their advice. They hitched up the two cows to the cart, but they kept their calves in a barn. 
1SA.6.11	Then they put the chest on the cart, along with the bag that had the gold rats and sores in it.
1SA.6.12	The cows went straight up the road toward Beth-Shemesh, mooing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them until they got close to Beth-Shemesh.
1SA.6.13	The people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat
1SA.6.14+1SA.6.15	The cows left the road and pulled the cart into a field that belonged to Joshua from Beth-Shemesh, and they stopped beside a huge rock. Some men from the tribe of Levi were there. So they took the chest off the cart and placed it on the rock, and then they did the same thing with the bag of gold rats and sores. A few other people chopped up the cart and made a fire. They killed the cows and burned them as sacrifices to the 
1SA.6.16	When the five rulers of the Philistines saw what had happened, they went back to Ekron that same day.
1SA.6.17	That is how the Philistines sent gifts to the 
1SA.6.18	They also sent one gold rat for each walled town and for every village that the five Philistine rulers controlled. The huge stone
1SA.6.19	Some of the men of Beth-Shemesh looked inside the sacred chest, and the 
1SA.6.20	and they started saying, “No other God is like the 
1SA.6.21	They sent messengers to tell the people of Kiriath-Jearim, “The Philistines have sent back the sacred chest. Why don't you take it and keep it there with you?”
1SA.7.2	and it stayed there for 20 years.
1SA.7.2	During this time everyone in Israel was very sad and begged the 
1SA.7.3	One day, Samuel told all the people of Israel, “If you really want to turn back to the 
1SA.7.4	The people got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte and began worshiping only the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Tell everyone in Israel to meet together at Mizpah, and I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	The Israelites met together at Mizpah with Samuel as their leader. They drew water from the well and poured it out as an offering to the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistine rulers found out about the meeting at Mizpah, they sent an army there to attack the people of Israel.
1SA.7.7	The Israelites were afraid when they heard that the Philistines were coming. 
1SA.7.8	“Don't stop praying!” they told Samuel. “Ask the 
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel left Mizpah and went after them as far as the hillside below Beth-Car, killing every enemy soldier they caught.
1SA.7.12+1SA.7.13	The Philistines were so badly beaten that it was quite a while before they attacked Israel again. After the battle, Samuel set up a monument between Mizpah and the rocky cliffs. He named it “Help Monument”
1SA.7.12+1SA.7.13	For as long as Samuel lived, the 
1SA.7.14	The Israelites were even able to recapture their towns and territory between Ekron and Gath.
1SA.7.14	Israel was also at peace with the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel was a leader
1SA.7.16	Every year he would go around to the towns of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah where he served as judge for the people. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would go back to his home in Ramah and do the same thing there. He also had an altar built for the 
1SA.8.1+1SA.8.2	Samuel had two sons. The older one was Joel, and the younger one was Abijah. When Samuel was getting old, he let them be leaders at Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But they were not like their father. They were dishonest and accepted bribes to give unfair decisions.
1SA.8.4	One day the nation's leaders came to Samuel at Ramah 
1SA.8.5	 and said, “You are an old man. You set a good example for your sons, but they haven't followed it. Now we want a king to be our leader, just like all the other nations. Choose one for us!”
1SA.8.6	Samuel was upset to hear the leaders say they wanted a king, so he prayed about it. 
1SA.8.7	The 
1SA.8.7	Samuel, do everything they want you to do. I am really the one they have rejected as their king. 
1SA.8.8	Ever since the day I rescued my people from Egypt, they have turned from me to worship idols. Now they are turning away from you. 
1SA.8.9	Do everything they ask, but warn them and tell them how a king will treat them.
1SA.8.10	Samuel told the people who were asking for a king what the 
1SA.8.11	If you have a king, this is how he will treat you. He will force your sons to join his army. Some of them will ride in his chariots, some will serve in the cavalry, and others will run ahead of his own chariot.
1SA.8.12	Some of them will be officers in charge of 1,000 soldiers, and others will be in charge of 50. Still others will have to farm the king's land and harvest his crops, or make weapons and parts for his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	Your daughters will have to make perfume or do his cooking and baking.
1SA.8.14	The king will take your best fields, as well as your vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his own officials. 
1SA.8.15	He will also take a tenth of your grain and grapes and give it to his officers and officials.
1SA.8.16	The king will take your slaves and your best young men and your donkeys and make them do his work. 
1SA.8.17	He will also take a tenth of your sheep and goats. You will become the king's slaves, 
1SA.8.18	and you will finally cry out for the 
1SA.8.19+1SA.8.20	The people would not listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want to be like other nations. We want a king to rule us and lead us in battle.”
1SA.8.21	Samuel listened to them and then told the 
1SA.8.22	“Do what they want,” the 
1SA.8.22	Samuel told the people to go back to their homes.
1SA.9.1	Kish was a wealthy man who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. His father was Abiel, his grandfather was Zeror, his great-grandfather was Becorath, and his great-great-grandfather was Aphiah. 
1SA.9.2	Kish had a son named Saul, who was better looking and more than a head taller than anyone else in all Israel.
1SA.9.3	Kish owned some donkeys, but they had run off. So he told Saul, “Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.”
1SA.9.4	Saul and the servant went through the hill country of Ephraim and the territory of Shalishah, but they could not find the donkeys. Then they went through the territories of Shaalim and Benjamin, but still there was no sign of the donkeys. 
1SA.9.5	Finally they came to the territory where the clan of Zuph
1SA.9.6	“Wait!” the servant answered. “There's a man of God who lives in a town near here. He's amazing! Everything he says comes true. Let's talk to him. Maybe he can tell us where to look.”
1SA.9.7	Saul said, “How can we talk to the prophet when I don't have anything to give him? We don't even have any bread left in our sacks. What can we give him?”
1SA.9.8	“I have a small piece of silver,” the servant answered. “We can give him that, and then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys.”
1SA.9.9+1SA.9.10	“Great!” Saul replied. “Let's go to the man who can see visions!” He said this because in those days God would answer questions by giving visions to prophets.
1SA.9.9+1SA.9.10	Saul and his servant went to the town where the prophet lived. 
1SA.9.11	As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to get water,
1SA.9.12	“Yes, he is,” they replied. “He's in town today because there's going to be a sacrifice and a sacred meal at the place of worship. In fact, he's just ahead of you. Hurry 
1SA.9.13	and you should find him right inside the town gate. He's on his way out to the place of worship to eat with the invited guests. They can't start eating until he blesses the sacrifice. If you go now, you should find him.”
1SA.9.14	They went to the town, and just as they were going through the gate, Samuel was coming out on his way to the place of worship.
1SA.9.15	The day before Saul came, the 
1SA.9.16	“I've seen how my people are suffering, and I've heard their call for help. About this time tomorrow I'll send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin, who will rescue my people from the Philistines. I want you to pour olive oil
1SA.9.17	Samuel looked at Saul, and the 
1SA.9.18	Saul went over to Samuel in the gateway and said, “A man who can see visions lives here in town. Could you tell me the way to his house?”
1SA.9.19	“I am the one who sees visions!” Samuel answered. “Go on up to the place of worship. You will eat with me today, and in the morning I'll answer your questions. 
1SA.9.20	Don't worry about your donkeys that ran off three days ago. They've already been found. Everything of value in Israel now belongs to you and your family.”
1SA.9.21	“Why are you telling me this?” Saul asked. “I'm from Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my clan is the least important in the tribe.”
1SA.9.22	Samuel took Saul and his servant into the dining room at the place of worship. About 30 people were there for the dinner, but Samuel gave Saul and his servant the places of honor. 
1SA.9.23+1SA.9.24	Then Samuel told the cook, “I gave you the best piece of meat and told you to set it aside. Bring it here now.”
1SA.9.23+1SA.9.24	The cook brought the meat over and set it down in front of Saul. “This is for you,” Samuel told him. “Go ahead and eat it. I had this piece saved especially for you, and I invited these guests to eat with you.”
1SA.9.23+1SA.9.24	After Saul and Samuel had finished eating, 
1SA.9.25	they went down from the place of worship and back into town. A bed was set up for Saul on the flat roof
1SA.9.26	and Saul slept there.
1SA.9.26	About sunrise the next morning,
1SA.9.26	Saul got up. He and Samuel left together 
1SA.9.27	and had almost reached the edge of town when Samuel stopped and said, “Tell your servant go on. Stay here with me for a few minutes, and I'll tell you what God has told me.”
1SA.9.27	After the servant had gone,
1SA.10.1	Samuel took a small jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head. Then he kissed
1SA.10.1	The 
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you'll meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They'll tell you, “The donkeys you've been looking for have been found. Your father has forgotten about them, and now he's worrying about you! He's wondering how he can find you.”
1SA.10.3	Go on from there until you reach the big oak tree at Tabor, where you'll meet three men on their way to worship God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and the last one will be carrying a clay jar of wine. 
1SA.10.4	After they greet you, they'll give you two loaves of bread.
1SA.10.5	Next, go to Gibeah,
1SA.10.6	The Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	After these things happen, do whatever you think is right! God will help you.
1SA.10.8	Then go to Gilgal. I'll come a little later, so wait for me. It may even take a week for me to get there, but when I come, I'll offer sacrifices to please the 
1SA.10.9	As Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God made Saul feel like a different person. That same day, everything happened just as Samuel had said. 
1SA.10.10	When Saul arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. The Spirit of God suddenly took control of him,
1SA.10.11	Some people who had known Saul for a long time saw that he was speaking and behaving like a prophet. They said to each other, “What's happened? How can Saul be a prophet?”
1SA.10.13	After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the place of worship.
1SA.10.14	Later, Saul's uncle asked him, “Where have you been?”
1SA.10.14	Saul answered, “Looking for the donkeys. We couldn't find them, so we went to talk with Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	“And what did he tell you?” Saul's uncle asked.
1SA.10.16	Saul answered, “He told us the donkeys had been found.” But Saul didn't mention that Samuel had chosen him to be king.
1SA.10.17	Samuel sent messengers to tell the Israelites to come to Mizpah and meet with the 
1SA.10.18	When everyone had arrived, Samuel said:
1SA.10.18	The 
1SA.10.19	God has rescued you from your troubles and hard times. But you have rejected your God and have asked for a king. Now each tribe and clan must come near the place of worship so the 
1SA.10.20	Samuel brought each tribe, one after the other, to the altar, and the 
1SA.10.21	Next, Samuel brought each clan of Benjamin there, and the 
1SA.10.22	The people prayed, “Our 
1SA.10.22	“Yes,” the 
1SA.10.23	The people ran and got Saul and brought him into the middle of the crowd. He was more than a head taller than anyone else. 
1SA.10.24	“Look closely at the man the 
1SA.10.24	The crowd shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Samuel explained the rights and duties of a king and wrote them all in a book. He put the book in one of the shrines where the 
1SA.10.26	God had encouraged some young men to become followers of Saul, and when he returned to his hometown of Gibeah, they went with him. 
1SA.10.27	But some worthless fools said, “How can someone like Saul rescue us from our enemies?” They did not want Saul to be their king, and so they didn't bring him any gifts. But Saul kept calm.
1SA.11.1	About this time,
1SA.11.2	Nahash answered, “Sure, I'll sign a treaty! But not before I insult Israel by poking out the right eye of every man who lives in Jabesh.”
1SA.11.3	The town leaders said, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers everywhere in Israel to ask for help. If no one comes here to save us, we will surrender to you.”
1SA.11.4	Some of the messengers went to Gibeah, Saul's hometown. They told what was happening at Jabesh, and everyone in Gibeah started crying. 
1SA.11.5	Just then, Saul came in from the fields, walking behind his oxen.
1SA.11.5	“Why is everyone crying?” Saul asked.
1SA.11.5	They told him what the men from Jabesh had said. 
1SA.11.6	Then the Spirit of God suddenly took control of Saul and made him furious. 
1SA.11.7	Saul killed two of his oxen, cut them up in pieces, and gave the pieces to the
1SA.11.7	The 
1SA.11.8	at Bezek. Saul had them organized and counted. There were 300,000 from Israel and 30,000
1SA.11.9	Saul and his officers sent the messengers back to Jabesh with this promise: “We will rescue you tomorrow afternoon.” The messengers went back to the people at Jabesh and told them that they were going to be rescued.
1SA.11.9	Everyone was encouraged! 
1SA.11.10	So they told the Ammonites, “We will surrender to you tomorrow, and then you can do whatever you want to.”
1SA.11.11	The next day, Saul divided his army into three groups and attacked before daylight. They started killing Ammonites and kept it up until afternoon. A few Ammonites managed to escape, but they were scattered far from each other.
1SA.11.12	The Israelite soldiers went to Samuel and demanded, “Where are the men who said they didn't want Saul to be king? Bring them to us, and we will put them to death!”
1SA.11.13	“No you won't!” Saul told them. “The 
1SA.11.14	“Come on!” Samuel said. “Let's go to Gilgal and make an agreement that Saul will continue to be our king.”
1SA.11.15	Everyone went to the place of worship at Gilgal, where they agreed that Saul would be their king. Saul and the people sacrificed animals to ask for the 
1SA.12.1	Samuel told the Israelites:
1SA.12.1	I have given you a king, just as you asked. 
1SA.12.2	You have seen how I have led you ever since I was a young man. I'm already old. My hair is gray, and my own sons are grown. Now you must see how well your king will lead you.
1SA.12.4	“No,” the Israelites answered. “You've never cheated us in any way!”
1SA.12.5	Samuel said, “The 
1SA.12.5	“That's true,” they replied.
1SA.12.6	The 
1SA.12.7	Now the 
1SA.12.9	 But your ancestors forgot the 
1SA.12.12	 Then you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was going to attack you. And even though the 
1SA.12.13	You asked for a king, and you chose one. Now he stands here where all of you can see him. But it was really the 
1SA.12.14	If you and your king want to be followers of the 
1SA.12.15	If you're stubborn and refuse to obey the 
1SA.12.16	Just stand here and watch the 
1SA.12.17	Isn't this the dry season?
1SA.12.18	Samuel prayed, and that same day the 
1SA.12.19	They told Samuel, “Please, pray to the 
1SA.12.20	Samuel answered:
1SA.12.20	Even though what you did was wrong, you don't need to be afraid. But you must always follow the 
1SA.12.21	Don't worship idols! They don't have any power, and they can't help you or save you when you're in trouble. 
1SA.12.22	But the 
1SA.12.23	I would be disobeying the 
1SA.12.24	You also must obey the 
1SA.12.25	But if you and your king do evil, the 
1SA.13.1	Saul was a young man
1SA.13.2	Then
1SA.13.3	Jonathan led an attack on the Philistine army camp at Geba.
1SA.13.4	The messengers then said to the people of Israel, “Saul has destroyed the Philistine army camp at Geba.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines called their army together to fight Israel. They had 3,000
1SA.13.6	The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle. Some of the Israelite men hid in caves or in clumps of bushes,
1SA.13.7	Still others
1SA.13.7	Saul stayed at Gilgal. His soldiers were shaking with fear, 
1SA.13.8	 and they were starting to run off and leave him. Saul waited there seven days, just as Samuel had ordered him to do,
1SA.13.9	Finally, Saul commanded, “Bring me some animals, so we can offer sacrifices to please the 
1SA.13.9	Saul killed one of the animals, 
1SA.13.10	and just as he placed it on the altar, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to welcome him.
1SA.13.11	“What have you done?” Samuel asked.
1SA.13.11	Saul answered, “My soldiers were leaving in all directions, and you didn't come when you were supposed to. The Philistines were gathering at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	and I was worried that they would attack me here at Gilgal. I hadn't offered a sacrifice to ask for the 
1SA.13.13	“That was stupid!” Samuel said. “You didn't obey the 
1SA.13.14	 But no, you disobeyed, and so the 
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel left Gilgal.
1SA.13.15	Part of Saul's army had not deserted him, and he led them to Gibeah in Benjamin to join his other troops. Then he counted them
1SA.13.16	Saul, Jonathan, and their army set up camp at Geba in Benjamin.
1SA.13.16	The Philistine army was camped at Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	Each day they sent out patrols to attack and rob villages and then destroy them. One patrol would go north along the road to Ophrah in the region of Shual. 
1SA.13.18	Another patrol would go west along the road to Beth-Horon. A third patrol would go east toward the desert on the road to the ridge that overlooks Zeboim Valley.
1SA.13.19	The Philistines would not allow any Israelites to learn how to make iron tools. “If we allowed that,” they said, “those worthless Israelites would make swords and spears.”
1SA.13.20+1SA.13.21	Whenever the Israelites wanted to get an iron point put on a cattle prod,
1SA.13.22	So, whenever the Israelite soldiers had to go into battle, none of them had a sword or a spear except Saul and his son Jonathan.
1SA.13.23	The Philistines moved their camp to the pass at Michmash,
1SA.14.1+1SA.14.2+1SA.14.3	and Saul was in Geba
1SA.14.1+1SA.14.2+1SA.14.3	One day, Jonathan told the soldier who carried his weapons that he wanted to attack the Philistine camp on the other side of the valley. So they slipped out of the Israelite camp without anyone knowing it. Jonathan didn't even tell his father he was leaving.
1SA.14.4+1SA.14.5	Jonathan decided to get to the Philistine camp by going through the pass that led between Shiny Cliff and Michmash to the north and Thornbush Cliff
1SA.14.6	Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons talked as they went toward the Philistine camp. “It's just the two of us against all those godless men,” Jonathan said. “But the 
1SA.14.7	“Do whatever you want,” the soldier answered. “I'll be right there with you.”
1SA.14.8	“This is what we will do,” Jonathan said. “We will go across and let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they agree to come down the hill and fight where we are, then we won't climb up to their camp. 
1SA.14.10	But we will go if they tell us to come up the hill and fight. That will mean the 
1SA.14.11+1SA.14.12	Jonathan and the soldier stood at the bottom of the hill where the Philistines could see them. The Philistines said, “Look! Those worthless Israelites have crawled out of the holes where they've been hiding.” Then they yelled down to Jonathan and the soldier, “Come up here, and we will teach you a thing or two!”
1SA.14.11+1SA.14.12	Jonathan turned to the soldier and said, “Follow me! The 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan crawled up the hillside with the soldier right behind him. When they got to the top, Jonathan killed the Philistines who attacked from the front, and the soldier killed those who attacked from behind.
1SA.14.14	Before they had gone 30 meters,
1SA.14.15	The whole Philistine army panicked—those in camp, those on guard duty, those in the fields, and those on raiding patrols. All of them were afraid and confused. Then God sent an earthquake, and the ground began to tremble.
1SA.14.16	Saul's lookouts at Geba
1SA.14.17	Saul told his officers, “Call the roll and find out who left our camp.” When they had finished, they found out that Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons were missing.
1SA.14.18	At that time, Ahijah was serving as priest for the army of Israel, and Saul told him, “Come over here! Let's ask God what we should do.”
1SA.14.19	Just as Saul finished saying this, he could see that the Philistine army camp was getting more and more confused, and he said, “Ahijah, never mind!”
1SA.14.20	Saul quickly called his army together, then led them to the Philistine camp. By this time the Philistines were so confused that they were killing each other.
1SA.14.21	There were also some hired soldiers
1SA.14.22	Many Israelites had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim. And when they heard that the Philistines were running away, they came out of hiding and joined in chasing the Philistines.
1SA.14.23+1SA.14.24	So the 
1SA.14.23+1SA.14.24	Saul had earlier told his soldiers, “I want to get even with those Philistines by sunset. If any of you eat before then, you will be under a curse!” So he made them swear not to eat.
1SA.14.23+1SA.14.24	By the time the fighting moved past Beth-Aven,
1SA.14.25+1SA.14.26	The army and the people who lived nearby had gone into a forest, and they came to a place where honey was dripping on the ground.
1SA.14.27	Jonathan did not know about Saul's warning to the soldiers. So he dipped the end of his walking stick in the honey and ate some with his fingers. He felt stronger and more alert. 
1SA.14.28	Then a soldier told him, “Your father swore that anyone who ate food today would be put under a curse, and we agreed not to eat. That's why we're so weak.”
1SA.14.29	Jonathan said, “My father has caused you a lot of trouble. Look at me! I ate only a little of this honey, but already I feel strong and alert. 
1SA.14.30	I wish you had eaten some of the food the Philistines left behind. We would have been able to kill a lot more of them.”
1SA.14.31	By evening the Israelite army was exhausted from killing Philistines all the way from Michmash to Aijalon.
1SA.14.32	They grabbed the food they had captured from the Philistines and started eating. They even killed sheep and cows and calves right on the spot and ate the meat without draining the blood.
1SA.14.33	 Someone told Saul, “Look! The army is disobeying the 
1SA.14.33	“You're right,” Saul answered. “They are being unfaithful to the 
1SA.14.34	Then tell everyone in camp to bring their cattle and lambs to me. They can kill the animals on this rock,
1SA.14.34	That night the soldiers brought their cattle over to the big rock and killed them there. 
1SA.14.35	It was the first altar Saul had built for offering sacrifices to the 
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let's attack the Philistines again while it's still dark. We can fight them all night. Let's kill them and take everything they own!”
1SA.14.36	The people answered, “We will do whatever you want.”
1SA.14.36	“Wait!” Ahijah the priest said. “Let's ask God what we should do.”
1SA.14.37	Saul asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you help us win?”
1SA.14.37	This time God did not answer. 
1SA.14.38	Saul called his army officers together and said, “We have to find out what sin has kept God from answering. 
1SA.14.39	I swear by the living 
1SA.14.39	No one said a word.
1SA.14.40	Saul told his army, “You stand on that side of the priest, and Jonathan and I will stand on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	Everyone agreed.
1SA.14.41	The answer came back that Jonathan or Saul had sinned, not the army. 
1SA.14.42	Saul told Ahijah, “Now ask the 
1SA.14.42	The answer came back that Jonathan had sinned. 
1SA.14.43	“Jonathan,” Saul exclaimed, “tell me what you did!”
1SA.14.43	“I dipped the end of my walking stick in some honey and ate a little. Now you say I have to die!”
1SA.14.44	“Yes, Jonathan. I swear to God that you must die.”
1SA.14.45	“No!” the soldiers shouted. “God helped Jonathan win the battle for us. We won't let you kill him. We swear to the 
1SA.14.46	Saul stopped hunting down the Philistines, and they went home.
1SA.14.47+1SA.14.48	When Saul became king, the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, the Philistines, and the Amalekites had all been robbing the Israelites. Saul fought back against these enemies and stopped them from robbing Israel. He was a brave commander and always won his battles.
1SA.14.49+1SA.14.50+1SA.14.51	Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. They had three sons: Jonathan, Ishvi,
1SA.14.49+1SA.14.50+1SA.14.51	Abner, Saul's cousin, was the commander of the army. Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	Saul was at war with the Philistines for as long as he lived. Whenever he found a good warrior or a brave man, Saul made him join his army.
1SA.15.1	The 
1SA.15.2	 “When the Israelites were on their way out of Egypt, the nation of Amalek attacked them. I am the 
1SA.15.3	“Go and attack the Amalekites! Destroy them and all their possessions. Don't have any pity. Kill their men, women, children, and even their babies. Slaughter their cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.”
1SA.15.4	Saul sent messengers who told every town and village to send men to join the army at Telaim. There were 210,000 troops in all, and 10,000 of these were from Judah. Saul organized them, 
1SA.15.5	then led them to a valley near one of the towns in
1SA.15.6	Some Kenites lived nearby, and Saul told them, “Your people were kind to our nation when we left Egypt, and I don't want you to get killed when I wipe out the Amalekites. So stay away from them.”
1SA.15.6	The Kenites left, 
1SA.15.7	and Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah
1SA.15.8	Every Amalekite was killed except King Agag. 
1SA.15.9	Saul and his army let Agag live, and they also spared the best sheep and cattle. They didn't want to destroy anything of value, so they only killed the animals that were worthless or weak.
1SA.15.10	The 
1SA.15.11	“Saul has stopped obeying me, and I'm sorry that I made him king.”
1SA.15.11	Samuel was angry, and he cried out in prayer to the 
1SA.15.12	Early the next morning he went to talk with Saul. Someone told him, “Saul went to Carmel, where he had a monument built so everyone would remember his victory. Then he left for Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	Samuel finally caught up with Saul,
1SA.15.14	“Then why,” Samuel asked, “do I hear sheep and cattle?”
1SA.15.15	“The army took them from the Amalekites,” Saul explained. “They kept the best sheep and cattle, so they could sacrifice them to the 
1SA.15.16	“Stop!” Samuel said. “Let me tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	“All right,” Saul answered.
1SA.15.17	Samuel continued, “You may not think you're very important, but the 
1SA.15.18	When the 
1SA.15.19	Why didn't you listen to the 
1SA.15.20	“But I did listen to the 
1SA.15.21	All the animals were going to be destroyed
1SA.15.22	“Tell me,” Samuel said. “Does the 
1SA.15.23	Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshiping idols or asking them for advice. You refused to do what God told you, so God has decided that you can no longer be king.”
1SA.15.24	“I have sinned,” Saul admitted. “I disobeyed both you and the 
1SA.15.25	Please forgive me and come back with me so I can worship the 
1SA.15.26	“No!” Samuel replied, “You disobeyed the 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said, “The 
1SA.15.29	Besides, the eternal
1SA.15.30	Saul said, “I did sin, but please honor me in front of the leaders of the army and the people of Israel. Come back with me, so I can worship the 
1SA.15.31	Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel shouted, “Bring me King Agag of Amalek!”
1SA.15.32	Agag came in chains,
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said, “Agag, you have snatched children from their mothers' arms and killed them. Now your mother will be without children.” Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces at the place of worship in Gilgal.
1SA.15.34	Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his home in Gibeah. 
1SA.15.35	Even though Samuel felt sad about Saul, Samuel never saw him again.
1SA.15.35	The 
1SA.16.2	Samuel answered, “If I do that, Saul will find out and have me killed.”
1SA.16.2	“Take a calf with you,” the 
1SA.16.3	then invite Jesse to the sacrifice.
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	“Yes, it is!” Samuel answered. “I've come to offer a sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When Jesse and his sons arrived, Samuel noticed Jesse's oldest son, Eliab. “He has to be the one the 
1SA.16.8	Jesse told his son Abinadab to go over to Samuel, but Samuel said, “No, the 
1SA.16.9	Next, Jesse sent his son Shammah to him, and Samuel said, “The 
1SA.16.10	One by one, Jesse told all seven of his sons to go over to Samuel. Finally, Samuel said, “Jesse, the 
1SA.16.11	 Do you have any other sons?”
1SA.16.11	“Yes,” Jesse answered. “My youngest son David is out taking care of the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	“Send for him!” Samuel said. “We won't start the ceremony until he gets here.”
1SA.16.12	Jesse sent for David. He was a healthy, good-looking boy with a sparkle in his eyes. As soon as David came, the 
1SA.16.13	Samuel poured the oil on David's head while his brothers watched. At that moment, the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.13	Samuel returned home to Ramah.
1SA.16.14	The Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	“It's an evil spirit from God that's frightening you,” Saul's officials told him. 
1SA.16.16	“Your Majesty, let us go and look for someone who is good at playing the harp. He can play for you whenever the evil spirit from God bothers you, and you'll feel better.”
1SA.16.17	“All right,” Saul answered. “Find me someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him here.”
1SA.16.18	“A man named Jesse who lives in Bethlehem has a son who can play the harp,” one official said. “He's a brave warrior, he's good-looking, he can speak well, and the 
1SA.16.19	Saul sent a message to Jesse: “Tell your son David to leave your sheep and come here to me.”
1SA.16.20	Jesse loaded a donkey with bread and a goatskin full of wine,
1SA.16.21	David went to Saul and started working for him. Saul liked him so much that he put David in charge of carrying his weapons. 
1SA.16.22	Not long after this, Saul sent another message to Jesse: “I really like David. Please let him stay with me.”
1SA.17.1	The Philistines got ready for war and brought their troops together to attack the town of Socoh in Judah. They set up camp at Ephes-Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.
1SA.17.2+1SA.17.3	King Saul and the Israelite army set up camp on a hill overlooking Elah Valley, and they got ready to fight the Philistine army that was on a hill on the other side of the valley.
1SA.17.4	The Philistine army had a hero named Goliath who was from the town of Gath and was about three meters
1SA.17.5+1SA.17.6	He wore a bronze helmet and had bronze armor to protect his chest and legs. The chest armor alone weighed about 57 kilograms. He carried a bronze sword strapped on his back, 
1SA.17.7	and his spear was so big that the iron spearhead alone weighed about seven kilograms. A soldier always walked in front of Goliath to carry his shield.
1SA.17.8	Goliath went out and shouted to the army of Israel:
1SA.17.8	Why are you lining up for battle? I'm the best soldier in our army, and all of you are in Saul's army. Choose your best soldier to come out and fight me! 
1SA.17.9	If he can kill me, our people will be your slaves. But if I kill him, your people will be our slaves. 
1SA.17.10	Here and now I challenge Israel's whole army! Choose someone to fight me!
1SA.17.11	Saul and his men heard what Goliath said, but they were so frightened of Goliath that they couldn't do a thing.
1SA.17.12	David's father Jesse was an old man, who belonged to the Ephrath clan and lived in Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons: 
1SA.17.13+1SA.17.14	the oldest was Eliab, the next was Abinadab, and Shammah was the third. The three of them had gone off to fight in Saul's army.
1SA.17.13+1SA.17.14	David was Jesse's youngest son. 
1SA.17.15	 He took care of his father's sheep, and he went back and forth between Bethlehem and Saul's camp.
1SA.17.16	Goliath came out and gave his challenge every morning and every evening for 40 days.
1SA.17.17	One day, Jesse told David, “Hurry and take this sack of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers at the army camp. 
1SA.17.18	And here are ten large chunks of cheese to take to their commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are doing and bring back something that shows that they're all right. 
1SA.17.19	They're with Saul's army, fighting the Philistines in Elah Valley.”
1SA.17.20	David obeyed his father. He got up early the next morning and left someone else in charge of the sheep; then he loaded the supplies and started off. He reached the army camp just as the soldiers were taking their places and shouting the battle cry. 
1SA.17.21	The army of Israel and the Philistine army stood there facing each other.
1SA.17.22	David left his things with the man in charge of supplies and ran up to the battle line to ask his brothers if they were well. 
1SA.17.23	While David was talking with them, Goliath came out from the line of Philistines and started boasting as usual. David heard him.
1SA.17.24	When the Israelite soldiers saw Goliath, they were scared and ran off. 
1SA.17.25	They said to each other, “Look how he keeps coming out to insult us. The king is offering a big reward to the man who kills Goliath. That man will even get to marry the king's daughter, and no one in his family will ever have to pay taxes again.”
1SA.17.26	David asked some soldiers standing nearby, “What will a man get for killing this Philistine and stopping him from insulting our people? Who does that worthless Philistine think he is? He's making fun of the army of the living God!”
1SA.17.27	The soldiers told David what the king would give the man who killed Goliath.
1SA.17.28	David's oldest brother Eliab heard him talking with the soldiers. Eliab was angry with him and said, “What are you doing here, anyway? Who's taking care of your little flock of sheep out in the desert? You spoiled brat! You came here just to watch the fighting, didn't you?”
1SA.17.29	“Now what have I done?” David answered. “Can't I even ask a question?” 
1SA.17.30	Then he turned and asked another soldier the same thing he had asked the others, and he got the same answer.
1SA.17.31	Some soldiers overheard David talking, so they told Saul what David had said. Saul sent for David, and David came. 
1SA.17.32	“Your Majesty,” he said, “this Philistine shouldn't turn us into cowards. I'll go out and fight him myself!”
1SA.17.33	“You don't have a chance against him,” Saul replied. “You're only a boy, and he's been a soldier all his life.”
1SA.17.34	But David told him:
1SA.17.34	Your Majesty, I take care of my father's sheep. And when one of them is dragged off by a lion or a bear, 
1SA.17.35	I go after it and beat the wild animal until it lets the sheep go. If the wild animal turns and attacks me, I grab it by the throat and kill it.
1SA.17.36	Sir, I have killed lions and bears that way, and I can kill this worthless Philistine. He shouldn't have made fun of the army of the living God! 
1SA.17.37	The 
1SA.17.37	“All right,” Saul answered, “go ahead and fight him. And I hope the 
1SA.17.38	Saul had his own military clothes and armor put on David, and he gave David a bronze helmet to wear. 
1SA.17.39	David strapped on a sword and tried to walk around, but he was not used to wearing those things.
1SA.17.39	“I can't move with all this stuff on,” David said. “I'm just not used to it.”
1SA.17.39	David took off the armor 
1SA.17.40	and picked up his shepherd's stick. He went out to a stream and picked up five smooth rocks and put them in his leather bag. Then with his sling in his hand, he went straight toward Goliath.
1SA.17.41	Goliath came toward David, walking behind the soldier who was carrying his shield. 
1SA.17.42	When Goliath saw that David was just a healthy, good-looking boy, he made fun of him. 
1SA.17.43	 “Do you think I'm a dog?” Goliath asked. “Is that why you've come after me with a stick?” He cursed David in the name of the Philistine gods 
1SA.17.44	and shouted, “Come on! When I'm finished with you, I'll feed you to the birds and wild animals!”
1SA.17.45	David answered:
1SA.17.45	You've come out to fight me with a sword and a spear and a dagger. But I've come out to fight you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	Today the 
1SA.17.47	Everybody here will see that the 
1SA.17.48	When Goliath started forward, David ran toward him. 
1SA.17.49	He put a rock in his sling and swung the sling around by its straps. When he let go of one strap, the rock flew out and hit Goliath on the forehead. It cracked his skull, and he fell facedown on the ground. 
1SA.17.50	 David defeated Goliath with a sling and a rock. He killed him without even using a sword.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw what had happened to their hero, they started running away. 
1SA.17.52	But the soldiers of Israel and Judah let out a battle cry and went after them as far as Gath
1SA.17.53	When the Israelite army returned from chasing the Philistines, they took what they wanted from the enemy camp. 
1SA.17.54	David took Goliath's head to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath's weapons in his own tent.
1SA.17.55	After King Saul had watched David go out to fight Goliath, Saul turned to the commander of his army and said, “Abner, who is that young man?”
1SA.17.55	“Your Majesty,” Abner answered, “I swear by your life that I don't know.”
1SA.17.56	“Then find out!” Saul told him.
1SA.17.57	When David came back from fighting Goliath, he was still carrying Goliath's head.
1SA.17.57	Abner took David to Saul, 
1SA.17.58	and Saul asked, “Who are you?”
1SA.17.58	“I am David the son of Jesse, a loyal Israelite from Bethlehem.”
1SA.18.1	David and Saul finished talking, and soon David and Jonathan
1SA.18.2	From that time on, Saul kept David in his service and would not let David go back to his own family.
1SA.18.3	Jonathan liked David so much that they promised to always be loyal friends. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan took off the robe that he was wearing and gave it to David. He also gave him his military clothes,
1SA.18.5	David was a success in everything that Saul sent him to do, and Saul made him a high officer in his army. That pleased everyone, including Saul's other officers.
1SA.18.6	David had killed Goliath, the battle was over, and the Israelite army set out for home. As the army went along, women came out of each Israelite town to welcome King Saul. They were celebrating by singing songs and dancing to the music of tambourines and harps. 
1SA.18.7	 They sang:
1SA.18.7	Saul has killed
1SA.18.7	a thousand enemies;
1SA.18.7	David has killed
1SA.18.7	ten thousand!
1SA.18.8	This song made Saul very angry, and he thought, “They are saying that David has killed ten times more enemies than I ever did. Next they will want to make him king.” 
1SA.18.9	Saul never again trusted David.
1SA.18.10	The next day the 
1SA.18.11	Saul thought, “I'll pin David to the wall.” He threw the spear at David twice, but David dodged and got away both times.
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	Saul put David in charge of 1,000 soldiers and sent him out to fight. 
1SA.18.14	The 
1SA.18.15	This made Saul even more afraid of David. 
1SA.18.16	But everyone else in Judah and Israel was loyal to
1SA.18.17	One day, Saul told David, “If you'll be brave and fight the 
1SA.18.18	David answered, “How could I possibly marry your daughter? I'm not very important, and neither is my family.”
1SA.18.19	But when the time came for David to marry Saul's daughter Merab, Saul told her to marry Adriel from the town of Meholah.
1SA.18.20	Saul had another daughter. Her name was Michal, and Saul found out that she was in love with David. This made Saul happy, 
1SA.18.21	and he thought, “I'll tell David he can marry Michal, but I'll set it up so that the Philistines will kill him.” He told David, “I'm going to give you a second chance to marry one of my daughters.”
1SA.18.22+1SA.18.23	Saul ordered his officials to speak to David in private, so they went to David and said, “Look, the king likes you, and all of his officials are loyal to you. Why not ask the king if you can marry his daughter Michal?”
1SA.18.22+1SA.18.23	“I'm not rich
1SA.18.24	The officials went back to Saul and told him exactly what David had said. 
1SA.18.25	Saul was hoping that the Philistines would kill David, and he told his officials to tell David, “The king doesn't want any silver or gold. He only wants to get even with his enemies. All you have to do is to bring back proof that you have killed 100 Philistines!”
1SA.18.26	The officials told David, and David wanted to marry the princess.
1SA.18.26	King Saul had set a time limit, and before it ran out, 
1SA.18.27	David and his men left and killed 200 Philistines. David brought back the proof that Saul had demanded and showed it to him, so he could marry Michal. Saul agreed to let David marry Michal. 
1SA.18.28	King Saul knew that she loved David,
1SA.18.29	But knowing those things made Saul even more afraid of David, and he was David's enemy for the rest of his life.
1SA.18.30	The Philistine rulers kept coming to fight Israel, but whenever David fought them, he won. He was famous because he won more battles against the Philistines than any of Saul's other officers.
1SA.19.1	One day, Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan and David were best friends, 
1SA.19.2+1SA.19.3	and he warned David, “My father is trying to have you killed, so be very careful. Hide in a field tomorrow morning, and I'll bring him there. Then I'll talk to him about you, and if I find out anything, I'll let you know.”
1SA.19.4+1SA.19.5	The next morning, Jonathan reminded Saul about the many good things David had done for him. Then he said, “Why do you want to kill David? He hasn't done anything to you. He has served in your army and has always done what's best for you. He even risked his life to kill Goliath. The 
1SA.19.6	Saul agreed and promised, “I swear by the living 
1SA.19.7	Jonathan went to David and told him what Saul had said. Then he brought David to Saul, and David served in Saul's army just as he had done before.
1SA.19.8	The next time there was a war with the Philistines, David fought hard and forced them to retreat.
1SA.19.9+1SA.19.10	One night, David was in Saul's home, playing the harp for him. Saul was sitting there, holding a spear, when an evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.11	Michal, David's wife, told him, “If you don't escape tonight, they'll kill you tomorrow!” 
1SA.19.12	She helped David leave through a window and climb down to the ground.
1SA.19.13	Michal put a statue in his bed. She put goat hair on its head and dressed it in some of David's clothes.
1SA.19.14	The next morning, Saul sent guards to arrest David. But Michal told them, “David is sick.”
1SA.19.15	Saul sent the guards back and told them, “Bring David to me—bed and all—so I can kill him.”
1SA.19.16	When the guards went in, all they found in the bed was the statue with the goat hair on its head.
1SA.19.17	“Why have you tricked me this way?” Saul asked Michal. “You helped my enemy get away!”
1SA.19.17	She answered, “He said he would kill me if I didn't help him escape!”
1SA.19.18	Meanwhile, David went to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done. Then Samuel and David went to Prophets Village
1SA.19.19	Someone told Saul, “David is at Prophets Village in Ramah.”
1SA.19.20	Saul sent a few soldiers to bring David back. They went to Ramah and found Samuel in charge of a group of prophets who were all prophesying. Then the Spirit of God took control of the soldiers and they started prophesying too.
1SA.19.21	When Saul heard what had happened, he sent some more soldiers, but they prophesied just like the first group. He sent a third group of soldiers, but the same thing happened to them. 
1SA.19.22	Finally, Saul left for Ramah himself. He went as far as the deep pit
1SA.19.22	“At Prophets Village in Ramah,” the people answered.
1SA.19.23	Saul left for Ramah. But as he walked along, the Spirit of God took control of him, and he started prophesying. Then, when he reached Prophets Village, 
1SA.19.24	 he stripped off his clothes and prophesied in front of Samuel. He dropped to the ground and lay there naked all that day and night. That's how the saying started, “Is Saul now a prophet?”
1SA.20.1	David escaped from Prophets Village. Then he ran to see Jonathan and asked, “Why does your father Saul want to kill me? What have I done wrong?”
1SA.20.2	“My father can't be trying to kill you! He never does anything without telling me about it. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true!”
1SA.20.3	“Jonathan, I swear it's true! But your father knows how much you like me, and he didn't want to break your heart. That's why he didn't tell you. I swear by the living 
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said, “Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.”
1SA.20.5	Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival,
1SA.20.6	If Saul wonders where I am, tell him, “David asked me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem, so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year.”
1SA.20.7	If your father says it's all right, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he wants to harm me. 
1SA.20.8	Be kind to me. After all, it was your idea to promise the 
1SA.20.9	“Don't worry,” Jonathan said. “If I find out that my father wants to kill you, I'll certainly let you know.”
1SA.20.10	“How will you do that?” David asked.
1SA.20.11	“Let's go out to this field, and I'll tell you,” Jonathan answered.
1SA.20.11	When they got there, 
1SA.20.12	Jonathan said:
1SA.20.12	I swear by the 
1SA.20.13	But if he wants to harm you, I promise to tell you and help you escape. And I ask the 
1SA.20.13	I pray that the 
1SA.20.14+1SA.20.15	 Someday the 
1SA.20.16	Jonathan and David made an agreement that even David's descendants would have to keep.
1SA.20.17	Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself, so he asked David to promise once more that he would be a loyal friend. 
1SA.20.18	After this Jonathan said:
1SA.20.18	Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, and people will wonder where you are, because your place at the table will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	By the day after tomorrow, everyone will think you've been gone a long time.
1SA.20.20	I'll shoot three arrows at a target off to the side of the rock, 
1SA.20.21	and send my servant to find the arrows.
1SA.20.21	You'll know if it's safe to come out by what I tell him. If it is safe, I swear by the living 
1SA.20.22	But if it isn't safe, I'll say to the boy, “The arrows are farther away!” This will mean that the 
1SA.20.23	But he will always watch us to make sure that we keep the promise we made to each other.
1SA.20.24	So David hid there in the field.
1SA.20.24	During the New Moon Festival, Saul sat down to eat 
1SA.20.25	by the wall, just as he always did. Jonathan sat across from him,
1SA.20.26	Saul didn't say anything that day, because he was thinking, “Something must have happened to make David unfit to be at the Festival.
1SA.20.27	The day after the New Moon Festival, when David's place was still empty, Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn't that son of Jesse come to eat with us? He wasn't here yesterday, and he still isn't here today!”
1SA.20.28+1SA.20.29	Jonathan answered, “The reason David hasn't come to eat with you is that he begged me to let him go to Bethlehem. He said, ‘Please let me go. My family is offering a sacrifice, and my brother told me I have to be there. Do me this favor and let me slip away to see my brothers.’ ”
1SA.20.30	Saul was furious with Jonathan and yelled, “You're no son of mine, you traitor! I know you've chosen to be loyal to that son of Jesse. You should be ashamed of yourself! And your own mother should be ashamed that you were ever born. 
1SA.20.31	You'll never be safe, and your kingdom will be in danger as long as that son of Jesse is alive. Turn him over to me now! He deserves to die!”
1SA.20.32	“Why do you want to kill David?” Jonathan asked. “What has he done?”
1SA.20.33	Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him. Then Jonathan was sure that his father really did want to kill David. 
1SA.20.34	Jonathan was angry and hurt that his father had insulted David
1SA.20.35	In the morning, Jonathan went out to the field to meet David. He took a servant boy along 
1SA.20.36	and told him, “When I shoot the arrows, you run and find them for me.”
1SA.20.36	The boy started running, and Jonathan shot an arrow so that it would go beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy got near the place where the arrow had landed, Jonathan shouted, “Isn't the arrow on past you?” 
1SA.20.38	Jonathan shouted to him again, “Hurry up! Don't stop!”
1SA.20.38	The boy picked up the arrows and brought them back to Jonathan, 
1SA.20.39	but he had no idea about what was going on. Only Jonathan and David knew. 
1SA.20.40	Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him, “Take these back into town.”
1SA.20.41	After the boy had gone, David got up from beside the mound
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said, “Take care of yourself. And remember, we each have asked the 
1SA.20.42	David left and Jonathan went back to town.
1SA.21.2	“I'm on a mission for King Saul,” David answered. “He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about, so I ordered my soldiers to stay somewhere else. 
1SA.21.3	Do you have any food you can give me? Could you spare five loaves of bread?”
1SA.21.4	“The only bread I have is the sacred bread,” the priest told David. “You can have it if your soldiers didn't sleep with women last night.”
1SA.21.5	“Of course we didn't sleep with women,” David answered. “I never let my men do that when we're on a mission. They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we're on a regular mission, and today we're on a special mission.”
1SA.21.7	It so happened that one of Saul's officers was there, worshiping the 
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword? I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I didn't bring along my sword or any other weapons.”
1SA.21.9	“It's the best sword there is,” David said. “I'll take it!”
1SA.21.10	David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath,
1SA.21.11	 The officers of King Achish were also there, and they asked Achish, “Isn't David a king back in his own country? Don't the Israelites dance and sing,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has killed
1SA.21.11	a thousand enemies;
1SA.21.11	David has killed
1SA.21.11	ten thousand’?”
1SA.21.13	 So right there in front of everyone, he pretended to be insane. He acted confused and started making scratches on the doors of the town gate, while drooling in his beard.
1SA.21.14	“Look at him!” Achish said to his officers. “You can see he's crazy. Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	I have enough crazy people without your bringing another one here. Keep him away from my palace!”
1SA.22.2	A lot of other people joined him too. Some were in trouble, others were angry or in debt, and David was soon the leader of 400 men.
1SA.22.3	David left Adullam Cave and went to the town of Mizpeh in Moab, where he talked with the king of Moab. “Please,” David said, “let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do with me.” 
1SA.22.4	So he brought his parents to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him while David was in hiding.
1SA.22.5	One day the prophet Gad told David, “Don't stay here! Go back to Judah.” David then left and went to Hereth Forest.
1SA.22.6	Saul was sitting under a small tree on top of the hill at Gibeah when he heard that David and his men had been located. Saul was holding his spear, and his officers were standing in front of him. 
1SA.22.7	He told them:
1SA.22.7	Listen to me! You belong to the Benjamin tribe,
1SA.22.8	But you're all plotting against me! Not one of you told me that my own son Jonathan had made an agreement with him. Not one of you cared enough to tell me that Jonathan had helped one of my officers
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech talked to the 
1SA.22.11	Saul sent a message to Ahimelech and his whole family of priests at Nob, ordering them to come to him. When they came, 
1SA.22.12	Saul told them, “Listen to me, you son of Ahitub.”
1SA.22.12	“Certainly, Your Majesty,” Ahimelech answered.
1SA.22.13	Saul demanded, “Why did you plot against me with that son of Jesse? You helped him rebel against me by giving him food and a sword, and by talking with God for him. Now he's trying to ambush me!”
1SA.22.14	“Your Majesty, none of your officers is more loyal than David!” Ahimelech replied. “He's your son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguard. Everyone in your family respects him. 
1SA.22.15	This isn't the first time I've talked with God for David, and it's never made you angry before! Please don't accuse me or my family like this. I have no idea what's going on!”
1SA.22.16	“Ahimelech,” Saul said, “you and your whole family are going to die.”
1SA.22.17	Saul shouted to his bodyguards, “These priests of the 
1SA.22.17	But the king's officers would not attack the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	Saul turned to Doeg, who was from Edom, and said, “Kill the priests!”
1SA.22.18	On that same day, Doeg killed 85 priests. 
1SA.22.19	Then he attacked the town of Nob, where the priests had lived, and he killed everyone there—men, women, children, and babies. He even killed their cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
1SA.22.20	Ahimelech's son Abiathar was the only one who escaped. He ran to David 
1SA.22.21	and told him, “Saul has murdered the 
1SA.22.22	David answered, “That day when I saw Doeg, I knew he would tell Saul! Your family died because of me. 
1SA.22.23	Stay here. Isn't the same person trying to kill both of us? Don't worry! You'll be safe here with me.”
1SA.23.1	One day some people told David, “The Philistines keep attacking the town of Keilah and stealing grain from the threshing place.”
1SA.23.2	David asked the 
1SA.23.2	“Yes,” the 
1SA.23.3	But David's men said, “Look, even here in Judah we're afraid of the Philistines. We will be terrified if we try to fight them at Keilah!”
1SA.23.4	David asked the 
1SA.23.5	David and his men went there and fiercely attacked the Philistines. They killed many of them, then led away their cattle, and rescued the people of Keilah.
1SA.23.6+1SA.23.7+1SA.23.8	Meanwhile, Saul heard that David was in Keilah. “God has let me catch David,” Saul said. “David is trapped inside a walled town where the gates can be locked.” Saul decided to go there and surround the town, in order to trap David and his men. He sent messengers who told the towns and villages, “Send men to serve in Saul's army!”
1SA.23.6+1SA.23.7+1SA.23.8	By this time, Abiathar had joined David in Keilah and had brought along everything he needed to get answers from God.
1SA.23.9	David heard about Saul's plan to capture him, and he told Abiathar, “Let's ask God what we should do.”
1SA.23.10	David prayed, “
1SA.23.11	Would the leaders of Keilah turn me over to Saul? Or is he really coming? Please tell me, 
1SA.23.11	“Yes, he will come,” the 
1SA.23.12	David asked, “Would the leaders of Keilah hand me and my soldiers over to Saul?”
1SA.23.12	“Yes, they would,” the 
1SA.23.13	David and his 600 men got out of there fast and started moving from place to place. Saul heard that David had left Keilah, and he decided not to go after him.
1SA.23.14	David stayed in hideouts in the hill country of Ziph Desert. Saul kept searching, but God never let Saul catch him.
1SA.23.15	One time, David was at Horesh in Ziph Desert. He was afraid because
1SA.23.16	But Jonathan went to see David, and God helped him encourage David. 
1SA.23.17	“Don't be afraid,” Jonathan said. “My father Saul will never get his hands on you. In fact, you're going to be the next king of Israel, and I'll be your highest official. Even my father knows it's true.”
1SA.23.20	If you come, we will help you catch him.”
1SA.23.21	Saul told them:
1SA.23.21	You've done me a big favor, and I pray that the 
1SA.23.22	Now please do just a little more for me. Find out exactly where David is, as well as where he goes, and who has seen him there. I've been told that he's very tricky. 
1SA.23.23	Find out where all his hiding places are and come back when you're sure. Then I'll go with you. If he is still in the area, or anywhere among the clans of Judah, I'll find him.
1SA.23.24	The people from Ziph went back ahead of Saul, and they found out that David and his men were still south of Jeshimon in the Maon Desert. 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his army set out to find David. But David heard that Saul was coming, and he went to a place called The Rock, one of his hideouts in Maon Desert.
1SA.23.25	Saul found out where David was and started closing in on him. 
1SA.23.26	Saul was going around a hill on one side, and David and his men were on the other side, trying to get away. Saul and his soldiers were just about to capture David and his men, 
1SA.23.27	when a messenger came to Saul and said, “Come quickly! The Philistines are attacking Israel and taking everything.”
1SA.23.28	Saul stopped going after David and went back to fight the Philistines. That's why the place is called “Escape Rock.”
1SA.23.29	David left and went to live in the hideouts at En-Gedi.
1SA.24.1	When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines, he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi. 
1SA.24.2	Saul led 3,000 of Israel's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi. 
1SA.24.3	 There were some sheep pens along the side of the road, and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave. Saul went into the cave to relieve himself.
1SA.24.3	David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	They whispered to David, “The 
1SA.24.4	David sneaked over and cut off a small piece
1SA.24.5	Afterwards, David was sorry that he had even done that, 
1SA.24.6+1SA.24.7	 and he told his men, “Stop talking foolishly. We're not going to attack Saul. He's my king, and I pray that the 
1SA.24.6+1SA.24.7	Saul left the cave and started down the road. 
1SA.24.8	Soon, David also got up and left the cave. “Your Majesty!” he shouted from a distance.
1SA.24.8	Saul turned around to look. David bowed down very low 
1SA.24.9	and said:
1SA.24.9	Your Majesty, why do you listen to people who say that I'm trying to harm you? 
1SA.24.10	You can see for yourself that the 
1SA.24.11	Your Majesty, look at what I'm holding. You can see that it's a piece of your robe. If I could cut off a piece of your robe, I could have killed you. But I let you live, and that should prove I'm not trying to harm you or to rebel. I haven't done anything to you, and yet you keep trying to ambush and kill me.
1SA.24.12	I'll let the 
1SA.24.13	An old proverb says, “Only evil people do evil things,” and so I won't harm you.
1SA.24.15	I pray that the 
1SA.24.16	“David, my son—is that you?” Saul asked. Then he started crying 
1SA.24.17	and said:
1SA.24.17	David, you're a better person than I am. You treated me with kindness, even though I've been cruel to you. 
1SA.24.18	You've told me how you were kind enough not to kill me when the 
1SA.24.19	If you really were my enemy, you wouldn't have let me leave here alive. I pray that the 
1SA.24.20	I realize now that you will be the next king, and a powerful king at that. 
1SA.24.21	Promise me with the 
1SA.24.22	So David promised, and Saul went home. David and his men returned to their hideout.
1SA.25.1	Samuel died, and people from all over Israel gathered to mourn for him when he was buried at his home
1SA.25.2+1SA.25.3	Nabal was a very rich man who lived in Maon. He owned 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, which he kept at Carmel.
1SA.25.4	One day, Nabal was in Carmel where his servants were cutting the wool from his sheep. David was in the desert when he heard about it. 
1SA.25.5+1SA.25.6	So he sent ten men to Carmel with this message for Nabal:
1SA.25.5+1SA.25.6	I hope that you and your family are healthy and that all is going well for you. 
1SA.25.7	I've heard that you are cutting the wool from your sheep.
1SA.25.7	When your shepherds were with us in Carmel, we didn't harm them, and nothing was ever stolen from them. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your shepherds, and they'll tell you the same thing.
1SA.25.8	My servants are your servants, and you are like a father to me. This is a day for celebrating,
1SA.25.9	David's men went to Nabal and gave him David's message, then they waited for Nabal's answer.
1SA.25.10	This is what he said:
1SA.25.10	Who does this David think he is? That son of Jesse is just one more slave on the run from his master, and there are too many of them these days. 
1SA.25.11	What makes you think I would take my bread, my water, and the meat that I've had cooked for my own servants
1SA.25.12	The men returned to their camp and told David everything Nabal had said.
1SA.25.13	“Everybody get your swords!” David ordered.
1SA.25.13	They all strapped on their swords. Two hundred men stayed behind to guard the camp, but the other 400 followed David.
1SA.25.14+1SA.25.15+1SA.25.16	Meanwhile, one of Nabal's servants told Abigail:
1SA.25.14+1SA.25.15+1SA.25.16	David's men were often nearby while we were taking care of the sheep in the fields. They were very good to us, they never hurt us, and nothing was ever stolen from us while they were nearby. With them around day or night, we were as safe as we would have been inside a walled city.
1SA.25.14+1SA.25.15+1SA.25.16	David sent some messengers from the desert to wish our master well, but he shouted insults at them. 
1SA.25.17	He's a bully who won't listen to anyone.
1SA.25.17	Isn't there something you can do? Please think of something! Or else our master and his family and everyone who works for him are all doomed.
1SA.25.18	Abigail quickly got together 200 loaves of bread, two large clay jars of wine, the meat from five sheep, a large sack of roasted grain, 100 handfuls of raisins, and 200 handfuls of dried figs. She loaded all the food on donkeys 
1SA.25.19	and told her servants, “Take this on ahead, and I'll catch up with you.” She didn't tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.
1SA.25.20	Abigail was riding her donkey on the path that led around the hillside, when suddenly she met David and his men heading straight at her.
1SA.25.21	David had just been saying, “I surely wasted my time guarding Nabal's things in the desert and keeping them from being stolen! I was good to him, and now he pays me back with insults. 
1SA.25.22	I swear that by morning, there won't be a man or boy left from his family or his servants' families. I pray that God will punish me
1SA.25.23	Abigail quickly got off her donkey and bowed down in front of David. 
1SA.25.24	Then she said:
1SA.25.24	Sir, please let me explain! 
1SA.25.25	Don't pay any attention to that good-for-nothing Nabal. His name means “fool,” and it really fits him!
1SA.25.25	I didn't see the men you sent, 
1SA.25.26+1SA.25.27	but please take this gift of food that I've brought and share it with your followers. The 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive me if I say a little more. The 
1SA.25.29	The 
1SA.25.30	The 
1SA.25.31	and now your conscience will be clear, because you won't be guilty of taking revenge and killing innocent people.
1SA.25.31	When the 
1SA.25.32	David told her:
1SA.25.32	I praise the 
1SA.25.33	And you should also be praised. Your good sense kept me from taking revenge and killing innocent people. 
1SA.25.34	If you hadn't come to meet me so quickly, every man and boy in Nabal's family and in his servants' families would have been killed by morning. I swear by the living 
1SA.25.35	David accepted the food Abigail had brought. “Don't worry,” he said. “You can go home now. I'll do what you asked.”
1SA.25.36	Abigail went back home and found Nabal throwing a party fit for a king. He was very drunk and feeling good, so she didn't tell him anything that night. 
1SA.25.37	But when he sobered up the next morning, Abigail told him everything that had happened. Nabal had a heart attack, and he lay in bed as still as a stone. 
1SA.25.38	Ten days later, the 
1SA.25.39+1SA.25.40	David heard that Nabal had died. “I praise the 
1SA.25.39+1SA.25.40	Abigail was still at Carmel. So David sent messengers to ask her if she would marry him.
1SA.25.41	She bowed down and said, “I would willingly be David's slave and wash his servants' feet.”
1SA.25.42	Abigail quickly got ready and went back with David's messengers. She rode on her donkey, while five of her servant women walked alongside. She and David were married as soon as she arrived.
1SA.25.43	David had earlier married Ahinoam from the town of Jezreel, so both she and Abigail were now David's wives.
1SA.25.44	 Meanwhile, Saul had arranged for Michal
1SA.26.2	Saul took 3,000 of Israel's best soldiers and went to look for David there in Ziph Desert. 
1SA.26.3	Saul set up camp on Mount Hachilah, which is across the road from Jeshimon. But David was hiding out in the desert.
1SA.26.3	When David heard that Saul was following him, 
1SA.26.4	he sent some spies to find out if it was true. 
1SA.26.5	Then he sneaked up to Saul's camp. He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp, with soldiers sleeping all around them. 
1SA.26.6	David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai,
1SA.26.6	“I will!” Abishai answered.
1SA.26.7	That same night, David and Abishai crept into the camp. Saul was sleeping, and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head. Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him.
1SA.26.8	Abishai whispered, “This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy! I'll pin him to the ground with one thrust of his own spear.”
1SA.26.9	“Don't kill him!” David whispered back. “The 
1SA.26.10	As surely as the 
1SA.26.11	 But I pray that the 
1SA.26.12	David took the spear and the water jar, then left the camp. None of Saul's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up—the 
1SA.26.13	David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill, where they were at a safe distance. 
1SA.26.14	“Abner!” David shouted toward Saul's army. “Can you hear me?”
1SA.26.14	Abner shouted back. “Who dares disturb the king?”
1SA.26.15	“Abner, what kind of a man are you?” David replied. “Aren't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel? Then why didn't you protect your king? Anyone who went into your camp could have killed him tonight.
1SA.26.16	You're a complete failure! I swear by the living 
1SA.26.17	Saul could tell it was David's voice, and he called out, “David, my son! Is that you?”
1SA.26.17	“Yes it is, Your Majesty. 
1SA.26.18	Why are you hunting me down? Have I done something wrong, or have I committed a crime? 
1SA.26.19	Please listen to what I have to say. If the 
1SA.26.20	Don't let me die in a land far away from the 
1SA.26.21	“David, you had the chance to kill me today. But you didn't. I was very wrong about you. It was a terrible mistake for me to try to kill you. I've acted like a fool, but I'll never try to harm you again. You're like a son to me, so please come back.”
1SA.26.22	“Your Majesty, here's your spear! Let one of your soldiers come and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	I spared your life today, and I pray that the 
1SA.26.25	“David, my son, I pray that the Lord will bless you and make you successful!”
1SA.26.25	Saul went back home. David also left,
1SA.27.1	but he thought to himself, “One of these days, Saul is going to kill me. The only way to escape from him is to go to Philistia. Then I'll be outside of Israel, and Saul will give up trying to catch me.”
1SA.27.2+1SA.27.3	David and his 600 men went across the border to stay in Gath with King Achish the son of Maoch. His men brought their families with them. David brought his wife Ahinoam whose hometown was Jezreel, and he also brought his wife Abigail who had been married to Nabal from Carmel. 
1SA.27.4	When Saul found out that David had run off to Gath, he stopped trying to catch him.
1SA.27.5	One day, David was talking with Achish and said, “If you are happy with me, then let me live in one of the towns in the countryside. I'm not important enough to live here with you in the royal city.”
1SA.27.6	Achish gave David the town of Ziklag that same day, and Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.
1SA.27.7	David was in Philistia for a year and four months. 
1SA.27.8	The Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites lived in the area from Telam to Shur
1SA.27.9	Whenever David and his men attacked a town, they took the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and the clothing, and killed everyone who lived there.
1SA.27.9	After he returned from a raid, David always went to see Achish, 
1SA.27.10	who would ask, “Where did you attack today?”
1SA.27.10	David would answer, “Oh, we attacked some desert town that belonged to the Judah tribe.” Sometimes David would say, “Oh, we attacked a town in the desert where the Jerahmeel clan lives” or “We attacked a town in the desert where the Kenites
1SA.27.11	That's why David killed everyone in the towns he attacked. He thought, “If I let any of them live, they might come to Gath and tell what I've really been doing.”
1SA.27.11	David made these raids all the time he was in Philistia. 
1SA.27.12	But Achish trusted David and thought, “David's people must be furious with him. From now on he will have to take orders from me.”
1SA.28.1+1SA.28.2+1SA.28.3	Meanwhile, Saul had been trying to get rid of everyone who spoke with the spirits of the dead.
1SA.28.1+1SA.28.2+1SA.28.3	Achish told David, “Of course, you know that you and your men must fight as part of our Philistine army.”
1SA.28.1+1SA.28.2+1SA.28.3	David answered, “That will give you a chance to see for yourself just how well we can fight!”
1SA.28.1+1SA.28.2+1SA.28.3	“In that case,” Achish said, “you and your men will always be my bodyguards.”
1SA.28.4	The Philistines went to Shunem and set up camp. Saul called the army of Israel together, and they set up their camp in Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	Saul took one look at the Philistine army and started shaking with fear. 
1SA.28.6	 So he asked the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul told his officers, “Find me a woman who can talk to the spirits of the dead. I'll go to her and find out what's going to happen.”
1SA.28.7	His servants told him, “There's a woman at Endor who can talk to spirits of the dead.”
1SA.28.8	That night, Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him. Then he and two of his men went to the woman, and asked, “Will you bring up the ghost of someone for us?”
1SA.28.9	The woman said, “Why are you trying to trick me and get me killed? You know King Saul has killed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead!”
1SA.28.10	Saul replied, “I swear by the living 
1SA.28.11	“Bring up the ghost of Samuel,” he answered.
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. Then she turned to Saul and said, “You've tricked me! You're the king!”
1SA.28.13	“Don't be afraid,” Saul replied. “Just tell me what you see.”
1SA.28.13	She answered, “I see a spirit rising up out of the ground.”
1SA.28.14	“What does it look like?”
1SA.28.14	“It looks like an old man wearing a robe.”
1SA.28.14	Saul knew it was Samuel, so he bowed down low.
1SA.28.15	“Why are you bothering me by bringing me up like this?” Samuel asked.
1SA.28.15	“I'm terribly worried,” Saul answered. “The Philistines are about to attack me. God has turned his back on me and won't answer any more by prophets or by dreams. What should I do?”
1SA.28.16	Samuel said:
1SA.28.16	If the 
1SA.28.17	 I've already told you: The 
1SA.28.18	 When the 
1SA.28.19	Tomorrow the 
1SA.28.20	At once, Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor, terrified at what Samuel had said. He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before.
1SA.28.21	The woman came over to Saul, and when she saw that he was completely terrified, she said, “Your Majesty, I listened to you and risked my life to do what you asked. 
1SA.28.22	Now please listen to me. Let me get you a little something to eat. It will give you strength for your walk back to camp.”
1SA.28.23	“No, I won't eat!”
1SA.28.23	But his officers and the woman kept on urging Saul, until he finally agreed. He got up off the floor and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	At once the woman killed a calf that she had been fattening up. She cooked part of the meat and baked some thin bread.
1SA.28.25	Then she served the food to Saul and his officers, who ate and left before daylight.
1SA.29.1	The Philistines had brought their whole army to Aphek,
1SA.29.2+1SA.29.3	The Philistine rulers and their troops were marching past the Philistine army commanders in groups of 100 and 1,000. When David and his men marched by at the end with Achish, the commanders said, “What are these worthless Israelites doing here?”
1SA.29.2+1SA.29.3	“They are David's men,” Achish answered. “David used to be one of Saul's officers, but he left Saul and joined my army a long time ago. I've never had even one complaint about him.”
1SA.29.4	The Philistine army commanders were angry and shouted:
1SA.29.4	Send David back to the town you gave him. We won't have him going into the battle with us. He could turn and fight against us! Saul would take David back as an officer if David brought him the heads of our soldiers. 
1SA.29.5	 The Israelites even dance and sing,
1SA.29.5	“Saul has killed
1SA.29.5	a thousand enemies;
1SA.29.5	David has killed
1SA.29.5	ten thousand!”
1SA.29.6	Achish called David over and said:
1SA.29.6	I swear by the living 
1SA.29.7	Go on back home and try not to upset them.
1SA.29.8	“But what have I done?” David asked. “Do you know of anything I've ever done that would keep me from fighting the enemies of my king?”
1SA.29.9	Achish said:
1SA.29.9	I believe that you're as good as an angel of God, but our army commanders have decided that you can't fight in this battle. 
1SA.29.10	You and your troops will have to go back to the town I gave you.
1SA.29.11	David and his men got up early in the morning and headed back toward Philistia, while the Philistines left for Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag. But while they had been away, the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there. They had attacked Ziklag, burned it to the ground, 
1SA.30.2	and had taken away the women and children. 
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw the burned-out ruins and learned that their families had been taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more. 
1SA.30.5	 David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken captive with everyone else.
1SA.30.6	David was desperate. His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death. But he felt the 
1SA.30.7	 and he said to the priest, “Abiathar, let's ask God what to do.”
1SA.30.7	Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God, and he went over to David. 
1SA.30.8	Then David asked the 
1SA.30.8	“Go after them,” the 
1SA.30.9+1SA.30.10	David led his 600 men to Besor Gorge, but 200 of them were too tired to go across. So they stayed behind, while David and the other 400 men crossed the gorge.
1SA.30.11	Some of David's men found an Egyptian out in a field and took him to David. They gave the Egyptian some bread, and he ate it. Then they gave him a drink of water, 
1SA.30.12	some dried figs, and two handfuls of raisins. This was the first time in three days he had tasted food or water. Now he felt much better.
1SA.30.13	“Who is your master?” David asked. “And where do you come from?”
1SA.30.13	“I'm from Egypt,” the young man answered. “I'm the servant of an Amalekite, but he left me here three days ago because I was sick. 
1SA.30.14	We had attacked some towns in the desert where the Cherethites live, in the area that belongs to Judah, and in the desert where the Caleb clan lives. And we burned down Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	“Will you take me to those Amalekites?” David asked.
1SA.30.15	“Yes, I will, if you promise with God as a witness that you won't kill me or hand me over to my master.”
1SA.30.16	He led David to the Amalekites. They were eating and drinking everywhere, celebrating because of what they had taken from Philistia and Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David attacked just before sunrise the next day and fought until sunset.
1SA.30.18	David rescued his two wives and everyone else the Amalekites had taken from Ziklag. 
1SA.30.19	No one was missing—young or old, sons or daughters. David brought back everything that had been stolen, 
1SA.30.20	including their livestock.
1SA.30.20	David also took the sheep and cattle that the Amalekites had with them, but he kept these separate from the others. Everyone agreed that these would be David's reward.
1SA.30.21	On the way back, David went to the 200 men he had left at Besor Gorge, because they had been too tired to keep up with him. They came toward David and the people who were with him. When David was close enough, he greeted the 200 men and asked how they were doing.
1SA.30.22	Some of David's men were good-for-nothings, and they said, “Those men didn't go with us to the battle, so they don't get any of the things we took back from the Amalekites. Let them take their wives and children and go!”
1SA.30.23	But David said:
1SA.30.23	My friends, don't be so greedy with what the 
1SA.30.24	Who would pay attention to you, anyway? Soldiers who stay behind to guard the camp get as much as those who go into battle.
1SA.30.25	David made this a law for Israel, and it has been the same ever since.
1SA.30.26	David went back to Ziklag with everything they had taken from the Amalekites. He sent some of these things as gifts to his friends who were leaders of Judah, and he told them, “We took these things from the 
1SA.30.27+1SA.30.28+1SA.30.29+1SA.30.30+1SA.30.31	This is a list of the towns where David sent gifts: Bethel,
1SA.31.1	Meanwhile, the Philistines were fighting Israel at Mount Gilboa. Israel's soldiers ran from the Philistines, and many of them were killed. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
1SA.31.3	The fighting was fierce around Saul, and he was badly wounded by enemy arrows.
1SA.31.4	Saul told the soldier who carried his weapons, “Kill me with your sword! I don't want these worthless Philistines to torture and make fun of me.” But the soldier was afraid to kill him.
1SA.31.4	Saul then took out his own sword; he stuck the blade into his stomach, and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When the soldier knew that Saul was dead, he killed himself in the same way.
1SA.31.6	Saul was dead, his three sons were dead, and the soldier who carried his weapons was dead. They and all his soldiers died on that same day. 
1SA.31.7	The Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley
1SA.31.8	The day after the battle, when the Philistines returned to the battlefield to take the weapons of the dead Israelite soldiers, they found Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9+1SA.31.10	The Philistines cut off Saul's head and pulled off his armor. Then they put his armor in the temple of the goddess Astarte, and they nailed his body to the city wall of Beth-Shan. They also sent messengers everywhere in Philistia to spread the good news in the temples of their idols and among their people.
1SA.31.11	The people who lived in Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul's body. 
1SA.31.12	So one night, some brave men from Jabesh went to Beth-Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons, then brought them back to Jabesh and burned them. 
1SA.31.13	They buried the bones under a small tree in Jabesh, and for seven days, they went without eating to show their sorrow.
2SA.1.1	Saul was dead.
2SA.1.1	Meanwhile, David had defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag. 
2SA.1.2	Three days later, a soldier came from Saul's army. His clothes were torn, and dirt was on his head.
2SA.1.3	David asked, “Where did you come from?”
2SA.1.3	The man answered, “From Israel's army. I barely escaped with my life.”
2SA.1.4	“Who won the battle?” David asked.
2SA.1.4	The man said, “Our army turned and ran, but many were wounded and died. Even King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”
2SA.1.5	David asked, “How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?”
2SA.1.6	I was on Mount Gilboa and saw King Saul leaning on his spear. The enemy's war chariots and cavalry were closing in on him. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned around and saw me, he called me over. I went and asked what he wanted.
2SA.1.8	Saul asked me, “Who are you?”
2SA.1.8	“An Amalekite,” I answered.
2SA.1.9	Then he said, “Kill me! I'm dying, and I'm in terrible pain.”
2SA.1.10	So I killed him. I knew he was too badly wounded to live much longer. Then I took his crown and his arm-band, and I brought them to you, Your Majesty. Here they are.
2SA.1.11	At once, David and his soldiers tore their clothes in sorrow. 
2SA.1.12	They cried all day long and would not eat anything. Everyone was sad because Saul, his son Jonathan, and many of the 
2SA.1.13	David asked the young man, “Where is your home?”
2SA.1.13	The man replied, “My father is an Amalekite, but we live in Israel.”
2SA.1.14+2SA.1.15+2SA.1.16	David said to him, “Why weren't you afraid to kill the 
2SA.1.14+2SA.1.15+2SA.1.16	Then David told one of his soldiers, “Come here and kill this man!”
2SA.1.17	David sang a song in memory of Saul and Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	 and he ordered his men to teach the song to everyone in Judah. He called it “The Song of the Bow,” and it can be found in 
2SA.1.19	Israel, your famous hero
2SA.1.19	lies dead on the hills,
2SA.1.19	and your mighty warriors
2SA.1.19	have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Don't tell it in Gath
2SA.1.20	or spread the news
2SA.1.20	on the streets of Ashkelon.
2SA.1.20	The godless Philistine women
2SA.1.20	will be happy
2SA.1.20	and jump for joy.
2SA.1.21	Don't let dew or rain fall
2SA.1.21	on the hills of Gilboa.
2SA.1.21	Don't let its fields
2SA.1.21	grow offerings for God.
2SA.1.21	There the warriors' shields
2SA.1.21	were smeared with mud,
2SA.1.21	and Saul's own shield
2SA.1.21	was left unpolished.
2SA.1.22	The arrows of Jonathan struck,
2SA.1.22	and warriors died.
2SA.1.22	The sword of Saul cut
2SA.1.22	the enemy apart.
2SA.1.23	It was easy to love Saul
2SA.1.23	and Jonathan.
2SA.1.23	Together in life,
2SA.1.23	together in death,
2SA.1.23	they were faster than eagles
2SA.1.23	and stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	Women of Israel, cry for Saul.
2SA.1.24	He brought you fine red cloth
2SA.1.24	and jewelry made of gold.
2SA.1.25	Our warriors have fallen
2SA.1.25	in the heat of battle,
2SA.1.25	and Jonathan lies dead
2SA.1.25	on the hills of Gilboa.
2SA.1.26	Jonathan, I miss you most!
2SA.1.26	I loved you
2SA.1.26	like a brother.
2SA.1.26	You were truly loyal to me,
2SA.1.26	more faithful than a wife
2SA.1.26	to her husband.
2SA.1.27	Our warriors have fallen,
2SA.1.27	and their weapons
2SA.1.27	are destroyed.
2SA.2.1	Later, David asked the 
2SA.2.1	The 
2SA.2.1	David asked, “Which town should I go to?”
2SA.2.1	“Go to Hebron,” the 
2SA.2.3	David also told his men and their families to come and live in the villages near Hebron.
2SA.2.5	David sent messengers to tell them:
2SA.2.5	The 
2SA.2.6	and I pray that the 
2SA.2.7	Saul is dead, but the tribe of Judah has made me their king. So be strong and have courage.
2SA.2.8	Abner the son of Ner
2SA.2.9	and made him king of Israel,
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth was 40 years old at the time, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah made David their king, 
2SA.2.11	and he ruled from Hebron for seven and a half years.
2SA.2.12	One day, Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth
2SA.2.13	Meanwhile, Joab the son of Zeruiah
2SA.2.14	Abner yelled to Joab, “Let's get some of our best soldiers to stand up and fight each other!”
2SA.2.14	Joab agreed, 
2SA.2.15	and twelve of Ishbosheth's men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David's men. 
2SA.2.16	They grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died right there! That's why the place in Gibeon is called “Field of Daggers.”
2SA.2.17	Then everyone started fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but David's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel.
2SA.2.18	Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an open field, 
2SA.2.19	and he ran straight after Abner, without looking to the right or to the left.
2SA.2.20	When Abner turned and saw him, he said, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	Asahel answered, “Yes it is.”
2SA.2.21	Abner said, “There are soldiers all around. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.”
2SA.2.21	But Asahel refused to stop.
2SA.2.22	Abner said, “If you don't turn back, I'll have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.”
2SA.2.23	But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still. 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai went after Abner. Finally, about sunset, they came to the hill of Ammah, not far from Giah on the road to Gibeon Desert. 
2SA.2.25	Abner brought the men of Benjamin together in one group on top of a hill, and they got ready to fight.
2SA.2.26	Abner shouted to Joab, “Aren't we ever going to stop killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on doing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing their own relatives?”
2SA.2.27	Joab shouted back, “I swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their relatives all night!” 
2SA.2.28	Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal for his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Israel. At once, the fighting stopped.
2SA.2.29	Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan River valley all that night. Then they crossed the river and marched all morning
2SA.2.30	As soon as Joab stopped chasing Abner, he got David's troops together and counted them. There were 19 missing besides Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But David's soldiers had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin. 
2SA.2.32	Joab and his troops carried Asahel's body to Bethlehem and buried him in the family burial place. Then they marched all night and reached Hebron before sunrise.
2SA.3.1	This battle was the beginning of a long war between the followers of Saul and the followers of David. Saul's power grew weaker, but David's grew stronger.
2SA.3.2+2SA.3.3+2SA.3.4+2SA.3.5	Several of David's sons were born while he was living in Hebron. His oldest son was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel. David's second son was Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, who had been married to Nabal from Carmel. Absalom was the third. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur. The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital. The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, another one of David's wives.
2SA.3.6	As the war went on between the families of David and Saul, Abner was gaining more power than ever in Saul's family. 
2SA.3.7	He had even slept with a wife
2SA.3.8	Abner was very angry because of what Ishbosheth had said, and he told Ishbosheth:
2SA.3.8	Am I some kind of worthless dog from Judah? I've always been loyal to your father's family and to his relatives and friends. I haven't turned you over to David. And yet you talk to me as if I've committed a crime with this woman.
2SA.3.9	I ask God to punish me if I don't help David get what the 
2SA.3.10	 God said that he wouldn't let anyone in Saul's family ever be king again and that David would be king instead. He also said that David would rule both Israel and Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.
2SA.3.11	Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he could not even answer.
2SA.3.12	Abner sent some of his men to David with this message: “You should be the ruler of the whole nation. If you make an agreement with me, I will persuade everyone in Israel to make you their king.”
2SA.3.13	David sent this message back: “Good! I'll make an agreement with you. But before I will even talk with you about it, you must get Saul's daughter Michal back for me.”
2SA.3.15	Ishbosheth sent some of his men to take Michal away from her new husband, Paltiel the son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	Paltiel followed Michal and the men all the way to Bahurim, crying as he walked. But he went back home after Abner ordered him to leave.
2SA.3.17	Abner talked with the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them, “You've wanted to make David your king for a long time now. 
2SA.3.18	So do it! After all, God said he would use his servant David to rescue his people Israel from their enemies, especially from the Philistines.”
2SA.3.19	Finally, Abner talked with the tribe of Benjamin. Then he left for Hebron to tell David everything that the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the people of Israel wanted to do. 
2SA.3.20	Abner took 20 soldiers with him, and when they got to Hebron, David gave a big feast for them.
2SA.3.21	After the feast, Abner said, “Your Majesty, let me leave now and bring Israel here to make an agreement with you. You'll be king of the whole nation, just as you've been wanting.”
2SA.3.21	David told Abner he could leave, and he left without causing any trouble.
2SA.3.22	Soon after Abner had left Hebron, Joab and some of David's soldiers came back, bringing a lot of things they had taken from an enemy village. 
2SA.3.23	Right after they arrived, someone told Joab, “Abner visited the king, and the king let him go. Abner even left without causing any trouble.”
2SA.3.24	Joab went to David and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you, and you let him go. Now he's long gone! 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner—he came to trick you. He wants to find out how strong your army is and to know everything you're doing.”
2SA.3.26	Joab left David, then he sent some messengers to catch up with Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah,
2SA.3.27	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pretended he wanted to talk privately with him. So he took Abner into one of the small rooms that were part of the town gate and stabbed him in the stomach. Joab killed him because Abner had killed Joab's brother Asahel.
2SA.3.28	David heard how Joab had killed Abner, and he said, “I swear to the 
2SA.3.29	Joab and his family are the guilty ones. I pray that Joab's family will always be sick with sores and other skin diseases. May they all be cowards,
2SA.3.30	Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	David told Joab and everyone with him, “Show your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth!
2SA.3.31	David walked behind the stretcher on which Abner's body was being carried. 
2SA.3.32	Abner was buried in Hebron, while David and everyone else stood at the tomb and cried loudly. 
2SA.3.33	Then the king sang a funeral song about Abner:
2SA.3.33	Abner, why should you
2SA.3.33	have died like an outlaw?
2SA.3.34	No one tied your hands
2SA.3.34	or chained your feet,
2SA.3.34	yet you died as a victim
2SA.3.34	of murderers.
2SA.3.34	Everyone started crying again. 
2SA.3.35	Then they brought some food to David and told him he would feel better if he had something to eat. It was still daytime, and David said, “I swear to God that I won't take a bite of bread or anything else until sunset!”
2SA.3.36	Everyone noticed what David did, and they liked it, just as they always liked what he did. 
2SA.3.37	Now the people of Judah and Israel were certain that David had nothing to do with killing Abner.
2SA.3.38	David said to his officials, “Don't you realize that today one of Israel's great leaders has died? 
2SA.3.39	I am the chosen king, but Joab and Abishai have more power than I do. So God will have to pay them back
2SA.4.1	Ishbosheth
2SA.4.2	Ishbosheth had put the two brothers Baanah and Rechab in charge of the soldiers who raided enemy villages. Rimmon was their father, and they were from the town of Beeroth, which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. 
2SA.4.3	The people who used to live in Beeroth had run away to Gittaim, and they still live
2SA.4.5	One day about noon, Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth's house. It was a hot day, and he was resting 
2SA.4.6+2SA.4.7	in his bedroom. The two brothers went into the house, pretending to get some flour. But once they were inside, they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach and killed him. Then they cut off his head and took it with them.
2SA.4.6+2SA.4.7	Rechab and Baanah walked through the Jordan River valley all night long. 
2SA.4.8	Finally they turned west and went to Hebron. They went in to see David and told him, “Your Majesty, here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you! The 
2SA.4.9	David answered:
2SA.4.9	I swear that only the 
2SA.4.10	 When a man came to Ziklag and told me that Saul was dead, he thought he deserved a reward for bringing good news. But I grabbed him and killed him.
2SA.4.11	You evil men have done something much worse than he did. You've killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed. I'll make you pay for that. I'll wipe you from the face of the earth!
2SA.4.12	Then David said to his troops, “Kill these two brothers! Cut off their hands and feet and hang their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But bury Ishbosheth's head in Abner's tomb near Hebron.” And they did.
2SA.5.1	Israel's leaders met with David at Hebron and said, “We are your relatives. 
2SA.5.2	Even when Saul was king, you led our nation in battle. And the 
2SA.5.3	During the meeting, David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the 
2SA.5.5	He lived in Hebron for the first seven and a half years and ruled only Judah. Then he moved to Jerusalem, where he ruled both Israel and Judah for 33 years.
2SA.5.7+2SA.5.8+2SA.5.9	David told his troops, “You will have to go up through the water tunnel to get those Jebusites. I hate people like them
2SA.5.7+2SA.5.8+2SA.5.9	That's why there is still a rule that says, “Only people who can walk and see are allowed in the temple.”
2SA.5.7+2SA.5.8+2SA.5.9	David captured the fortress on Mount Zion, then he moved there and named it David's City. He had the city rebuilt, starting with the landfill to the east. 
2SA.5.10	David became a great and strong ruler, because the 
2SA.5.11	King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. Carpenters and stone workers came with them, and they brought cedar logs so they could build David a palace.
2SA.5.12	David knew that the 
2SA.5.13	After David left Hebron and moved to Jerusalem, he married many women
2SA.5.14	His sons who were born there were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada,
2SA.5.17	The Philistines heard that David was now king of Israel, and they came into the hill country to try and capture him. But David found out and went into his fortress.
2SA.5.18	So the Philistines camped in Rephaim Valley.
2SA.5.19	David asked the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	David attacked the Philistines and defeated them. Then he said, “I watched the 
2SA.5.21	David and his troops also carried away the idols that the Philistines had left behind.
2SA.5.22	Some time later, the Philistines came back into the hill country and camped in Rephaim Valley. 
2SA.5.23	David asked the 
2SA.5.23	Don't attack them from the front. Circle around behind and attack from among the balsam
2SA.5.24	Wait until you hear a sound in the treetops like marching troops. Then attack quickly! That sound will mean I have marched out ahead of you to fight the Philistine army.
2SA.5.25	David obeyed the 
2SA.6.1	David brought together 30,000 of Israel's best soldiers and 
2SA.6.2	 led them to Baalah in Judah, which was also called Kiriath-Jearim. They were going there
2SA.6.4	with Ahio
2SA.6.5	Some of the people of Israel were playing music on small harps and other stringed instruments, and on tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. David and the others were happy, and they danced for the 
2SA.6.6	But when they came to Nacon's threshing-floor, the oxen stumbled, so Uzzah reached out and took hold of the sacred chest. 
2SA.6.7	The 
2SA.6.8	David got angry with God for killing Uzzah. He named that place “Bursting Out Against Uzzah,”
2SA.6.9	David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	He decided not to take it there. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the home of Obed Edom, who was from Gath.
2SA.6.11+2SA.6.12	At once, David went to Obed Edom's house to get the chest and bring it to David's City. Everyone was celebrating. 
2SA.6.13	The people carrying the chest walked six steps, then David sacrificed an ox and a choice cow. 
2SA.6.14	He was dancing for the 
2SA.6.15	He and everyone else were celebrating by shouting and blowing horns while the chest was being carried along.
2SA.6.16	Saul's daughter Michal looked out her window and watched the chest being brought into David's City. But when she saw David jumping and dancing for the 
2SA.6.17	They put the chest inside a tent that David had set up for it. David worshiped the 
2SA.6.18	then he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	 He gave all the men and women in the crowd a small loaf of bread, some meat, and a handful of raisins, then everyone went home.
2SA.6.20	David went home so he could ask the 
2SA.6.21	David told her, “The 
2SA.6.22	I'll show you just how great I can be! I'll even be disgusting to myself. But those slave-girls you talked about will still honor me!”
2SA.6.23	Michal never had any children.
2SA.7.1	King David moved into his new palace, and the 
2SA.7.2	Then one day, as David was talking with Nathan the prophet, David said, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest has to stay in a tent.”
2SA.7.3	Nathan replied, “The 
2SA.7.4	That night, the 
2SA.7.5	to go to David and give him this message:
2SA.7.5	David, you are my servant, so listen to what I say. Why should you build a temple for me? 
2SA.7.6	I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them. 
2SA.7.7	I chose leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
2SA.7.9	Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world.
2SA.7.10	I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace, and they won't have to tremble with fear any more. Evil nations won't bother them, as they did 
2SA.7.11	when I let judges rule my people. And I have kept your enemies from attacking you.
2SA.7.11	Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings. 
2SA.7.12	 I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler, 
2SA.7.13	and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me. 
2SA.7.14	 I will be his father, and he will be my son.
2SA.7.14	When he does wrong, I'll see that he is corrected, just as children are corrected by their parents. 
2SA.7.15	But I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you. 
2SA.7.16	 I will make sure that one of your descendants will always be king.
2SA.7.17	Nathan told David exactly what he had heard in the vision.
2SA.7.18	David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. Then he sat there and prayed:
2SA.7.19	and yet you have promised to do even more. Is this the way you usually treat people?
2SA.7.20	I am your servant, and you know my thoughts, so there is nothing more that I need to say. 
2SA.7.21	You have done this wonderful thing, and you have let me know about it, because you wanted to keep your promise.
2SA.7.23	 And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here.
2SA.7.24	You have chosen Israel to be your people forever, and you have become their God.
2SA.7.25	And now, 
2SA.7.26	Then you will be famous forever, and everyone will say, “The 
2SA.7.27	After all, you really are Israel's God, the 
2SA.7.29	Please bless my descendants and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already promised, and I'm sure that you will bless my family forever.
2SA.8.1	Later, David attacked and badly defeated the Philistines. Israel was now free from their control.
2SA.8.2	David also defeated the Moabites. Then he made their soldiers lie down on the ground, and he measured them off with a rope. He would measure off two lengths of the rope and have those men killed, then he would measure off one length and let those men live. The people of Moab had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him.
2SA.8.3	David set out for the Euphrates River to build a monument
2SA.8.4	In the battle, David captured 1,700 cavalry
2SA.8.5	When troops from the Aramean kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 
2SA.8.6	He left some of his soldiers in Damascus, and the Arameans had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him.
2SA.8.6	Everywhere David went, the 
2SA.8.7	Hadadezer's officers had carried their arrows in gold cases hung over their shoulders, but David took these cases
2SA.8.8	He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Betah and Berothai, which had belonged to Hadadezer.
2SA.8.9+2SA.8.10	King Toi of Hamath and King Hadadezer had been enemies. So when Toi heard that David had attacked and defeated
2SA.8.11	David gave these to the 
2SA.8.12	Edom,
2SA.8.14	David left soldiers all through Edom, and the people of Edom had to accept him as their ruler.
2SA.8.14	Wherever David went, the 
2SA.8.15	David ruled all Israel with fairness and justice.
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah was the commander in chief of the army.
2SA.8.16	Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept the government records.
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abiathar the son of Ahimelech,
2SA.8.17	Seraiah was the secretary.
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was the commander of
2SA.8.18	David's sons were priests.
2SA.9.2	David called in Ziba, one of the servants of Saul's family. David said, “So you are Ziba.”
2SA.9.2	“Yes, Your Majesty, I am.”
2SA.9.3	Ziba answered, “One of Jonathan's sons is still alive, but he can't walk.”
2SA.9.4	“Where is he?” David asked.
2SA.9.4	Ziba replied, “He lives in Lo-Debar with Machir the son of Ammiel.”
2SA.9.5+2SA.9.6	David sent some servants to bring Jonathan's son from Lo-Debar. His name was Mephibosheth,
2SA.9.5+2SA.9.6	David asked, “Are you Mephibosheth?”
2SA.9.5+2SA.9.6	“Yes, I am, Your Majesty.”
2SA.9.7	David said, “Don't be afraid. I'll be kind to you because Jonathan was your father. I'm going to give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul. Besides that, you will always eat with me at my table.”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth knelt down again and said, “Why should you care about me? I'm worth no more than a dead dog.”
2SA.9.9	David called in Ziba, Saul's chief servant, and told him, “Since Mephibosheth is Saul's grandson, I've given him back everything that belonged to your master Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You and your 15 sons and 20 servants will work for Mephibosheth. You will farm his land and bring in his crops, so that Saul's family and servants
2SA.9.11+2SA.9.12+2SA.9.13	Ziba replied, “Your Majesty, I will do exactly what you tell me to do.” So Ziba's family and servants worked for Mephibosheth.
2SA.9.11+2SA.9.12+2SA.9.13	Mephibosheth was lame, but he lived in Jerusalem and ate at David's
2SA.10.1	Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
2SA.10.2	David said, “Nahash was kind to me, and I will be kind to his son.” So he sent some officials to the country of Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died.
2SA.10.3	But Hanun's officials told him, “Do you really believe David is honoring your father by sending these people to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our city, so he can destroy it.” 
2SA.10.4	Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off on one side of their faces. He had their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	They were terribly ashamed.
2SA.10.5	When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message and told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”
2SA.10.6	The Ammonites realized that they had made David very angry, so they hired more foreign soldiers. Twenty thousand of them were foot soldiers from the Aramean cities of Beth-Rehob and Zobah, 1,000 were from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 were from the region of Tob. 
2SA.10.7	David heard what they had done, and he sent out Joab with all of his well-trained soldiers.
2SA.10.8	The Ammonite troops came out and got ready to fight in front of the gate to their city. The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the soldiers from Tob and Maacah formed a separate group in the nearby fields.
2SA.10.9	Joab saw that he had to fight in front and behind at the same time, and he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Arameans. 
2SA.10.10	He put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and gave them orders to fight the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	Joab told his brother, “If the Arameans are too much for me to handle, you can come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the cities of our God. I pray that the 
2SA.10.13	Joab and his soldiers attacked the Arameans, and the Arameans ran from them. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonite soldiers saw that the Arameans had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab stopped fighting the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	The Arameans realized they had lost the battle, so they brought all their troops together again. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent messengers to call in the Arameans who were on the other side of the Euphrates River. Then Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led them to the town of Helam.
2SA.10.17	David found out what the Arameans were doing, and he brought Israel's whole army together. They crossed the Jordan River and went to Helam, where the Arameans were ready to meet them. 
2SA.10.18	The Arameans attacked, but then they ran from Israel. David killed 700 chariot drivers and 40,000 cavalry.
2SA.10.19	When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had beaten them, they made peace with Israel and accepted David as their ruler. The Arameans were afraid to help Ammon any more.
2SA.11.2+2SA.11.3+2SA.11.4	Late one afternoon, David got up from a nap and was walking around on the flat roof of his palace. A beautiful young woman was down below in her courtyard, bathing as her religion required.
2SA.11.2+2SA.11.3+2SA.11.4	The servant came back and told David, “Her name is Bathsheba. She is the daughter of Eliam, and she is the wife of Uriah the Hittite.”
2SA.11.2+2SA.11.3+2SA.11.4	David sent some messengers to bring her to his palace. She came to him, and he slept with her. Then she returned home. 
2SA.11.5	But later, when she found out that she was going to have a baby, she sent someone to David with this message: “I'm pregnant!”
2SA.11.6	David sent a message to Joab: “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.”
2SA.11.6	Joab sent Uriah 
2SA.11.7	to David's palace, and David asked him, “Is Joab well? How is the army doing? And how about the war?” 
2SA.11.8	Then David told Uriah, “Go home and clean up.”
2SA.11.9	But Uriah didn't go home. Instead, he slept outside the entrance to the royal palace, where the king's guards slept.
2SA.11.10	Someone told David that Uriah had not gone home. So the next morning David asked him, “Why didn't you go home? Haven't you been away for a long time?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah answered, “The sacred chest and the armies of Israel and Judah are camping out somewhere in the fields
2SA.11.12	Then David said, “Stay here in Jerusalem today, and I will send you back tomorrow.”
2SA.11.12	Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day. Then the next day, 
2SA.11.13	David invited him for dinner. Uriah ate with David, who gave him so much to drink that he got drunk. But Uriah still did not go home. He went out and slept on his mat near the palace guards. 
2SA.11.14	Early the next morning, David wrote a letter and told Uriah to deliver it to Joab. 
2SA.11.15	The letter said: “Put Uriah on the front line where the fighting is the worst. Then pull the troops back from him, so that he will be wounded and die.”
2SA.11.16	Joab had been carefully watching the city of Rabbah, and he put Uriah in a place where he knew there were some of the enemy's best soldiers. 
2SA.11.17	When the men of the city came out, they fought and killed some of David's soldiers—Uriah the Hittite was one of them.
2SA.11.18	Joab sent a messenger to tell David everything that was happening in the war. 
2SA.11.19	He gave the messenger these orders:
2SA.11.19	When you finish telling the king everything that has happened, 
2SA.11.20	he may get angry and ask, “Why did you go so near the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	 Don't you know how Abimelech the son of Gideon
2SA.11.21	Then tell him, “One of your soldiers who was killed was Uriah the Hittite.”
2SA.11.22	The messenger went to David and reported everything Joab had told him. 
2SA.11.23	He added, “The enemy chased us from the wall and out into the open fields. But we pushed them back as far as the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	Then they shot arrows at us from the top of the wall. Some of your soldiers were killed, and one of them was Uriah the Hittite.”
2SA.11.25	David replied, “Tell Joab to cheer up and not to be upset about what happened. You never know who will be killed in a war. Tell him to strengthen his attack against the city and break through its walls.”
2SA.11.26	When Bathsheba heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
2SA.11.27	Then after the time for mourning was over, David sent someone to bring her to the palace. She became David's wife, and they had a son.
2SA.11.27	The 
2SA.12.1	A rich man and a poor man lived in the same town. 
2SA.12.2	The rich man owned a lot of sheep and cattle, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had only one little lamb that he had bought and raised. The lamb became a pet for him and his children. He even let it eat from his plate and drink from his cup and sleep on his lap. The lamb was like one of his own children.
2SA.12.4	One day someone came to visit the rich man, but the rich man didn't want to kill any of his own sheep or cattle and serve it to the visitor. So he stole the poor man's lamb and served it instead.
2SA.12.5	David was furious with the rich man and said to Nathan, “I swear by the living 
2SA.12.6	And because he didn't have pity on the poor man, he will have to pay four times what the lamb was worth.”
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan told David:
2SA.12.7	You are that rich man! Now listen to what the 
2SA.12.8	and even gave you his house and his wives. I let you rule Israel and Judah, and if that had not been enough, I would have given you much more. 
2SA.12.9	Why did you disobey me and do such a horrible thing? You murdered Uriah the Hittite by letting the Ammonites kill him, so you could take his wife.
2SA.12.10	“Because you wouldn't obey me and took Uriah's wife for yourself, your family will never live in peace. 
2SA.12.11	 Someone from your own family will cause you a lot of trouble, and I will take your wives and give them to another man before your very eyes. He will go to bed with them while everyone looks on. 
2SA.12.12	What you did was in secret, but I will do this in the open for everyone in Israel to see.”
2SA.12.13+2SA.12.14	David said, “I have disobeyed the 
2SA.12.13+2SA.12.14	“Yes, you have!” Nathan answered. “You showed you didn't care what the 
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went back home.
2SA.12.15	The 
2SA.12.16	So David went without eating to show his sorrow, and he begged God to make the boy well. David would not sleep on his bed, but spent each night lying on the floor. 
2SA.12.17	His officials stood beside him and tried to talk him into getting up. But he would not get up or eat with them.
2SA.12.18	After the child had been sick for seven days, he died, but the officials were afraid to tell David. They said to each other, “Even when the boy was alive, David wouldn't listen to us. How can we tell him his son is dead? He might do something terrible!”
2SA.12.19	David noticed his servants whispering, and he knew the boy was dead. “Did my son die?” he asked his servants.
2SA.12.19	“Yes, he did,” they answered.
2SA.12.20	David got up off the floor; he took a bath, combed his hair, and dressed. He went into the 
2SA.12.21	His officials said, “What are you doing? You went without eating and cried for your son while he was alive! But now that he's dead, you're up and eating.”
2SA.12.22	David answered:
2SA.12.22	While he was still alive, I went without food and cried because there was still hope. I said to myself, “Who knows? Maybe the 
2SA.12.23	But now that he's dead, why should I go without eating? I can't bring him back! Someday I will join him in death, but he can't return to me.
2SA.12.24	David comforted his wife Bathsheba and slept with her. Later on, she gave birth to another son and named him Solomon. The 
2SA.12.25	and sent Nathan the prophet to tell David, “The 
2SA.12.26	Meanwhile, Joab had been in the country of Ammon, attacking the city of Rabbah. He captured the royal fortress 
2SA.12.27	and sent a messenger to tell David:
2SA.12.27	I have attacked Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding the city water supply. 
2SA.12.28	Call the rest of the army together. Then surround the city, and capture it yourself. If you don't, everyone will remember that I captured the city.
2SA.12.29	David called the rest of the army together and attacked Rabbah. He captured the city 
2SA.12.30	and took the crown from the statue of their god Milcom.
2SA.12.31	David made the people of Rabbah tear down the city walls
2SA.12.31	David went back to Jerusalem, and the people of Israel returned to their homes.
2SA.13.1	David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half sister of Amnon,
2SA.13.2	But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.
2SA.13.3	Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted, 
2SA.13.4	and he said to Amnon, “What's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.”
2SA.13.4	Amnon said, “I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”
2SA.13.5	Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.”
2SA.13.6	So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread
2SA.13.7	David told Tamar, “Go over to Amnon's house and fix him some food.” 
2SA.13.8	When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched. 
2SA.13.9	Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it.
2SA.13.9	Amnon said, “Send the servants out of the house.” After they had gone, 
2SA.13.10	he said to Tamar, “Serve the food in my bedroom.”
2SA.13.10	Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”
2SA.13.12	She answered, “No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's disgusting! 
2SA.13.13	Think of me. I'll be disgraced forever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but trash! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.”
2SA.13.14	But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her. 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, “Get up and get out!”
2SA.13.16	She said, “Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.”
2SA.13.16	But Amnon would not listen. 
2SA.13.17	He called in his servant and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door!”
2SA.13.18	The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her.
2SA.13.18	The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.
2SA.13.19	Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.
2SA.13.20	Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, “How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.”
2SA.13.20	Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely. 
2SA.13.21	When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy.
2SA.13.22	Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all of the king's sons to be there.
2SA.13.24	Then he went to David and said, “My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!”
2SA.13.25	David answered, “No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time.
2SA.13.26	Absalom said, “If you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.”
2SA.13.26	David asked, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom.
2SA.13.27	Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.
2SA.13.28	But he told his servants, “Keep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling relaxed, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.”
2SA.13.29	Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom.
2SA.13.30	While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, “Absalom has killed all of your sons! Not even one is left.” 
2SA.13.31	David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground. His servants remained standing, but they tore their clothes too.
2SA.13.32	Then David's nephew
2SA.13.33	Don't worry about the report that all your sons were killed. Only Amnon is dead, 
2SA.13.34	and Absalom has run away.”
2SA.13.34	One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim.
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said, “Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.”
2SA.13.36	No sooner had he said it, than David's sons came in. They were weeping out loud, and David and all his officials cried just as loudly. 
2SA.13.37+2SA.13.38	 David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead.
2SA.13.37+2SA.13.38	Absalom had run away to Geshur, where he stayed for three years with King Talmai
2SA.13.39	David still felt so sad over the loss of Amnon that he wanted to take his army there and capture Absalom.
2SA.14.1	Joab knew that David couldn't stop thinking about Absalom, 
2SA.14.2+2SA.14.3	and he sent someone to bring in the wise woman who lived in Tekoa. Joab told her, “Put on funeral clothes and don't use any makeup. Go to the king and pretend you have spent a long time mourning the death of a loved one.” Then he told her what to say.
2SA.14.4	The woman from Tekoa went to David. She bowed very low and said, “Your Majesty, please help me!”
2SA.14.5	David asked, “What's the matter?”
2SA.14.5	She replied:
2SA.14.5	My husband is dead, and I'm a widow. 
2SA.14.6	I had two sons, but they got into a fight out in a field where there was no one to pull them apart, and one of them killed the other. 
2SA.14.7	Now all of my relatives have come to me and said, “Hand over your son! We're going to put him to death for killing his brother.” But what they really want is to get rid of him, so they can take over our land.
2SA.14.7	Please don't let them put out my only flame of hope! There won't be anyone left on this earth to carry on my husband's name.
2SA.14.8	“Go on home,” David told her. “I'll take care of this matter for you.”
2SA.14.9	The woman said, “I hope your decision doesn't cause any problems for you. But if it does, you can blame me.”
2SA.14.10	He said, “If anyone gives you trouble, bring them to me, and it won't happen again!”
2SA.14.11	“Please,” she replied, “swear by the 
2SA.14.11	He said, “I swear by the living 
2SA.14.12	Then she asked, “Your Majesty, may I say something?”
2SA.14.12	“Yes,” he answered.
2SA.14.13	The woman said:
2SA.14.13	Haven't you been hurting God's people? Your own son had to leave the country. And when you judged in my favor, it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back. 
2SA.14.14	We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground. But God doesn't take our lives.
2SA.14.15	Your Majesty, I came here to tell you about my problem, because I was afraid of what someone might do to me. I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help. 
2SA.14.16	In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.
2SA.14.18	Then David said to the woman, “Now I'm going to ask you a question, and don't try to hide the truth!”
2SA.14.18	The woman replied, “Please go ahead, Your Majesty.”
2SA.14.19	David asked, “Did Joab put you up to this?”
2SA.14.19	The woman answered, “Your Majesty, I swear by your life that no one can hide the truth from you. Yes, Joab did tell me what to say, 
2SA.14.20	but only to show you the other side of this problem. You must be as wise as the angel of God to know everything that goes on in this country.”
2SA.14.21	David turned to Joab and said, “It seems that I have already given my decision. Go and bring Absalom back.”
2SA.14.22	Joab bowed very low and said, “Your Majesty, I thank you for giving your permission. It shows that you approve of me.”
2SA.14.23	Joab went to Geshur to get Absalom. But when they came back to Jerusalem, 
2SA.14.24	David told Joab, “I don't want to see my son Absalom. Tell him to stay away from me.” So Absalom went to his own house without seeing his father.
2SA.14.25	No one in all Israel was as handsome and well-built as Absalom. 
2SA.14.26	His hair grew so thick and heavy that when he got it cut once a year, it weighed over two kilograms.
2SA.14.27	Absalom had three sons. He also had a daughter named Tamar, who grew up to be very beautiful.
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing his father. 
2SA.14.29	He wanted Joab to talk to David for him. So one day he sent a message asking Joab to come over, but Joab refused. Absalom sent another message, but Joab still refused. 
2SA.14.30	Finally, Absalom told his servants, “Joab's barley field is right next to mine. Go set it on fire!” And they did.
2SA.14.31	Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered, “You didn't pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I'm guilty, let him kill me.”
2SA.14.33	Joab went to David and told him what Absalom had said. David sent for Absalom, and Absalom came. He bowed very low, and David leaned over and kissed him.
2SA.15.1	Some time later, Absalom got himself a chariot with horses to pull it, and he had 50 men run in front. 
2SA.15.2	He would get up early each morning and wait by the side of the road that led to the city gate.
2SA.15.2	If they said, “I'm from a tribe in the north,” 
2SA.15.3	Absalom would say, “You deserve to win your case. It's too bad the king doesn't have anyone to hear complaints like yours. 
2SA.15.4	I wish someone would make me the judge around here! I would be fair to everyone.”
2SA.15.5	Whenever anyone came to Absalom and started bowing down, he would reach out and hug and kiss them. 
2SA.15.6	That's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king. Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David.
2SA.15.7	Four years
2SA.15.8	when I was living with the Arameans in Geshur. I promised that if the 
2SA.15.9	David gave his permission, and Absalom went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10+2SA.15.11+2SA.15.12	He took 200 men from Jerusalem with him, but they had no idea what he was going to do. Absalom offered sacrifices in Hebron and sent someone to Gilo to tell David's advisor Ahithophel to come.
2SA.15.10+2SA.15.11+2SA.15.12	More and more people were joining Absalom and supporting his plot. Meanwhile, Absalom had secretly sent some messengers to the northern tribes of Israel. The messengers told everyone, “When you hear the sound of the trumpets, you must shout, ‘Absalom now rules as king in Hebron!’ ”
2SA.15.13	A messenger came and told David, “Everyone in Israel is on Absalom's side!”
2SA.15.14	David's officials were in Jerusalem with him, and he told them, “Let's get out of here! We'll have to leave soon, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry! If he moves fast, he could catch us while we're still here. Then he will kill us and everyone else in the city.”
2SA.15.15	The officials said, “Your Majesty, we'll do whatever you say.”
2SA.15.16+2SA.15.17	David left behind ten of his wives
2SA.15.16+2SA.15.17	They stopped at the last house at the edge of the city. 
2SA.15.18	Then David stood there and watched while his regular troops and his bodyguards
2SA.15.19	David spoke to Ittai and said, “You're a foreigner from the town of Gath. You don't have to leave with us. Go back and join the new king! 
2SA.15.20	You haven't been with me very long, so why should you have to follow me, when I don't even know where I'm going? Take your soldiers and go back. I pray that the Lord will be
2SA.15.21	Ittai answered, “Your Majesty, just as surely as you and the 
2SA.15.22	“Then come on!” David said.
2SA.15.22	So Ittai and all his men and their families walked on past David.
2SA.15.23	The people of Jerusalem were crying and moaning as David and everyone with him passed by. He led them across Kidron Valley
2SA.15.24	Zadok and Abiathar the priests were there along with several men from the tribe of Levi who were carrying the sacred chest. They set the chest down, and left it there until David and his followers had gone out of the city.
2SA.15.25	Then David said:
2SA.15.25	Zadok, take the sacred chest back to Jerusalem. If the 
2SA.15.26	But if he says he isn't pleased with me, then let him do what he knows is best.
2SA.15.27	Zadok, you are a good judge of things,
2SA.15.28	I'll wait at the river crossing in the desert until I hear from you.
2SA.15.29	Zadok and Abiathar took the sacred chest back into Jerusalem and stayed there. 
2SA.15.30	David went on up the slope of the Mount of Olives. He was barefoot and crying, and he covered his head to show his sorrow. Everyone with him was crying, and they covered their heads too.
2SA.15.31	Someone told David, “Ahithophel is helping Absalom plot against you!”
2SA.15.31	David said, “Please, 
2SA.15.32	When David reached the top of the Mount of Olives, he met Hushai the Archite
2SA.15.33	David told him:
2SA.15.33	If you come with me, you might slow us down.
2SA.15.34	Go back into the city and tell Absalom, “Your Majesty, I am your servant. I will serve you now, just as I served your father in the past.”
2SA.15.34	Hushai, if you do that, you can help me ruin Ahithophel's plans. 
2SA.15.35	Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you, and you can tell them everything you hear in the palace. 
2SA.15.36	Then they can send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what you've heard.
2SA.15.37	David's advisor Hushai slipped back into Jerusalem, at just about the same time Absalom was coming in.
2SA.16.2	“What's all this?” David asked.
2SA.16.2	Ziba said, “The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat, and the wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.”
2SA.16.3	Ziba answered, “He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks the people of Israel want him to rule the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”
2SA.16.4	David then told him, “Everything that used to belong to Mephibosheth is now yours.”
2SA.16.4	Ziba said, “Your Majesty, I am your humble servant, and I hope you will be pleased with me.”
2SA.16.5	David was near the town of Bahurim when a man came out and started cursing him. The man was Shimei the son of Gera, and he was one of Saul's distant relatives. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David, at his soldiers, and at everyone else, including the bodyguards who walked on each side of David.
2SA.16.7	Shimei was yelling at David, “Get out of here, you murderer! You good-for-nothing, 
2SA.16.8	the 
2SA.16.9	Abishai said, “Your Majesty, this man is as useless as a dead dog! He shouldn't be allowed to curse you. Let me go over and chop off his head.”
2SA.16.10	David replied, “What will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? If Shimei is cursing me because the 
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and all his soldiers:
2SA.16.11	My own son is trying to kill me! Why shouldn't this man from the tribe of Benjamin want me dead even more? Let him curse all he wants. Maybe the 
2SA.16.12	But if the 
2SA.16.13	David and the others went on down the road. Shimei went along the hillside by the road, cursing and throwing rocks and dirt at them. 
2SA.16.14	When David and those with him came to the Jordan River, they were tired out. But after they rested, they
2SA.16.15	By this time, Absalom, Ahithophel, and the others had reached Jerusalem. 
2SA.16.16	David's friend Hushai came to Absalom and said, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	But Absalom asked Hushai, “Is this how you show loyalty to your friend David? Why didn't you go with him?”
2SA.16.18	Hushai answered, “The 
2SA.16.19	Besides, it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.”
2SA.16.20	Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Give us your advice! What should we do?”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel answered, “Some of your father's wives
2SA.16.23	Ahithophel gave such good advice in those days that both Absalom and David thought it came straight from God.
2SA.17.1	Ahithophel said to Absalom:
2SA.17.1	Let me choose 12,000 men and attack David tonight, 
2SA.17.2	while he is tired and discouraged. He will panic, and everyone with him will run away. I won't kill anyone except David, 
2SA.17.3	since he's the one you want to get rid of. Then I'll bring the whole nation back to you like a bride coming home to her husband.
2SA.17.4	Absalom and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel agreed that Ahithophel had a good plan. 
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Bring in Hushai the Archite. Let's hear what he has to say.”
2SA.17.6	Hushai came in, and Absalom told him what Ahithophel had planned. Then Absalom said, “Should we do what he says? And if we shouldn't, can you come up with anything better?”
2SA.17.7	Hushai said:
2SA.17.7	This time Ahithophel's advice isn't so good. 
2SA.17.8	You know that your father and his followers are real warriors. Now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others. 
2SA.17.9	He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else.
2SA.17.9	As soon as anyone hears that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your whole army has been destroyed. 
2SA.17.10	Then even those who are as brave as a lion will lose their courage. All Israel knows what a great warrior your father is and what brave soldiers he has.
2SA.17.11	My advice is to gather all the fighting men of Israel from the town of Dan in the north down to the town of Beersheba in the south. You will have more soldiers than there are grains of sand on the seashore. Absalom, you should lead them yourself, 
2SA.17.12	and we will all go to fight David wherever he is. We will fall on him just as dew falls and covers the ground. He and all his soldiers will die! 
2SA.17.13	If they go into a walled town, we will put ropes around that town and drag it into the river. We won't leave even one small piece of a stone.
2SA.17.14	Absalom and the others liked Hushai's plan better than Ahithophel's plan. This was because the 
2SA.17.15	At once, Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar. He told them what advice Ahithophel had given to Absalom and to the leaders of Israel. He also told them about the advice he had given. 
2SA.17.16	Then he said, “Hurry! Send someone to warn David not to spend the night on this side of the Jordan. He must get across the river, so he and the others won't be wiped out!”
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz
2SA.17.18	But a young man saw them and went to tell Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left and hurried to the house of a man who lived in Bahurim. Then they climbed down into a well in the courtyard. 
2SA.17.19	The man's wife put the cover on the well and poured grain on top of it, so the well could not be seen.
2SA.17.20	Absalom's soldiers came to the woman and demanded, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	The woman answered, “They went across that stream.”
2SA.17.20	The soldiers went off to look for the two men. But when they did not find the men, they went back to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	After the soldiers had gone, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well. They went to David and said, “Hurry! Get ready to cross the river!” Then they told him about Ahithophel's plan.
2SA.17.22	David and the others got ready and started crossing the Jordan River. By sunrise all of them were on the other side.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that Absalom and the leaders of Israel were not going to follow his advice, he saddled his donkey and rode back to his home in Gilo. He told his family and servants what to do. Then he hanged himself, and they buried him in his family's burial place.
2SA.17.24	David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with the army of Israel. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom put Amasa in Joab's place as commander of the army. Amasa's father was Ithra
2SA.17.26	The Israelites under Absalom's command set up camp in the region of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	After David came to the town of Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon,
2SA.17.28+2SA.17.29	Here is a list of what they brought: sleeping mats, blankets, bowls, pottery jars, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, honey, yogurt, sheep, and cheese.
2SA.17.28+2SA.17.29	They brought the food for David and the others because they knew that everyone would be hungry, tired, and thirsty from being out in the desert.
2SA.18.1	David divided his soldiers into groups of 100 and groups of 1,000. Then he chose officers to be in command of each group. 
2SA.18.2	He sent out one third of his army under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and the rest under the command of Ittai from Gath. He told the soldiers, “I'm going into battle with you.”
2SA.18.3	But the soldiers said, “No, don't go into battle with us! It won't matter to our enemies if they make us all run away, or even if they kill half of us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. It would be better for you to stay in town and send help if we need it.”
2SA.18.4+2SA.18.5+2SA.18.6	David said, “All right, if you think I should.”
2SA.18.4+2SA.18.5+2SA.18.6	Then in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he said, “Joab! Abishai! Ittai! For my sake, be sure that Absalom comes back unharmed.”
2SA.18.4+2SA.18.5+2SA.18.6	David stood beside the town gate as his army marched past in groups of 100 and in groups of 1,000.
2SA.18.4+2SA.18.5+2SA.18.6	The war with Israel took place in Ephraim Forest. 
2SA.18.7+2SA.18.8	Battles were being fought all over the forest, and David's soldiers were winning. Twenty thousand soldiers were killed
2SA.18.9	Absalom was riding his mule under a huge tree when his head
2SA.18.10	and one of them went and told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree!”
2SA.18.11	Joab said, “You saw Absalom? Why didn't you kill him? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a special belt.”
2SA.18.12	The man answered, “Even if you paid me 1,000 pieces of silver here and now, I still wouldn't touch the king's son. We all heard King David tell you and Abishai and Ittai not to harm Absalom. 
2SA.18.13	He always finds out what's going on. I would have been risking my life to kill Absalom, because you would have let me take the blame.”
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I'm not going to waste any more time on you!”
2SA.18.14	Absalom was still alive, so Joab took three spears and stuck them through Absalom's chest. 
2SA.18.15	Ten of Joab's bodyguards came over and finished him off. 
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew a trumpet to signal his troops to stop chasing Israel's soldiers. 
2SA.18.17	They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and put a big pile of rocks over it.
2SA.18.17	Meanwhile, the people of Israel had all run back to their own homes.
2SA.18.18	When Absalom was alive, he had set up a stone monument for himself in King's Valley. He explained, “I don't have any sons
2SA.18.19	Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Joab, let me run and tell King David that the 
2SA.18.20	Joab answered, “You're not the one to tell the king that his son is dead. You can take him a message some other time, but not today.”
2SA.18.21	Someone from Ethiopia
2SA.18.22	Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again, “No matter what happens, I still want to go. And besides, the Ethiopian has already left.”
2SA.18.22	Joab said, “Why should you go? You won't get a reward for the news you have!”
2SA.18.23	“I'll run no matter what!” Ahimaaz insisted.
2SA.18.23	“All right then, run!” Joab said.
2SA.18.23	Ahimaaz took the road through the Jordan Valley and outran the Ethiopian.
2SA.18.24	Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates
2SA.18.25	and shouted down to tell David.
2SA.18.25	David answered, “If he's alone, he must have some news.”
2SA.18.25	The runner was getting closer, 
2SA.18.26	when the soldier saw someone else running. He shouted down to the gate, “Look! There's another runner!”
2SA.18.26	David said, “He must have some news too.”
2SA.18.27	The soldier on the roof shouted, “The first one runs just like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.”
2SA.18.27	This time David said, “He's a good man. He must have some good news.”
2SA.18.28	Ahimaaz called out, “We won! We won!” Then he bowed low to David and said, “Your Majesty, praise the 
2SA.18.29	“Is my son Absalom all right?” David asked.
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz said, “When Joab sent your personal servant and me, I saw a noisy crowd. But I don't know what it was all about.”
2SA.18.30	David told him, “Stand over there and wait.”
2SA.18.30	Ahimaaz went over and stood there. 
2SA.18.31	The Ethiopian came and said, “Your Majesty, today I have good news! The 
2SA.18.32	“Is my son Absalom all right?” David asked.
2SA.18.32	The Ethiopian replied, “I wish that all Your Majesty's enemies and everyone who tries to harm you would end up like him!”
2SA.18.33	David started trembling. Then he went up to the room above the city gate to cry. As he went, he kept saying, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I could have died instead of you! Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	Someone told Joab, “The king is crying because Absalom is dead.”
2SA.19.2	David's army found out he was crying because his son had died, and their day of victory suddenly turned into a day of sadness. 
2SA.19.3	The troops were sneaking into Mahanaim, just as if they had run away from a battle and were ashamed.
2SA.19.4	David covered his face with his hands and kept on crying loudly, “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him:
2SA.19.5	You've made your soldiers ashamed! Not only did they save your life, they saved your sons and daughters and wives as well. 
2SA.19.6	You're more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. What you've done today has shown your officers and soldiers that they don't mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive, even if the rest of us were dead.
2SA.19.7	Now get up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you don't, I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	David got up and went to the town gate and sat down. When the people heard that he was sitting there, they came to see him.
2SA.19.8	After Israel's soldiers had all returned home, 
2SA.19.9+2SA.19.10	everyone in Israel started arguing. They were saying to each other, “King David rescued us from the Philistines and from our other enemies. But then we chose Absalom to be our new leader, and David had to leave the country to get away. Absalom died in battle, so why hasn't something been done to bring David back?”
2SA.19.11	When David found out what they were saying, he sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. It said:
2SA.19.11	Say to the leaders of Judah, “Why are you the last tribe to think about bringing King David back home? 
2SA.19.12	He is your brother, your own relative! Why haven't you done anything to bring him back?”
2SA.19.13	And tell Amasa, “You're my nephew, and with God as a witness, I swear I'll make you commander of my army instead of Joab.”
2SA.19.14	Soon the tribe of Judah again became followers of David, and they sent him this message: “Come back, and bring your soldiers with you.”
2SA.19.15	David started back and had gone as far as the Jordan River when he met the people of Judah. They had gathered at Gilgal and had come to help him cross the river.
2SA.19.17	1,000 others from Benjamin had come with him.
2SA.19.17	Ziba, the chief servant of Saul's family, also came to the Jordan River. He and his 15 sons and 20 servants waded across
2SA.19.18	Then they brought David's family and servants back across the river, and they did everything he wanted them to do.
2SA.19.18	Shimei crossed the Jordan River and bowed down in front of David. 
2SA.19.19	He said, “Your Majesty, I beg you not to punish me! Please, forget what I did when you were leaving Jerusalem. Don't even think about it. 
2SA.19.20	I know I was wrong. That's why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you.”
2SA.19.21	But Abishai shouted, “You should be killed for cursing the 
2SA.19.22	David said, “Abishai, what will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong? I've been made king of all Israel today, and no one will be put to death!” 
2SA.19.23	Then David promised Shimei that he would not be killed.
2SA.19.26	He answered, “Your Majesty, you know I can't walk. I told my servant to saddle a donkey for me
2SA.19.27	then he lied about me. You're as wise as an angel of God, so do what you think is right. 
2SA.19.28	After all, you could have killed my whole family and me. But instead, you let me eat at your own table. Your Majesty, what more could I ask?”
2SA.19.29	David answered, “You've said enough! I've decided to divide the property
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth replied, “He can have it all! I'm just glad you've come home safely.”
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was 80 years old. He was very rich and had sent food to David in Mahanaim.
2SA.19.33	David said to him, “Cross the river and go to Jerusalem with me. I will take care of you.”
2SA.19.34	Barzillai answered:
2SA.19.34	Your Majesty, why should I go to Jerusalem? I don't have much longer to live. 
2SA.19.35	I'm already 80 years old, and my body is almost numb. I can't taste my food or hear the sound of singing, and I would be nothing but a burden. 
2SA.19.36	I'll cross the river with you, but I'll only go a little way on the other side. You don't have to be so kind to me. 
2SA.19.37	Just let me return to my hometown, where I can someday be buried near my father and mother. My servant Chimham
2SA.19.38	David said, “I'll take Chimham with me, and whatever you ask me to do for him, I'll do. And if there's anything else you want, I'll also do that.”
2SA.19.39	David's soldiers went on across the river, while he stayed behind to tell Barzillai goodbye and to wish him well. Barzillai returned home, but 
2SA.19.40	Chimham crossed the river with David.
2SA.19.40	All of Judah's army and half of Israel's army were there to help David cross the river. 
2SA.19.41	The soldiers from Israel came to him and said, “Why did our relatives from Judah secretly take you and your family and your soldiers across the Jordan?”
2SA.19.42	The people of Judah answered, “Why are you so angry? We are the king's relatives. He didn't give us any food, and we didn't take anything for ourselves!”
2SA.19.43	Those from Israel said, “King David belongs to us ten times more than he belongs to you.
2SA.19.43	The people of Judah argued more strongly than the people of Israel.
2SA.20.2	So they stopped following David and went off with Sheba. But the people of Judah stayed close to David all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.4	David said to Amasa, “Three days from now I want you and all of Judah's army to be here!”
2SA.20.5	Amasa started bringing the army together, but it was taking him more than three days. 
2SA.20.6	So David said to Abishai, “Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We don't want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.”
2SA.20.7	Abishai left Jerusalem to try and capture Sheba. He took along Joab and his soldiers, as well as David's bodyguard
2SA.20.8	They had gone as far as the big rock at Gibeon when Amasa caught up with them. Joab had a dagger strapped around his waist over his military uniform, but it fell out as he started toward Amasa.
2SA.20.9	Joab said, “Amasa, my cousin, how are you?” Then Joab took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand, so that he could greet him with a kiss. 
2SA.20.10	Amasa did not see the dagger in Joab's other hand. Joab stuck it in Amasa's stomach, and his insides spilled out on the ground. Joab only struck him once, but Amasa was dying.
2SA.20.10	Joab and his brother Abishai went off to chase Sheba. 
2SA.20.11	One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa and shouted, “If any of you are for Joab and David, then follow Joab!”
2SA.20.12	Amasa was still rolling in his own blood in the middle of the road. The soldier who had shouted noticed that everyone who passed by would stop, so he dragged Amasa off the road and covered him with a blanket. 
2SA.20.13	After this, no one else stopped. They all walked straight past him on their way to help Joab capture Sheba.
2SA.20.14	Sheba had gone through all of the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah. All of his best soldiers
2SA.20.15	Joab and his troops came and surrounded Abel, so that no one could go in or come out. They made a dirt ramp up to the town wall and then started to use a battering ram to knock the wall down.
2SA.20.16	A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall,
2SA.20.17	When he came, the woman said, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“Yes, I am,” he answered.
2SA.20.17	She said, “Please, listen to what I have to say.”
2SA.20.17	“All right,” he said. “I'll listen.”
2SA.20.18	She said, “Long ago people used to say, ‘If you want good advice, go to the town of Abel to get it.’ The answers they got here were all that was needed to settle any problem. 
2SA.20.19	We are Israelites, and we want peace! You can trust us. Why are you trying to destroy a town that's like a mother in Israel? Why do you want to wipe out the 
2SA.20.20	Joab answered, “No, no! I'm not trying to wipe you out or destroy your town! 
2SA.20.21	That's not it at all. There's a man in your town from the hill country of Ephraim. His name is Sheba, and he is the leader of a rebellion against King David. Turn him over to me, and we will leave your town alone.”
2SA.20.21	The woman told Joab, “We will throw his head over the wall.”
2SA.20.22	She went to the people of the town and talked them into doing it. They cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab.
2SA.20.22	Joab blew a signal on his trumpet, and the soldiers returned to their homes. Joab went back to David in Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	Joab was the commander of Israel's entire army.
2SA.20.23	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of David's bodyguard.
2SA.20.24	Adoram
2SA.20.24	Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept government records.
2SA.20.25	Sheva was the secretary.
2SA.20.25	Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
2SA.20.26	Ira from Jair was David's priest.
2SA.21.1	While David was king, there were three years in a row when the nation of Israel could not grow enough food. So David asked the 
2SA.21.2	David had the Gibeonites come, and he talked with them. 
2SA.21.3	He said, “What can I do to make up for what Saul did, so that you'll ask the 
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites answered, “Silver and gold from Saul and his family are not enough. On the other hand, we don't have the right to put any Israelite to death.”
2SA.21.4	David said, “I'll do whatever you ask.”
2SA.21.5	They replied, “Saul tried to kill all our people so that none of us would be left in the land of Israel. 
2SA.21.6	Give us seven of his descendants. We will hang
2SA.21.6	“I'll give them to you,” David said.
2SA.21.8	 But Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth. Saul's daughter Merab
2SA.21.9	turned them over to the Gibeonites, who hanged
2SA.21.10	Rizpah spread out some sackcloth
2SA.21.13+2SA.21.14	David had their bones taken to the land of Benjamin and buried in a side room in Saul's family burial place. Then he gave orders for the bones of the men who had been hanged
2SA.21.15	One time David got very tired when he and his soldiers were fighting the Philistines. 
2SA.21.16	One of the Philistine warriors was Ishbibenob, who was a descendant of the Rephaim,
2SA.21.17	 But Abishai
2SA.21.17	David's soldiers told him, “We can't let you risk your life in battle anymore! You give light to our nation, and we want that flame to keep burning.”
2SA.21.18	There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob, where Sibbecai from Hushah killed a descendant of the Rephaim named Saph.
2SA.21.19	There was still another battle with the Philistines at Gob. A soldier named Elhanan killed Goliath
2SA.21.20	There was another war, this time in Gath. One of the enemy soldiers was a descendant of the Rephaim. He was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. 
2SA.21.21	But when he made fun of Israel, David's nephew Jonathan killed him. Jonathan was the son of David's brother Shimei.
2SA.21.22	David and his soldiers killed these four men who were descendants of the Rephaim from Gath.
2SA.22.1	David sang a song to the 
2SA.22.2	Our 
2SA.22.2	you are my mighty rock,
2SA.22.2	my fortress, my protector.
2SA.22.3	You are the rock
2SA.22.3	where I am safe.
2SA.22.3	You are my shield,
2SA.22.3	my powerful weapon,
2SA.22.3	and my place of shelter.
2SA.22.3	You rescue me and keep me
2SA.22.3	safe from violence.
2SA.22.4	I praise you, our 
2SA.22.4	I prayed to you,
2SA.22.4	and you rescued me
2SA.22.4	from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	Death, like ocean waves,
2SA.22.5	surrounded me,
2SA.22.5	and I was almost swallowed
2SA.22.5	by its flooding waters.
2SA.22.6	Ropes from the world
2SA.22.6	of the dead
2SA.22.6	had coiled around me,
2SA.22.6	and death had set a trap
2SA.22.6	in my path.
2SA.22.7	I was in terrible trouble
2SA.22.7	when I called out to you,
2SA.22.7	but from your temple
2SA.22.7	you heard me
2SA.22.7	and answered my prayer.
2SA.22.8	Earth shook and shivered!
2SA.22.8	The columns supporting the sky
2SA.22.8	rocked back and forth.
2SA.22.8	You were angry
2SA.22.9	and breathed out smoke.
2SA.22.9	Scorching heat and fiery flames
2SA.22.9	spewed from your mouth.
2SA.22.10	You opened the heavens
2SA.22.10	like curtains,
2SA.22.10	and you came down
2SA.22.10	with storm clouds
2SA.22.10	under your feet.
2SA.22.11	You rode on the backs
2SA.22.11	of flying creatures.
2SA.22.11	You appeared
2SA.22.11	with the wind as wings.
2SA.22.12	Darkness was your tent!
2SA.22.12	Thunderclouds filled the sky,
2SA.22.12	hiding you from sight.
2SA.22.13	Fiery coals lit up the sky
2SA.22.13	in front of you.
2SA.22.14	thundered from the heavens.
2SA.22.15	You scattered your enemies
2SA.22.15	with arrows of lightning.
2SA.22.16	You roared at the sea,
2SA.22.16	and its deepest channels
2SA.22.16	could be seen.
2SA.22.16	You snorted,
2SA.22.16	and the earth shook
2SA.22.16	to its foundations.
2SA.22.17	You reached down from heaven,
2SA.22.17	and you lifted me
2SA.22.17	from deep in the ocean.
2SA.22.18	You rescued me from enemies
2SA.22.18	who were hateful
2SA.22.18	and too powerful for me.
2SA.22.19	On the day disaster struck,
2SA.22.19	they came and attacked,
2SA.22.19	but you defended me.
2SA.22.20	When I was fenced in,
2SA.22.20	you freed and rescued me
2SA.22.20	because you love me.
2SA.22.21	You are good to me, 
2SA.22.21	because I do right,
2SA.22.21	and you reward me
2SA.22.21	because I am innocent.
2SA.22.22	I do what you want
2SA.22.22	and never turn to do evil.
2SA.22.23	I keep your laws in mind
2SA.22.23	and never turn away
2SA.22.23	from your teachings.
2SA.22.24	I obey you completely
2SA.22.24	and guard against sin.
2SA.22.25	You have been good to me
2SA.22.25	because I do right;
2SA.22.25	you have rewarded me
2SA.22.25	for being innocent
2SA.22.25	by your standards.
2SA.22.26	You are always loyal
2SA.22.26	to your loyal people,
2SA.22.26	and you are faithful
2SA.22.26	to the faithful.
2SA.22.27	With all who are sincere
2SA.22.27	you are sincere,
2SA.22.27	but you treat the unfaithful
2SA.22.27	as their deeds deserve.
2SA.22.28	You rescue the humble,
2SA.22.28	but you look for ways
2SA.22.28	to put down the proud.
2SA.22.29	Our 
2SA.22.29	you are my lamp.
2SA.22.29	You turn darkness to light.
2SA.22.30	You help me defeat armies
2SA.22.30	and capture cities.
2SA.22.31	Your way is perfect, 
2SA.22.31	and your word is correct.
2SA.22.31	You are a shield for those
2SA.22.31	who run to you for help.
2SA.22.32	You alone are God!
2SA.22.32	Only you are a mighty rock.
2SA.22.33	You are my strong fortress,
2SA.22.33	and you set me free.
2SA.22.34	as those of a deer,
2SA.22.34	and you help me stand
2SA.22.34	on the mountains.
2SA.22.35	You teach my hands to fight
2SA.22.35	and my arms to use
2SA.22.35	a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You alone are my shield,
2SA.22.36	and by coming to help me,
2SA.22.36	you have made me famous.
2SA.22.37	You clear the way for me,
2SA.22.37	and now I won't stumble.
2SA.22.38	I kept chasing my enemies
2SA.22.38	until I caught them
2SA.22.38	and destroyed them.
2SA.22.39	I destroyed them!
2SA.22.39	I stuck my sword
2SA.22.39	through my enemies,
2SA.22.39	and they were crushed
2SA.22.39	under my feet.
2SA.22.40	You helped me win victories
2SA.22.40	and forced my attackers
2SA.22.40	to fall victim to me.
2SA.22.41	You made my enemies run,
2SA.22.41	and I killed them.
2SA.22.42	They cried out for help,
2SA.22.42	but no one saved them;
2SA.22.42	they called out to you,
2SA.22.42	but there was no answer.
2SA.22.43	I ground them to dust,
2SA.22.43	and I squashed them
2SA.22.43	like mud in the streets.
2SA.22.44	You rescued me
2SA.22.44	from my stubborn people
2SA.22.44	and made me the leader
2SA.22.44	of foreign nations,
2SA.22.44	who are now my slaves.
2SA.22.45	They obey and come crawling.
2SA.22.46	They have lost all courage
2SA.22.46	and from their fortresses
2SA.22.46	they come trembling.
2SA.22.47	You are the living 
2SA.22.47	I will praise you!
2SA.22.47	You are a mighty rock.
2SA.22.47	I will honor you
2SA.22.47	for keeping me safe.
2SA.22.48	You took revenge for me,
2SA.22.48	and you put nations
2SA.22.48	in my power.
2SA.22.49	You protected me
2SA.22.49	from violent enemies,
2SA.22.49	and you made me much greater
2SA.22.49	than all of them.
2SA.22.50	and I will honor you
2SA.22.50	among the nations.
2SA.22.51	You give glorious victories
2SA.22.51	to your chosen king.
2SA.22.51	Your faithful love for David
2SA.22.51	and for his descendants
2SA.22.51	will never end.
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David the son of Jesse.
2SA.23.1	The God of Jacob chose David
2SA.23.1	and made him a great king.
2SA.23.1	The Mighty God of Israel
2SA.23.1	loved him.
2SA.23.1	When God told him to speak,
2SA.23.1	David said:
2SA.23.2	The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	has told me what to say.
2SA.23.3	Our Mighty Rock,
2SA.23.3	the God of Jacob, told me,
2SA.23.3	“A ruler who obeys God
2SA.23.3	and does right
2SA.23.4	is like the sunrise
2SA.23.4	on a cloudless day,
2SA.23.4	or like rain that sparkles
2SA.23.4	on the grass.”
2SA.23.5	I have ruled this way,
2SA.23.5	and God will never break
2SA.23.5	his promise to me.
2SA.23.5	God's promise is complete
2SA.23.5	and unchanging;
2SA.23.5	he will always help me
2SA.23.5	and give me what I hope for.
2SA.23.6	But evil people are pulled up
2SA.23.6	like thornbushes.
2SA.23.6	They are not dug up by hand,
2SA.23.7	but with a sharp spear
2SA.23.7	and are burned on the spot.
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David's warriors:
2SA.23.8	Ishbosheth
2SA.23.9	The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran, 
2SA.23.10	except Eleazar. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped, and he couldn't let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies' weapons and armor. The 
2SA.23.11	Next was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. One time the Philistines brought their army together to destroy a crop of peas growing in a field near Lehi. The rest of Israel's soldiers ran away from the Philistines, 
2SA.23.12	but Shammah stood in the middle of the field and killed the Philistines. The crops were saved, and the 
2SA.23.13	One year at harvest time, the Three Warriors
2SA.23.14	and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in his fortress, 
2SA.23.15	and he was very thirsty. He said, “I wish I had a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem.”
2SA.23.16	The Three Warriors
2SA.23.17	and said to the 
2SA.23.17	The Three Warriors did these brave deeds.
2SA.23.18	Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors,
2SA.23.19	and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors, but he still did not become one of the Three Warriors.
2SA.23.20	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moab's best fighters,
2SA.23.21	Another time, he killed an Egyptian, as big as a giant.
2SA.23.22+2SA.23.23	Benaiah did these things. He never became one of the Three Warriors, but he was just as famous as they were and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. David made him the leader of his bodyguard.

2SA.24.1	The 
2SA.24.2	So David told Joab and the army officers,
2SA.24.3	Joab answered, “I hope the 
2SA.24.4	But when David refused to change his mind, Joab and the army officers went out and started counting the people. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed the Jordan River and began with
2SA.24.6	They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria.
2SA.24.7	They came to the fortress of Tyre, then went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah. 
2SA.24.8	After they had gone through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It had taken them 9 months and 20 days.
2SA.24.9	Joab came and told David, “In Israel there are 800,000 who can serve in the army, and in Judah there are 500,000.”
2SA.24.10	After everyone had been counted, David realized he had done wrong. He told the 
2SA.24.11	Before David even got up the next morning, the 
2SA.24.12+2SA.24.13	to take a message to David. Gad went to David and told him:
2SA.24.12+2SA.24.13	You must choose one of three ways for the 
2SA.24.14	David was really frightened and said, “It's a terrible choice to make! But the 
2SA.24.15+2SA.24.16	So that morning, the 
2SA.24.15+2SA.24.16	When the angel was about to destroy Jerusalem, the 
2SA.24.17	David saw the angel killing everyone and told the 
2SA.24.18+2SA.24.19	That same day the prophet Gad came and told David, “Go to the threshing place that belongs to Araunah and build an altar there for the 
2SA.24.18+2SA.24.19	So David went.
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked and saw David and his soldiers coming up toward him. He went over to David, bowed down low, 
2SA.24.21	and said, “Your Majesty! Why have you come to see me?”
2SA.24.21	David answered, “I've come to buy your threshing place. I have to build the 
2SA.24.22	Araunah said, “Take whatever you want and offer your sacrifice. Here are some oxen for the sacrifice. You can use the threshing-boards
2SA.24.23	Take them—they're yours! I hope the 
2SA.24.24	But David answered, “No! I have to pay you what they're worth. I can't offer the 
2SA.24.25	Then he built an altar for the 
2SA.24.25	The 
1KI.1.1	King David was now an old man, and he always felt cold, even under a lot of blankets. 
1KI.1.2	His officials said, “Your Majesty, we will look for a young woman to take care of you. She can lie down beside you and keep you warm.” 
1KI.1.3+1KI.1.4	They looked everywhere in Israel until they found a very beautiful young woman named Abishag, who lived in the town of Shunem.
1KI.1.7	Adonijah met with Joab the son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest and asked them if they would help him become king. Both of them agreed to help. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei,
1KI.1.9	Adonijah invited his brothers and David's officials from Judah to go with him to Crawling Rock
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan, Benaiah, David's bodyguards, or his own brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	Have you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has made himself king? But David doesn't know a thing about it. 
1KI.1.12	You and your son Solomon will be killed, unless you do what I tell you. 
1KI.1.13	Go say to David, “You promised me that Solomon would be the next king. So why is Adonijah now king?”
1KI.1.14	While you are still talking to David, I'll come in and tell him that everything you said is true.
1KI.1.15	Meanwhile, David was in his bedroom where Abishag was taking care of him because he was so old. Bathsheba went in 
1KI.1.16	and bowed down.
1KI.1.16	“What can I do for you?” David asked.
1KI.1.17	Bathsheba answered:
1KI.1.17	Your Majesty, you promised me in the name of the 
1KI.1.18	But Adonijah has already been made king, and you didn't know anything about it. 
1KI.1.19	He sacrificed a lot of cattle, calves, and sheep. And he invited Abiathar the priest, Joab your army commander, and all your sons to be there, except Solomon, your loyal servant.
1KI.1.20	Your Majesty, everyone in Israel is waiting for you to announce who will be the next king. 
1KI.1.21	If you don't, they will say that Solomon and I have rebelled. They will treat us like criminals and kill us as soon as you die.
1KI.1.22	Just then, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
1KI.1.23	Someone told David that he was there, and Nathan came in. He bowed with his face to the ground 
1KI.1.24	and said:
1KI.1.24	Your Majesty, did you say that Adonijah would be king? 
1KI.1.25	Earlier today, he sacrificed a lot of cattle, calves, and sheep. He invited the army commanders, Abiathar, and all your sons to be there. They are already eating and drinking and shouting, “Long live King Adonijah!” 
1KI.1.26	But he didn't invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Did you say they could do this without telling the rest of us who would be the next king?
1KI.1.28	David said, “Tell Bathsheba to come here.” She came and stood in front of him. 
1KI.1.29+1KI.1.30	Then he said, “The living 
1KI.1.31	Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Your Majesty, I pray that you will live a long time!”
1KI.1.32	Then David said, “Tell Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah to come here.”
1KI.1.32	When they arrived, 
1KI.1.33	he told them:
1KI.1.33	Take along some of my officials and let Solomon ride my own mule to Gihon Spring. 
1KI.1.34	When you get there, Zadok and Nathan will pour olive oil over Solomon's head to show that he is the new king of Israel. Then order someone to blow a trumpet and tell everyone to shout, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.35	Bring him back here, and he will take my place as king. He is the one I have chosen to rule Israel and Judah.
1KI.1.36	Benaiah answered, “We will do it, Your Majesty. I pray that the 
1KI.1.37	The 
1KI.1.38	Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah left and took along the two groups of David's special bodyguards.
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest brought some olive oil from the sacred tent and poured it on Solomon's head to show that he was now king. A trumpet was blown and everyone shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	Then they played flutes and celebrated as they followed Solomon back to Jerusalem. They made so much noise that the ground shook.
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and his guests had almost finished eating when they heard the noise. Joab also heard the trumpet and asked, “What's all that noise about in the city?”
1KI.1.42	Just then, Jonathan son of Abiathar came running up. “Come in,” Adonijah said. “An important man like you must have some good news.”
1KI.1.43	Jonathan answered:
1KI.1.43	No, I don't! David has just announced that Solomon will be king. 
1KI.1.44+1KI.1.45	Solomon rode David's own mule to Gihon Spring, and Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and David's special bodyguards
1KI.1.46	Solomon is now king.
1KI.1.47	And listen to this! David's officials told him, “We pray that your God will help Solomon to be an even greater king!”
1KI.1.47	David was in his bed at the time, but he bowed 
1KI.1.48	and prayed, “I praise you, 
1KI.1.49	Adonijah's guests shook with fear when they heard this news, and they left as fast as they could. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah himself was afraid of what Solomon might do to him, so he ran to the sacred tent and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar for protection.
1KI.1.51	Someone told Solomon, “Adonijah is afraid of you and is holding onto the corners of the altar. He wants you to promise that you won't kill him.”
1KI.1.52	Solomon answered, “If Adonijah doesn't cause any trouble, I won't hurt him. But if he does, I'll have him killed.” 
1KI.1.53	Then he sent someone to the altar to get Adonijah.
1KI.1.53	After Adonijah came and bowed down, Solomon said, “Adonijah, go home.”
1KI.2.1	Not long before David died, he told Solomon:
1KI.2.2	My son, I will soon die, as everyone must. But I want you to be strong and brave. 
1KI.2.3	Do what the 
1KI.2.4	You and your descendants must always faithfully obey the 
1KI.2.6	in the way you think best. Whatever you do, don't let him die peacefully in his old age.
1KI.2.9	Now you must punish him. He's an old man, but you're wise enough to know that you must have him killed.
1KI.2.12	 His son Solomon became king and took control of David's kingdom.
1KI.2.13	One day, Adonijah went to see Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and she asked, “Is this a friendly visit?”
1KI.2.13	“Yes. 
1KI.2.14	I just want to talk with you.”
1KI.2.14	“All right,” she told him, “go ahead.”
1KI.2.15	“You know that I was king for a little while,” Adonijah replied. “And everyone in Israel accepted me as their ruler. But the 
1KI.2.16	Would you do me a favor?”
1KI.2.16	“What do you want?” Bathsheba asked.
1KI.2.18	“All right,” she said. “I'll ask him.”
1KI.2.19	When Bathsheba went to see Solomon, he stood up to meet her, then bowed low. He sat back down and had another throne brought in, so his mother could sit at his right side.
1KI.2.20	Bathsheba sat down and then asked, “Would you do me a small favor?”
1KI.2.20	Solomon replied, “Mother, just tell me what you want, and I will do it.”
1KI.2.21	“Allow your brother Adonijah to marry Abishag,” she answered.
1KI.2.22	Solomon said:
1KI.2.22	What? Let my older brother marry Abishag? You may as well ask me to let him rule the kingdom! And why don't you ask such favors for Abiathar and Joab?
1KI.2.23	I swear in the name of the 
1KI.2.24	The 
1KI.2.25	“Benaiah,” Solomon shouted, “go kill Adonijah.” So Adonijah died.
1KI.2.26	Abiathar, go back home to Anathoth! You ought to be killed too, but I won't do it now. When my father David was king, you were in charge of the sacred chest, and you went through a lot of hard times with my father. 
1KI.2.27	 But I won't let you be a priest of the 
1KI.2.27	And so the promise that the 
1KI.2.28	Joab had not helped Absalom try to become king, but he had helped Adonijah. So when Joab learned that Adonijah had been killed, he ran to the sacred tent and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar for protection.
1KI.2.29	When Solomon heard about this, he sent someone to ask Joab, “Why did you run to the altar?”
1KI.2.29	Joab sent back his answer, “I was afraid of you, and I ran to the 
1KI.2.29	Then Solomon shouted, “Benaiah, go kill Joab!”
1KI.2.30	Benaiah went to the sacred tent and yelled, “Joab, the king orders you to come out!”
1KI.2.30	“No!” Joab answered. “Kill me right here.”
1KI.2.30	Benaiah went back and told Solomon what Joab had said.
1KI.2.31+1KI.2.32	Solomon replied:
1KI.2.31+1KI.2.32	Do what Joab said. Kill him and bury him! Then my family and I won't be responsible for what he did to Abner the commander of Israel's army and to Amasa the commander of Judah's army. He killed those innocent men without my father knowing about it. Both of them were better men than Joab. Now the 
1KI.2.33	Joab's family will always suffer because of what he did, but the 
1KI.2.34	Benaiah went back and killed Joab. His body was taken away and buried near his home in the desert.
1KI.2.35	Solomon put Benaiah in Joab's place as army commander, and he put Zadok in Abiathar's place as priest.
1KI.2.36	Solomon sent for Shimei and said, “Build a house here in Jerusalem and live in it. But whatever you do, don't leave the city! 
1KI.2.37	If you ever cross Kidron Valley and leave Jerusalem, you will be killed. And it will be your own fault.”
1KI.2.38	“That's fair, Your Majesty,” Shimei answered. “I'll do that.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem from then on.
1KI.2.39	About three years later, two of Shimei's servants ran off to King Achish in Gath. When Shimei found out where they were, 
1KI.2.40	he saddled his donkey and went after them. He found them and brought them back to Jerusalem.
1KI.2.41	Someone told Solomon that Shimei had gone to Gath and was back. 
1KI.2.42	Solomon sent for him and said:
1KI.2.42	Shimei, you promised in the name of the 
1KI.2.43	You have disobeyed me and have broken the promise you made to the 
1KI.2.44	I know you remember all the cruel things you did to my father David. Now the 
1KI.2.45	But the 
1KI.2.46	“Benaiah,” Solomon shouted, “kill Shimei.” So Shimei died.
1KI.2.46	Solomon was now in complete control of his kingdom.
1KI.3.1	Solomon signed a treaty with the king of Egypt and married his daughter. She lived in the older part of Jerusalem
1KI.3.2	At that time, there was no temple for worshiping the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.5	One night while Solomon was in Gibeon, the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon answered:
1KI.3.6	My father David, your servant, was honest and did what you commanded. You were always loyal to him, and you gave him a son who is now king. 
1KI.3.7	 God, I'm your servant, and you've made me king in my father's place. But I'm very young and know so little about being a leader. 
1KI.3.8	And now I must rule your chosen people, even though there are too many of them to count.
1KI.3.9	Please make me wise and teach me the difference between right and wrong. Then I will know how to rule your people. If you don't, there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours.
1KI.3.10+1KI.3.11	God said:
1KI.3.10+1KI.3.11	Solomon, I'm pleased that you asked for this. You could have asked to live a long time or to be rich. Or you could have asked for your enemies to be destroyed. Instead, you asked for wisdom to make right decisions. 
1KI.3.12	So I'll make you wiser than anyone who has ever lived or ever will live.
1KI.3.13	I'll also give you what you didn't ask for. You'll be rich and respected as long as you live, and you'll be greater than any other king. 
1KI.3.14	If you obey me and follow my commands, as your father David did, I'll let you live a long time.
1KI.3.15	Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream. He went back to Jerusalem and stood in front of the sacred chest, where he offered sacrifices to please the Lord
1KI.3.16	One day two women
1KI.3.17	and one of them said:
1KI.3.17	Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. Not long ago my baby was born at home, 
1KI.3.18	and three days later her baby was born. Nobody else was there with us.
1KI.3.19	One night while we were all asleep, she rolled over on her baby, and he died. 
1KI.3.20	Then while I was still asleep, she got up and took my son out of my bed. She put him in her bed, then she put her dead baby next to me.
1KI.3.21	In the morning when I got up to feed my son, I saw that he was dead. But when I looked at him in the light, I knew he wasn't my son.
1KI.3.22	“No!” the other woman shouted. “He was your son. My baby is alive!”
1KI.3.22	“The dead baby is yours,” the first woman yelled. “Mine is alive!”
1KI.3.22	They argued back and forth in front of Solomon, 
1KI.3.23	until finally he said, “Both of you say this live baby is yours. 
1KI.3.24	Someone bring me a sword.”
1KI.3.24	A sword was brought, and Solomon ordered, 
1KI.3.25	“Cut the baby in half! That way each of you can have part of him.”
1KI.3.26	“Please don't kill my son,” the baby's mother screamed. “Your Majesty, I love him very much, but give him to her. Just don't kill him.”
1KI.3.26	The other woman shouted, “Go ahead and cut him in half. Then neither of us will have the baby.”
1KI.3.27	Solomon said, “Don't kill the baby.” Then he pointed to the first woman, “She is his real mother. Give the baby to her.”
1KI.3.28	Everyone in Israel was amazed when they heard how Solomon had made his decision. They realized that God had given him wisdom to judge fairly.

1KI.4.13	The son of Geber was in charge of the town of Ramoth in Gilead and the villages in Gilead belonging to the family of Jair, a descendant of Manasseh. He was also in charge of the region of Argob in Bashan, which had 60 walled towns with bronze bars on their gates.

1KI.4.19	And one officer was in charge of the territory of Judah.
1KI.4.20	There were so many people living in Judah and Israel while Solomon was king that they seemed like grains of sand on a beach. Everyone had enough to eat and drink, and they were happy.
1KI.4.22	Every day, Solomon needed 5,000 liters of fine flour, 10,000 liters of coarsely-ground flour, 
1KI.4.23	10 grain-fed cattle, 20 pasture-fed cattle, 100 sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, and geese.
1KI.4.24	Solomon ruled the whole region west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and he was at peace with all of the countries around him. 
1KI.4.25	Everyone living in Israel, from the town of Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, was safe as long as Solomon lived. Each family sat undisturbed beneath its own grape vines and fig trees.
1KI.4.27	Each of the twelve regional officers brought food to Solomon and his household for one month of the year. They provided everything he needed, 
1KI.4.28	as well as barley and straw for the horses.
1KI.4.29	Solomon was brilliant. God had blessed him with insight and understanding. 
1KI.4.30+1KI.4.31	 He was wiser than anyone else in the world, including the wisest people of the east and of Egypt. He was even wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Mahol's three sons, Heman, Calcol, and Darda. Solomon became famous in every country around Judah and Israel. 
1KI.4.32	 Solomon wrote 3,000 wise sayings and composed more than 1,000 songs. 
1KI.4.33	He could talk about all kinds of plants, from large trees to small bushes, and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	Kings all over the world heard about Solomon's wisdom and sent people to listen to him teach.
1KI.5.1	King Hiram of Tyre
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent a message back to Hiram:
1KI.5.3	Remember how my father David wanted to build a temple where the 
1KI.5.4	Now, thanks to the 
1KI.5.6	I'd like you to send your workers to cut down cedar trees in Lebanon for me. I will pay them whatever you say and will even have my workers help them. We both know that your workers are more experienced than anyone else at cutting lumber.
1KI.5.7	Hiram was so happy when he heard Solomon's request that he said, “I am grateful that the 
1KI.5.8	Then he sent back his answer:
1KI.5.8	I received your message and will give you all the cedar and pine logs you need. 
1KI.5.9	My workers will carry them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea. They will tie the logs together and float them along the coast to wherever you want them. Then they will untie the logs, and your workers can take them from there.
1KI.5.9	To pay for the logs, you can provide the grain I need for my household.
1KI.5.10	Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he needed. 
1KI.5.11	In return, Solomon gave Hiram over 2,000 tons of wheat and almost 4,000 liters of pure olive oil each year.
1KI.5.12	The 
1KI.5.13	Solomon ordered 30,000 people from all over Israel to cut logs for the temple, 
1KI.5.14	 and he put Adoniram in charge of these workers. Solomon divided them into three groups of 10,000. Each group worked one month in Lebanon and had two months off at home.
1KI.5.15	He also had 80,000 workers to cut stone in the hill country of Israel, 70,000 workers to carry the stones, 
1KI.5.16	and over 3,000 assistants to keep track of the work and to supervise the workers. 
1KI.5.17	He ordered the workers to cut and shape large blocks of good stone for the foundation of the temple.
1KI.5.18	Solomon's and Hiram's men worked with men from the city of Gebal,
1KI.6.1	Solomon's workers started building the temple during Ziv,
1KI.6.2	The inside of the 
1KI.6.3	A four-and-a-half-meter porch went all the way across the front of the temple. 
1KI.6.4	The windows were narrow on the outside but wide on the inside.
1KI.6.5+1KI.6.6	Along the sides and back of the temple, there were three levels of storage rooms. The rooms on the bottom level were just over two meters wide, the rooms on the middle level were over two and a half meters wide, and those on the top level were just over three meters wide. There were ledges on the outside of the temple that supported the beams of the storage rooms, so that nothing was built into the temple walls.
1KI.6.7	Solomon did not want the noise of hammers and axes to be heard at the place where the temple was being built. So he gave orders for the workers to shape the blocks of stone at the quarry.
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the bottom storage rooms was on the south side of the building, and stairs to the other rooms were also there. 
1KI.6.9	The roof of the temple was made out of beams and cedar boards.
1KI.6.9	The workers finished building the outside of the temple. 
1KI.6.10	Storage rooms just over two meters high were all around the temple, and they were attached to the temple by cedar beams.
1KI.6.11	The 
1KI.6.12+1KI.6.13	If you obey my commands and do what I say, I will keep the promise I made to your father David. I will live among my people Israel in this temple you are building, and I will not desert them.
1KI.6.14	So Solomon's workers finished building the temple.
1KI.6.15	The floor of the temple was made out of pine, and the walls were lined with cedar from floor to ceiling.
1KI.6.17	The temple's main room was 18 meters long, and it was in front of the most holy place.
1KI.6.18	The inside walls were lined with cedar to hide the stones, and the cedar was decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers.
1KI.6.19	The sacred chest was kept in the most holy place. 
1KI.6.20+1KI.6.21+1KI.6.22	 This room was nine meters long, nine meters wide, and nine meters high, and it was lined with pure gold. There were also gold chains across the front of the most holy place. The inside of the temple, as well as the cedar altar in the most holy place, was covered with gold.
1KI.6.24+1KI.6.25+1KI.6.26	and four and a half meters across. They had two wings, and the wings were just over two meters long. 
1KI.6.27	Solomon put them next to each other in the most holy place. Their wings were spread out and reached across the room. 
1KI.6.28	The creatures were also covered with gold.
1KI.6.29	The walls of the two rooms were decorated with carvings of palm trees, flowers, and winged creatures. 
1KI.6.30	Even the floor was covered with gold.
1KI.6.31+1KI.6.32	The two doors to the most holy place were made out of olive wood and were decorated with carvings of palm trees, flowers, and winged creatures. The doors and the carvings were covered with gold. The door frame came to a point at the top.
1KI.6.33+1KI.6.34	The two doors to the main room of the temple were made out of pine, and each one had two sections
1KI.6.35	The doors were covered with gold and were decorated with carvings of palm trees, flowers, and winged creatures.
1KI.6.36	The inner courtyard of the temple had walls made out of three layers of cut stones with one layer of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	Work began on the temple during Ziv,
1KI.6.38	Seven years later the workers finished building it during Bul,
1KI.7.1	Solomon's palace took 13 years to build.
1KI.7.2+1KI.7.3	Forest Hall was the largest room in the palace. It was 44 meters long, 22 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high, and was lined with cedar from Lebanon. It had 4 rows of cedar pillars, 15 in a row, and they held up 45 cedar beams. The ceiling was covered with cedar. 
1KI.7.4	Three rows of windows on each side faced each other, 
1KI.7.5	and there were three doors on each side near the front of the hall.
1KI.7.6	Pillar Hall was 22 meters long and 13.5 meters wide. A covered porch supported by pillars went all the way across the front of the hall.
1KI.7.7	Solomon's throne was in Justice Hall, where he judged cases. This hall was completely lined with cedar.
1KI.7.9	From the foundation all the way to the top, these buildings and the courtyard were made out of the best stones
1KI.7.10	The foundation stones were huge, good stones—some of them four and a half meters long and others three and a half meters long. 
1KI.7.11	The cedar beams and other stones that had been cut to size were on top of these foundation stones. 
1KI.7.12	The walls around the palace courtyard were made out of three layers of cut stones with one layer of cedar beams, just like the front porch and the inner courtyard of the temple.
1KI.7.13+1KI.7.14	Hiram was a skilled bronze worker from the city of Tyre.
1KI.7.13+1KI.7.14	King Solomon asked Hiram to come to Jerusalem and make the bronze furnishings to use for worship in the 
1KI.7.15	Hiram made two bronze columns eight meters tall and almost two meters across. 
1KI.7.16	For the top of each column, he also made a bronze cap just over two meters high. 
1KI.7.17	The caps were decorated with seven rows of designs that looked like chains,
1KI.7.18	with two rows of designs that looked like pomegranates.
1KI.7.19	The caps for the columns of the porch were almost two meters high and were shaped like lilies.
1KI.7.20	The chain designs on the caps were right above the rounded tops of the two columns, and there were 200 pomegranates in rows around each cap. 
1KI.7.21	Hiram placed the two columns on each side of the main door of the temple. The column on the south side was called Jachin,
1KI.7.22	The lily-shaped caps were on top of the columns.
1KI.7.22	This completed the work on the columns.
1KI.7.23	Hiram also made a large bowl called the Sea. It was just over two meters deep, about 4.5 meters across, and 13.5 meters around. 
1KI.7.24	Two rows of bronze gourds were around the outer edge of the bowl, ten gourds to every 45 centimeters. 
1KI.7.25	The bowl itself sat on top of twelve bronze bulls with three bulls facing outward in each of four directions. 
1KI.7.26	The sides of the bowl were 75 millimeters thick, and its rim was like a cup that curved outward like flower petals. The bowl held about 40,000 liters.
1KI.7.27	Hiram made ten movable bronze stands, each one over a meter high, almost two meters long, and almost two meters wide. 
1KI.7.28+1KI.7.29	The sides were made with panels attached to frames decorated with flower designs. The panels themselves were decorated with figures of lions, bulls, and winged creatures. 
1KI.7.30+1KI.7.31	Each stand had four bronze wheels and axles and a round frame 68 centimeters across, held up by four supports 45 centimeters high. A small bowl rested in the frame. The supports were decorated with flower designs, and the frame with carvings.
1KI.7.30+1KI.7.31	The side panels of the stands were square, 
1KI.7.32	and the wheels and axles were underneath them. The wheels were about 68 centimeters high 
1KI.7.33	and looked like chariot wheels. The axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were made out of bronze.
1KI.7.34+1KI.7.35	Around the top of each stand was a 22-centimeter strip, and there were four braces
1KI.7.36	and the stands were decorated with flower designs and figures of lions, palm trees, and winged creatures. 
1KI.7.37	Hiram made the ten bronze stands from the same mold, so they were exactly the same size and shape.
1KI.7.39	He put five stands on the south side of the temple, five stands on the north side, and the large bowl at the southeast corner of the temple.
1KI.7.40	Hiram made pans for hot ashes, and also shovels and sprinkling bowls.
1KI.7.40	This is a list of the bronze items that Hiram made for the 
1KI.7.41	two columns; two bowl-shaped caps for the tops of the columns; two chain designs on the caps; 
1KI.7.42	400 pomegranates
1KI.7.43	ten movable stands; ten small bowls for the stands; 
1KI.7.44	a large bowl; twelve bulls that held up the bowl; 
1KI.7.45	pans for hot ashes, and also shovels and sprinkling bowls.
1KI.7.45	Hiram made these bronze things for Solomon 
1KI.7.46	near the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan by pouring melted bronze into clay molds.
1KI.7.47	There were so many bronze things that Solomon never bothered to weigh them, and no one ever knew how much bronze was used.
1KI.7.49	 ten lampstands that went in front of the most holy place; flower designs; lamps and tongs; 
1KI.7.50	cups, lamp snuffers, and small sprinkling bowls; dishes for incense; fire pans; and the hinges for the doors to the most holy place and the main room of the temple.
1KI.8.1+1KI.8.2	Solomon called together the important leaders of Israel. 
1KI.8.3+1KI.8.4	Then the priests and the Levites carried to the temple the sacred chest, the sacred tent, and the objects used for worship. 
1KI.8.5	Solomon and a crowd of people stood in front of the chest and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted.
1KI.8.6	The priests carried the chest into the most holy place and put it under the winged creatures, 
1KI.8.7	whose wings covered both the chest and the poles used for carrying it. 
1KI.8.8	The poles were so long that they could be seen from right outside the most holy place, but not from anywhere else. And they stayed there from then on.
1KI.8.11	The 
1KI.8.12	 Then Solomon prayed:
1KI.8.12	“Our 
1KI.8.12	would live in a dark cloud.
1KI.8.13	Now I have built a glorious temple
1KI.8.13	where you can live forever.”
1KI.8.14	Solomon turned toward the people standing there. Then he blessed them 
1KI.8.15+1KI.8.16	 and said:
1KI.8.15+1KI.8.16	Praise the 
1KI.8.18	the 
1KI.8.19	 But you're not the one to do it. Your son will build a temple to honor me.”
1KI.8.20	The 
1KI.8.21	I've also made a place in the temple for the sacred chest. And in that chest are the two flat stones on which is written the solemn agreement the 
1KI.8.22	Solomon stood facing the altar with everyone standing behind him. Then he lifted his arms toward heaven 
1KI.8.23	and prayed:
1KI.8.23	You never forget the agreement you made with your people, and you are loyal to anyone who faithfully obeys your teachings. 
1KI.8.24	My father David was your servant, and today you have kept every promise you made to him.
1KI.8.26	Please keep this promise you made to your servant David.
1KI.8.28	But I ask you to answer my prayer. 
1KI.8.29	 This is the temple where you have chosen to be worshiped. Please watch over it day and night and listen when I turn toward it and pray. 
1KI.8.30	I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you. So whenever any of us look toward this temple and pray, answer from your home in heaven and forgive our sins.
1KI.8.31	Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime, and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say, “I swear I am innocent!” 
1KI.8.32	Listen from heaven and decide who is right. Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free.
1KI.8.34	listen from your home in heaven. Forgive them and bring them back to the land you gave their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	Suppose your people sin against you, and you punish them by holding back the rain. If they turn toward this temple and pray in your name and stop sinning, 
1KI.8.36	listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. The people of Israel are your servants, so teach them to live right. And please send rain on the land you gave them to be theirs forever.
1KI.8.37	Sometimes the crops may dry up or rot or be eaten by locusts
1KI.8.38	Listen when anyone in Israel truly feels sorry and sincerely prays with arms lifted toward your temple. 
1KI.8.39	You know what is in everyone's heart. So from your home in heaven answer their prayers, according to the way they live and what is in their hearts. 
1KI.8.40	Then your people will worship and obey you for as long as they live in the land you gave their ancestors.
1KI.8.41+1KI.8.42	Foreigners will hear about you and your mighty power, and some of them will come to live among your people Israel. If any of them pray toward this temple, 
1KI.8.43	listen from your home in heaven and answer their prayers. Then everyone on earth will worship you, just like your people Israel, and they will know that I have built this temple to honor you.
1KI.8.44	Our 
1KI.8.45	Answer their prayers from heaven and give them victory.
1KI.8.46	Everyone sins. But when your people sin against you, suppose you get angry enough to let their enemies drag them away to foreign countries. 
1KI.8.47+1KI.8.48+1KI.8.49	Later, they may feel sorry for what they did and ask your forgiveness. Answer them when they pray toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city, here in this land you gave their ancestors. From your home in heaven, listen to their sincere prayers and do what they ask. 
1KI.8.50	Forgive your people no matter how much they have sinned against you. Make the enemies who defeated them be kind to them. 
1KI.8.51	Remember, they are the people you chose and rescued from Egypt that was like a blazing fire to them.
1KI.8.52	I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you. So listen when any of us pray and cry out for your help. 
1KI.8.53	When you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, you told your servant Moses to say to them, “From all people on earth, the 
1KI.8.54	When Solomon finished his prayer at the altar, he was kneeling with his arms lifted toward heaven. He stood up, 
1KI.8.55	turned toward the people, blessed them, and said loudly:
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	May the 
1KI.8.59	I pray that the 
1KI.8.60	Then every nation will know that the 
1KI.8.61	Obey the 
1KI.8.62+1KI.8.63	Solomon and the people dedicated the temple to the 
1KI.8.64	On that day, Solomon dedicated the courtyard in front of the temple and made it acceptable for worship. He offered the sacrifices there because the bronze altar in front of the temple was too small.
1KI.8.65	Solomon and the huge crowd celebrated the Festival of Shelters at the temple for seven days.
1KI.8.66	Then on the eighth day, he sent everyone home. They said goodbye and left, very happy, because of all the good things the 
1KI.9.1	The 
1KI.9.2	 Some time later the 
1KI.9.3	 The 
1KI.9.3	I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do. This temple you have built is where I will be worshiped forever. It belongs to me, and I will never stop watching over it.
1KI.9.4	You must obey me, as your father David did, and be honest and fair. Obey my laws and teachings, 
1KI.9.5	 and I will keep my promise to David that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.
1KI.9.6	But if you or any of your descendants disobey my commands or start worshiping foreign gods, 
1KI.9.7	I will no longer let my people Israel live in this land I gave them. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped. Then people everywhere will think this nation is only a joke and will make fun of it. 
1KI.9.8	 This temple will become a pile of rocks!
1KI.9.9	Then they will answer, “We know why the 
1KI.9.10	It took 20 years for the 
1KI.9.11	Later, Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre 20 towns in the region of Galilee to repay him for the cedar, pine, and gold he had given Solomon.
1KI.9.12	When Hiram went to see the towns, he did not like them. 
1KI.9.13	He said, “Solomon, my friend, are these the kind of towns you want to give me?” So Hiram called the region Cabul because he thought it was worthless.
1KI.9.14	He sent Solomon only five tons of gold in return.
1KI.9.15	After Solomon's workers had finished the temple and the palace, he ordered them to fill in the land on the east side of Jerusalem,
1KI.9.16	Earlier, the king of Egypt had captured the town of Gezer; he burned it to the ground and killed the Canaanite people living there. Then he gave it to his daughter as a wedding present when she married Solomon. 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon had the town rebuilt.
1KI.9.17	Solomon ordered his workers to rebuild Lower Beth-Horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, and Tamar in the desert of Judah. 
1KI.9.19	They also built towns where he could keep his supplies and his chariots and horses. Solomon ordered them to build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere in his kingdom.
1KI.9.20+1KI.9.21+1KI.9.22	Solomon did not force the Israelites to do his work. They were his soldiers, officials, leaders, commanders, chariot captains, and chariot drivers. But he did make slaves of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites who were living in Israel. These were the descendants of those foreigners the Israelites could not destroy, and they remained Israel's slaves.
1KI.9.23	Solomon appointed 550 officers to be in charge of his workers and to watch over his building projects.
1KI.9.24	Solomon's wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from the older part of Jerusalem
1KI.9.25	Solomon had now finished building the 
1KI.9.26	He also had a lot of ships at Ezion-Geber, a town in Edom near Eloth on the Red Sea.
1KI.9.27+1KI.9.28	King Hiram let some of his experienced sailors go to the country of Ophir
1KI.10.2	She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of. 
1KI.10.3	He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was.
1KI.10.4+1KI.10.5	The Queen was amazed at Solomon's wisdom. She was breathless when she saw his palace, the food on his table, his officials, his servants in their uniforms, the people who served his food, and the sacrifices he offered at the 
1KI.10.6	She said:
1KI.10.6	Solomon, in my own country I had heard about your wisdom and all you've done. 
1KI.10.7	But I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes! And there's so much I didn't hear about. You are wiser and richer than I was told. 
1KI.10.8	Your wives
1KI.10.9	I praise the 
1KI.10.10	The Queen of Sheba gave Solomon more than four tons of gold, many jewels, and more spices than anyone had ever brought into Israel.
1KI.10.11+1KI.10.12+1KI.10.13	In return, Solomon gave her the gifts he would have given any other ruler, but he also gave her everything else she wanted. Then she and her officials went back to their own country.
1KI.10.11+1KI.10.12+1KI.10.13	King Hiram's ships brought gold, juniper wood, and jewels from the country of Ophir. Solomon used the wood to make steps
1KI.10.14	Solomon received almost 23 tons of gold a year. 
1KI.10.15	The merchants and traders, as well as the kings of Arabia and rulers from Israel, also gave him gold.
1KI.10.16	Solomon made 200 gold shields and used almost seven kilograms of gold for each one. 
1KI.10.17	He also made 300 smaller gold shields, using almost two kilograms for each one, and he put the shields in his palace in Forest Hall.
1KI.10.18	His throne was made of ivory and covered with pure gold. 
1KI.10.19+1KI.10.20	The back of the throne was rounded at the top, and it had armrests on each side. There was a statue of a lion on both sides of the throne, and there was a statue of a lion at both ends of each of the six steps leading up to the throne. No other throne in the world was like Solomon's.
1KI.10.21	Since silver was almost worthless in those days, everything was made of gold, even the cups and dishes used in Forest Hall.
1KI.10.22	Solomon had a lot of seagoing ships.
1KI.10.23	He was the richest and wisest king in the world. 
1KI.10.24	People from every nation wanted to hear the wisdom God had given him. 
1KI.10.25	Year after year people came and brought gifts of silver and gold, as well as clothes, weapons, spices, horses, or mules.
1KI.11.1+1KI.11.2	Solomon loved his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt. But he also loved some women from Moab, Ammon, and Edom, and others from Sidon and the land of the Hittites. 
1KI.11.3+1KI.11.4	Seven hundred of his wives were daughters of kings, but he also married 300 other women.
1KI.11.3+1KI.11.4	As Solomon got older, some of his wives led him to worship their gods. He wasn't like his father David, who had worshiped only the 
1KI.11.5	Solomon also worshiped Astarte the goddess of Sidon, and Milcom the disgusting god of Ammon. 
1KI.11.6	Solomon's father had obeyed the 
1KI.11.7	Solomon built shrines on a hill east of Jerusalem to worship Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab, and Molech the disgusting god of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	In fact, he built a shrine for each of his foreign wives, so all of them could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.
1KI.11.9+1KI.11.10	The 
1KI.11.11	and he said to Solomon:
1KI.11.11	You did what you wanted and not what I told you to do. Now I'm going to take your kingdom from you and give it to one of your officials. 
1KI.11.12	But because David was your father, you will remain king as long as you live. I will wait until your son becomes king, then I will take the kingdom from him. 
1KI.11.13	When I do, I will still let him rule one tribe, because I have not forgotten that David was my servant and Jerusalem is my chosen city.
1KI.11.14	Hadad was from the royal family of Edom, and here is how the 
1KI.11.15+1KI.11.16	Some time earlier, when David conquered the nation of Edom,
1KI.11.17+1KI.11.18+1KI.11.19	Hadad was a boy at the time, but he escaped to Midian with some of his father's officials. At Paran some other men joined them, and they went to the king of Egypt. The king liked Hadad and gave him food, some land, and a house, and even let him marry the sister of Queen Tahpenes. 
1KI.11.20	Hadad and his wife had a son named Genubath, and the queen let the boy grow up in the palace with her own children.
1KI.11.21	When Hadad heard that David and Joab were dead, he said to the king, “Your Majesty, please let me go back to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	“Why?” asked the king. “Do you want something I haven't given you?”
1KI.11.22	“No, I just want to go home.”
1KI.11.23	Here is how God made Rezon son of Eliada an enemy of Solomon:
1KI.11.23	Rezon had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24+1KI.11.25	He formed his own small army and became its leader after David had defeated Hadadezer's troops.
1KI.11.24+1KI.11.25	Both Hadad and Rezon were enemies of Israel while Solomon was king, and they caused him a lot of trouble.
1KI.11.26	Jeroboam was from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim. His father Nebat had died, but his mother Zeruah was still alive. Jeroboam was one of Solomon's officials, but even he rebelled against Solomon. 
1KI.11.27	Here is how it happened:
1KI.11.27	While Solomon's workers were filling in the land on the east side of Jerusalem
1KI.11.28	Solomon noticed that Jeroboam was a hard worker. So he put Jeroboam in charge of the work force from Manasseh and Ephraim.
1KI.11.29+1KI.11.30	One day when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, he met Ahijah, a prophet from Shiloh. No one else was anywhere around. Suddenly, Ahijah took off his new coat and ripped it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said:
1KI.11.31	Jeroboam, take ten pieces of this coat and listen to what the 
1KI.11.32	But Solomon will still rule one tribe,
1KI.11.33	“Solomon and the Israelites are not like their ancestor David. They will not listen to me, obey me, or do what is right. They have turned from me to worship Astarte the goddess of Sidon, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of Ammon.
1KI.11.34	“Solomon is David's son, and David was my chosen leader, who did what I commanded. So I will let Solomon be king until he dies. 
1KI.11.35	Then I will give you ten tribes to rule, 
1KI.11.36	but Solomon's son will still rule one tribe. This way, my servant David will always have a descendant ruling in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to be worshiped.
1KI.11.37	“You will be king of Israel and will rule every nation you want. 
1KI.11.38	I'll help you if you obey me. And if you do what I say, as my servant David did, I will always let someone from your family rule in Israel, just as someone from David's family will always rule in Judah. The nation of Israel will be yours.
1KI.11.39	“I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.”
1KI.11.40	When Solomon learned what the 
1KI.11.41	Everything else Solomon did while he was king is written in the book about him and his wisdom. 
1KI.11.42	After he had ruled 40 years from Jerusalem, 
1KI.11.43	he died and was buried there in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam then became king.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
1KI.12.2	Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he stayed in Egypt,
1KI.12.3	But the people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”
1KI.12.5	“Give me three days to think about it,” Rehoboam replied, “then come back for my answer.” So the people left.
1KI.12.6	Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”
1KI.12.7	They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should do what they ask today. Tell them you will make their work easier.”
1KI.12.8	But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials. 
1KI.12.9	He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”
1KI.12.10	His younger advisors said:
1KI.12.10	Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak.
1KI.12.11	He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”
1KI.12.12	Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back. 
1KI.12.13	Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisors. 
1KI.12.14	He spoke bluntly and told them exactly what his own advisors had suggested: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”
1KI.12.15+1KI.12.16+1KI.12.17+1KI.12.18+1KI.12.19	Adoniram
1KI.12.15+1KI.12.16+1KI.12.17+1KI.12.18+1KI.12.19	So the people from the northern tribes of Israel went home, leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from the towns in Judah. Ever since that day, the people of Israel have opposed David's family in Judah. All of this happened just as the 
1KI.12.20	When the Israelites heard that Jeroboam was back, they called everyone together. Then they sent for Jeroboam and made him king of Israel. Only the people from the tribe of Judah
1KI.12.21	After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and take control of the whole country. So he called together 180,000 soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
1KI.12.22	Meanwhile, God told Shemaiah the prophet 
1KI.12.23	to give Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin this warning: 
1KI.12.24	“Don't go to war against the people from Israel—they are your relatives. Go home! I am the 
1KI.12.24	Rehoboam and his army obeyed the 
1KI.12.25	Jeroboam rebuilt Shechem in Ephraim and made it a stronger town, then he moved there. He also fortified the town of Penuel.
1KI.12.26+1KI.12.27	One day, Jeroboam started thinking, “Everyone in Israel still goes to the temple in Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the 
1KI.12.29	Then he put one of the gold calves in the town of Bethel and the other in the town of Dan. 
1KI.12.30	The people sinned because they started going to these places to worship.
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam built small places of worship at the shrines
1KI.12.32+1KI.12.33	 He also decided to start a new festival for the Israelites on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, just like the one in Judah.
1KI.13.1+1KI.13.2	The 
1KI.13.3	You will know that the 
1KI.13.4	Jeroboam pointed at the prophet and shouted, “Grab him!” But at once, Jeroboam's hand became stiff, and he could not move it. 
1KI.13.5	The altar split in half, and the ashes fell to the ground, just as the prophet had warned.
1KI.13.6	“Please pray to the 
1KI.13.6	The prophet prayed, and Jeroboam's hand was healed.
1KI.13.7	“Come home with me and eat something,” Jeroboam said. “I want to give you a gift for what you have done.”
1KI.13.8	“No, I wouldn't go with you, even if you offered me half of your kingdom. I won't eat or drink here either. 
1KI.13.9	The 
1KI.13.10	Then he started home down a different road.
1KI.13.11	At that time an old prophet lived in Bethel, and one of his sons told him what the prophet from Judah had said and done.
1KI.13.12	“Show me which way he went,” the old prophet said, and his sons pointed out the road. 
1KI.13.13	“Put a saddle on my donkey,” he told them. After they did, he got on the donkey 
1KI.13.14	and rode off to look for the prophet from Judah.
1KI.13.14	The old prophet found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the prophet from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	“Yes, I am.”
1KI.13.15	“Come home with me,” the old prophet said, “and have something to eat.”
1KI.13.16	“I can't go back with you,” the prophet replied, “and I can't eat or drink anything with you. 
1KI.13.17	The 
1KI.13.18	The old prophet said, “I'm a prophet too. One of the 
1KI.13.18	The prophet from Judah did not know that the old prophet was lying, 
1KI.13.19	so he went home with him and ate and drank.
1KI.13.20	During the meal the 
1KI.13.21	a message for the prophet from Judah:
1KI.13.21	Listen to the 
1KI.13.22	He told you not to eat or drink anything here, but you came home and ate with me. And so, when you die, your body won't be buried in your family tomb.
1KI.13.23	After the meal the old prophet got a donkey ready, 
1KI.13.24	and the prophet from Judah left. Along the way, a lion attacked and killed him, and the donkey and the lion stood there beside his dead body.
1KI.13.25	Some people walked by and saw the body with the lion standing there. They ran into Bethel, telling everyone what they had seen.
1KI.13.26	When the old prophet heard the news, he said, “That must be the prophet from Judah. The 
1KI.13.27	The old prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey, and when it was ready, 
1KI.13.28	he left. He found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and lion standing there. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	The old prophet picked up the body, put it on his own donkey, and took it back to Bethel, so he could bury it and mourn for the prophet from Judah.
1KI.13.30	He buried the body in his own family tomb and cried for the prophet. 
1KI.13.31	He said to his sons, “When I die, bury my body next to this prophet. 
1KI.13.32	I'm sure that everything he said about the altar in Bethel and the shrines in Samaria will happen.”
1KI.13.33	But Jeroboam kept on doing evil things. He appointed men to be priests at the local shrines, even if they were not Levites. In fact, anyone who wanted to be a priest could be one. 
1KI.13.34	This sinful thing led to the downfall of his kingdom.
1KI.14.1	About the same time, Abijah son of Jeroboam got sick. 
1KI.14.2+1KI.14.3	Jeroboam told his wife:
1KI.14.2+1KI.14.3	Disguise yourself so no one will know you're my wife, then go to Shiloh, where the prophet Ahijah lives. Take him ten loaves of bread, some small cakes, and honey, and ask him what will happen to our son. He can tell you, because he's the one who told me I would become king.
1KI.14.4	She got ready and left for Ahijah's house in Shiloh.
1KI.14.4	Ahijah was now old and blind, 
1KI.14.5	but the 
1KI.14.5	Jeroboam's wife came to Ahijah's house, pretending to be someone else. 
1KI.14.6	But when Ahijah heard her walking up to the door, he said:
1KI.14.6	Come in! I know you're Jeroboam's wife—why are you pretending to be someone else? I have some bad news for you. 
1KI.14.7	Give your husband this message from the 
1KI.14.8	I even took David's kingdom away from his family and gave it to you. But you are not like my servant David. He always obeyed me and did what was right.
1KI.14.9	“You have made me very angry by rejecting me and making idols out of gold. Jeroboam, you have done more evil things than any king before you.
1KI.14.11	Dogs will eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country. I, the 
1KI.14.12	That's the 
1KI.14.13	Everyone in Israel will mourn at his funeral. But he will be the last one from Jeroboam's family to receive a proper burial, because he's the only one the 
1KI.14.14	The 
1KI.14.15	The people of Israel have made the 
1KI.14.16	Jeroboam sinned and caused the Israelites to sin. Now the 
1KI.14.17	Jeroboam's wife left and went back home to the town of Tirzah. As soon as she set foot in her house, her son died. 
1KI.14.18	Everyone in Israel came and mourned at his funeral, just as the 
1KI.14.19	Everything else Jeroboam did while he was king, including the battles he won, is written in 
1KI.14.20	He was king of Israel for 22 years, then he died, and his son Nadab became king.
1KI.14.21	Rehoboam son of Solomon was 41 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 17 years from Jerusalem, the city where the 
1KI.14.22	The people of Judah disobeyed the 
1KI.14.23	 They also built their own local shrines
1KI.14.24	 Even worse, they allowed prostitutes
1KI.14.26	 He took everything of value from the temple and the palace, including Solomon's gold shields.
1KI.14.27	Rehoboam had bronze shields made to replace the gold ones, and he ordered the guards at the city gates to keep them safe. 
1KI.14.28	Whenever Rehoboam went to the 
1KI.14.29	Everything else Rehoboam did while he was king is written in 
1KI.14.30	He and Jeroboam were constantly at war. 
1KI.14.31	Rehoboam's mother Naamah was from Ammon, but when Rehoboam died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem.
1KI.15.1	Abijam became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel, 
1KI.15.2	and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.3	Abijam did not truly obey the 
1KI.15.4+1KI.15.5	 David had always obeyed the 
1KI.15.6+1KI.15.7	Everything else Abijam did while he was king is written in 
1KI.15.8	Abijam died and was buried in Jerusalem,
1KI.15.9	Asa became king of Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's rule in Israel, 
1KI.15.10	and he ruled 41 years from Jerusalem. His grandmother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.11	Asa obeyed the 
1KI.15.12	 He forced the prostitutes
1KI.15.13	His own grandmother Maacah had made an idol of Asherah, and Asa took it and burned it in Kidron Valley. Then he removed Maacah from her position as queen mother.
1KI.15.14	As long as Asa lived, he was completely faithful to the 
1KI.15.15	He placed in the temple all the silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated to the 
1KI.15.16	Asa was always at war with King Baasha of Israel. 
1KI.15.17	One time, Baasha invaded Judah and captured the town of Ramah. He started making the town stronger, so he could put troops there to stop people from going in and out of Judah.
1KI.15.18	When Asa heard about this, he took the silver and gold from his palace and from the 
1KI.15.19	“Our fathers signed a peace treaty. Why don't we do the same thing? This silver and gold is a present for you. So, would you please break your treaty with Baasha and force him to leave my country?”
1KI.15.20	Benhadad did what Asa asked and sent the Syrian army into Israel. They captured the towns of Ijon, Dan, and Abel-Bethmaacah, and the territories of Chinneroth and Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard about it, he left Ramah and went back to Tirzah.
1KI.15.22	Asa ordered everyone in Judah to carry away the stones and wood Baasha had used to strengthen the town of Ramah. Then he used these same stones and wood to fortify the town of Geba in the territory of Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	Everything else Asa did while he was king, including his victories and the towns he rebuilt, is written in 
1KI.15.24	Asa died and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors in Jerusalem.
1KI.15.25	Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Asa's second year as king of Judah, and he ruled two years. 
1KI.15.26	Nadab disobeyed the 
1KI.15.27+1KI.15.28	Baasha son of Ahijah was from the tribe of Issachar, and he made plans to kill Nadab. When Nadab and his army went to attack the town of Gibbethon in Philistia, Baasha killed Nadab there. So in the third year of Asa's rule, Baasha became king of Israel.
1KI.15.30	because Jeroboam had made the 
1KI.15.31	Everything else Nadab did while he was king is written in 
1KI.15.32	King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were always at war.
1KI.15.33	Baasha son of Ahijah became king of Israel in Asa's third year as king of Judah, and he ruled 24 years from Tirzah. 
1KI.15.34	Baasha also disobeyed the 
1KI.16.1	The 
1KI.16.2	Nobody knew who you were until I, the 
1KI.16.3	that I will destroy you and your family, just as I did the family of Jeroboam. 
1KI.16.4	Dogs will eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country.
1KI.16.5+1KI.16.6+1KI.16.7	Baasha made the 
1KI.16.5+1KI.16.6+1KI.16.7	Everything else Baasha did while he was king, including his brave deeds, is written in 
1KI.16.8	Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel after Asa had been king of Judah for 25 years, and he ruled from Tirzah for two years.
1KI.16.9	Zimri commanded half of Elah's chariots, and he made plans to kill Elah.
1KI.16.9	One day, Elah was in Tirzah, getting drunk at the home of Arza, his prime minister, 
1KI.16.10	when Zimri went there and killed Elah. So Zimri became king in the twenty-seventh year of Asa's rule in Judah.
1KI.16.11	As soon as Zimri became king, he killed everyone in Baasha's family. Not one man or boy in his family was left alive—even his close friends were killed. 
1KI.16.12	Baasha's family was completely wiped out, just as the 
1KI.16.13	Baasha and Elah sinned and caused the Israelites to sin, and they made the 
1KI.16.14	Everything else Elah did while he was king is written in 
1KI.16.15+1KI.16.16	Zimri became king of Israel in Asa's twenty-seventh year as king of Judah, but he ruled only seven days from Tirzah.
1KI.16.15+1KI.16.16	Israel's army was camped near Gibbethon in Philistia under the command of Omri. The soldiers heard that Zimri had killed Elah, and they made Omri their king that same day. 
1KI.16.17	At once, Omri and his army marched to Tirzah and attacked. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the town was captured, he ran into the strongest part of the palace and killed himself by setting it on fire. 
1KI.16.19	Zimri had disobeyed the 
1KI.16.20	Everything else Zimri did while he was king, including his rebellion against Elah, is written in 
1KI.16.21	After Zimri died, some of the Israelites wanted Tibni son of Ginath to be king, but others wanted Omri. 
1KI.16.22	Omri's followers were stronger than Tibni's, so Tibni was killed, and Omri became king of Israel 
1KI.16.23	in the thirty-first year of Asa's rule in Judah.
1KI.16.23	Omri ruled Israel for twelve years. The first six years he ruled from Tirzah, 
1KI.16.24	then he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for 6,000 pieces of silver. He built a town there and named it Samaria, after Shemer who had owned the hill.
1KI.16.25	Omri did more evil things than any king before him. 
1KI.16.26	He acted just like Jeroboam and made the 
1KI.16.27	Everything else Omri did while he was king, including his brave deeds, is written in 
1KI.16.28	Omri died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab became king.
1KI.16.29	Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa's rule in Judah, and he ruled 22 years from Samaria.
1KI.16.30	Ahab did more things to disobey the 
1KI.16.31	He acted just like Jeroboam. Even worse, he married Jezebel the daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon
1KI.16.32	Ahab built an altar and temple for Baal in Samaria 
1KI.16.33	and set up a sacred pole
1KI.17.2	Later, the 
1KI.17.3	“Leave and go across the Jordan River so you can hide near Cherith Creek. 
1KI.17.4	You can drink water from the creek, and eat the food I've told the ravens to bring you.”
1KI.17.5	Elijah obeyed the 
1KI.17.6	Ravens brought him bread and meat twice a day, and he drank water from the creek. 
1KI.17.7	But after a while, it dried up because there was no rain.
1KI.17.8	The 
1KI.17.9	 “Go to the town of Zarephath in Sidon and live there. I've told a widow in that town to give you food.”
1KI.17.10	When Elijah came near the town gate of Zarephath, he saw a widow gathering sticks for a fire. “Would you please bring me a cup of water?” he asked. 
1KI.17.11	As she left to get it, he asked, “Would you also please bring me a piece of bread?”
1KI.17.12	The widow answered, “In the name of the living 
1KI.17.13	Elijah said, “Everything will be fine. Do what you said. Go home and fix something for you and your son. But first, please make a small piece of bread and bring it to me. 
1KI.17.14	The 
1KI.17.15	The widow went home and did exactly what Elijah had told her. She and Elijah and her family had enough food for a long time. 
1KI.17.16	The 
1KI.17.17	Several days later, the son of the woman who owned the house
1KI.17.18	The woman shouted at Elijah, “What have I done to you? I thought you were God's prophet. Did you come here to cause the death of my son as a reminder that I've sinned against God?”
1KI.17.19	“Bring me your son,” Elijah said. Then he took the boy from her arms and carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying. Elijah laid the boy on his bed 
1KI.17.20	and prayed, “
1KI.17.21	 Elijah stretched himself out over the boy three times, while praying, “
1KI.17.22	The 
1KI.17.23	Elijah picked him up and carried him downstairs. He gave the boy to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive.”
1KI.17.24	“You are God's prophet!” the woman replied. “Now I know that you really do speak for the 
1KI.18.1+1KI.18.2	For three years no rain fell in Samaria, and there was almost nothing to eat anywhere. The 
1KI.18.3+1KI.18.4	At that time Obadiah was in charge of Ahab's palace, but he faithfully worshiped the 
1KI.18.3+1KI.18.4	Ahab sent for Obadiah 
1KI.18.5	and said, “We have to find something for our horses and mules to eat. If we don't, we will have to kill them. Let's look around every creek and spring in the country for some grass. 
1KI.18.6	You go one way, and I'll go the other.” Then they left in separate directions.
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was walking along, he met Elijah. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down, and asked, “Elijah, is it really you?”
1KI.18.8	“Yes. Go tell Ahab I'm here.”
1KI.18.9	Obadiah replied:
1KI.18.9	King Ahab would kill me if I told him that. And I haven't even done anything wrong. 
1KI.18.10	I swear to you in the name of the living 
1KI.18.11	Do you really want me to tell him you're here?
1KI.18.12	What if the 
1KI.18.12	I have worshiped the 
1KI.18.13	I even hid 100 of the 
1KI.18.14	Do you really want me to tell Ahab you're here? He will kill me!
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “I'm a servant of the living 
1KI.18.16	Obadiah left and told Ahab where to find Elijah.
1KI.18.16	Ahab went to meet Elijah, 
1KI.18.17	and when he saw him, Ahab shouted, “There you are, the biggest troublemaker in Israel!”
1KI.18.18	Elijah answered:
1KI.18.18	You're the troublemaker—not me! You and your family have disobeyed the 
1KI.18.19	Call together everyone from Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. Be sure to bring along the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.
1KI.18.20	Ahab got everyone together, then they went to meet Elijah on Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How much longer will you try to have things both ways? If the 
1KI.18.21	The people did not say a word.
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah continued:
1KI.18.22	I am the 
1KI.18.23	Bring us two bulls. Baal's prophets can take one of them, kill it, and cut it into pieces. Then they can put the meat on the wood without lighting the fire. I will do the same thing with the other bull, and I won't light a fire under it either.
1KI.18.24	The prophets of Baal will pray to their god, and I will pray to the 
1KI.18.24	“That's a good idea,” everyone agreed.
1KI.18.25	Elijah said to Baal's prophets, “There are more of you, so you go first. Pick out a bull and get it ready, but don't light the fire. Then pray to your god.”
1KI.18.26	They chose their bull, then they got it ready and prayed to Baal all morning, asking him to start the fire. They danced around the altar and shouted, “Answer us, Baal!” But there was no answer.
1KI.18.27	At noon, Elijah began making fun of them. “Pray louder!” he said. “Baal must be a god. Maybe he's daydreaming or using the toilet or traveling somewhere. Or maybe he's asleep, and you have to wake him up.”
1KI.18.28	The prophets kept shouting louder and louder, and they cut themselves with swords and knives until they were bleeding. This was the way they worshiped, 
1KI.18.29	and they kept it up until time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no answer of any kind.
1KI.18.30	Elijah told everyone to gather around him while he repaired the 
1KI.18.31+1KI.18.32	 Then he used twelve stones to build an altar in honor of the 
1KI.18.33	He placed the wood on the altar, then they cut the bull into pieces and laid the meat on the wood.
1KI.18.33	He told the people, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it over the meat and the wood.” After they did this, 
1KI.18.34	he told them to do it two more times. They did exactly as he said 
1KI.18.35	until finally, the water ran down the altar and filled the ditch.
1KI.18.36	When it was time for the evening sacrifice, Elijah prayed:
1KI.18.36	Our 
1KI.18.37	Please answer me, so these people will know that you are the 
1KI.18.38	The 
1KI.18.39	When the crowd saw what had happened, they all bowed down and shouted, “The 
1KI.18.40	Just then, Elijah said, “Grab the prophets of Baal! Don't let any of them get away.”
1KI.18.40	So the people captured the prophets and took them to Kishon River, where Elijah killed every one of them.
1KI.18.41	Elijah told Ahab, “Get something to eat and drink. I hear a heavy rain coming.”
1KI.18.43	and said to his servant, “Look toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	The servant left. And when he came back, he said, “I looked, but I didn't see anything.” Elijah told him to look seven more times.
1KI.18.44	After the seventh time the servant replied, “I see a small cloud coming this way. But it's no bigger than a fist.”
1KI.18.44	Elijah told him, “Tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and start home now. Otherwise, the rain will stop him.”
1KI.18.45+1KI.18.46	A few minutes later, it got very cloudy and windy, and rain started pouring down. So Elijah wrapped his coat around himself, and the 
1KI.19.1	Ahab told his wife Jezebel what Elijah had done and that he had killed the prophets. 
1KI.19.2	She sent a message to Elijah: “You killed my prophets. Now I'm going to kill you! I pray that the gods will punish me even more severely if I don't do it by this time tomorrow.”
1KI.19.3	Elijah was afraid when he got her message, and he ran to the town of Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there, 
1KI.19.4	 then walked another whole day into the desert. Finally, he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade. He begged the 
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep.
1KI.19.5	Suddenly an angel woke him up and said, “Get up and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	Elijah looked around, and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread. He sat up, ate and drank, then lay down and went back to sleep.
1KI.19.7	Soon the 
1KI.19.8	So Elijah sat up and ate and drank.
1KI.19.8	The food and water made him strong enough to walk 40 more days. At last, he reached Mount Sinai,
1KI.19.9	and he spent the night there in a cave.
1KI.19.9	While Elijah was on Mount Sinai, the 
1KI.19.11	“Go out and stand on the mountain,” the 
1KI.19.11	All at once, a strong wind shook the mountain and shattered the rocks. But the 
1KI.19.12	Then there was a fire, but the 
1KI.19.12	Finally, there was a gentle breeze,
1KI.19.13	and when Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his coat. He went out and stood at the entrance to the cave.
1KI.19.13	A voice asked, “Elijah, why are you here?”
1KI.19.14	Elijah answered, “
1KI.19.15	Elijah, you can go back to the desert near Damascus. And when you get there, appoint
1KI.19.16	 Then appoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king of Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat
1KI.19.17	Hazael will start killing the people who worship Baal. Jehu will kill those who escape from Hazael, and Elisha will kill those who escape from Jehu.
1KI.19.19	Elijah left and found Elisha plowing a field with a pair of oxen. There were eleven other men in front of him, and each one was also plowing with a pair of oxen. Elijah went over and put his own coat on Elisha.
1KI.19.20	Elisha stopped plowing and ran after him. “Let me kiss my parents goodbye, then I'll go with you,” he said.
1KI.19.20	“You can go,” Elijah said. “But remember what I've done for you.”
1KI.19.21	Elisha left and took his oxen with him. He killed them and boiled them over a fire he had made with the wood from his plow. He gave the meat to the people who were with him, and they ate it. Then he left with Elijah and became his assistant.
1KI.20.1	King Benhadad of Syria
1KI.20.2	Benhadad sent a messenger to tell King Ahab of Israel, 
1KI.20.3	“Ahab, give me your silver and gold, your wives,
1KI.20.4	“Your Majesty,” Ahab replied, “everything I have is yours, including me.”
1KI.20.5	Later, Benhadad sent another messenger to say to Ahab, “I already told you to give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your children. 
1KI.20.6	But tomorrow at this time, I will send my officials into your city to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will take everything else that you
1KI.20.7	Ahab called a meeting with the leaders of Israel and said, “Benhadad is causing real trouble. He told me to give him my wives and children, as well as my silver and gold. And I agreed.”
1KI.20.8	“Don't listen to him!” they answered. “You don't have to do what he says.”
1KI.20.9	So Ahab sent someone to tell Benhadad, “Your Majesty, I'll give you my silver and gold, and even my wives and children. But I won't let you have anything else.”
1KI.20.9	When Benhadad got his answer, 
1KI.20.10	he replied, “I'll completely destroy Samaria! There won't even be enough of it left for my soldiers to carry back in their hands. If I don't do it, I pray that the gods will punish me terribly.”
1KI.20.11	Ahab then answered, “Benhadad, don't brag before the fighting even begins. Wait and see if you live through it.”
1KI.20.12	Meanwhile, Benhadad and the other kings had been drinking in their tents. But when Ahab's reply came, he ordered his soldiers to prepare to attack Samaria, and they all got ready.
1KI.20.13	At that very moment, a prophet ran up to Ahab and said, “You can see that Benhadad's army is very strong. But the 
1KI.20.14	“Who will fight the battle?” Ahab asked.
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “The young bodyguards who serve the district officials.”
1KI.20.14	“But who will lead them into battle?” Ahab asked.
1KI.20.14	“You will!” the prophet replied.
1KI.20.15	So Ahab called together the 232 young soldiers and the 7,000 troops in Israel's army, and he got them ready to fight the Syrians.
1KI.20.16+1KI.20.17	At noon, King Ahab and his Israelite army marched out of Samaria, with the young soldiers in front.
1KI.20.16+1KI.20.17	King Benhadad of Syria and the 32 kings with him were drunk when the scouts he had sent out ran up to his tent, shouting, “We just now saw soldiers marching out of Samaria!”
1KI.20.18	“Take them alive!” Benhadad ordered. “I don't care if they have come out to fight or to surrender.”
1KI.20.19	The young soldiers led Israel's troops into battle, 
1KI.20.20	and each of them attacked and killed an enemy soldier. The rest of the Syrian army turned and ran, and the Israelites went after them. Benhadad and some others escaped on horses, 
1KI.20.21	but Ahab and his soldiers followed them and captured
1KI.20.21	Ahab and Israel's army crushed the Syrians.
1KI.20.22	Later, the prophet
1KI.20.23	Meanwhile, Benhadad's officials went to him and explained:
1KI.20.23	Israel's gods are mountain gods. We fought Israel's army in the hills, and that's why they defeated us. But if we fight them on flat land, there's no way we can lose.
1KI.20.24	Here's what you should do. First, get rid of those 32 kings and put army commanders in their places. 
1KI.20.25	Then get more soldiers, horses, and chariots, so your army will be as strong as it was before. We'll fight Israel's army on flat land and wipe them out.
1KI.20.25	Benhadad agreed and did what they suggested.
1KI.20.26	In the spring, Benhadad got his army together, and they marched to the town of Aphek to attack Israel. 
1KI.20.27	The Israelites also prepared to fight. They marched out to meet the Syrians, and the two armies camped across from each other. The Syrians covered the whole area, but the Israelites looked like two little flocks of goats.
1KI.20.28	The prophet went to Ahab and said, “The Syrians think the 
1KI.20.29	For seven days the two armies stayed in their camps, facing each other. Then on the seventh day the fighting broke out, and before sunset the Israelites had killed 100,000 Syrian troops. 
1KI.20.30	The rest of the Syrian army ran back to Aphek, but the town wall fell and crushed 27,000 of them.
1KI.20.30	Benhadad also escaped to Aphek and hid in the back room of a house. 
1KI.20.31	His officials said, “Your Majesty, we've heard that Israel's kings keep their agreements. We will wrap sackcloth around our waists, put ropes around our heads, and ask Ahab to let you live.”
1KI.20.32	They dressed in sackcloth and put ropes on their heads, then they went to Ahab and said, “Your servant Benhadad asks you to let him live.”
1KI.20.32	“Is he still alive?” Ahab asked. “Benhadad is like a brother to me.”
1KI.20.33	Benhadad's officials were trying to figure out what Ahab was thinking, and when he said “brother,” they quickly replied, “You're right! You and Benhadad are like brothers.”
1KI.20.33	“Go get him,” Ahab said.
1KI.20.33	When Benhadad came out, Ahab had him climb up into his chariot.
1KI.20.34	Benhadad said, “I'll give back the towns my father took from your father. And you can have shops in Damascus, just as my father had in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Ahab replied, “If you do these things, I'll let you go free.” Then they signed a peace treaty, and Ahab let Benhadad go.
1KI.20.35	About this time the 
1KI.20.36	 and the prophet told him, “You disobeyed the 
1KI.20.37	The prophet found someone else and said, “Hit me!” So this man beat him up.
1KI.20.38	The prophet left and put a bandage over his face to disguise himself. Then he went and stood beside the road, waiting for Ahab to pass by.
1KI.20.39	When Ahab went by, the prophet shouted, “Your Majesty, right in the heat of battle, someone brought a prisoner to me and told me to guard him. He said if the prisoner got away, I would either be killed or forced to pay 3,000 pieces of silver. 
1KI.20.40	But I got busy doing other things, and the prisoner escaped.”
1KI.20.40	Ahab answered, “You will be punished just as you have said.”
1KI.20.41	The man quickly tore the bandage off his face, and Ahab saw that he was one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	The prophet said, “The 
1KI.20.43	Ahab went back to Samaria, angry and depressed.
1KI.21.1	Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel near King Ahab's palace.
1KI.21.2	One day, Ahab said, “Naboth, your vineyard is near my palace. Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden. I'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours.”
1KI.21.3	Naboth answered, “This vineyard has always been in my family. I won't let you have it.”
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went home, angry and depressed because of what Naboth had told him. He lay on his bed, just staring at the wall and refusing to eat a thing.
1KI.21.5	Jezebel his wife came in and asked, “What's wrong? Why won't you eat?”
1KI.21.6	“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to let me give him a better one,” Ahab replied. “And he told me I couldn't have it.”
1KI.21.7	“Aren't you the king of Israel?” Jezebel asked. “Get out of bed and eat something! Don't worry, I'll get Naboth's vineyard for you.”
1KI.21.8+1KI.21.9+1KI.21.10	Jezebel wrote a letter to each of the leaders of the town where Naboth lived. In the letters she said:
1KI.21.8+1KI.21.9+1KI.21.10	Call everyone together and tell them to go without eating
1KI.21.8+1KI.21.9+1KI.21.10	She signed Ahab's name to the letters and sealed them with his seal. Then she sent them to the town leaders.
1KI.21.11	After receiving her letters, they did exactly what she had asked. 
1KI.21.12	They told the people that it was a day to go without eating, and when they all came together, they seated Naboth at the front. 
1KI.21.13	The two liars came in and sat across from Naboth. Then they accused him of cursing God and the king, so the people dragged Naboth outside and stoned him to death.
1KI.21.14	The leaders of Jezreel sent a message back to Jezebel that said, “Naboth is dead.”
1KI.21.15	As soon as Jezebel got their message, she told Ahab, “Now you can have the vineyard Naboth refused to sell. He's dead.” 
1KI.21.16	Ahab got up and went to take over the vineyard.
1KI.21.17	The 
1KI.21.18	“King Ahab of Israel is in Naboth's vineyard right now, taking it over. 
1KI.21.19	Go tell him that I say, ‘Ahab, you murdered Naboth and took his property. And so, in the very spot where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, they will lick up your blood.’ ”
1KI.21.19	When Elijah found him, 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said, “So, my enemy, you found me at last.”
1KI.21.20	Elijah answered:
1KI.21.20	Yes, I did! Ahab, you have managed to do everything the 
1KI.21.21	Now you will be punished. You and every man and boy in your family will die, whether slave or free. 
1KI.21.22	Your whole family will be wiped out, just like the families of King Jeroboam and King Baasha. You've made the 
1KI.21.24	Dogs will also eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country.
1KI.21.25+1KI.21.26+1KI.21.27+1KI.21.28+1KI.21.29	When Ahab heard this, he tore his clothes in sorrow and wore sackcloth day and night. He was depressed and refused to eat.
1KI.21.25+1KI.21.26+1KI.21.27+1KI.21.28+1KI.21.29	Some time later, the 
1KI.21.25+1KI.21.26+1KI.21.27+1KI.21.28+1KI.21.29	No one was more determined than Ahab to disobey the 
1KI.22.1	For the next three years there was peace between Israel and Syria. 
1KI.22.2	During the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.
1KI.22.3	Ahab asked his officials, “Why haven't we tried to get Ramoth in Gilead back from the Syrians? It belongs to us.” 
1KI.22.4	Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Would you go to Ramoth with me and attack the Syrians?”
1KI.22.4	“Just tell me what to do,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army and horses are at your command. 
1KI.22.5	But first, let's ask the 
1KI.22.6	Ahab sent for about 400 prophets and asked, “Should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?”
1KI.22.6	“Yes!” the prophets answered. “The Lord will help you defeat them.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the 
1KI.22.8	“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.”
1KI.22.8	“Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied. 
1KI.22.9	Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
1KI.22.10	All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria. They were listening to the prophets tell them what the 
1KI.22.11	Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the 
1KI.22.12	All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth, and they promised that the 
1KI.22.13	Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”
1KI.22.14	“I'll say whatever the living 
1KI.22.15	Then Micaiah went to Ahab, and Ahab asked, “Micaiah, should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?”
1KI.22.15	“Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The 
1KI.22.16	“Micaiah, I've told you over and over to tell me the truth!” Ahab shouted. “What does the 
1KI.22.18	Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring bad news!”
1KI.22.19	Listen to this! I also saw the 
1KI.22.20	The 
1KI.22.20	They talked about it for a while, 
1KI.22.21	then finally a spirit came forward and said to the 
1KI.22.21	“How?” the 
1KI.22.22	“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.”
1KI.22.22	“Good!” the 
1KI.22.23	This is exactly what has happened, Ahab. The 
1KI.22.24	Zedekiah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the 
1KI.22.25	Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”
1KI.22.26	Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria. 
1KI.22.27	Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the 
1KI.22.29	Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Then Ahab disguised himself and went into battle.
1KI.22.31	The king of Syria had ordered his 32 chariot commanders to attack only Ahab. 
1KI.22.32	So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But when Jehoshaphat shouted out to them, 
1KI.22.33	they realized he wasn't Ahab, and they left him alone.
1KI.22.34	However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab where two pieces of his armor joined. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”
1KI.22.35	The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He bled so much that the bottom of the chariot was covered with blood, and by evening he was dead.
1KI.22.36	As the sun was going down, someone in Israel's army shouted to the others, “Retreat! Go back home!”
1KI.22.37	Ahab's body was taken to Samaria and buried there. 
1KI.22.38	Some workers washed his chariot near a spring in Samaria, and prostitutes washed themselves in his blood.
1KI.22.39	Everything else Ahab did while he was king, including the towns he strengthened and the palace he built and furnished with ivory, is written in 
1KI.22.40	Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became king.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in Ahab's fourth year as king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
1KI.22.43+1KI.22.44+1KI.22.45+1KI.22.46	Jehoshaphat obeyed the 
1KI.22.43+1KI.22.44+1KI.22.45+1KI.22.46	He got rid of the rest of the prostitutes
1KI.22.43+1KI.22.44+1KI.22.45+1KI.22.46	Everything else Jehoshaphat did while he was king, including his brave deeds and military victories, is written in 
1KI.22.47	The country of Edom had no king at the time, so a lower official ruled the land.
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat had seagoing ships
1KI.22.49	Ahaziah son of Ahab offered to let his sailors go with Jehoshaphat's sailors, but Jehoshaphat refused.
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem,
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's rule in Judah, and he ruled two years from Samaria.
1KI.22.52	Ahaziah disobeyed the 
1KI.22.53	Ahaziah worshiped Baal and made the 
2KI.1.1+2KI.1.2	Soon after King Ahab of Israel died, the country of Moab rebelled against his son King Ahaziah.
2KI.1.1+2KI.1.2	One day, Ahaziah fell through the wooden slats around the porch on the flat roof of his palace in Samaria, and he was badly injured. So he sent some messengers to the town of Ekron
2KI.1.3	About the same time, an angel from the 
2KI.1.4	Tell him that because he has done this, he's on his deathbed!” And Elijah did what he was told.
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he asked, “Why are you back so soon?”
2KI.1.6	“A man met us along the road with a message for you from the 
2KI.1.7	“What did the man look like?” Ahaziah asked.
2KI.1.8	“It must be Elijah!” replied Ahaziah. 
2KI.1.9	So at once he sent an army officer and 50 soldiers to meet Elijah.
2KI.1.9	Elijah was sitting on top of a hill
2KI.1.11	Ahaziah sent another officer and 50 more soldiers to Elijah. The officer said, “Man of God, the king orders you to come see him at once.”
2KI.1.12	“If I am a man of God,” Elijah answered, “fire will destroy you and your 50 soldiers.” And God sent down fire
2KI.1.13	Ahaziah sent a third army officer and 50 more soldiers. This officer went up to Elijah, then he got down on his knees and begged, “Man of God, please be kind to me and these 50 servants of yours. Let us live! 
2KI.1.14	Fire has already wiped out the other officers and their soldiers. Please don't let it happen to me.”
2KI.1.15	The angel from the 
2KI.1.16	When Elijah arrived, he told Ahaziah, “The 
2KI.1.17	Ahaziah died, just as the 
2KI.1.18	Everything else Ahaziah did while he was king is written in

2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “The

2KI.2.3	A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the 
2KI.2.3	“Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”
2KI.2.4	Elijah then said, “Elisha, now the 
2KI.2.4	Elisha replied, “I swear by the living 
2KI.2.5	A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the 
2KI.2.5	“Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”
2KI.2.6	Elijah then said to Elisha, “Now the 
2KI.2.6	Elisha replied, “I swear by the living 
2KI.2.7	Fifty prophets followed Elijah and Elisha from Jericho, then stood at a distance and watched as the two men walked toward the river. 
2KI.2.8	When they got there, Elijah took off his coat, then he rolled it up and struck the water with it. At once a path opened up through the river, and the two of them walked across on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	Elisha answered, “Please give me twice as much of your power as you give the other prophets, so I can be the one who takes your place as their leader.”
2KI.2.10	“It won't be easy,” Elijah answered. “It can happen only if you see me as I am being taken away.”
2KI.2.11	Elijah and Elisha were walking along and talking, when suddenly there appeared between them a flaming chariot pulled by fiery horses. At once, a strong wind took Elijah up into heaven. 
2KI.2.12	 Elisha saw this and shouted, “Israel's cavalry and chariots have taken my master away!”
2KI.2.13	Elijah's coat had fallen off, so Elisha picked it up and walked back to the Jordan River. 
2KI.2.14	He struck the water with the coat and wondered, “Will the 
2KI.2.15	When the prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they said to each other, “Elisha now has Elijah's power.”
2KI.2.15	They walked over to him, bowed down, 
2KI.2.16	and said, “There are 50 strong men here with us. Please let them go look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.16	“No,” Elisha replied, “they won't find him.”
2KI.2.17	They kept begging until he was embarrassed to say no. He finally agreed, and the prophets sent the men out. They looked three days for Elijah but never found him. 
2KI.2.18	They returned to Jericho, and Elisha said, “I told you that you wouldn't find him.”
2KI.2.19	One day the people of Jericho said, “Elisha, you can see that our city is in a good spot. But the water from our spring is so bad that it even keeps our crops from growing.”
2KI.2.20	He replied, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me.”
2KI.2.20	They brought him the bowl of salt, 
2KI.2.21	and he carried it to the spring. He threw the salt into the water and said, “The 
2KI.2.22	The water has been fine ever since, just as Elisha said.
2KI.2.23	Elisha left and headed toward Bethel. Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting, “Go away, baldy! Get out of here!”
2KI.2.24	Elisha turned around and stared at the boys. Then he cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	Elisha went up to Mount Carmel, then returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Joram
2KI.3.2	and disobeyed the 
2KI.3.3	But he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to do.
2KI.3.4	For many years the country of Moab had been controlled by Israel and was forced to pay taxes to the kings of Israel. King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, so he paid the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams. 
2KI.3.5	But soon after the death of Ahab, Mesha rebelled against Israel.
2KI.3.6	One day, Joram left Samaria and called together Israel's army. 
2KI.3.7	He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled. Will you go with me to attack him?”
2KI.3.7	“Yes, I will,” Jehoshaphat answered. “I'm on your side, and my soldiers and horses are at your command. 
2KI.3.8	But which way should we go?”
2KI.3.8	“We will march through Edom Desert,” Joram replied.
2KI.3.9	So Joram, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom led their troops out. But seven days later, there was no drinking water left for them or their animals. 
2KI.3.10	Joram cried out, “This is terrible! The 
2KI.3.11	Jehoshaphat said, “Which of the 
2KI.3.11	One of Joram's officers answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was one of Elijah's closest followers.”
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat replied, “He can give us the 
2KI.3.12	The three kings went over to Elisha, 
2KI.3.13	and he asked Joram, “Why did you come to me? Go talk to the prophets of the foreign gods your parents worshiped.”
2KI.3.13	“No,” Joram answered. “It was the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha said to him, “I serve the

2KI.3.15	The harpist began playing, and the 
2KI.3.16	The 
2KI.3.17	You won't feel any wind or see any rain, but there will be plenty of water for you and your animals.
2KI.3.18	That simple thing isn't all the 
2KI.3.19	You will capture all their walled cities and important towns. You will chop down every good tree and stop up every spring of water, then ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks.
2KI.3.20	The next morning, while the sacrifice was being offered, water suddenly started flowing from the direction of Edom, and it flooded the land.
2KI.3.21	Meanwhile, the people of Moab had heard that the three kings were coming to attack them. They had called together all of their fighting men, from the youngest to the oldest, and these troops were now standing at their border, ready for battle. 
2KI.3.22	When they got up that morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it look red. The Moabite troops took one look 
2KI.3.23	and shouted, “Look at that blood! The armies of those kings must have fought and killed each other. Come on, let's go take what's left in their camp.”
2KI.3.24	But when they arrived at Israel's camp, the Israelite soldiers came out and attacked them, until they turned and ran away. Israel's army chased them all the way back to Moab, and even there they kept up the attack.
2KI.3.25	The Israelites destroyed the Moabite towns. They chopped down the good trees and stopped up the springs of water, then covered the fertile fields with rocks.
2KI.3.25	Finally, the only city left standing was Kir-Hareseth, but soldiers armed with slings surrounded and attacked it. 
2KI.3.26	King Mesha of Moab saw that he was about to be defeated. So he took along 700 soldiers with swords and tried to break through the front line where the Edomite troops were positioned. But he failed. 
2KI.3.27	He then grabbed his oldest son who was to be the next king and sacrificed him as an offering on the city wall. The Israelite troops were so horrified that
2KI.4.1	One day the widow of one of the 
2KI.4.2	“Maybe there's something I can do to help,” Elisha said. “What do you have in your house?”
2KI.4.2	“Sir, I have nothing but a small bottle of olive oil.”
2KI.4.3	Elisha told her, “Ask your neighbors for their empty jars. And after you've borrowed as many as you can, 
2KI.4.4	go home and shut the door behind you and your sons. Then begin filling the jars with oil and set each one aside as you fill it.” 
2KI.4.5	The woman left.
2KI.4.5	Later, when she and her sons were back inside their house, the two sons brought her the jars, and she began filling them.
2KI.4.6	At last, she said to one of her sons, “Bring me another jar.”
2KI.4.6	“We don't have any more,” he answered, and the oil stopped flowing from the small bottle.
2KI.4.7	After she told Elisha what had happened, he said, “Sell the oil and use part of the money to pay what you owe the man. You and your sons can live on what is left.”
2KI.4.8	Once, while Elisha was in the town of Shunem,
2KI.4.9	Some time later the woman said to her husband, “I'm sure the man who comes here so often is a prophet of God. 
2KI.4.10	Why don't we build him a small room on the flat roof of our house? We can put a bed, a table and chair, and an oil lamp in it. Then whenever he comes, he can stay with us.”
2KI.4.11	The next time Elisha was in Shunem, he stopped at their house and went up to his room to rest. 
2KI.4.12+2KI.4.13	He said to his servant Gehazi, “This woman has been very helpful. Have her come up here to the roof for a moment.” She came, and Elisha told Gehazi to say to her, “You've gone to a lot of trouble for us, and we want to help you. Is there something we can request the king or army commander to do?”
2KI.4.12+2KI.4.13	The woman answered, “With my relatives nearby, I have everything I need.”
2KI.4.14	“Then what can we do for her?” Elisha asked Gehazi.
2KI.4.14	Gehazi replied, “I do know that her husband is old, and that she doesn't have a son.”
2KI.4.15	“Ask her to come here again,” Elisha told his servant. He called for her, and she came and stood in the doorway of Elisha's room.
2KI.4.16	“You're a man of God,” the woman replied. “Please don't lie to me.”
2KI.4.17	But a few months later, the woman got pregnant. She gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had promised.
2KI.4.18	One day while the boy was still young, he was out in the fields with his father, where the workers were harvesting the crops. 
2KI.4.19	Suddenly he shouted, “My head hurts. It hurts a lot!”
2KI.4.19	“Carry him back to his mother,” the father said to his servant. 
2KI.4.20	The servant picked up the boy and carried him to his mother. The boy lay on her lap all morning, and by noon he was dead. 
2KI.4.21	She carried him upstairs to Elisha's room and laid him across the bed. Then she walked out and shut the door behind her.
2KI.4.22	The woman called to her husband, “I need to see the prophet. Let me use one of the donkeys. Send a servant along with me, and let me leave now, so I can get back quickly.”
2KI.4.23	“Why do you need to see him today?” her husband asked. “It's not the Sabbath or time for the New Moon Festival.”
2KI.4.23	“That's all right,” she answered. 
2KI.4.24	She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Let's go. And don't slow down unless I tell you to.” 
2KI.4.25	She left at once for Mount Carmel to talk with Elisha.
2KI.4.25	When Elisha saw her coming, he said, “Gehazi, look! It's the woman from Shunem. 
2KI.4.26	Run and meet her. And ask her if everything is all right with her and her family.”
2KI.4.26	“Everything is fine,” she answered Gehazi. 
2KI.4.27	But as soon as she got to the top of the mountain, she went over and grabbed Elisha by the feet.
2KI.4.27	Gehazi started toward her to push her away, when Elisha said, “Leave her alone! Don't you see how sad she is? But the 
2KI.4.28	The woman said, “Sir, I begged you not to get my hopes up, and I didn't even ask you for a son.”
2KI.4.29	“Gehazi, get ready and go to her house,” Elisha said. “Take along my walking stick, and when you get there, lay it on the boy's face. Don't stop to talk to anyone, even if they try to talk to you.”
2KI.4.30	But the boy's mother said to Elisha, “I swear by the living 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi ran on ahead and laid Elisha's walking stick on the boy's face, but the boy didn't move or make a sound. Gehazi ran back to Elisha and said, “The boy didn't wake up.”
2KI.4.32	Elisha arrived at the woman's house and went straight to his room, where he saw the boy's body on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	He walked in, shut the door, and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	 Then he got on the bed and stretched out over the dead body, with his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hand on his hands. As he lay there, the boy's body became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room, then he went back and leaned over the boy's body. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	Elisha called out to Gehazi, “Ask the boy's mother to come here.” Gehazi did, and when she was at the door, Elisha said, “You can take your son.”
2KI.4.37	She came in and bowed down at Elisha's feet. Then she picked up her son and left.
2KI.4.38	Later, Elisha went back to Gilgal, where there was almost nothing to eat, because the crops had failed.
2KI.4.38	One day while the prophets who lived there were meeting with Elisha, he said to his servant, “Prepare a big pot of stew for these prophets.”
2KI.4.39	One of them went out into the woods to gather some herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as much of its fruit as he could carry, but he didn't know that the fruit was very sour. When he got back, he cut up the fruit and put it in the stew.
2KI.4.40	The stew was served, and when the prophets started eating it, they shouted, “Elisha, this stew tastes terrible! We can't eat it.”
2KI.4.41	“Bring me some flour,” Elisha said. He sprinkled the flour in the stew and said, “Now serve it to them.” And the stew tasted fine.
2KI.4.42	A man from the town of Baal-Shalishah
2KI.4.43	“There's not enough here for 100 people,” his servant said.
2KI.4.43	“Just give it to them,” Elisha replied. “The 
2KI.4.44	So the servant served the bread and grain to the people. They ate and still had some left over, just as the 
2KI.5.2	One day while the Syrian troops were raiding Israel, they captured a girl, and she became a servant of Naaman's wife. 
2KI.5.3	Some time later the girl said, “If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would be cured of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.4	When Naaman told the king what the girl had said, 
2KI.5.5	the king replied, “Go ahead! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.”
2KI.5.5	Naaman left and took along 30,000 pieces of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and 10 new outfits. 
2KI.5.6	He also carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, “I am sending my servant Naaman to you. Would you cure him of his leprosy?”
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in fear and shouted, “That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy! Does he think I'm God with power over life and death? He must be trying to pick a fight with me.”
2KI.5.8	As soon as Elisha the prophet
2KI.5.9	Naaman left with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent someone outside to say to him, “Go wash seven times in the Jordan River. Then you'll be completely cured.”
2KI.5.11	But Naaman stormed off, grumbling, “Why couldn't he come out and talk to me? I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the 
2KI.5.12	What about the Abana River
2KI.5.13	His servants went over to him and said, “Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. So why don't you do what he said? Go wash and be cured.”
2KI.5.14	Naaman walked down to the Jordan; he waded out into the water and stooped down in it seven times, just as Elisha had told him. At once, he was cured, and his skin became as smooth as a child's.
2KI.5.15	Naaman and his officials went back to Elisha. Naaman stood in front of him and announced, “Now I know that the God of Israel is the only God in the whole world. Sir, would you please accept a gift from me?”
2KI.5.16	“I am a servant of the living 
2KI.5.16	Naaman kept begging, but Elisha kept refusing. 
2KI.5.17	Finally Naaman said, “If you won't accept a gift, then please let me take home as much soil as two mules can pull in a wagon. Sir, from now on I will offer sacrifices only to the 
2KI.5.18	But I pray that the 
2KI.5.19	“Go on home, and don't worry about that,” Elisha replied. Then Naaman left.
2KI.5.19	After Naaman had gone only a short distance, 
2KI.5.20	Gehazi said to himself, “Elisha let that Syrian off too easy. He should have taken Naaman's gift. I swear by the living 
2KI.5.21	So he hurried after Naaman.
2KI.5.21	When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he got out of his chariot to meet him. Naaman asked, “Is everything all right?”
2KI.5.22	“Yes,” Gehazi answered. “But my master has sent me to tell you about two young prophets from the hills of Ephraim. They came asking for help, and now Elisha wants to know if you would give them 3,000 pieces of silver and some new clothes?”
2KI.5.23	“Sure,” Naaman replied. “But why don't you take twice that amount of silver?” He convinced Gehazi to take it all, then put the silver in two bags. He handed the bags and the clothes to his two servants, and they carried them for Gehazi.
2KI.5.24	When they reached the hill where Gehazi lived, he took the bags from the servants and placed them in his house, then sent the men away. After they had gone, 
2KI.5.25	Gehazi went in and stood in front of Elisha, who asked, “Gehazi, where have you been?”
2KI.5.25	“Nowhere, sir,” Gehazi answered.
2KI.5.26	Elisha asked, “Don't you know that my spirit was there when Naaman got out of his chariot to talk with you? Gehazi, you have no right to accept money or clothes, olive orchards or vineyards, sheep or cattle, or servants. 
2KI.5.27	Because of what you've done, Naaman's leprosy
2KI.5.27	Suddenly, Gehazi's skin became white with leprosy, and he left.
2KI.6.1	One day the prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we meet with you is too small. 
2KI.6.2	Why don't we build a new meeting place near the Jordan River? Each of us could get some wood, then we could build it.”
2KI.6.2	“That's a good idea,” Elisha replied, “get started.”
2KI.6.3	“Aren't you going with us?” one of the prophets asked.
2KI.6.3	“Yes, I'll go,” Elisha answered, 
2KI.6.4	and he left with them.
2KI.6.4	They went to the Jordan River and began chopping down trees. 
2KI.6.5	While one of the prophets was working, his ax head fell off and dropped into the water. “Oh!” he shouted. “Sir, I borrowed this ax.”
2KI.6.6	“Where did it fall in?” Elisha asked. The prophet pointed to the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. The ax head floated to the top of the water.
2KI.6.7	“Now get it,” Elisha told him. And the prophet reached in and grabbed it.
2KI.6.8	Time after time, when the king of Syria was at war against the Israelites, he met with his officers and announced, “I've decided where we will set up camp.”
2KI.6.9	Each time, Elisha
2KI.6.10	So the king would warn the Israelite troops in that place to be on guard.
2KI.6.11	The king of Syria was furious when he found out what was happening. He called in his officers and asked, “Which one of you has been telling the king of Israel our plans?”
2KI.6.12	“None of us, Your Majesty,” one of them answered. “It's an Israelite named Elisha. He's a prophet, so he can tell his king everything—even what you say in your own room.”
2KI.6.13	“Find out where he is!” the king ordered. “I'll send soldiers to bring him here.”
2KI.6.13	They learned that Elisha was in the town of Dothan
2KI.6.14	He ordered his best troops to go there with horses and chariots. They marched out during the night and surrounded the town.
2KI.6.15	When Elisha's servant got up the next morning, he saw that Syrian troops had the town surrounded. “Sir, what are we going to do?” he asked.
2KI.6.16	“Don't be afraid,” Elisha answered. “There are more troops on our side than on theirs.” 
2KI.6.17	Then he prayed, “
2KI.6.18	As the Syrian army came closer, Elisha prayed, “
2KI.6.19	Elisha told the enemy troops, “You've taken the wrong road and are in the wrong town. Follow me. I'll lead you to the man you're looking for.” Elisha led them straight to the capital city of Samaria.
2KI.6.20	When all the soldiers were inside the city, Elisha prayed, “
2KI.6.21	The king of Israel saw them and asked Elisha, “Should I kill them, sir?”
2KI.6.22	“No!” Elisha answered. “You didn't capture these troops in battle, so you have no right to kill them. Instead, give them something to eat and drink and let them return to their leader.”
2KI.6.23	The king ordered a huge meal to be prepared for Syria's army, and when they finished eating, he let them go.
2KI.6.23	For a while, the Syrian troops stopped invading Israel's territory.
2KI.6.24	Some time later, King Benhadad of Syria
2KI.6.25	They kept up the attack until there was nothing to eat in the city. In fact, a donkey's head cost 80 pieces of silver, and a small bowl of pigeon droppings
2KI.6.26	One day as the king of Israel
2KI.6.27	“Let the 
2KI.6.28	Then he asked, “What's the matter anyway?”
2KI.6.28	The woman answered, “Another woman and I were so hungry that we agreed to eat our sons. She said if we ate my son one day, we could eat hers the next day. 
2KI.6.29	 So yesterday we cooked my son and ate him. But today when I went to her house to eat her son, she had hidden him.”
2KI.6.30	The king tore off his clothes in sorrow, and since he was on top of the city wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath. 
2KI.6.31	He said, “I pray that God will punish me terribly, if Elisha's head is still on his shoulders by this time tomorrow.” 
2KI.6.32	Then he sent a messenger to Elisha.
2KI.6.32	Elisha was home at the time, and the important leaders of Israel were meeting with him. Even before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha told the leaders, “That murderer
2KI.6.33	Before Elisha finished talking, the messenger
2KI.7.1	Elisha answered, “I have a message for you. The 
2KI.7.2	The chief officer there with the king replied, “I don't believe it! Even if the 
2KI.7.2	“You will see it happen, but you won't eat any of the food,” Elisha warned him.
2KI.7.3	About the same time, four men with leprosy
2KI.7.4	There's nothing to eat in the city, so we would starve if we went inside. But if we stay out here, we will die for sure. Let's sneak over to the Syrian army camp and surrender. They might kill us, but they might not.” 
2KI.7.5+2KI.7.6+2KI.7.7+2KI.7.8	That evening the four men got up and left for the Syrian camp.
2KI.7.5+2KI.7.6+2KI.7.7+2KI.7.8	As they walked toward the camp, the Lord caused the Syrian troops to hear what sounded like the roar of a huge cavalry. The soldiers said to each other, “Listen! The king of Israel must have hired Hittite and Egyptian troops to attack us. Let's get out of here!” So they ran out of their camp that night, leaving their tents and horses and donkeys.
2KI.7.5+2KI.7.6+2KI.7.7+2KI.7.8	When the four men with leprosy reached the edge of the Syrian camp, no one was there. They walked into one of the tents, where they ate and drank, before carrying off clothes, as well as silver and gold. They hid all this, then walked into another tent; they took what they wanted and hid it too.
2KI.7.9	They said to each other, “This isn't right. Today is a day to celebrate, and we haven't told anyone else what has happened. If we wait until morning, we will be punished. Let's go to the king's palace at once and tell the good news.”
2KI.7.10	They went back to Samaria and shouted up to the guards at the gate, “We've just come from the Syrian army camp, and all the soldiers are gone! The tents are empty, and the horses and donkeys are still tied up. We didn't see or hear anybody.”
2KI.7.11	The guards reported the news to the king's palace. 
2KI.7.12	The king got out of bed and said to his officers, “I know what those Syrians are doing. They know we're starving, so they're hiding in the fields, hoping we will go out to look for food. When we do, they can capture us and take over our city.”
2KI.7.13	One of his officers replied, “We have a few horses left—why don't we let some men take five of them and go to the Syrian camp and see what's happening? We're going to die anyway like those who have already died.”
2KI.7.14	They found two chariots, and the king commanded the men to find out what had happened to the Syrian troops.
2KI.7.15	The men rode as far as the Jordan River. All along the way they saw clothes and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away as they escaped. Then they went back to the king and told him what they had seen.
2KI.7.16	At once the people went to the Syrian camp and carried off what was left. They took so much that a large sack of flour and two large sacks of barley sold for almost nothing, just as the 
2KI.7.17	The king of Israel had put his chief officer in charge of the gate, but he died when the people trampled him as they rushed out of the city. 
2KI.7.18	Earlier, when the king was at Elisha's house, Elisha had told him that flour or barley would sell for almost nothing. 
2KI.7.19	But the officer refused to believe that even the 
2KI.7.20	And that's exactly what happened—the officer was trampled to death.
2KI.8.2	The woman did exactly what Elisha had said and went to live in Philistine territory.
2KI.8.2	She and her family lived there seven years. 
2KI.8.3	Then she returned to Israel and immediately begged the king to give back her house and property.
2KI.8.4	Meanwhile, the king was asking Gehazi the servant of Elisha about the amazing things Elisha had been doing. 
2KI.8.5	While Gehazi was telling him that Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life, the woman and her son arrived.
2KI.8.5	“Here's the boy, Your Majesty,” Gehazi said. “And this is his mother.”
2KI.8.6	The king asked the woman to tell her story, and she told him everything that had happened. He then said to one of his officials, “I want you to make sure that this woman gets back everything that belonged to her, including the money her crops have made since the day she left Israel.”
2KI.8.7	Some time later Elisha went to the capital city of Damascus to visit King Benhadad of Syria, who was sick. And when Benhadad was told he was there, 
2KI.8.8	he said to Hazael,
2KI.8.9	Hazael left with forty camel loads of the best things made in Damascus as a gift for Elisha. He found the prophet and said, “Your servant, King Benhadad, wants to know if he will get well.”
2KI.8.10	“Tell him he will,” Elisha said to Hazael. “But the 
2KI.8.11	Elisha stared at him until Hazael was embarrassed, then Elisha began crying.
2KI.8.12	“Sir, why are you crying?” Hazael asked.
2KI.8.12	Elisha answered, “Because I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel. You will burn down their walled cities and slaughter their young men. You will even crush the heads of their babies and rip open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	“Hazael, the 
2KI.8.14	Hazael went back to Benhadad and told him, “Elisha said that you will get well.” 
2KI.8.15	But the very next day, Hazael got a thick blanket; he soaked it in water and held it over Benhadad's face until he died. Hazael then became king.
2KI.8.16	Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah in Joram's fifth year as king of Israel, while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah.
2KI.8.17	Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled 8 years from Jerusalem.
2KI.8.18	Jehoram disobeyed the 
2KI.8.19	 But the 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram
2KI.8.22	Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah
2KI.8.23	Everything else Jehoram did while he was king is written in 
2KI.8.24	Jehoram died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.25	Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah in the twelfth year of Joram's rule in Israel. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he ruled from Jerusalem for only one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Since Ahaziah was related to Ahab's family,
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle, 
2KI.8.29	so he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. Ahaziah went there to visit him.
2KI.9.1	One day, Elisha called for one of the other prophets and said:
2KI.9.1	Take this bottle of olive oil and get ready to go to the town of Ramoth in Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you get there, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a place where the two of you can be alone, 
2KI.9.3	then pour olive oil on his head to show that he is the new king. Say to him, “The 
2KI.9.4	The young prophet left for Ramoth. 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived, the army officers were meeting together. “Sir, I have a message for you,” he said.
2KI.9.5	“For which one of us?” Jehu asked.
2KI.9.5	“You, sir,” the prophet answered. 
2KI.9.6	 So Jehu got up and went inside.
2KI.9.6	The 
2KI.9.7	I want you to wipe out the family of Ahab, so Jezebel will be punished for killing the prophets and my other servants. 
2KI.9.8	Every man and boy in Ahab's family must die, whether slave or free. 
2KI.9.9	His whole family must be destroyed, just like the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	 As for Jezebel, her body will be eaten by dogs in the town of Jezreel. There won't be enough left of her to bury.”
2KI.9.10	Then the young prophet opened the door and ran out.
2KI.9.11	Jehu went back to his officers, and one of them asked, “What did that crazy prophet want? Is everything all right?”
2KI.9.11	“You know him and how he talks,” Jehu answered.
2KI.9.12	“No, we don't. What did he say?” they asked.
2KI.9.12	“He had a message from the 
2KI.9.13	They quickly grabbed their coats and spread them out on the steps where Jehu was standing. Someone blew a trumpet, and everyone shouted, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14+2KI.9.15+2KI.9.16	King Joram
2KI.9.14+2KI.9.15+2KI.9.16	Meanwhile, Jehu was in Ramoth, making plans to kill Joram. He said to his officers, “If you want me to be king, then don't let anyone leave this town. They might go to Jezreel and tell Joram.” Then Jehu got in his chariot and rode to Jezreel.
2KI.9.17	When the guard in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men riding up, he shouted to the king, “I see a large group of men coming this way.”
2KI.9.17	Joram ordered, “Send someone out to ask them if this is a friendly visit.”
2KI.9.18	One of the soldiers rode out and said to Jehu, “King Joram wants to know if this is a friendly visit.”
2KI.9.18	“What's it to you?” Jehu asked. “Just stay behind me with the rest of my troops!”
2KI.9.18	About the same time the guard in the watchtower said, “Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back.”
2KI.9.19	So Joram sent out another rider, who rode up to Jehu and said, “The king wants to know if this is a friendly visit.”
2KI.9.19	“What's it to you?” Jehu asked. “Just get behind me with the rest of my troops!”
2KI.9.20	The guard in the watchtower said, “Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back either. Wait a minute! That one man is a reckless chariot driver—it must be Jehu!”
2KI.9.21	Joram commanded, “Get my chariot ready.” Then he and Ahaziah got in their chariots and rode out to meet Jehu. They all met on the land that had belonged to Naboth.
2KI.9.22	Joram asked, “Jehu, is this a peaceful visit?”
2KI.9.22	“How can there be peace?” Jehu asked. “Your mother Jezebel has caused everyone to worship idols and practice witchcraft.”
2KI.9.23	“Ahaziah, let's get out of here!” Joram yelled. “It's a trap!” As Joram tried to escape, 
2KI.9.24	Jehu shot an arrow. It hit Joram between his shoulders, then it went through his heart and came out his chest. He fell over dead in his chariot.
2KI.9.27	Ahaziah saw all of this happen and tried to escape to the town of Beth-Haggan, but Jehu caught up with him and shouted, “Kill him too!” So his troops shot Ahaziah with an arrow while he was on the road to Gur near Ibleam. He went as far as Megiddo, where he died. 
2KI.9.28	Ahaziah's officers put his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where they buried him beside his ancestors.
2KI.9.29	Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year of the rule of Ahab's son Joram.
2KI.9.30	Jehu headed toward Jezreel, and when Jezebel heard he was coming, she put on eye shadow and brushed her hair. Then she stood at the window, waiting for him to arrive. 
2KI.9.31	As he walked through the city gate, she shouted down to him, “Why did you come here, you murderer? To kill the king? You're no better than Zimri!”
2KI.9.32	He looked up toward the window and asked, “Is anyone up there on my side?” A few palace workers stuck their heads out of a window, 
2KI.9.33	and Jehu shouted, “Throw her out the window!” They threw her down, and her blood splattered on the walls and on the horses that trampled her body.
2KI.9.34	Jehu left to get something to eat and drink. Then he told some workers, “Even though she was evil, she was a king's daughter,
2KI.9.35	But when they went out to bury her body, they found only her skull, her hands, and her feet. 
2KI.9.36	 They reported this to Jehu, and he said, “The 
2KI.9.37	And he warned that her bones would be spread all over the ground like manure, so that no one could tell who it was.”
2KI.10.1	Ahab still had 70 descendants living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote a letter to each of the important leaders and officials of the town,
2KI.10.2	Your town is strong, and you're protected by chariots and an armed cavalry. And I know that King Ahab's descendants live there with you. So as soon as you read this letter, 
2KI.10.3	choose the best person for the job and make him the next king. Then be prepared to defend Ahab's family.
2KI.10.4	The officials and leaders read the letters and were very frightened. They said to each other, “Jehu has already killed King Joram and King Ahaziah! We have to do what he says.” 
2KI.10.5	The prime minister, the mayor of the city, as well as the other leaders and Ahab's supporters, sent this answer to Jehu, “We are your servants, Your Majesty, and we will do whatever you tell us. But it's not our place to choose someone to be king. You do what you think is best.”
2KI.10.6	Jehu then wrote another letter which said, “If you are on my side and will obey me, then prove it. Bring me the heads of the descendants of Ahab! And be here in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
2KI.10.6	The 70 descendants of King Ahab were living with some of the most important people of the city. 
2KI.10.7	And when these people read Jehu's second letter, they called together all 70 of Ahab's descendants. They killed them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jezreel.
2KI.10.8	When Jehu was told what had happened, he said, “Put the heads in two piles at the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”
2KI.10.9	The next morning, Jehu went out and stood where everyone could hear him, and he said, “You people are not guilty of anything. I'm the one who plotted against Joram and had him killed. But who killed all these men? 
2KI.10.10	Listen to me. Everything the 
2KI.10.12+2KI.10.13	Jehu left for Samaria, and along the way, he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah at a place where shepherds meet.
2KI.10.12+2KI.10.13	“We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered. “We're going to visit his family.”
2KI.10.14	“Take them alive!” Jehu said to his officers. So they grabbed them and led them to the well near the shepherds' meeting place, where they killed all 42 of them.
2KI.10.15	As Jehu went on, he saw Jehonadab son of Rechab
2KI.10.15	“Yes, I am.”
2KI.10.15	“Then give me your hand,” Jehu answered. He helped Jehonadab into his chariot 
2KI.10.16	and said, “Come with me and see how faithful I am to the 
2KI.10.16	They rode together in Jehu's chariot 
2KI.10.17	to Samaria. Jehu killed everyone there who belonged to Ahab's family, as well as all his officials. Everyone in his family was now dead, just as the 
2KI.10.18	Jehu called together the people in Samaria and said:
2KI.10.18	King Ahab sometimes worshiped Baal, but I will be completely faithful to Baal. 
2KI.10.19	I'm going to offer a huge sacrifice to him. So invite his prophets and priests, and be sure everyone who worships him is there. Anyone who doesn't come will be killed.
2KI.10.19	But this was a trick—Jehu was really planning to kill the worshipers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	He said, “Announce a day of worship for Baal!” After the day had been announced, 
2KI.10.21	Jehu sent an invitation to everyone in Israel. All the worshipers of Baal came, and the temple was filled from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	Jehu told the official in charge of the sacred robes to make sure that everyone had a robe to wear.
2KI.10.23	Jehu and Jehonadab went into the temple, and Jehu said to the crowd, “Look around and make sure that only the worshipers of Baal are here. No one who worships the 
2KI.10.24	Then they began to offer sacrifices to Baal.
2KI.10.24	Earlier, Jehu had ordered 80 soldiers to wait outside the temple. He had warned them, “I will get all these worshipers here, and if any of you let even one of them escape, you will be killed instead!”
2KI.10.25	As soon as Jehu finished offering the sacrifice, he told the guards and soldiers, “Come in and kill them! Don't let anyone escape.” They slaughtered everyone in the crowd and threw the bodies outside. Then they went back into the temple 
2KI.10.26	and carried out the image of Baal. They burned it 
2KI.10.27	and broke it into pieces, then they completely destroyed Baal's temple. And since that time, it's been nothing but a public toilet.
2KI.10.28	That's how Jehu stopped the worship of Baal in Israel. 
2KI.10.29	 But he did not stop the worship of the gold statues of calves at Dan and Bethel that Jeroboam had made for the people to worship.
2KI.10.30	Later the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu did not completely obey the commands of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	of the regions of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River and north of the town of Aroer near the Arnon River. This was the land where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh had once lived.
2KI.10.34	Everything else Jehu did while he was king, including his brave deeds, is written in 
2KI.10.35	Jehu died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz became king. 
2KI.10.36	Jehu had ruled Israel 28 years from Samaria.
2KI.11.1	As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done that, 
2KI.11.2	but Jehosheba rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as he was about to be murdered. Jehosheba, who was Jehoram's
2KI.11.3	Joash hid in the temple with Jehosheba
2KI.11.4	Joash son of Ahaziah had hidden in the 
2KI.11.5	and said to them:
2KI.11.5	Here's what I want you to do. Three of your guard units will be on duty on the Sabbath. I want one unit to guard the palace. 
2KI.11.6	Another unit will guard Sur Gate, and the third unit will guard the palace gate and relieve the palace guards.
2KI.11.7	The other two guard units are supposed to be off duty on the Sabbath. But I want both of them to stay here at the temple and protect King Joash. 
2KI.11.8	Make sure they follow him wherever he goes, and tell them to keep their swords ready to kill anyone who tries to get near him.
2KI.11.9	The commanders followed Jehoiada's orders. Each one called together his guards—those coming on duty and those going off duty. 
2KI.11.10	Jehoiada brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David and gave them to the commanders. 
2KI.11.11	Then they gave the weapons to their guards, who took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect Joash on every side.
2KI.11.12	Jehoiada brought Joash outside, where he placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, while the crowd clapped and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	Queen Athaliah heard the crowd and went to the temple. 
2KI.11.14	 There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns, which was the usual place for the king. The singers
2KI.11.15	At once, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, “Kill her! But don't do it anywhere near the 
2KI.11.16	So the commanders dragged her to the gate where horses are led into the palace, and they killed her there.
2KI.11.17	Jehoiada the priest asked King Joash and the people to promise that they would be faithful to each other and to the 
2KI.11.18	Then the crowd went to the temple built to honor Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal right in front of the altars.
2KI.11.18	After Jehoiada had placed guards around the 
2KI.11.19	he called together all the commanders, the king's special bodyguards,
2KI.11.20	Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again. 
2KI.11.21	Joash was only seven years old when this happened.
2KI.12.1	Joash
2KI.12.2	Jehoiada the priest taught Joash what was right, and so for the rest of his life Joash obeyed the 
2KI.12.3	But even Joash did not destroy the local shrines,
2KI.12.5	and use it to repair the temple whenever you see the need.”
2KI.12.6	But the priests never started repairing the temple. So in the twenty-third year of his rule, 
2KI.12.7	Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and said, “Why aren't you using the money to repair the temple? Don't take any more money for yourselves. It is only to be used to pay for the repairs.” 
2KI.12.8	The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money or be in charge of the temple repairs.
2KI.12.9	Jehoiada found a wooden box; he cut a hole in the top of it and set it on the right side of the altar where people went into the temple. Whenever someone gave money to the temple, the priests guarding the entrance would put it into this box. 
2KI.12.10	When the box was full of money, the king's secretary and the chief priest would count the money and put it in bags. 
2KI.12.11	Then they would give it to the men supervising the repairs to the temple. Some of the money was used to pay the builders, the woodworkers, 
2KI.12.12	the stonecutters, and the men who built the walls. And some was used to buy wood and stone and to pay any other costs for repairing the temple.
2KI.12.13	While the repairs were being made, the money that was given to the temple was not used to make silver bowls, lamp snuffers, small sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or anything gold or silver for the temple. 
2KI.12.14	It went only to pay for repairs. 
2KI.12.15	 The men in charge were honest, so no one had to keep track of the money.
2KI.12.17	About the same time, King Hazael of Syria attacked the town of Gath and captured it. Next, he decided to attack Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	So Joash collected everything he and his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated to the 
2KI.12.19	Everything else Joash did while he was king is written in 
2KI.12.20+2KI.12.21	At the end of his rule, some of his officers rebelled against him. Jozabad
2KI.13.1	Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in the twenty-third year of Joash's rule in Judah. Jehoahaz ruled 17 years from Samaria 
2KI.13.2	and disobeyed the 
2KI.13.3	The 
2KI.13.4	Jehoahaz prayed to the 
2KI.13.5	by sending Israel a leader who rescued them from the Syrians,
2KI.13.6+2KI.13.7	But Hazael had defeated Israel's army so badly that Jehoahaz had only 10 chariots, 50 cavalry troops, and 10,000 regular soldiers left in his army.
2KI.13.6+2KI.13.7	The Israelites kept sinning and following the example of Jeroboam's family. They did not tear down the sacred poles
2KI.13.8	Everything else Jehoahaz did while he was king, including his brave deeds, is written in 
2KI.13.9	Jehoahaz died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoash became king.
2KI.13.10	Jehoash became king of Israel in the thirty-seventh year of Joash's rule in Judah, and he ruled 16 years from Samaria. 
2KI.13.11	He disobeyed the 
2KI.13.12	Everything else Jehoash did while he was king, including his war against King Amaziah of Judah, is written in 
2KI.13.13	Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria beside the other Israelite kings. His son Jeroboam then became king.
2KI.13.15+2KI.13.16	“Grab a bow and some arrows,” Elisha told him, “and hold them in your hand.” Jehoash grabbed the bow and arrows and held them. Elisha placed his hand on the king's hand 
2KI.13.17	and said, “Open the window facing east.” When it was open, Elisha shouted, “Now shoot!” Jehoash shot an arrow and Elisha said, “That arrow is a sign that the 
2KI.13.18	Elisha said, “Pick up the arrows and hit the ground with them.” Jehoash grabbed the arrows and hit the ground three times, then stopped. 
2KI.13.19	Elisha became angry with the king and exclaimed, “If you had struck it five or six times, you would completely wipe out the Syrians. Now you will defeat them only three times.”
2KI.13.20	Elisha died and was buried.
2KI.13.20	Every year in the spring, Moab's leaders sent raiding parties into Israel. 
2KI.13.21	Once, while some Israelites were burying a man's body, they saw a group of Moabites. The Israelites quickly threw the body into Elisha's tomb and ran away. As soon as the man's body touched the bones of Elisha, the man came back to life and stood up.
2KI.13.22	Israel was under the power of King Hazael of Syria during the entire rule of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	Hazael died, and his son Benhadad then became king of Syria. 
2KI.13.25	King Jehoash of Israel attacked and defeated the Syrian army three times. He took back from Benhadad all the towns Hazael had captured in battle from his father Jehoahaz.
2KI.14.1	Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah in the second year of Jehoash's rule in Israel. 
2KI.14.2	Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem, which was also the hometown of his mother Jehoaddin.
2KI.14.3	Amaziah followed the example of his father Joash by obeying the 
2KI.14.4	Amaziah did not destroy the local shrines, and they were still used as places for offering sacrifices.
2KI.14.5	As soon as Amaziah had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father. 
2KI.14.6	 But the children of those officers were not killed. The 
2KI.14.7	While Amaziah was king, he killed 10,000 Edomite soldiers in Salt Valley. He captured the town of Sela and renamed it Joktheel, which is still its name.
2KI.14.8	One day, Amaziah sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel: “Come out and face me in battle!”
2KI.14.9	Jehoash sent back this reply:
2KI.14.9	Once upon a time, a small thornbush in Lebanon announced that his son was going to marry the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush.
2KI.14.10	Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. Go ahead and celebrate—but stay at home. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed.
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah refused to listen. So Jehoash and his troops marched to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops. 
2KI.14.12	During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home, 
2KI.14.13	and Jehoash captured Amaziah.
2KI.14.13	Jehoash then marched to Jerusalem and broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly 200 meters long. 
2KI.14.14	He took the gold and silver, as well as everything of value from the 
2KI.14.15	Everything else Jehoash did while he was king, including his brave deeds and how he defeated King Amaziah of Judah, is written in 
2KI.14.16	Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria beside the other Israelite kings. His son Jeroboam then became king.
2KI.14.17	Fifteen years after Jehoash died, 
2KI.14.18+2KI.14.19+2KI.14.20	some people in Jerusalem plotted against Amaziah. He was able to escape to the town of Lachish, but another group of people caught him and killed him there. His body was taken back to Jerusalem on horseback and buried beside his ancestors.
2KI.14.18+2KI.14.19+2KI.14.20	Everything else Amaziah did while he was king is written in 
2KI.14.21	After his death the people of Judah made his son Azariah king, even though he was only 16 at the time. 
2KI.14.22	Azariah was the one who later recaptured and rebuilt the town of Elath.
2KI.14.23	Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel in the fifteenth year of Amaziah's rule in Judah. Jeroboam ruled 41 years from Samaria. 
2KI.14.24	He disobeyed the 
2KI.14.26	The 
2KI.14.27	And since the 
2KI.14.28	Everything else Jeroboam did while he was king, including his brave deeds and how he recaptured the towns of Damascus and Hamath,
2KI.14.29	Jeroboam died and was buried, and his son Zechariah became king.
2KI.15.1	Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah in Jeroboam's twenty-seventh year as king of Israel. 
2KI.15.2	He was only 16 years old when he became king, and he ruled 52 years from Jerusalem, which was also the hometown of his mother Jecoliah.
2KI.15.3	Azariah obeyed the 
2KI.15.4	But Azariah did not destroy the local shrines,
2KI.15.5	The 
2KI.15.6	Everything else Azariah did while he was king is written in 
2KI.15.7	 Azariah died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. His son Jotham then became king.
2KI.15.8	Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's rule in Judah, but he ruled only six months from Samaria. 
2KI.15.9	Like his ancestors, Zechariah disobeyed the 
2KI.15.10	Shallum son of Jabesh plotted against Zechariah and killed him in public.
2KI.15.11+2KI.15.12	 So the 
2KI.15.11+2KI.15.12	Everything else Zechariah did while he was king is written in 
2KI.15.13	Shallum became king of Israel in the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's
2KI.15.14+2KI.15.15+2KI.15.16	Menahem son of Gadi came to Samaria from Tirzah and killed him. Menahem then became king. The town of Tiphsah would not surrender to him, so he destroyed it and all the surrounding towns as far as Tirzah. He killed everyone living in Tiphsah, and with his sword he even ripped open pregnant women.
2KI.15.14+2KI.15.15+2KI.15.16	Everything else Shallum did while he was king, including his plot against Zechariah, is written in 
2KI.15.17	Menahem became king of Israel in Azariah's thirty-ninth year as king of Judah, and he ruled Israel ten years from Samaria. 
2KI.15.18	He constantly disobeyed the 
2KI.15.19	During Menahem's rule, King Tiglath Pileser
2KI.15.20	So Menahem ordered every rich person in Israel to give him at least 50 pieces of silver, and he gave it all to Tiglath Pileser, who stopped his attack and left Israel.
2KI.15.21	Everything else Menahem did while he was king is written in 
2KI.15.22	Menahem died, and his son Pekahiah became king.
2KI.15.23	Pekahiah became king of Israel in the fiftieth year of Azariah's rule in Judah, and he ruled two years from Samaria. 
2KI.15.24	He disobeyed the 
2KI.15.25	Pekah son of Remaliah was Pekahiah's chief officer, but he made plans to kill the king. So he and 50 men from Gilead broke into the strongest part of the palace in Samaria and murdered Pekahiah, together with Argob and Arieh.
2KI.15.26	Everything else Pekahiah did while he was king is written in 
2KI.15.27	Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in Azariah's fifty-second year as king of Judah, and he ruled 20 years from Samaria. 
2KI.15.28	He disobeyed the 
2KI.15.29	During Pekah's rule, King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria marched into Israel. He captured the territories of Gilead and Galilee, including the towns of Ijon, Abel-Bethmaacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor, as well as the entire territory of Naphtali. Then he took Israelites from those regions to Assyria as prisoners.
2KI.15.30	In the twentieth year of Jotham's rule in Judah, Hoshea son of Elah plotted against Pekah and murdered him. Hoshea then became king of Israel.

2KI.15.32	Jotham son of Azariah
2KI.15.33	Jotham was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 16 years from Jerusalem. His mother Jerusha was the daughter of Zadok.

2KI.15.38	Jotham died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Ahaz became king.
2KI.16.1	Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah in the seventeenth year of Pekah's rule in Israel. 
2KI.16.2	He was 20 years old at the time, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 16 years.
2KI.16.2	Ahaz wasn't like his ancestor David. Instead, he disobeyed the 
2KI.16.3	 and was even more sinful than the kings of Israel. He sacrificed his own son, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the 
2KI.16.4	Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees.
2KI.16.5+2KI.16.6	About the same time, King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah of Israel marched to Jerusalem and attacked, but they could not capture it.
2KI.16.7	Ahaz sent a message to King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria that said, “Your Majesty, King Rezin and King Pekah are attacking me, your loyal servant. Please come and rescue me.” 
2KI.16.8	Along with the message, Ahaz sent silver and gold from the 
2KI.16.9	As soon as Tiglath Pileser received the message, he and his troops marched to Syria. He captured the capital city of Damascus, then he took the people living there to the town of Kir as prisoners and killed King Rezin.
2KI.16.10	Later, Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser. And while Ahaz was there, he saw an altar and sent a model of it back to Uriah the priest, along with the plans for building one. 
2KI.16.11	Uriah followed the plans and built an altar exactly like the one in Damascus, finishing it just before Ahaz came back.
2KI.16.12	When Ahaz returned, he went to see the altar and to offer sacrifices on it. He walked up to the altar 
2KI.16.13	and poured wine over it. Then he offered sacrifices to please the 
2KI.16.14	 After that, he had the bronze altar moved aside,
2KI.16.15	He told Uriah the priest:
2KI.16.15	From now on, the morning and evening sacrifices as well as all gifts of grain and wine are to be offered on this altar. The sacrifices for the people and for the king must also be offered here. Sprinkle the blood from all the sacrifices on it, but leave the bronze altar for me to use for prayer and finding out what God wants me to do.
2KI.16.16	Uriah did everything Ahaz told him.
2KI.16.18	He took down the special tent that was used for worship on the Sabbath

2KI.16.20	 Ahaz died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem,
2KI.17.1	Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in the twelfth year of Ahaz's rule in Judah, and he ruled nine years from Samaria. 
2KI.17.2	Hoshea disobeyed the 
2KI.17.3	During Hoshea's rule, King Shalmaneser of Assyria
2KI.17.4	But later, Hoshea refused to pay the taxes and asked King So of Egypt to help him rebel. When Shalmaneser found out, he arrested Hoshea and put him in prison.
2KI.17.5	Shalmaneser invaded Israel and attacked the city of Samaria for three years, 
2KI.17.6	before capturing it in the ninth year of Hoshea's rule. The Assyrian king
2KI.17.7	All of this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the

2KI.17.9	Even worse, the Israelites tried to hide their sins from the 
2KI.17.10	 They also built stone images of foreign gods and set up sacred poles

2KI.17.14	But the Israelites would not listen; they were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to worship the 
2KI.17.15	They ignored the 
2KI.17.17	 They used magic and witchcraft and even sacrificed their own children. The Israelites were determined to do whatever the 
2KI.17.18	The 
2KI.17.18	Only the people living in Judah were left, 
2KI.17.19	but they also disobeyed the 
2KI.17.20	So the 
2KI.17.21	Earlier, when the 
2KI.17.22	The people kept on sinning like Jeroboam, 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.23	That's why the people of Israel were taken away as prisoners to Assyria, and that's where they remained.
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria took people who were living in the cities of Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and forced them to move to Israel. They took over the towns where the Israelites had lived, including the capital city of Samaria.
2KI.17.25	At first these people did not worship the 
2KI.17.26	A messenger told the king of Assyria, “The people you moved to Israel don't know how to worship the god of that country. So he sent lions that have attacked and killed some of them.”
2KI.17.27	The king replied, “Get one of the Israelite priests we brought here and send him back to Israel. He can live there and teach them about the god of that country.” 
2KI.17.28	One of the Israelite priests was chosen to go back to Israel. He lived in Bethel and taught the people how to worship the 
2KI.17.29	But in towns all over Israel, the different groups of people made statues of their own gods, then they placed these idols in local Israelite
2KI.17.30	The people from Babylonia made the god Succoth-Benoth; those from Cuthah made the god Nergal; those from Hamath made Ashima; 
2KI.17.31	those from Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the people from Sepharvaim sacrificed their children to their own gods Adrammelech and Anammelech. 
2KI.17.32+2KI.17.33	They worshiped their own gods, just as they had before they were taken away to Israel. They also worshiped the 
2KI.17.34	 Everyone followed their old customs. None of them worshiped only the 
2KI.17.35	 At the time when the 
2KI.17.35	Do not worship any other gods! Do not bow down to them or offer them a sacrifice. 
2KI.17.36	 Worship only me! I am the one who rescued you from Egypt with my mighty power. Bow down to me and offer sacrifices. 
2KI.17.37	Never worship any other god, always obey my laws and teachings, 
2KI.17.38	and remember the solemn agreement between us.
2KI.17.38	I will say it again: Do not worship any god 
2KI.17.39	except me. I am the 
2KI.17.40	But the people living in Israel ignored that command and kept on following their old customs. 
2KI.17.41	They did worship the 
2KI.18.1	Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah in the third year of Hoshea's rule in Israel. 
2KI.18.2	Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem. His mother Abi was the daughter of Zechariah.
2KI.18.3	Hezekiah obeyed the 
2KI.18.4	 He destroyed the local shrines, then tore down the images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole for worshiping the goddess Asherah. He also smashed the bronze snake Moses had made. The people had named it Nehushtan
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah trusted the 
2KI.18.6	He was completely faithful to the 
2KI.18.7	The 
2KI.18.8	Hezekiah defeated the Philistine towns as far away as Gaza—from the smallest towns to the large, walled cities.
2KI.18.9	During the fourth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the seventh year of Hoshea's rule in Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria led his troops to Samaria, the capital city of Israel. They attacked 
2KI.18.10	and captured it three years later,
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria
2KI.18.12	All of that happened because the people of Israel had not obeyed the 
2KI.18.14	Hezekiah sent this message to Sennacherib, who was in the town of Lachish: “I know I am guilty of rebellion. But I will pay you whatever you want, if you stop your attack.”
2KI.18.14	Sennacherib told Hezekiah to pay ten tons of silver and one ton of gold. 
2KI.18.15	So Hezekiah collected all the silver from the 
2KI.18.16	He even stripped the gold that he had used to cover the doors and doorposts
2KI.18.17	The king of Assyria ordered his three highest military officers to leave Lachish and take a large army to Jerusalem. When they arrived, the officers stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool. 
2KI.18.18	They called out to Hezekiah, and three of his highest officials came out to meet them. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records.
2KI.18.19	One of the Assyrian commanders told them:
2KI.18.19	I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself. 
2KI.18.20	Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.21	Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand.
2KI.18.22	Is Hezekiah now depending on the 
2KI.18.23	The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people. He will give you 2,000 horses, if you have enough troops to ride them. 
2KI.18.24	How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry? 
2KI.18.25	Don't forget that it was the 
2KI.18.26	Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, “Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.”
2KI.18.27	The Assyrian army commander answered, “My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you.”
2KI.18.28	Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted in Hebrew:
2KI.18.28	Listen to what the great king of Assyria says! 
2KI.18.29	Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you. 
2KI.18.30	Don't trust him when he tells you that the 
2KI.18.31	Stop listening to Hezekiah! Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns 
2KI.18.32	for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards, raise your own grain, and have plenty of olive oil and honey. Believe me, you won't starve there.
2KI.18.32	Hezekiah claims the 
2KI.18.33	Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? What about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces? 
2KI.18.35	None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the 
2KI.18.36+2KI.18.37	Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah had been warned by King Hezekiah not to answer the Assyrian commander. So they tore their clothes in sorrow and reported to Hezekiah everything the commander had said.
2KI.19.1	As soon as Hezekiah heard the news, he tore off his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he went into the temple of the 
2KI.19.2	He told Prime Minister Eliakim, Assistant Prime Minister Shebna, and the senior priests to dress in sackcloth and tell the prophet Isaiah:
2KI.19.3	These are difficult and disgraceful times. Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth, when it's time for her baby to be born. 
2KI.19.4	Please pray for those of us who are left alive. The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God. Perhaps the 
2KI.19.5	When these leaders went to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	he told them that the 
2KI.19.6	I am the 
2KI.19.7	I will upset him with rumors about what's happening in his own country. He will go back, and there I will make him die a violent death.
2KI.19.8	Meanwhile, the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah. So he went there.
2KI.19.9	About this same time the king of Assyria learned that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia
2KI.19.10	Don't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me. 
2KI.19.11	You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations. What makes you feel so safe? 
2KI.19.12	The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar. What good did their gods do them? 
2KI.19.13	The kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah have all disappeared.
2KI.19.14	After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the 
2KI.19.15	 He prayed:
2KI.19.16	But just look how Sennacherib has insulted you, the living God.
2KI.19.17	It is true, our 
2KI.19.18	They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshiped. 
2KI.19.19	But you are our 
2KI.19.20	Isaiah went to Hezekiah and told him that the 
2KI.19.20	Hezekiah, I heard your prayer about King Sennacherib of Assyria. 
2KI.19.21	Now this is what I say to that king:
2KI.19.21	The people of Jerusalem
2KI.19.21	hate and make fun of you;
2KI.19.21	they laugh
2KI.19.21	behind your back.
2KI.19.22	Sennacherib, you cursed,
2KI.19.22	shouted, and sneered at me,
2KI.19.22	the holy God of Israel.
2KI.19.23	You let your officials
2KI.19.23	insult me, the Lord.
2KI.19.23	And this is how you
2KI.19.23	bragged about yourself:
2KI.19.23	“I led my chariots
2KI.19.23	to the highest heights
2KI.19.23	of Lebanon's mountains.
2KI.19.23	I went deep into its forest,
2KI.19.23	cutting down the best cedar
2KI.19.23	and cypress trees.
2KI.19.24	I dried up every stream
2KI.19.24	in the land of Egypt,
2KI.19.24	and I drank water
2KI.19.24	from wells I had dug.”
2KI.19.25	Sennacherib, now listen
2KI.19.25	to me, the Lord.
2KI.19.25	I planned all this long ago.
2KI.19.25	And you don't even realize
2KI.19.25	that I alone am the one
2KI.19.25	who decided that you
2KI.19.25	would do these things.
2KI.19.25	I let you make ruins
2KI.19.25	of fortified cities.
2KI.19.26	Their people became weak,
2KI.19.26	terribly confused.
2KI.19.26	They were like wild flowers
2KI.19.26	or tender young grass
2KI.19.26	growing on a flat roof,
2KI.19.26	scorched before it matures.
2KI.19.27	I know all about you,
2KI.19.27	even how fiercely angry
2KI.19.27	you are with me.
2KI.19.28	I have seen your pride
2KI.19.28	and the tremendous hatred
2KI.19.28	you have for me.
2KI.19.28	Now I will put a hook
2KI.19.28	in your nose,
2KI.19.28	a bit in your mouth,
2KI.19.28	then I will send you back
2KI.19.28	to where you came from.
2KI.19.29	Hezekiah, I will tell you what's going to happen. This year you will eat crops that grow on their own, and the next year you will eat whatever springs up where those crops grew. But the third year you will plant grain and vineyards, and you will eat what you harvest. 
2KI.19.30	Those who survive in Judah will be like a vine that puts down deep roots and bears fruit. 
2KI.19.31	I, the 
2KI.19.32	I promise that the king of Assyria won't get into Jerusalem, or shoot an arrow into the city, or even surround it and prepare to attack. 
2KI.19.33	As surely as I am the 
2KI.19.34	I will protect it for myself and for my servant David.
2KI.19.36	After this King Sennacherib went back to Assyria and lived in the city of Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	One day he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, when his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords. They escaped to the land of Ararat, and his son Esarhaddon became king.
2KI.20.1	About this time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. Isaiah the prophet went in and told him, “The 
2KI.20.2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed, 
2KI.20.3	“Don't forget that I have been faithful to you, 
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah got to the middle court of the palace, 
2KI.20.5	the 
2KI.20.5	Hezekiah, you are the ruler of my people, and I am the 
2KI.20.6	I will let you live 15 years more, while I protect you and your city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city as an honor to me and to my servant David.
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said to the king's servants, “Bring some mashed figs and place them on the king's open sore. He will then get well.”
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah asked Isaiah, “Can you prove that the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah replied, “The 
2KI.20.10	“It's normal for the sun to go forward,” Hezekiah answered. “But how can it go back?”
2KI.20.11	Isaiah prayed, and the 
2KI.20.12	Merodach
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah welcomed
2KI.20.14	Isaiah asked Hezekiah, “Where did these men come from? What did they want?”
2KI.20.14	“They came all the way from Babylonia,” Hezekiah answered.
2KI.20.15	“What did you show them?” Isaiah asked.
2KI.20.15	Hezekiah answered, “I showed them everything in my kingdom.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah told Hezekiah:
2KI.20.16	I have a message for you from the 
2KI.20.17	 One day everything you and your ancestors have stored up will be taken to Babylonia. The 
2KI.20.18	 Some of your own sons will be taken to Babylonia, where they will be disgraced and made to serve in the king's palace.
2KI.20.19	Hezekiah thought, “At least our nation will be at peace for a while.” So he told Isaiah, “The message you brought me from the 
2KI.20.20	Everything else Hezekiah did while he was king, including his brave deeds and how he made the upper pool and tunnel bring water into Jerusalem, is written in 
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became king.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 55 years from Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	 Manasseh disobeyed the 
2KI.21.3	He rebuilt the local shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He built altars for the god Baal and set up a sacred pole for worshiping the goddess Asherah, just as King Ahab of Israel had done. And he faithfully worshiped the stars in heaven.
2KI.21.5	and the stars. He placed these altars in both courts of the temple, 
2KI.21.6+2KI.21.7	 and even set up the pole for Asherah there. Manasseh practiced magic and witchcraft; he asked fortunetellers for advice and sacrificed his own son. He did many sinful things and made the 
2KI.21.6+2KI.21.7	Years ago the 
2KI.21.6+2KI.21.7	Jerusalem is the place I prefer above all others in Israel. It belongs to me, and there I will be worshiped forever. 
2KI.21.8	If my people will faithfully obey all the commands in the Law of my servant Moses, I will never make them leave the land I gave to their ancestors.
2KI.21.9	But the people of Judah disobeyed the 
2KI.21.10	One day the 
2KI.21.11	King Manasseh has done more disgusting things than the Amorites,
2KI.21.12	Now I, the 
2KI.21.13	Jerusalem is as sinful as Ahab and the people of Samaria were. So I will wipe out Jerusalem and be done with it, just as someone wipes water off a plate and turns it over to dry.
2KI.21.14	I will even get rid of my people who survive. They will be defeated and robbed by their enemies. 
2KI.21.15	My people have done what I hate and have not stopped making me angry since their ancestors left Egypt.
2KI.21.16	Manasseh was guilty of causing the people of Judah to sin and disobey the 
2KI.21.17	Everything else Manasseh did while he was king, including his terrible sins, is written in 
2KI.21.18	He died and was buried in Uzza Garden near his palace, and his son Amon became king.
2KI.21.19	Amon was 22 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 2 years. His mother Meshullemeth was the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	Amon disobeyed the 
2KI.21.21	Amon worshiped the idols Manasseh had made and 
2KI.21.22	refused to be faithful to the 
2KI.21.23	Some of Amon's officials plotted against him and killed him in his palace. 
2KI.21.24+2KI.21.25+2KI.21.26	He was buried in Uzza Garden. Soon after that, the people of Judah killed the murderers of Amon, then they made his son Josiah king.
2KI.21.24+2KI.21.25+2KI.21.26	Everything else Amon did while he was king is written in 
2KI.22.2	Josiah always obeyed the 
2KI.22.3	After Josiah had been king for 18 years, he told Shaphan,
2KI.22.3	Go to the 
2KI.22.4	and ask Hilkiah the high priest to collect from the guards all the money that the people have donated. 
2KI.22.5	Tell Hilkiah to give it to the men supervising the repairs to the temple. They can use some of the money to pay 
2KI.22.6	the workers, and with the rest of it they can buy wood and stone for the repair work. 
2KI.22.7	 They are honest, so we won't ask them to keep track of the money.
2KI.22.8	While Shaphan was at the temple, Hilkiah handed him a book and said, “Look what I found here in the temple—
2KI.22.8	Shaphan read it, 
2KI.22.9	then went back to Josiah and reported, “Your officials collected the money in the temple and gave it to the men supervising the repairs. 
2KI.22.10	But there's something else, Your Majesty. The priest Hilkiah gave me this book.” Then Shaphan read it out loud.
2KI.22.11	When Josiah heard what was in

2KI.22.13	“The 
2KI.22.14	The five men left at once and went to talk with Huldah the prophet. Her husband was Shallum,
2KI.22.15	she said:
2KI.22.15	You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the 
2KI.22.16	“Josiah, I am the 
2KI.22.17	The people of Judah have rejected me. They have offered sacrifices to foreign gods and have worshiped their own idols. I cannot stand it any longer. I am furious.
2KI.22.18	“Josiah, listen to what I am going to do. 
2KI.22.19	I noticed how sad you were when you read that this country and its people would be completely wiped out. You even tore your clothes in sorrow, and I heard you cry. 
2KI.22.20	So I will let you die in peace, before I destroy this place.”
2KI.22.20	The men left and took Huldah's answer back to Josiah.
2KI.23.1	King Josiah called together the older leaders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	Then he went to the 
2KI.23.3	After Josiah had finished reading, he stood by one of the columns. He asked the people to promise in the 
2KI.23.5	Josiah also got rid of the pagan priests at the local shrines in Judah and around Jerusalem. These were the men that the kings of Judah had appointed to offer sacrifices to Baal and to the sun, moon, and stars. 
2KI.23.6	Josiah had the sacred pole
2KI.23.7	He had the buildings torn down where the male prostitutes
2KI.23.8	In almost every town in Judah, priests had been offering sacrifices to the 
2KI.23.9	Those local priests could not serve at the 
2KI.23.11	He also got rid of the horses that the kings of Judah used in their ceremonies to worship the sun, and he destroyed the chariots along with them. The horses had been kept near the entrance to the 
2KI.23.13	 After that, he closed down the shrines that Solomon had built east of Jerusalem and south of Spoil Hill to honor Astarte the disgusting goddess of Sidon, Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab, and Milcom the disgusting god of Ammon.
2KI.23.14	He tore down the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole used in the worship of Asherah. Then he had the whole area covered with human bones.
2KI.23.16	 As he looked around, he saw graves on the hillside. He had the bones in them dug up and burned on the altar, so that it could no longer be used. This happened just as God's prophet had said when Jeroboam was standing at the altar, celebrating a festival.
2KI.23.16	Then Josiah saw the grave of the prophet who had said this would happen 
2KI.23.17	 and he asked,
2KI.23.17	Some people who lived nearby answered, “It belongs to the prophet from Judah who told what would happen to this altar.”
2KI.23.18	Josiah replied, “Then leave it alone. Don't dig up his bones.” So they did not disturb his bones or the bones of the old prophet from Israel who had also been buried there.
2KI.23.19	Some of the Israelite kings had made the 
2KI.23.20	He killed the priests who served at them and burned their bones on the altars.
2KI.23.20	After all that, Josiah went back to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	Josiah told the people of Judah, “Celebrate Passover in honor of the 
2KI.23.22	This festival had not been celebrated in this way since the time that tribal leaders ruled Israel or the kings ruled Israel and Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in Josiah's eighteenth year as king of Judah, everyone came to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover.
2KI.23.24	Josiah got rid of every disgusting person and thing in Judah and Jerusalem—including magicians, fortunetellers, and idols. He did his best to obey every law written in the book that the priest Hilkiah found in the 
2KI.23.25	No other king before or after Josiah tried as hard as he did to obey the Law of Moses.
2KI.23.26	But the 
2KI.23.27	The 
2KI.23.28	Everything else Josiah did while he was king is written in 
2KI.23.29	During Josiah's rule, King Neco of Egypt led his army north to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. Josiah led his troops north to fight Neco, but when they met in battle at Megiddo, Josiah was killed.
2KI.23.30	A few of Josiah's servants put his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where they buried it in his own tomb. Then the people of Judah found his son Jehoahaz and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem only 3 months. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	Jehoahaz disobeyed the 
2KI.23.33	King Neco of Egypt had Jehoahaz arrested and put in prison at Riblah
2KI.23.34	 Neco appointed Josiah's son Eliakim king of Judah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He took Jehoahaz as a prisoner to Egypt, where he died.
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim forced the people of Judah to pay higher taxes, so he could give Neco the silver and gold he demanded.
2KI.23.37	Jehoiakim disobeyed the 
2KI.24.2	At that time, the 
2KI.24.3	and now he was making it happen. The country of Judah was going to be wiped out, because Manasseh had sinned 
2KI.24.4	and caused many innocent people to die. The 
2KI.24.5	Everything else Jehoiakim did while he was king is written in 
2KI.24.6	Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin became king.
2KI.24.7	King Nebuchadnezzar defeated King Neco of Egypt and took control of his land from the Egyptian Gorge all the way north to the Euphrates River. So Neco never invaded Judah again.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled only 3 months from Jerusalem. His mother Nehushta was the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	Jehoiachin disobeyed the 
2KI.24.10	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia sent troops to attack Jerusalem soon after Jehoiachin became king. 
2KI.24.11	During the attack, Nebuchadnezzar himself arrived at the city. 
2KI.24.12	 Jehoiachin immediately surrendered, together with his mother and his servants, as well as his army officers and officials. Then Nebuchadnezzar had Jehoiachin arrested. These things took place in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule in Babylonia.
2KI.24.13	The 
2KI.24.14	He also led away as prisoners the Jerusalem officials, the military leaders, and the skilled workers—10,000 in all. Only the very poorest people were left in Judah.
2KI.24.16	He also led away 7,000 soldiers and 1,000 skilled workers, all of them trained for battle.
2KI.24.19	Zedekiah disobeyed the 
2KI.24.20	 It was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
2KI.24.20	The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the 
2KI.25.2+2KI.25.3	After a year and a half, all the food in Jerusalem was gone. Then on the ninth day of the fourth
2KI.25.4	 the Babylonian troops broke through the city wall.
2KI.25.5	but the Babylonian troops caught up with them near Jericho. They arrested Zedekiah, but his soldiers scattered in every direction.
2KI.25.6	Zedekiah was taken to Riblah, where Nebuchadnezzar put him on trial and found him guilty. 
2KI.25.7	 Zedekiah's sons were killed right in front of him. His eyes were then poked out, and he was put in chains and dragged off to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	About a month later,
2KI.25.9	 Nebuzaradan burned down the 
2KI.25.10	Then he ordered the Babylonian soldiers to break down the walls around Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.11	He led away as prisoners the people left in the city, including those who had become loyal to Nebuchadnezzar. 
2KI.25.12	Only some of the poorest people were left behind to work the vineyards and the fields.
2KI.25.14	 They carried off the bronze things used for worship at the temple, including the pans for hot ashes, and the shovels, snuffers, and also the dishes for incense, 
2KI.25.15	as well as the fire pans and the sprinkling bowls. Nebuzaradan ordered his soldiers to take everything made of gold or silver.
2KI.25.16	The pile of bronze from the columns, the stands, and the large bowl that Solomon had made for the temple was too large to be weighed. 
2KI.25.17	Each column had been eight meters tall with a bronze cap over one meter high. These caps were decorated with bronze designs—some of them like chains and others like pomegranates.
2KI.25.18	Next, Nebuzaradan arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah his assistant, and three temple officials. 
2KI.25.19	Then he arrested one of the army commanders, the king's five personal advisors, and the officer in charge of gathering the troops for battle. He also found 60 more soldiers who were still in Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan led them all to Riblah 
2KI.25.21	near Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar had them killed.
2KI.25.21	Most of the people of Judah had been carried away as captives from their own country.
2KI.25.23	When the army officers and troops heard that Gedaliah was their ruler, the officers met with him at Mizpah. These men were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth from Netophah, and Jaazaniah from Maacah.
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah said to them, “Everything will be fine, I promise. We don't need to be afraid of the Babylonian rulers, if we live here peacefully and do what Nebuchadnezzar says.”
2KI.25.26	 After that, the army officers and all the people in Mizpah, whether important or not, were afraid of what the Babylonians might do. So they left Judah and went to Egypt.
2KI.25.27	Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon for 37 years. Then Evil-Merodach became king of Babylonia,
2KI.25.28	Evil-Merodach was kind to Jehoiachin and honored him more than any of the other kings held prisoner there. 
2KI.25.29	Jehoiachin was even allowed to wear regular clothes, and he ate at the king's table every day. 
2KI.25.30	As long as Jehoiachin lived, he was paid a daily allowance to buy whatever he needed.

1CH.11.3	So we have come to crown you king of Israel.”
1CH.11.3	David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the 
1CH.11.5	The Jebusites said, “You won't be able to get in here!” But David captured the fortress of Mount Zion, which is now called the City of David.
1CH.11.6	David had told his troops, “The first soldier to kill a Jebusite will become my army commander.” And since Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, he became commander.
1CH.11.7	Later, David moved to the fortress—that's why it's called the City of David. 
1CH.11.8	He had the city rebuilt, starting at the landfill on the east side.
1CH.11.9	David became a great and strong ruler, because the 
1CH.11.10	The 
1CH.11.11	The first of these warriors was Jashobeam the son of Hachmoni, the leader of the Three Warriors.
1CH.11.12	Another one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. 
1CH.11.13	During a battle against the Philistines at Pas-Dammim, all the Israelite soldiers ran away, 
1CH.11.14	except Eleazar, who stayed with David. They took their positions in a nearby barley field and defeated the Philistines! The 
1CH.11.15	One time the Three Warriors
1CH.11.16	and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in a fortress, 
1CH.11.17	and he said, “I'm very thirsty. I wish I had a drink of water from the well by the gate to Bethlehem.”
1CH.11.18	The Three Warriors sneaked through the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. They took it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured out the water as a sacrifice to the 
1CH.11.19	and said, “Drinking this water would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.”
1CH.11.19	The Three Warriors did these brave deeds.
1CH.11.20	Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors,
1CH.11.21	and was more famous than the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was their commander, but he never became one of the Three Warriors.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. One time he killed two of Moab's best fighters, and one snowy day he went into a pit and killed a lion. 
1CH.11.23	Another time he killed an Egyptian who was over two meters tall and was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club, so he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it. 
1CH.11.24	Benaiah did things like that; he was just as brave as the Three Warriors, 
1CH.11.25	even though he never became one of them. And he was certainly as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. So David made him the leader of his own bodyguard.
1CH.11.26+1CH.11.27+1CH.11.28+1CH.11.29+1CH.11.30+1CH.11.31+1CH.11.32+1CH.11.33+1CH.11.34+1CH.11.35+1CH.11.36+1CH.11.37+1CH.11.38+1CH.11.39+1CH.11.40+1CH.11.41+1CH.11.42+1CH.11.43+1CH.11.44+1CH.11.45+1CH.11.46+1CH.11.47	Here is a list of the other famous warriors:

1CH.12.1	Some time earlier, David had gone to live in the town of Ziklag to escape from King Saul. While David was there, several brave warriors joined him to help fight his battles.
1CH.12.2	Several of these warriors were from King Saul's own tribe of Benjamin. They were experts at using a bow and arrows, and they could shoot an arrow or sling a stone with either hand. 
1CH.12.3+1CH.12.4+1CH.12.5+1CH.12.6+1CH.12.7	Their leaders were Ahiezer and Joash, the sons of Shemaah from Gibeah. Here is a list of those men from Benjamin: Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth; Ishmaiah from Gibeon, who was the leader of the Thirty Warriors; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah; Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph; Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam from the Korah clan; Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Men from the tribe of Gad also joined David at his fortress in the desert and served as his warriors. They were also brave soldiers—fierce as lions and quick as gazelles. They were always prepared to fight with shields and spears. 
1CH.12.9+1CH.12.10+1CH.12.11+1CH.12.12+1CH.12.13	There were eleven of them, ranked in the following order: Ezer the leader, then Obadiah, Eliab, Mishmannah, Jeremiah, Attai, Eliel, Johanan, Elzabad, Jeremiah, and Machbannai.
1CH.12.14	All these men were army officers; some were high-ranking officers over a thousand troops, and others were officers over a hundred troops. 
1CH.12.15	Earlier, they had crossed the Jordan River when it flooded, and they chased out the people who lived in the valleys on each side of the river.
1CH.12.16	One time a group of men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah went to the fortress where David was staying. 
1CH.12.17	David met them outside and said, “If you are coming as friends to fight on my side, then stay and join us. But if you try to turn me over to my enemies, the God our ancestors worshiped will punish you, because I have done nothing wrong.”
1CH.12.18	Amasai, who later became the leader of the Thirty Warriors, was one of these men who went to David. God's Spirit took control of him, and he said, “We will join you, David son of Jesse! You and your followers will always be successful, because God fights on your side.”
1CH.12.18	So David agreed to let them stay, and he even put them in charge of his soldiers who raided enemy villages.
1CH.12.19	Some of the warriors who joined David were from the tribe of Manasseh. They had earlier gone with David when he agreed to fight on the side of the Philistines against King Saul. But as soon as the Philistine rulers realized that David might turn against them and rejoin Saul, they sent David away to the town of Ziklag. 
1CH.12.20	That's when the following men from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. They had all been commanders in Saul's army 
1CH.12.21	and brave soldiers, and so David made them officers in his army. They fought on his side when enemy troops attacked.
1CH.12.22	Day after day, new men came to join David, and soon he had a large, powerful army.
1CH.12.23+1CH.12.24+1CH.12.25+1CH.12.26+1CH.12.27+1CH.12.28+1CH.12.29+1CH.12.30+1CH.12.31+1CH.12.32+1CH.12.33+1CH.12.34+1CH.12.35+1CH.12.36+1CH.12.37	The kingdom of Israel had been taken away from Saul, and it now belonged to David. He was ruling from Hebron, and thousands of well-trained soldiers from each tribe went there to crown David king of all Israel, just as the 
1CH.12.38	All of these soldiers voluntarily came to Hebron because they wanted David to become king of Israel. In fact, everyone in Israel wanted the same thing. 
1CH.12.39	The soldiers stayed in Hebron three days, eating and drinking what their relatives had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	Other Israelites from as far away as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought cattle and sheep to slaughter for food. They also brought donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen that were loaded down with flour, dried figs and raisins, wine, and olive oil.
1CH.12.40	Everyone in Israel was very happy.
1CH.13.1	Some time later, David talked with his army commanders, 
1CH.13.2+1CH.13.3	and then announced to the people of Israel:
1CH.13.2+1CH.13.3	While Saul was king, the sacred chest was ignored. But now it's time to bring the chest to Jerusalem. We will invite everyone in Israel to come here, including the priests and the Levites in the towns surrounded by pastureland. But we will do these things only if you agree, and if the 
1CH.13.4	The people agreed this was the right thing to do.
1CH.13.5	David gathered everyone from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo-Hamath in the north. 
1CH.13.6	 Then he led them to Baalah in Judah, which was also called Kiriath-Jearim. They went there to get the sacred chest and bring it to Jerusalem, because it belonged to the 
1CH.13.7	The sacred chest was still at Abinadab's house,
1CH.13.8	while David and the crowd danced and sang praises to the 
1CH.13.9	But when they came to Chidon's threshing place, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the chest to stop it from falling. 
1CH.13.10	The 
1CH.13.11	David then got angry with God for killing Uzzah. So he named that place “Attack on Uzzah,”
1CH.13.12	David was afraid what the 
1CH.13.13	So instead of taking it to Jerusalem, David decided to take it to the home of Obed-Edom, who lived in the town of Gath.
1CH.14.1	King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. They brought along carpenters and stone workers, and enough cedar logs to build David a palace. 
1CH.14.2	David now knew that the 
1CH.14.3	After David moved to Jerusalem, he married more women and had more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4+1CH.14.5+1CH.14.6+1CH.14.7	His children born there were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Beeliada,
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had become king of Israel, they came to capture him. But David heard about their plan and marched out to meet them in battle. 
1CH.14.9	The Philistines had already camped in Rephaim Valley and were raiding the nearby villages.
1CH.14.10	David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you help me win?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	David and his army marched to Baal-Perazim, where they attacked and defeated the Philistines. He said, “I defeated my enemies because God broke through them like a mighty flood.” So he named the place “The Lord Broke Through.”
1CH.14.12	Then David ordered his troops to burn the idols that the Philistines had left behind.
1CH.14.13	Some time later, the Philistines came back into the hill country and camped in Rephaim Valley. 
1CH.14.14	David asked God what he should do, and God answered, “Don't attack them from the front. Circle around behind them where the balsam
1CH.14.15	Wait there until you hear the treetops making the sound of marching troops. That sound will mean I have marched out ahead of you to fight the Philistine army. So you must then attack quickly!”
1CH.14.16	David obeyed God and he defeated the Philistines. He even chased them all the way from Gibeon to the entrance to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	From then on, David became even more famous, and the 
1CH.15.1	David had several buildings built in Jerusalem, and he had a tent set up where the sacred chest would be kept. 
1CH.15.2	 He said, “Only Levites will be allowed to carry the chest, because the 
1CH.15.3	Next, David invited everyone to come to Jerusalem and watch the sacred chest being carried to the place he had set up for it. 
1CH.15.4	He also sent for Aaron's descendants and for the Levites. The Levites that came were: 
1CH.15.5	Uriel, the leader of the Kohath clan, and 120 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.6	Asaiah, the leader of the Merari clan, and 220 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.7	Joel, the leader of the Gershon clan, and 130 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.8	Shemaiah, the leader of the Elizaphan clan, and 200 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.9	Eliel, the leader of the Hebron clan, and 80 of his relatives; and 
1CH.15.10	Amminadab, the leader of the Uzziel clan, with 112 of his relatives.
1CH.15.11	David called together these six Levites and the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar. 
1CH.15.12	He said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans in the Levi tribe. You and your relatives must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean and acceptable to the 
1CH.15.13	The first time we tried to bring the chest to Jerusalem, we didn't ask the 
1CH.15.14	The priests and the Levites made themselves clean. They were now ready to carry the sacred chest 
1CH.15.15	 on poles that rested on their shoulders, just as the 
1CH.15.16	David then told the leaders to choose some Levites to sing and play music on small harps, other stringed instruments, and cymbals. 
1CH.15.17+1CH.15.18+1CH.15.19+1CH.15.20+1CH.15.21	The men chosen to play the cymbals were Heman the son of Joel, his relative Asaph the son of Berechiah, and Ethan the son of Kushaiah from the Merari clan. Some of their assistants played the smaller harps: they were Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah. Others played the larger harps: they were Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Azaziah, and two of the temple guards, Obed-Edom and Jeiel.
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah was chosen to be the music director, because he was a skilled musician.
1CH.15.23+1CH.15.24	Four Levites were then appointed to guard the sacred chest. They were Berechiah, Elkanah, Obed-Edom, and Jehiah.
1CH.15.23+1CH.15.24	Finally, David chose priests to walk in front of the sacred chest and blow trumpets. They were Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer.
1CH.15.25	David, the leaders of Israel, and the army commanders were very happy as they went to Obed-Edom's house to get the sacred chest. 
1CH.15.26	God gave the Levites the strength they needed to carry the chest, and so they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
1CH.15.27	David, the Levites, Chenaniah the music director, and all the musicians were wearing linen robes, and David was also wearing a linen cloth.
1CH.15.28	While the sacred chest was being carried into Jerusalem, everyone was celebrating by shouting and playing music on horns, trumpets, cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments.
1CH.15.29	Saul's daughter Michal
1CH.16.1	They put the sacred chest inside the tent that David had set up for it, then they offered sacrifices to please the 
1CH.16.2	After David had finished, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	and gave every person in the crowd a small loaf of bread, some meat, and a handful of raisins.
1CH.16.4	David appointed some of the Levites to serve at the sacred chest; they were to play music and sing praises to the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was their leader, and Zechariah was his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and another man named Jeiel were appointed to play small harps and stringed instruments. Asaph himself played the cymbals, 
1CH.16.6	and the two priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets every day in front of the sacred chest.
1CH.16.7	That same day, David instructed Asaph and his relatives for the first time to sing these praises to the 
1CH.16.8	Praise the 
1CH.16.8	and pray in his name!
1CH.16.8	Tell everyone
1CH.16.8	what he has done.

1CH.16.9	Tell about his miracles.

1CH.16.10	his holy name
1CH.16.10	with all your heart.

1CH.16.11	Worship him always.
1CH.16.12	Remember his miracles
1CH.16.12	and all his wonders
1CH.16.12	and his fair decisions.
1CH.16.13	You belong to the family
1CH.16.13	of Israel, his servant;

1CH.16.14	bringing justice

1CH.16.15	We must never forget
1CH.16.15	his agreement and his promises,
1CH.16.15	not in thousands of years.
1CH.16.15	* 
1CH.16.16	 God made an eternal promise
1CH.16.17	to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
1CH.16.18	when he said, “I'll give you
1CH.16.18	the land of Canaan.”
1CH.16.19	At the time there were
1CH.16.19	only a few of us,
1CH.16.19	and we were homeless.
1CH.16.20	We wandered from nation
1CH.16.20	to nation, from one country
1CH.16.20	to another.
1CH.16.21	mistreat our people.
1CH.16.21	Instead he protected us
1CH.16.21	by punishing rulers
1CH.16.22	and telling them,
1CH.16.22	“Don't touch my chosen leaders
1CH.16.22	or harm my prophets!”

1CH.16.25	The 
1CH.16.25	our greatest praise!
1CH.16.25	He is the only God
1CH.16.25	worthy of our worship.

1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.26	the heavens.
1CH.16.27	Give honor and praise
1CH.16.27	to the

1CH.16.30	The world stands firm,
1CH.16.30	never to be shaken.
1CH.16.31	Tell the heavens and the earth
1CH.16.31	to be glad and celebrate!
1CH.16.31	And announce to the nations,
1CH.16.31	“The 
1CH.16.32	Command the ocean to roar
1CH.16.32	with all of its creatures
1CH.16.32	and the fields to rejoice
1CH.16.32	with all of their crops.
1CH.16.33	Then every tree in the forest
1CH.16.33	will sing joyful songs
1CH.16.33	to the 
1CH.16.33	He is coming to judge
1CH.16.33	all people on earth.
1CH.16.34	because he is good to us,
1CH.16.34	and his love never fails.
1CH.16.35	Say to him, “Save us, 
1CH.16.35	Bring us back
1CH.16.35	from among the nations.
1CH.16.35	Let us celebrate and shout
1CH.16.35	in praise of your holy name.
1CH.16.36	you deserve to be praised
1CH.16.36	forever and ever.”
1CH.16.36	After David finished, the people shouted, “Amen! Praise the 
1CH.16.37	David chose Asaph and the Levites in his clan to be in charge of the daily worship at the place where the sacred chest was kept. 
1CH.16.38	Obed-Edom and 68 of his relatives were their assistants, and Hosah and Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun were the guards.
1CH.16.39	David also chose Zadok the priest and his relatives who were priests to serve at the 
1CH.16.40	They were to offer sacrifices on the altar every morning and evening, just as the 
1CH.16.41	 Heman and Jeduthun were their assistants, as well as the other men who had been chosen to praise the 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun were also responsible for blowing the trumpets, and for playing the cymbals and other instruments during worship at the tent. The Levites in Jeduthun's clan were the guards at Gibeon.
1CH.17.1	Soon after David moved into his new palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest is kept in a tent.”
1CH.17.2	Nathan replied, “The 
1CH.17.3	That night, the 
1CH.17.4	to go to David and tell him:
1CH.17.4	David, you are my servant, so listen carefully: You are not the one to build a temple for me. 
1CH.17.5	I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them. 
1CH.17.6	I chose special leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
1CH.17.7	David, this is what I, the 
1CH.17.8	Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world.
1CH.17.9	I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace. They will no longer have to tremble with fear—evil nations won't bother them, as they did 
1CH.17.10	when I let judges rule my people, and I will keep your enemies from attacking you.
1CH.17.10	Now I promise that like you, your descendants will be kings. 
1CH.17.11	I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried beside your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler, 
1CH.17.12	and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me. 
1CH.17.13	 I will be like a father to him, and he will be like a son to me. I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you. 
1CH.17.14	I will make sure that your son and his descendants will rule my people and my kingdom forever.
1CH.17.15	Nathan told David exactly what the 
1CH.17.16	David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. He sat there and prayed:
1CH.17.17	and yet you have promised to do even more for my descendants. You are treating me as if I am a very important person.
1CH.17.18	I am your servant, and you know my thoughts. What else can I say, except that you have honored me? 
1CH.17.19	It was your choice to do these wonderful things for me and to make these promises.
1CH.17.20	No other god is like you, 
1CH.17.21	And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so that your people could live here. 
1CH.17.22	You have chosen Israel to be your people forever, and you have become their God.
1CH.17.24	Then you will be famous forever, and everyone will say, “The 
1CH.17.24	My kingdom will be strong, 
1CH.17.25	because you are my God, and you have promised that my descendants will be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant.
1CH.17.26	You are the 
1CH.17.27	Now please bless my descendants forever, and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already blessed my family, and I know you will bless us forever.
1CH.18.1	Later, David attacked and defeated the Philistines. He captured their town of Gath and the nearby villages.
1CH.18.2	David also defeated the Moabites, and so they had to accept him as their ruler and pay taxes to him.
1CH.18.3	While King Hadadezer of Zobah was trying to gain control of the territory near the Euphrates River, David met him in battle at Hamath and defeated him. 
1CH.18.4	David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 chariot drivers, and 20,000 soldiers. And he crippled all but 100 of the horses.
1CH.18.5	When troops from the Syrian kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 
1CH.18.6	Then David stationed some of his troops in Damascus, and the people there had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him.
1CH.18.6	Everywhere David went, the 
1CH.18.7	Hadadezer's officers had carried gold shields, but David took these shields and brought them back to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	 He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Tibhath and Cun, which had belonged to Hadadezer. Later, Solomon used this bronze to make the large bowl called the Sea, and to make the pillars and other furnishings for the temple.
1CH.18.9+1CH.18.10	King Tou of Hamath and King Hadadezer had been enemies. So when Tou heard that David had defeated Hadadezer's whole army, he sent his son Hadoram to congratulate David on his victory. Hadoram also brought him gifts made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
1CH.18.11	David gave these gifts to the 
1CH.18.13	Then he stationed troops in Edom, and the people there had to accept David as their ruler.
1CH.18.13	Everywhere David went, the 
1CH.18.14	David ruled all Israel with fairness and justice.
1CH.18.15	Joab the son of Zeruiah was the commander in chief of the army.
1CH.18.15	Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept the government records.
1CH.18.16	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests.
1CH.18.16	Shavsha was the secretary.
1CH.18.17	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was the commander of David's bodyguard.
1CH.18.17	David's sons were his highest-ranking officials.
1CH.19.1	Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
1CH.19.2	David said, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.” He sent some officials to Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died.
1CH.19.2	But when David's officials arrived at Ammon, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you really believe King David is honoring your father by sending these men to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our country, so he can come and destroy it.”
1CH.19.4	Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off and their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	They were terribly ashamed.
1CH.19.5	When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message that told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”
1CH.19.6	The Ammonites realized they had made David furious. So they paid 34 tons of silver to hire chariot troops from Mesopotamia and from the Syrian kingdoms of Maacah and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	Thirty-two thousand troops, as well as the king of Maacah and his army, came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonite troops also left their towns and came to prepare for battle.
1CH.19.8	David heard what was happening, and he sent out Joab with his army. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonite troops marched to the entrance of the city
1CH.19.10	Joab saw that the enemy troops were lined up on both sides of him. So he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Syrians. 
1CH.19.11	Then he put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and told them to fight against the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	Joab told his brother, “If the Syrians are too much for me to handle, come and help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the towns of our 
1CH.19.14	Joab and his soldiers attacked the Syrians, and the Syrians ran from them. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonite troops saw that the Syrians had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	As soon as the Syrians realized they had been defeated, they sent for their troops that were stationed on the other side of the Euphrates River. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led these troops to Ammon.
1CH.19.17	David found out what the Syrians were doing, and he brought Israel's entire army together. They crossed the Jordan River, and he commanded them to take their positions facing the Syrian troops.
1CH.19.17	Soon after the fighting began, 
1CH.19.18	the Syrians ran from Israel. David killed 7,000 chariot troops and 40,000 regular soldiers. He also killed Shophach, their commander.
1CH.19.19	When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with David and accepted him as their new ruler. The Syrians never helped the Ammonites again.
1CH.20.2	Later, David himself went to Rabbah, where he took the crown from the statue of their god Milcom.
1CH.20.3	He forced the people of Rabbah to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also did the same thing with the people in all the other Ammonite towns.
1CH.20.3	David then led Israel's army back to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	Some time later, Israel fought a battle against the Philistines at Gezer. During this battle, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim,
1CH.20.6	Another one of the Philistine soldiers who was a descendant of the Rephaim was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. During a battle at Gath, 
1CH.20.7	he made fun of Israel, so David's nephew Jonathan
1CH.20.8	David and his soldiers killed these three men from Gath who were descendants of the Rephaim.
1CH.21.1	Satan decided to cause trouble for Israel by making David think it was a good idea to find out how many people there were in Israel and Judah. 
1CH.21.2	David told Joab and the army commanders, “Count everyone in Israel, from the town of Beersheba in the south all the way north to Dan. Then I will know how many people can serve in my army.”
1CH.21.3	Joab answered, “Your Majesty, even if the 
1CH.21.4	But David would not change his mind. And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people. He returned to Jerusalem 
1CH.21.5	and told David that the total number of men who could serve in the army was 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah. 
1CH.21.6	Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he still disagreed with David's orders.
1CH.21.7	David's order to count the people made God angry, and he punished Israel. 
1CH.21.8	David prayed, “I am your servant. But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Please forgive me.”
1CH.21.9	The 
1CH.21.10	“Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways. But he will have to choose which one it will be.”
1CH.21.11	Gad went to David and told him:
1CH.21.11	You must choose how the 
1CH.21.12	Will there be three years when the land won't grow enough food for its people? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months? Or will the 
1CH.21.13	David was miserable and said, “It's a terrible choice to make! But the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to do that, the 
1CH.21.16	David saw the 
1CH.21.17	and David prayed, “It's my fault! I sinned by ordering the people to be counted. They have done nothing wrong—they are innocent sheep. 
1CH.21.18	The 
1CH.21.19	David followed the 
1CH.21.20	Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time, and when they saw the angel, the four sons ran to hide. 
1CH.21.21	Just then, David arrived, and when Araunah saw him, he stopped his work and bowed down.
1CH.21.22	David said, “Would you sell me your threshing place, so I can build an altar on it to the 
1CH.21.23	Araunah answered, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you want with it. I'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice. And you can use the threshing-boards
1CH.21.24	But David replied, “No! I want to pay you what they're worth. I can't just take something from you and then offer the 
1CH.21.25	So David paid Araunah 600 gold coins for his threshing place. 
1CH.21.26	David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	When David saw that the 
1CH.21.29+1CH.21.30	because he was afraid of the angel's sword and did not want to go all the way to Gibeon. That's where the sacred tent that Moses had made in the desert was kept, as well as the altar where sacrifices were offered to the 
1CH.22.1	David said, “The temple of the 
1CH.22.2	David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem. Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple. 
1CH.22.3	He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors, and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed. 
1CH.22.4	He also brought an endless supply of cedar logs from the cities of Sidon and Tyre.
1CH.22.5	He said, “The temple for the 
1CH.22.5	That's why David did all these things before he died.
1CH.22.6	David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the 
1CH.22.7	 He said:
1CH.22.7	My son, I wanted to build a temple where the 
1CH.22.8	But some time ago, he told me, “David, you have killed too many people and have fought too many battles. That's why you are not the one to build my temple. 
1CH.22.9	But when your son becomes king, I will give him peace throughout his kingdom. His name will be Solomon, because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful.
1CH.22.10	Solomon will build my temple. He will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him. In fact, one of his descendants will always rule in Israel.”
1CH.22.11	Solomon, my son, I now pray that the 
1CH.22.12	May he give you wisdom and knowledge, so that you can rule Israel according to his Law. 
1CH.22.13	 If you obey the laws and teachings that the 
1CH.22.14	I have all the supplies you'll need to build the temple: You have more than 3,000 tons of gold and over 34,000 tons of silver. There's also plenty of wood, stone, and more bronze and iron than I could weigh. Ask for anything else you need. 
1CH.22.15	I have also assigned men who will cut and lay the stone. And there are carpenters and people who are experts in working with 
1CH.22.16	gold, silver, bronze, and iron. You have plenty of workers to do the job. Now get started, and I pray that the 
1CH.22.17	David then gave orders for the leaders of Israel to help Solomon. 
1CH.22.18	David said:
1CH.22.18	The 
1CH.22.19	Obey the 
1CH.23.2	Some time later, David called together all of Israel's leaders, priests, and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	He then counted the Levite men who were at least 30 years old, and the total was 38,000. 
1CH.23.4	He said, “Twenty-four thousand of the Levites will be in charge of the temple, 6,000 will be temple officials and judges, 
1CH.23.5	4,000 will be guards at the temple, and 4,000 will praise the 
1CH.23.6	David then divided the Levites into three groups according to the clans of Levi's sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	Ladan was the father of Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel. 
1CH.23.9	They were all family leaders among their father's descendants. Shimei was the father of Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. 
1CH.23.10+1CH.23.11	Later, Shimei had four more sons, in the following order: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. But Jeush and Beriah didn't have many children, so their descendants were counted as one family.
1CH.23.12	Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
1CH.23.13	 Amram was the father of Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were chosen to be in charge of all the sacred things. They served the 
1CH.23.14+1CH.23.15	Moses, the man of God, was the father of Gershom and Eliezer, and their descendants were considered Levites. 
1CH.23.16	Gershom's oldest son was Shebuel. 
1CH.23.17	Rehabiah, who was Eliezer's only son, had many children. 
1CH.23.18	The second son born to Kohath was Izhar, and his oldest son was Shelomith. 
1CH.23.19	Hebron, the third son of Kohath, was the father of Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam. 
1CH.23.20	Kohath's youngest son, Uzziel, was the father of Micah and Isshiah.
1CH.23.21	Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. Mahli was the father of Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar had no sons, only daughters, and they married their uncle's sons. 
1CH.23.23	Mushi the second son of Merari, was the father of Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
1CH.23.24	These were the clans and families of the tribe of Levi. Those who were 20 years and older were assigned to work at the 
1CH.23.25	David said:
1CH.23.25	The 
1CH.23.26	 And so, the Levites won't need to move the sacred tent and the things used for worship from place to place. 
1CH.23.27	From now on, all Levites at least 20 years old 
1CH.23.28	 will serve the 
1CH.23.29	They will also be in charge of the sacred loaves of bread, the flour for the grain sacrifices, the thin wafers, any offerings to be baked, and the flour mixed with olive oil. These Levites will weigh and measure these offerings.
1CH.23.30	Every morning and evening, the Levites are to give thanks to the 
1CH.23.31	They must also give thanks and sing praises when sacrifices are offered on each Sabbath, as well as during New Moon Festivals and other religious feasts. There must always be enough Levites on duty at the temple to do everything that needs to be done. 
1CH.23.32	They were once in charge of taking care of the sacred tent; now they are responsible for the temple and for helping Aaron's descendants.
1CH.24.1	Aaron's descendants were then divided into work groups. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	 But Nadab and Abihu died long before their father, without having any sons. That's why Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
1CH.24.3	David divided Aaron's descendants into groups, according to their assigned work. Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, helped David.
1CH.24.4	Eleazar's descendants were divided into 16 groups, and Ithamar's were divided into eight groups, because Eleazar's family included more family leaders. 
1CH.24.5	However, both families included temple officials and priests, and so to make sure the work was divided fairly, David asked God what to do.
1CH.24.6	As each group was assigned their duties, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the Levite wrote down the name of the family leader in charge of that group. The witnesses were David and his officials, as well as Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the family leaders from the clans of the priests and the Levites.
1CH.24.7+1CH.24.8+1CH.24.9+1CH.24.10+1CH.24.11+1CH.24.12+1CH.24.13+1CH.24.14+1CH.24.15+1CH.24.16+1CH.24.17+1CH.24.18	Each group of priests went by the name of its family leader, and they were assigned their duties in the following order: Jehoiarib, Jedaiah, Harim, Seorim, Malchijah, Mijamin, Hakkoz, Abijah, Jeshua, Shecaniah, Eliashib, Jakim, Huppah, Jeshebeab, Bilgah, Immer, Hezir, Happizzez, Pethahiah, Jehezkel, Jachin, Gamul, Delaiah, Maaziah. 
1CH.24.19	These men were assigned their duties at the temple, just as the 
1CH.24.20	Here is a list of the other descendants of Levi:
1CH.24.20	Amram was the ancestor of Shubael and Jehdeiah.

1CH.24.25	Isshiah, Micah's brother, was the father of Zechariah.
1CH.24.26	Merari was the father of Mahli, Mushi, and Jaaziah.
1CH.24.27	Jaaziah had three sons: Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
1CH.24.28+1CH.24.29	Mahli was the father of Eleazar and Kish. Eleazar had no sons, but Kish was the father of Jerahmeel. 
1CH.24.30	Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
1CH.24.30	These were the descendants of Levi, according to their clans. 
1CH.24.31	Each one was assigned his duties in the same way that their relatives the priests had been assigned their duties. David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the family leaders of the priests and Levites were the witnesses.
1CH.25.1	David and the temple officials chose the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to be in charge of music. They were to praise the 
1CH.25.2	Asaph's four sons, Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, were under the direction of their father and played music whenever the king told them to.

1CH.25.6	His sons were under his direction and played cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments during times of worship at the temple.
1CH.25.6	Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman took their orders directly from the king.
1CH.25.7	There were 288 of these men, and all of them were skilled musicians. 
1CH.25.8	David assigned them their duties by asking the 
1CH.25.9+1CH.25.10+1CH.25.11+1CH.25.12+1CH.25.13+1CH.25.14+1CH.25.15+1CH.25.16+1CH.25.17+1CH.25.18+1CH.25.19+1CH.25.20+1CH.25.21+1CH.25.22+1CH.25.23+1CH.25.24+1CH.25.25+1CH.25.26+1CH.25.27+1CH.25.28+1CH.25.29+1CH.25.30+1CH.25.31	The musicians were divided into 24 groups of twelve, and each group went by the name of their family leader.

1CH.26.8	There were 62 descendants of Obed-Edom who were strong enough to be guards at the temple.
1CH.26.9	Eighteen descendants of Meshelemiah were chosen for this work.
1CH.26.10+1CH.26.11	Hosah, from the Merari clan, was the father of Shimri, Hilkiah, Tebaliah, and Zechariah. Hosah had made Shimri the family leader, even though he was not the oldest son. Thirteen men from Hosah's family were chosen to be temple guards.
1CH.26.12	The guards were divided into groups, according to their family leaders, and they were assigned duties at the temple, just like the other Levites. 
1CH.26.13	Each group, no matter how large or small, was assigned a gate to guard, and they let the

1CH.27.28	Baal Hanan from Geder was in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the western foothills, and Joash was in charge of storing the olive oil.
1CH.27.29	Shitrai from Sharon was responsible for the cattle that were kept in Sharon Plain, and Shaphat son of Adlai was responsible for those kept in the valleys.
1CH.27.30	Obil the Ishmaelite was in charge of the camels, Jehdeiah from Meronoth was in charge of the donkeys, and Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the sheep and goats.
1CH.27.31	These were the men in charge of David's royal property.
1CH.27.32	David's uncle Jonathan was a wise and intelligent advisor. He and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni taught David's sons.
1CH.27.33	Ahithophel and Hushai the Archite were two of David's advisors. 
1CH.27.34	Jehoiada the son of Benaiah was the king's advisor after Ahithophel, and later, Abiathar was his advisor.
1CH.27.34	Joab was commander of Israel's army.
1CH.28.1	David called a meeting in Jerusalem for all of Israel's leaders, including the tribal leaders, the government officials, the army commanders, the officials in charge of the royal property and livestock, the palace officials, and the brave warriors.
1CH.28.2	Listen to me, my people. I wanted to build a place where the sacred chest would be kept, so we could go there and worship the 
1CH.28.3	but the 
1CH.28.4	The 
1CH.28.5	The 
1CH.28.6	The 
1CH.28.7	If he continues to obey my laws and commands, his kingdom will never end.”
1CH.28.8	My friends, you are the 
1CH.28.9	Solomon, my son, worship God and obey him with all your heart and mind, just as I have done. He knows all your thoughts and your reasons for doing things, and so if you turn to him, he will hear your prayers. But if you ignore him, he will reject you forever. 
1CH.28.10	The 
1CH.28.11	After David finished speaking, he gave Solomon the plans for building the main rooms of the temple, including the porch, the storerooms, the rooms upstairs and downstairs, as well as the most holy place. 
1CH.28.12	He gave Solomon his plans for the courtyards and the open areas around the temple, and for the rooms to store the temple treasures and gifts that had been dedicated to God.
1CH.28.13	David also gave Solomon his plans for dividing the priests and the Levites into groups, as well as for the work that needed to be done at the temple and for taking care of the objects used for worship. 
1CH.28.14	He told Solomon how much gold and silver was to be used in making the sacred objects, 
1CH.28.15	including the lampstands and lamps, 
1CH.28.16	the gold table which held the sacred loaves of bread, the tables made of silver, 
1CH.28.17	the meat forks, the bowls and cups, 
1CH.28.18	the gold incense altar, and the gold statue of a chariot for the winged creatures which were on the lid of the sacred chest.
1CH.28.19	David then said to Solomon:
1CH.28.19	The 
1CH.28.20	But you must see that everything is done according to these plans. Be confident, and never be afraid of anything or get discouraged. The 
1CH.28.21	The priests and Levites have been assigned their duties, and all the skilled workers are prepared to do their work. The people and their leaders will do anything you tell them.
1CH.29.1	God chose my son Solomon to build the temple, but Solomon is young and has no experience. This is not just any building—this is the temple for the 
1CH.29.2	That's why I have done my best to get everything Solomon will need to build it—gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, onyx, turquoise, colored gems, all kinds of precious stones, and marble.
1CH.29.3	Besides doing all that, I have promised to give part of my own gold and silver as a way of showing my love for God's temple. 
1CH.29.4	More than 100 tons of my finest gold and almost 240 tons of my silver will be used to decorate its walls 
1CH.29.5	and to make the gold and silver objects. Now, who else will show their dedication to the 
1CH.29.6	After David finished speaking, the family leaders, the tribal leaders, the army commanders, and the government officials voluntarily gave gifts 
1CH.29.7	for the temple. These gifts included more than 170 tons of gold, over 340 tons of silver, 620 tons of bronze, and more than 3,400 tons of iron. 
1CH.29.8	Everyone who owned precious stones also donated them to the temple treasury, where Jehiel from the Levite clan of Gershon guarded them.
1CH.29.9	David and the people were very happy that so much had been given to the 
1CH.29.10	Then, in front of everyone, David sang praises to the 
1CH.29.10	I praise you forever, 
1CH.29.11	 Your power is great, and your glory is seen everywhere in heaven and on earth. You are king of the entire world, 
1CH.29.12	and you rule with strength and power. You make people rich and powerful and famous. 
1CH.29.13	We thank you, our God, and praise you.
1CH.29.14	But why should we be happy that we have given you these gifts? They belong to you, and we have only given back what is already yours. 
1CH.29.15	We are only foreigners living here on earth for a while, just as our ancestors were. And we will soon be gone, like a shadow that suddenly disappears.
1CH.29.16	Our 
1CH.29.17	But we are happy, because everyone has voluntarily given you these things. You know what is in everyone's heart, and you are pleased when people are honest. 
1CH.29.18	Always make us eager to give, and help us be faithful to you, just as our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob faithfully worshiped you. 
1CH.29.19	And give Solomon the desire to completely obey your laws and teachings, and the desire to build the temple for which I have provided these gifts.
1CH.29.20	David then said to the people, “Now it's your turn to praise the 
1CH.29.21	The next day, the Israelites slaughtered 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, and they offered them as sacrifices to please the 
1CH.29.22	The people were very happy, and they ate and drank there at the 
1CH.29.22	That same day, Solomon was again crowned king. The people celebrated and poured olive oil on Solomon's head to show that he would be their next king. They also poured oil on Zadok's head to show that he was their priest.
1CH.29.24	Every official and every soldier, as well as all of David's other sons, were loyal to him. 
1CH.29.25	The 
1CH.29.26	David the son of Jesse was king of Israel 
1CH.29.27	 for 40 years. He ruled from Hebron for 7 years and from Jerusalem for 33 years. 
1CH.29.28	David was rich and respected and lived to be an old man. Then he died, and his son Solomon became king.
1CH.29.29	Everything David did while he was king is included in the history written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. 
1CH.29.30	They wrote about his powerful rule and about the things that happened not only to him, but also to Israel and the other nations.
2CH.1.1	King Solomon, the son of David, was now in complete control of his kingdom, because the 
2CH.1.2+2CH.1.3+2CH.1.4+2CH.1.5	One day, Solomon told the people of Israel, the army commanders, the officials, and the family leaders, to go with him to the place of worship at Gibeon, even though his father King David had already moved the sacred chest from Kiriath-Jearim to the tent that he had set up for it in Jerusalem. Solomon and the others went to Gibeon to worship the 
2CH.1.6	and there at the bronze altar, Solomon offered a thousand animals as sacrifices to please the 
2CH.1.7	God appeared to Solomon that night in a dream and said, “Solomon, ask for anything you want, and I will give it to you.”
2CH.1.8	Solomon answered:
2CH.1.9	 I am supposed to rule these people, but there are as many of them as there are specks of dust on the ground. So keep the promise you made to my father 
2CH.1.10	and make me wise. Give me the knowledge I'll need to be the king of this great nation of yours.
2CH.1.11	God replied:
2CH.1.11	Solomon, you could have asked me to make you rich or famous or to let you live a long time. Or you could have asked for your enemies to be destroyed. Instead, you asked for wisdom and knowledge to rule my people. 
2CH.1.12	So I will make you wise and intelligent. But I will also make you richer and more famous than any king before or after you.
2CH.1.13	Solomon then left Gibeon and returned to Jerusalem, the capital city of Israel.
2CH.1.15	While Solomon was king of Israel, there was silver and gold everywhere in Jerusalem, and cedar was as common as ordinary sycamore trees in the foothills.
2CH.2.1	Solomon decided to build a temple where the 
2CH.2.2	He assigned 70,000 men to carry building supplies and 80,000 to cut stone from the hills. And he chose 3,600 men to supervise these workers.
2CH.2.3	Solomon sent the following message to King Hiram of Tyre:
2CH.2.3	Years ago, when my father David was building his palace, you supplied him with cedar logs. Now will you send me supplies? 
2CH.2.4	I am building a temple where the 
2CH.2.5	This will be a great temple, because our God is greater than all other gods. 
2CH.2.6	 No one can ever build a temple large enough for God—even the heavens are too small a place for him to live in! All I can do is build a place where we can offer sacrifices to him.
2CH.2.7	Send me a worker who can not only carve, but who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as make brightly colored cloth. The person you send will work here in Judah and Jerusalem with the skilled workers that my father has already hired.
2CH.2.8	I know that you have workers who are experts at cutting lumber in Lebanon. So would you please send me some cedar, pine, and juniper logs? My workers will be there to help them, 
2CH.2.9	because I'll need a lot of lumber to build such a large and glorious temple. 
2CH.2.10	I will pay your woodcutters 2,000 tons of wheat, the same amount of barley, 400,000 liters of wine, and that same amount of olive oil.
2CH.2.11	Hiram sent his answer back to Solomon:
2CH.2.11	I know that the 
2CH.2.12	Praise the 
2CH.2.13	I am sending Huram Abi to you. He is wise and very skillful. 
2CH.2.14	His mother was from the Israelite tribe of Dan, and his father was from Tyre. Not only is Huram an expert at working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, but he can also make colored cloth and fine linen. And he can carve anything if you give him a pattern to follow. He can help your workers and those hired by your father King David.
2CH.2.15	Go ahead and send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine you promised to pay my workers. 
2CH.2.16	I will tell them to start cutting down trees in Lebanon. They will cut as many as you need, then tie them together into rafts, and float them down along the coast to Joppa. Your workers can take them to Jerusalem from there.
2CH.2.17	Solomon counted all the foreigners who were living in Israel, just as his father David had done when he was king, and the total was 153,600. 
2CH.2.18	He assigned 70,000 of them to carry building supplies and 80,000 of them to cut stone from the hills. He chose 3,600 others to supervise the workers and to make sure the work was completed.
2CH.3.3	The inside of the temple was 27 meters long and 9 meters wide, according to the older standards.
2CH.3.4	Across the front of the temple was a porch 9 meters wide and 9 meters
2CH.3.5	Solomon had the inside walls of the temple's main room paneled first with pine and then with a layer of gold, and he had them decorated with carvings of palm trees and designs that looked like chains. 
2CH.3.6	He used precious stones to decorate the temple, and he used gold imported from Parvaim
2CH.3.7	to decorate the ceiling beams, the doors, the door frames, and the walls. Solomon also told the workers to carve designs of winged creatures into the walls.
2CH.3.9	Five hundred and seventy grams of gold was used to cover the heads of the nails. The walls of the small storage rooms were also covered with gold.
2CH.3.11+2CH.3.12+2CH.3.13	Each creature had two wings and was four and a half meters from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing. Solomon set them next to each other in the most holy place, facing the doorway. Their wings were spread out and reached all the way across the nine-meter room.
2CH.3.15	Two columns were made for the entrance to the temple. Each one was 16 meters tall and had a cap on top that was over 2 meters high. 
2CH.3.16	The top of each column was decorated with designs that looked like chains
2CH.3.17	Solomon had one of the columns placed on the south side of the temple's entrance; it was called Jachin.
2CH.4.2	He also gave orders to make a large metal bowl called the Sea. It was 4.5 meters across, just over two meters deep, and 13.5 meters around. 
2CH.4.3	Its outer edge was decorated with two rows of carvings of bulls, ten bulls to about every 45 centimeters, all made from the same piece of metal as the bowl. 
2CH.4.4	The bowl itself sat on top of twelve bronze bulls, with three bulls facing outward in each of four directions. 
2CH.4.5	The sides of the bowl were 75 millimeters thick, and its rim was in the shape of a cup that curved outward like flower petals. The bowl held about 60,000 liters.
2CH.4.8	 He also made ten tables and placed them in the main room, five on each side. And he made 100 small gold sprinkling bowls.
2CH.4.9	Solomon gave orders to build two courtyards: a smaller one that only priests could use and a larger one. The doors to these courtyards were covered with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	The large bowl called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the temple.
2CH.4.11	Huram made shovels, sprinkling bowls, and pans for hot ashes. Here is a list of the other furnishings he made for God's temple: 
2CH.4.12	two columns, two bowl-shaped caps for the tops of these columns, two chain designs on the caps, 
2CH.4.13	400 pomegranates
2CH.4.14	the stands and the small bowls, 
2CH.4.15	the large bowl and the twelve bulls that held it up, 
2CH.4.16	pans for hot ashes, as well as shovels and meat forks.
2CH.4.16	Huram made all these things out of polished bronze 
2CH.4.17	by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds he had set up near the Jordan River, between Succoth and Zeredah.
2CH.4.18	There were so many bronze furnishings that no one ever knew how much bronze it took to make them.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also gave orders to make the following temple furnishings out of gold: the altar, the tables that held the sacred loaves of bread,
2CH.4.20	the lampstands and the lamps that burned in front of the most holy place, 
2CH.4.21	flower designs, lamps and tongs, 
2CH.4.22	lamp snuffers, small sprinkling bowls, ladles, fire pans, and the doors to the most holy place and the main room of the temple.
2CH.5.2+2CH.5.3	Solomon called together all the important leaders of Israel. 
2CH.5.4+2CH.5.5	Then the priests and the Levites picked up the sacred chest, the sacred tent, and the objects used for worship, and they carried them to the temple. 
2CH.5.6	Solomon and a crowd of people stood in front of the chest and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted.
2CH.5.7	The priests carried the chest into the most holy place and put it under the winged creatures, 
2CH.5.8	whose wings covered both the chest and the poles used for carrying it. 
2CH.5.9	The poles were so long that they could be seen from just outside the most holy place, but not from anywhere else. And they stayed there from then on.
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13	They were praising the 
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13	“The 
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13	and his love never ends.”
2CH.5.11+2CH.5.12+2CH.5.13	Suddenly a cloud filled the temple as the priests were leaving the holy place. 
2CH.5.14	The 
2CH.6.1	Solomon prayed:
2CH.6.1	“Our 
2CH.6.1	would live in a dark cloud.
2CH.6.2	Now I've built a glorious temple
2CH.6.2	where you can live forever.”
2CH.6.3	Solomon turned toward the people standing there. Then he blessed them 
2CH.6.4+2CH.6.5+2CH.6.6	 and said:
2CH.6.4+2CH.6.5+2CH.6.6	Praise the 
2CH.6.7	When my father wanted to build a temple for the 
2CH.6.8	the 
2CH.6.9	But you're not the one to do it. Your son will build the temple to honor me.”
2CH.6.10	The 
2CH.6.11	I've also put the sacred chest in the temple. And in that chest are the two flat stones on which is written the solemn agreement the 
2CH.6.12+2CH.6.13	Earlier, Solomon had a bronze platform made that was about two meters square and over a meter high, and he put it in the center of the outer courtyard near the altar. Solomon stood on the platform facing the altar with everyone standing behind him. Then he lifted his arms toward heaven; he knelt down 
2CH.6.14	and prayed:
2CH.6.14	You never forget the agreement you made with your people, and you are loyal to anyone who faithfully obeys your teachings. 
2CH.6.15	My father David was your servant, and today you have kept every promise you made to him.
2CH.6.17	Please keep this promise you made to your servant David. 
2CH.6.18	 There's not enough room in all of heaven for you, 
2CH.6.19	But I ask you to answer my prayer. 
2CH.6.20	 This is the temple where you have chosen to be worshiped. Please watch over it day and night and listen when I turn toward it and pray. 
2CH.6.21	I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you, and so whenever any of us look toward this temple and pray, answer from your home in heaven and forgive our sins.
2CH.6.22	Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime, and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say, “I swear I am innocent!” 
2CH.6.23	Listen from heaven and decide who is right. Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free.
2CH.6.24	Suppose your people Israel sin against you, and then an enemy defeats them. If they come to this temple and beg for forgiveness, 
2CH.6.25	listen from your home in heaven. Forgive them and bring them back to the land you gave their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	Suppose your people sin against you, and you punish them by holding back the rain. If they stop sinning and turn toward this temple to pray in your name, 
2CH.6.27	listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. The people of Israel are your servants, so teach them to live right. And send rain on the land you promised them forever.
2CH.6.28	Sometimes the crops may dry up or rot or be eaten by locusts
2CH.6.29	Please listen when anyone in Israel truly feels sorry and sincerely prays with arms lifted toward your temple. 
2CH.6.30	You know what is in everyone's heart. So from your home in heaven answer their prayers, according to what they do and what is in their hearts. 
2CH.6.31	Then your people will worship you and obey you for as long as they live in the land you gave their ancestors.
2CH.6.32	Foreigners will hear about you and your mighty power, and some of them will come to live among your people Israel. If any of them pray toward this temple, 
2CH.6.33	listen from your home in heaven and answer their prayers. Then everyone on earth will worship you, just as your own people Israel do, and they will know that I have built this temple in your honor.
2CH.6.34	Sometimes you will order your people to attack their enemies. Then your people will turn toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city, and they will pray to you. 
2CH.6.35	Answer their prayers from heaven and give them victory.
2CH.6.36	Everyone sins. But when your people sin against you, suppose you get angry enough to let their enemies drag them away to foreign countries. 
2CH.6.37+2CH.6.38+2CH.6.39	Later, they may feel sorry for what they did and ask your forgiveness. Answer them when they pray toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city, here in this land you gave their ancestors. From your home in heaven, listen to their sincere prayers and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
2CH.6.41	 Come to your new home, where we have already placed the sacred chest, which is the symbol of your strength. I pray that when the priests announce your power to save people, those who are faithful to you will celebrate what you've done for them. 
2CH.6.42	Always remember the love you had for your servant David,
2CH.7.2	and the priests could not go in.
2CH.7.3	“The 
2CH.7.3	and his love never ends.”
2CH.7.4+2CH.7.5	Solomon and the people dedicated the temple to the 
2CH.7.6	Everybody stood up during the ceremony. The priests were in their assigned places, blowing their trumpets. And the Levites faced them, playing the musical instruments that David had made for them to use when they praised the 
2CH.7.7	On that same day, Solomon dedicated the courtyard in front of the temple and got it ready to be used for worship. The bronze altar he had made was too small, so he used the courtyard to offer sacrifices to please the 
2CH.7.8	For 7 days, Solomon and the crowd celebrated the Festival of Shelters, and people came from as far away as the Egyptian Gorge in the south and Lebo-Hamath in the north. 
2CH.7.9	Then on the next day, everyone came together for worship. They had celebrated a total of 14 days, 7 days for the dedication of the altar and 7 more days for the festival. 
2CH.7.10	Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month,
2CH.7.11	The 
2CH.7.12	Some time later, the 
2CH.7.12	I heard your prayer, and I have chosen this temple as the place where sacrifices will be offered to me.
2CH.7.13	Suppose I hold back the rain or send locusts
2CH.7.14	If my own people will humbly pray and turn back to me and stop sinning, then I will answer them from heaven. I will forgive them and make their land fertile once again. 
2CH.7.15	I will hear the prayers made in this temple, 
2CH.7.16	because it belongs to me, and this is where I will be worshiped forever. I will never stop watching over it.
2CH.7.17	Your father David obeyed me, and now, Solomon, you must do the same. Obey my laws and teachings, 
2CH.7.18	 and I will keep my solemn promise to him that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.
2CH.7.19	But if you or any of the people of Israel disobey my laws or start worshiping foreign gods, 
2CH.7.20	I will pull you out of this land I gave you. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped, so that people everywhere will think it is only a joke and will make fun of it. 
2CH.7.21	This temple is now magnificent. But when these things happen, everyone who walks by it will be shocked and will ask, “Why did the 
2CH.7.22	Then they will answer, “It was because the people of Israel rejected the 
2CH.8.1	It took 20 years for the 
2CH.8.2	After that, Solomon had his workers rebuild the towns that Hiram had given him. Then Solomon sent Israelites to live in those towns.
2CH.8.3	Solomon attacked and captured the town of Hamath-Zobah. 
2CH.8.4	He ordered his workers to build the town of Tadmor in the desert and some towns in Hamath where he could keep his supplies. 
2CH.8.5	He strengthened Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon by adding walls and gates that could be locked. 
2CH.8.6	He did the same thing to the town of Baalath and to the cities where he kept supplies, chariots, and horses. Solomon ordered his workers to build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere else in his kingdom.
2CH.8.7+2CH.8.8+2CH.8.9	Solomon did not force the Israelites to do his work. Instead, they were his soldiers, officers, army commanders, and cavalry troops. But he did make slaves of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites who were living in Israel. These were the descendants of those foreigners the Israelites did not destroy, and they remained Israel's slaves.
2CH.8.10	Solomon appointed 250 officers to be in charge of his workers.
2CH.8.11	Solomon's wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from the part of Jerusalem called David's City to her new palace that Solomon had built. The sacred chest had been kept in David's City, which made his palace sacred, and so Solomon's wife could no longer live there.
2CH.8.12	Solomon offered sacrifices to the 
2CH.8.13	 He followed the requirements that Moses had given for sacrifices offered on the Sabbath, on the first day of each month, the Festival of Thin Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters.
2CH.8.14	Solomon then assigned the priests and the Levites their duties at the temple, and he followed the instructions that his father, the man of God, had given him. Some of the Levites were to lead music and help the priests in their duties, and others were to guard the temple gates 
2CH.8.15	and the storage rooms. The priests and Levites followed these instructions exactly.
2CH.8.16	Everything Solomon had planned to do was now finished—from the laying of the temple's foundation to its completion.
2CH.8.17	Solomon went to Ezion-Geber and Eloth, two Edomite towns on the Red Sea.
2CH.8.18	Hiram sent him ships and some of his experienced sailors. They went with Solomon's own sailors to the country of Ophir
2CH.9.2	He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was.
2CH.9.3+2CH.9.4	The Queen was amazed at Solomon's wisdom. She was breathless when she saw his palace,
2CH.9.5	She said:
2CH.9.5	Solomon, in my own country I had heard about your wisdom and all you've done. 
2CH.9.6	But I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes! And there's so much I didn't hear about. You are greater than I was told. 
2CH.9.7	Your people and officials are lucky to be here where they can listen to the wise things you say.
2CH.9.8	I praise the 
2CH.9.9	The Queen of Sheba gave Solomon more than four tons of gold, a large amount of jewels, and the best spices anyone had ever seen.
2CH.9.10+2CH.9.11+2CH.9.12	In return, Solomon gave her everything she wanted—even more than she had given him. Then she and her officials went back to their own country.
2CH.9.10+2CH.9.11+2CH.9.12	Hiram's and Solomon's sailors brought gold, juniper wood, and jewels from the country of Ophir. Solomon used the wood to make steps
2CH.9.13	Solomon received almost 23 tons of gold each year, 
2CH.9.14	not counting what the merchants and traders brought him. The kings of Arabia and the leaders of Israel also gave him gold and silver.
2CH.9.15	Solomon made 200 gold shields that weighed over three kilograms each. 
2CH.9.16	He also made 300 smaller gold shields that weighed almost two kilograms, and he put these shields in his palace in Forest Hall.
2CH.9.17	His throne was made of ivory and covered with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	It had a gold footstool attached to it and armrests on each side. There was a statue of a lion on each side of the throne, 
2CH.9.19	and there were two lion statues on each of the six steps leading up to the throne. No other throne in the world was like Solomon's.
2CH.9.20	Solomon's cups and dishes in Forest Hall were made of pure gold, because silver was almost worthless in those days.
2CH.9.21	Solomon had a lot of seagoing ships.
2CH.9.22	Solomon was the richest and wisest king in the world. 
2CH.9.23+2CH.9.24	Year after year, other kings came to hear the wisdom God had given him. And they brought gifts of silver and gold, as well as clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
2CH.9.27	While Solomon was king, there was silver everywhere in Jerusalem, and cedar was as common as the sycamore trees in the western foothills. 
2CH.9.28	 Solomon's horses were brought in from other countries, including Musri.
2CH.9.29	Everything else Solomon did while he was king is written in the records of Nathan the prophet, Ahijah the prophet from Shiloh, and Iddo the prophet who wrote about Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
2CH.9.30	After Solomon had ruled 40 years from Jerusalem, 
2CH.9.31	he died and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam then became king.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
2CH.10.2	Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he returned from Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon. 
2CH.10.3	The people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam replied, “Come back in three days for my answer.” So the people left.
2CH.10.6	Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”
2CH.10.7	They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should be kind and promise to make their work easier.”
2CH.10.8	But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials. 
2CH.10.9	He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”
2CH.10.10	His younger advisors said:
2CH.10.10	Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak.
2CH.10.11	He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”
2CH.10.12	Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back. 
2CH.10.13	Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisors. He spoke bluntly 
2CH.10.14	and told them exactly what his own advisors had suggested. He said: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”
2CH.10.15+2CH.10.16+2CH.10.17+2CH.10.18+2CH.10.19	Adoniram
2CH.10.15+2CH.10.16+2CH.10.17+2CH.10.18+2CH.10.19	Everyone from Israel's northern tribes went home, leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from Judah. And since that day, the people of Israel have been opposed to David's descendants in Judah.
2CH.11.1	After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and regain control of the whole country. So he called together 180,000 soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.2	Meanwhile, the 
2CH.11.3	to tell Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	“The 
2CH.11.4	Rehoboam and his army obeyed the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam ruled from Jerusalem, and he had several cities in Judah turned into fortresses so he could use them to defend his country. These cities included 
2CH.11.6	Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. After he had fortified these cities in the territories of Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.11	he assigned an army commander to each of them and stocked them with supplies of food, olive oil, and wine, 
2CH.11.12	as well as with shields and spears. He used these fortified cities to keep control of Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.13	The priests and Levites from the northern tribes of Israel gave their support to King Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.14	And since Jeroboam and the kings of Israel that followed him would not allow any Levites to serve as priests, most Levites left their towns and pasturelands in Israel and moved to Jerusalem and other towns in Judah. 
2CH.11.15	 Jeroboam chose his own priests to serve at the local shrines
2CH.11.16	But some of the people from Israel wanted to worship the 
2CH.11.17	For the next three years, they lived in Judah and were loyal to Rehoboam and his kingdom, just as they had been loyal to David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David, and whose mother was Abihail the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	Rehoboam and Mahalath had three sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	Then Rehoboam married Maacah the daughter of Absalom. Their sons were Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam had 18 wives, but he also married 60 other women,
2CH.11.22	so he chose their oldest son Abijah to be the next king. 
2CH.11.23	Rehoboam was wise enough to put one of his sons in charge of each fortified city in his kingdom. He gave them all the supplies they needed and found wives for every one of them.
2CH.12.1	Soon after Rehoboam had control of his kingdom, he and everyone in Judah stopped obeying the 
2CH.12.2	So in the fifth year of Rehoboam's rule, the 
2CH.12.3	Shishak attacked with his army of 1,200 chariots and 60,000 cavalry troops, as well as countless Egyptian soldiers from Libya, Sukkoth, and Ethiopia.
2CH.12.4	He captured every one of the fortified cities in Judah and then marched to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah had gone to Jerusalem to escape Shishak's invasion. And while they were there, Shemaiah the prophet told them, “The 
2CH.12.6	Rehoboam and the leaders were sorry for what they had done and admitted, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.7	The people of Judah are truly sorry for their sins, and so I won't let Shishak completely destroy them. But because I am still angry, 
2CH.12.8	he will conquer and rule them.
2CH.12.8	Then my people will know what it's like to serve a foreign king instead of serving me.
2CH.12.10	Rehoboam had bronze shields made to replace the gold ones, and he ordered the guards at the city gates to keep them safe. 
2CH.12.11	Whenever Rehoboam went to the 
2CH.12.12	Rehoboam turned back to the 
2CH.12.13	Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he ruled 17 years from Jerusalem, the city where the 
2CH.12.14	but he still did wrong and refused to obey the 
2CH.12.15	Everything else Rehoboam did while he was king, including a history of his family, is written in the records of the two prophets, Shemaiah and Iddo. During Rehoboam's rule, he and King Jeroboam of Israel were constantly at war. 
2CH.12.16	When Rehoboam died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Abijah became king.
2CH.13.1	Abijah
2CH.13.2	and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.
2CH.13.2	Some time later, Abijah and King Jeroboam of Israel went to war against each other. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah's army had 400,000 troops, and Jeroboam met him in battle with 800,000 troops.
2CH.13.4	Abijah went to the top of Mount Zemaraim
2CH.13.4	Listen, Jeroboam and all you Israelites! 
2CH.13.5	The 
2CH.13.6	But Jeroboam, you were King Solomon's official, and you rebelled. 
2CH.13.7	Then right after Rehoboam became king, you and your bunch of worthless followers challenged Rehoboam, who was too young to know how to stop you.
2CH.13.8	Now you and your powerful army think you can stand up to the kingdom that the 
2CH.13.9	You don't even have descendants of Aaron on your side, because you forced out the 
2CH.13.10	But we have not turned our backs on the 
2CH.13.11	Two times every day they offer sacrifices and burn incense to the 
2CH.13.12	That's why God is on our side and will lead us into battle when the priests sound the signal on the trumpets. It's no use, Israelites. You might as well give up. There's no way you can defeat the 
2CH.13.13	But while Abijah was talking, Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to attack Judah's army from behind, while the rest attacked from the front. 
2CH.13.14	Judah's army realized they were trapped, and so they prayed to the 
2CH.13.15	and the troops let out a battle cry. Then with Abijah leading them into battle, God defeated Jeroboam and Israel's army. 
2CH.13.16	The Israelites ran away, and God helped Judah's soldiers slaughter 
2CH.13.17	500,000 enemy troops. 
2CH.13.18	Judah's army won because they had trusted the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah kept up his attack on Jeroboam's army and captured the Israelite towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, as well as the villages around them.
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam never regained his power during the rest of Abijah's rule. The 
2CH.13.21	Abijah had a total of 14 wives, 22 sons, and 16 daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Everything Abijah said and did while he was king is written in the records of Iddo the prophet.
2CH.14.1	Abijah died and was buried in Jerusalem. Then his son Asa became king, and Judah had ten years of peace.
2CH.14.2	Asa obeyed the 
2CH.14.3	He destroyed the local shrines
2CH.14.4	Then he told everyone in Judah to worship the 
2CH.14.5	He destroyed every local shrine and incense altar in Judah.
2CH.14.6	The 
2CH.14.7	He said to the people, “Let's build walls and defense towers for these towns, and put in gates that can be locked with bars. This land still belongs to us, because we have obeyed the 
2CH.14.8	Asa had a large army of brave soldiers: 300,000 of them were from the tribe of Judah and were armed with shields and spears; 280,000 were from Benjamin and were armed with shields and bows.
2CH.14.9	Zerah from Ethiopia
2CH.14.10	Asa met him there, and the two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley.
2CH.14.11	Asa prayed:
2CH.14.12	The 
2CH.14.13	but Asa and his troops chased them as far as Gerar. It was a total defeat—the Ethiopians could not even fight back!
2CH.14.13	The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians. 
2CH.14.14	The people who lived in the villages around Gerar learned what had happened and were afraid of the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took a lot of sheep, goats, and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	Some time later, God spoke to Azariah son of Oded. 
2CH.15.2	At once, Azariah went to Asa and said:
2CH.15.2	Listen to me, King Asa and you people of Judah and Benjamin. The 
2CH.15.3	For a long time, the people of Israel did not worship the true God or listen to priests who could teach them about God. They refused to obey God's Law. 
2CH.15.4	But whenever trouble came, Israel turned back to the 
2CH.15.5	There was so much confusion in those days that it wasn't safe to go anywhere in Israel. 
2CH.15.6	Nations were destroying each other, and cities were wiping out other cities, because God was causing trouble and unrest everywhere.
2CH.15.7	So you must be brave. Don't give up! God will honor you for obeying him.
2CH.15.8	As soon as Asa heard what Azariah the prophet said, he gave orders for all the idols in Judah and Benjamin to be destroyed, including those in the towns he had captured in the territory of Ephraim. He also repaired the 
2CH.15.9	Asa called together the people from Judah and Benjamin, as well as the people from the territories of Ephraim, West Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many of these people were now loyal to Asa, because they had seen that the 
2CH.15.10	In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's rule, they all met in Jerusalem. 
2CH.15.11	That same day, they took 700 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats from what they had brought back from Gerar and sacrificed them as offerings to the 
2CH.15.12	They made a solemn promise to faithfully worship the 
2CH.15.13	and to put to death anyone who refused to obey him. 
2CH.15.14	The crowd solemnly agreed to keep their promise to the 
2CH.15.15	Everyone was happy because they had made this solemn promise, and in return, the 
2CH.15.16	Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting idol of the goddess Asherah, so he cut it down, crushed it, and burned it in Kidron Valley. Then he removed Maacah from her position as queen mother.
2CH.15.17	As long as Asa lived, he was faithful to the 
2CH.15.18	He placed in the temple all the silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated to God.
2CH.15.19	There was peace in Judah until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's rule.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's rule, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and captured the town of Ramah. He started making the town stronger, and he put troops there to stop people from going in and out of Judah.
2CH.16.2	When Asa heard about this, he took the silver and gold from his palace and from the 
2CH.16.3	“I think we should sign a peace treaty, just as our fathers did. This silver and gold is a present for you. Would you please break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel and force him to leave my country?”
2CH.16.4	Benhadad did what Asa asked and sent the Syrian army into Israel. They captured the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim,
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard about it, he stopped his work on the town of Ramah.
2CH.16.6	Asa ordered everyone in Judah to carry away the stones and wood Baasha had used to fortify Ramah. Then he fortified the towns of Geba and Mizpah with these same stones and wood.
2CH.16.7	Soon after that happened, Hanani the prophet went to Asa and said:
2CH.16.7	You depended on the king of Syria instead of depending on the 
2CH.16.8	Remember how powerful the Ethiopian
2CH.16.9	The 
2CH.16.10	When Asa heard this, he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison. Asa was also cruel to some of his people.
2CH.16.11	Everything Asa did while he was king is written in 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, he got a very bad foot disease, but he relied on doctors and refused to ask the 
2CH.16.13	He died two years later.
2CH.16.14	Earlier, Asa had his own tomb cut out of a rock hill in Jerusalem. So he was buried there, and the tomb was filled with spices and sweet-smelling oils. Then the people built a bonfire in his honor.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king and strengthened his defenses against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He assigned troops to the fortified cities in Judah, as well as to other towns in Judah and to those towns in Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2CH.17.3+2CH.17.4	When Jehoshaphat's father had first become king of Judah, he was faithful to the 
2CH.17.5	and helped him keep firm control of his kingdom. The people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, but even after he became very rich and respected, 
2CH.17.6	he remained completely faithful to the 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of Jehoshaphat's rule, he chose five officials and gave them orders to teach the 
2CH.17.8	Their assistants were the following nine Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah. Two priests, Elishama and Jehoram, also went along. 
2CH.17.9	They carried with them a copy of the 
2CH.17.10	The nations around Judah were afraid of the 
2CH.17.11	Philistines brought him silver and other gifts to keep peace. Some of the Arab people brought him 7,700 rams and the same number of goats.
2CH.17.12	As Jehoshaphat became more powerful, he built fortresses and cities 
2CH.17.13	where he stored supplies. He also kept in Jerusalem some experienced soldiers 
2CH.17.14	from the Judah and Benjamin tribes. These soldiers were grouped according to their clans.
2CH.17.14	Adnah was the commander of the troops from Judah, and he had 300,000 soldiers under his command. 
2CH.17.15	Jehohanan was second in command, with 280,000 soldiers under him. 
2CH.17.16	Amasiah son of Zichri, who had volunteered to serve the 
2CH.17.17	Eliada was a brave warrior who commanded the troops from Benjamin. He had 200,000 soldiers under his command, all of them armed with bows and shields. 
2CH.17.18	Jehozabad was second in command, with 180,000 soldiers under him. 
2CH.17.19	These were the troops who protected the king in Jerusalem, not counting those he had assigned to the fortified cities throughout the country.
2CH.18.1	Jehoshaphat was now very rich and famous. He signed a treaty with King Ahab of Israel by arranging the marriage of his son and Ahab's daughter.
2CH.18.2	One day, Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in his capital city of Samaria. Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle and prepared a big feast to honor Jehoshaphat and the officials with him. Ahab talked about attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead,
2CH.18.3	and finally asked, “Jehoshaphat, would you go with me to attack Ramoth?”
2CH.18.3	“Yes,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army is at your command. 
2CH.18.4	But first let's ask the 
2CH.18.5	Ahab sent for 400 prophets and asked, “Should I attack the city of Ramoth?”
2CH.18.5	“Yes!” the prophets answered. “God will help you capture the city.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the 
2CH.18.7	“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.”
2CH.18.7	“Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied. 
2CH.18.8	Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
2CH.18.9	All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria, listening to the prophets tell them what the 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the 
2CH.18.11	All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth and promised that the 
2CH.18.12	Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”
2CH.18.13	“I'll say whatever the living 
2CH.18.14	Then Micaiah went up to Ahab, who asked, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth?”
2CH.18.14	“Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The 
2CH.18.15	Ahab shouted, “Micaiah, I've told you over and over to tell me the truth! What does the 
2CH.18.17	Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring me bad news!”
2CH.18.18	Micaiah replied:
2CH.18.18	I then saw the 
2CH.18.19	The 
2CH.18.19	They talked about it for a while, 
2CH.18.20	then finally a spirit came forward and said to the 
2CH.18.20	“How?” the 
2CH.18.21	“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.”
2CH.18.21	“Good!” the 
2CH.18.22	Ahab, this is exactly what has happened. The 
2CH.18.23	Zedekiah walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the 
2CH.18.24	Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”
2CH.18.25	Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria. 
2CH.18.26	Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
2CH.18.27	Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the 
2CH.18.28	Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Ahab disguised himself and went into battle.
2CH.18.30	The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack only Ahab. 
2CH.18.31	So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But Jehoshaphat prayed, and the 
2CH.18.32	And when they realized he wasn't Ahab, they left him alone.
2CH.18.33	However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab between two pieces of his armor. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”
2CH.18.34	The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He stayed there until evening, and by sundown he was dead.
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	But the prophet Jehu son of Hanani met him and said:
2CH.19.2	By helping that wicked Ahab, you have made friends with someone who hates the 
2CH.19.3	But not everything about you is bad. You destroyed the sacred poles
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he often traveled through his kingdom, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north. He talked with the people and convinced them to turn back to the 
2CH.19.5	He assigned judges to each of the fortified cities in Judah 
2CH.19.6	and told them:
2CH.19.6	Be careful when you make your decisions in court, because you are judging by the 
2CH.19.7	So do your work in honor of him and know that he won't allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes.
2CH.19.8	Jehoshaphat also chose some Levites, some priests, and some of the family leaders, and he appointed them to serve as judges in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.9	He told them:
2CH.19.9	Faithfully serve the 
2CH.19.10	The people of Judah will bring you legal cases that involve every type of crime, including murder. You must settle these cases and warn the people to stop sinning against the 
2CH.19.11	Amariah the high priest will have the final say in any religious case. And Zebadiah, the leader
2CH.20.1	Some time later, the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with the Meunites,
2CH.20.2	Messengers told Jehoshaphat, “A large army from Edom
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he asked the 
2CH.20.4	They immediately left for Jerusalem to ask for the 
2CH.20.5	After everyone from Judah and Jerusalem had come together at the 
2CH.20.6	and prayed:
2CH.20.6	You, 
2CH.20.7	 Our God, you forced out the nations who lived in this land before your people Israel came here, and you gave it to the descendants of your friend Abraham forever. 
2CH.20.8	Our ancestors lived in this land and built a temple to honor you. 
2CH.20.9	They believed that whenever this land is struck by war or disease or famine, your people can pray to you at the temple, and you will hear their prayer and save them.
2CH.20.11	Now they are coming to take back the land you gave us. 
2CH.20.12	Aren't you going to punish them? We won't stand a chance when this army attacks. We don't know what to do—we are begging for your help.
2CH.20.13	While every man, woman, and child of Judah was standing there at the temple, 
2CH.20.14	the 
2CH.20.15	 Then Jahaziel said:
2CH.20.15	Your Majesty and everyone from Judah and Jerusalem, the 
2CH.20.16	So here's what you must do. Tomorrow the enemy armies will march through the desert around the town of Jeruel. March down and meet them at the town of Ziz as they come up the valley. 
2CH.20.17	 You won't even have to fight. Just take your positions and watch the 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed low to the ground and everyone worshiped the 
2CH.20.19	Then some Levites from the Kohath and Korah clans stood up and shouted praises to the 
2CH.20.20	Early the next morning, as everyone got ready to leave for the desert near Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, “Listen my friends, if we trust the 
2CH.20.21	Then he explained his plan and appointed men to march in front of the army and praise the 
2CH.20.21	“Praise the 
2CH.20.21	His love never ends.”
2CH.20.22	As soon as they began singing, the 
2CH.20.23	so that the Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom. Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out!
2CH.20.24	When Judah's army reached the tower that overlooked the desert, they saw that every soldier in the enemy's army was lying dead on the ground. 
2CH.20.25	So Jehoshaphat and his troops went into the camp to carry away everything of value. They found a large herd of livestock,
2CH.20.26	Then on the fourth day, everyone came together in Beracah Valley and sang praises to the 
2CH.20.27+2CH.20.28	Jehoshaphat led the crowd back to Jerusalem. And as they marched, they played harps and blew trumpets. They were very happy because the 
2CH.20.29	When the other nations heard how the 
2CH.20.30	to invade Judah. The 
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	Jehoshaphat obeyed the 
2CH.20.33	but he did not destroy the local shrines.
2CH.20.34	Everything else Jehoshaphat did while he was king is written in the records of Jehu son of Hanani that are included in 
2CH.20.35	While Jehoshaphat was king, he signed a peace treaty with Ahaziah the wicked king of Israel. 
2CH.20.36	They agreed to build several seagoing ships
2CH.20.37	But the prophet Eliezer
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Jehoram became king.
2CH.21.2	King Jehoshaphat had seven sons: Jehoram, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. 
2CH.21.3	Jehoshaphat gave each of them silver and gold, as well as other valuable gifts. He also put them in charge of the fortified cities in Judah, but he had chosen his oldest son Jehoram to succeed him as king.
2CH.21.4	After Jehoram had taken control of Judah, he had his brothers killed, as well as some of the nation's leaders. 
2CH.21.5	He was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem.
2CH.21.6	Jehoram married Ahab's daughter and followed the sinful example of Ahab's family and the other kings of Israel. He disobeyed the 
2CH.21.7	 but because the 
2CH.21.9	Jehoram, his officers, and his cavalry marched to Edom, where the Edomite army surrounded them. He escaped during the night, 
2CH.21.10	but Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah
2CH.21.10	Those things happened because Jehoram had turned away from the 
2CH.21.11	Jehoram even built local shrines
2CH.21.12	One day, Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet that said:
2CH.21.12	I have a message for you from the 
2CH.21.13	Instead you have acted like those sinful kings of Israel and have encouraged the people of Judah to stop worshiping the 
2CH.21.14	Because you have done these terrible things, the 
2CH.21.15	You will be struck with a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.
2CH.21.16	The 
2CH.21.17	They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace, and they led Jehoram's wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah,
2CH.21.18	After this happened, the 
2CH.21.19	About two years later, Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honor him, even though the people had done this for his ancestors.
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled 8 years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs.
2CH.22.1	Earlier, when the Arabs led a raid against Judah, they killed all of Jehoram's sons, except Ahaziah, the youngest one. So the people of Jerusalem crowned him their king. 
2CH.22.2	He was 22
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah's mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel, 
2CH.22.3	and she encouraged her son to sin against the 
2CH.22.4	In fact, after his father's death, Ahaziah sinned against the 
2CH.22.4	Their advice led to his downfall. 
2CH.22.5	He listened to them and went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle, 
2CH.22.6	and he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. And Ahaziah later went there to visit him. 
2CH.22.7	It was during that visit that God had Ahaziah put to death.
2CH.22.7	When Ahaziah arrived at Jezreel, he and Joram went to meet with Jehu grandson of Nimshi. The 
2CH.22.8	and while Jehu was doing that, he saw some of Judah's leaders and Ahaziah's nephews who had come with Ahaziah. Jehu killed them on the spot, 
2CH.22.9	then gave orders to find Ahaziah. Jehu's officers found him hiding in Samaria. They brought Ahaziah to Jehu, who immediately put him to death. They buried Ahaziah only because they respected Jehoshaphat his grandfather, who had done his best to obey the 
2CH.22.9	There was no one from Ahaziah's family left to become king of Judah.
2CH.22.10	As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done just that, 
2CH.22.11	but Jehosheba
2CH.22.12	Joash hid in the temple with them for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah.
2CH.23.1	After Ahaziah's son Joash had hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest knew that something had to be done. So he made sure he had the support of several army officers. They were Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. 
2CH.23.2	These five men went to the towns in Judah and called together the Levites and the clan leaders. They all came to Jerusalem 
2CH.23.3	 and gathered at the temple, where they agreed to help Joash.
2CH.23.3	Jehoiada said to them:
2CH.23.3	Joash will be our next king, because long ago the 
2CH.23.4	Here is what we will do. Three groups of priests and Levites will be on guard duty on the Sabbath—one group will guard the gates of the temple, 
2CH.23.5	one will guard the palace, and the other will guard Foundation Gate. The rest of you will stand guard in the temple courtyards. 
2CH.23.6	Only the priests and Levites who are on duty will be able to enter the temple, because they will be the only ones who have gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable. The others must stay outside in the courtyards, just as the 
2CH.23.7	You Levites must protect King Joash. Don't let him out of your sight! And keep your swords ready to kill anyone who comes into the temple.
2CH.23.8	The Levites and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada's orders. The guards going off duty were not allowed to go home, and so each commander had all his guards available—those going off duty as well as those coming on duty. 
2CH.23.9	Jehoiada went into the temple and brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David, and he gave them to the commanders. 
2CH.23.10	They gave the weapons to the guards, and Jehoiada then made sure that the guards took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect the king on every side.
2CH.23.11	Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash outside, where they placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of the instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, and the crowd cheered and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	As soon as Queen Athaliah heard the crowd cheering for Joash, she went to the temple. 
2CH.23.13	There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns near the entrance, which was the usual place for the king. The commanders and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the musicians were playing instruments and leading the people as they celebrated and blew trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, “You betrayed me, you traitors!”
2CH.23.14	At once, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, “Don't kill her near the 
2CH.23.15	She tried to escape, but the commanders caught and killed her near the gate where horses are led into the palace.
2CH.23.16	Jehoiada asked King Joash and the people to join with him in being faithful to the 
2CH.23.17	then rushed to the temple of the god Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2CH.23.18	Jehoiada assigned the priests and Levites their duties at the temple, just as David had done. They were in charge of offering sacrifices to the 
2CH.23.19	Jehoiada ordered the guards at the temple gates to keep out anyone who was unclean.
2CH.23.20	Finally, Jehoiada called together the army commanders, the most important citizens of Judah, and the government officials. The crowd of people followed them as they led Joash from the temple, through the Upper Gate, and into the palace, where he took his place as king of Judah. 
2CH.23.21	Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again.
2CH.24.1	Joash was only 7 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 40 years from Jerusalem. His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba.
2CH.24.2	While Jehoiada the priest was alive, Joash obeyed the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada even chose two women for Joash to marry so he could have a family.
2CH.24.4	Some time later, Joash decided it was time to repair the temple. 
2CH.24.5	He called together the priests and Levites and said, “Go everywhere in Judah and collect the annual tax from the people. I want this done at once—we need that money to repair the temple.”
2CH.24.5	But the Levites were in no hurry to follow the king's orders. 
2CH.24.6	 So he sent for Jehoiada the high priest and asked, “Why didn't you send the Levites to collect the taxes? The 
2CH.24.7	And now we need it to repair the temple because the sons of that evil woman Athaliah came in and wrecked it. They even used some of the sacred objects to worship the god Baal.”
2CH.24.8	Joash gave orders for a wooden box to be made and had it placed outside, near the gate of the temple. 
2CH.24.9	He then sent letters everywhere in Judah and Jerusalem, asking everyone to bring their taxes to the temple, just as Moses had required their ancestors to do.
2CH.24.10	The people and their leaders agreed, and they brought their money to Jerusalem and placed it in the box. 
2CH.24.11	Each day, after the Levites took the box into the temple, the king's secretary and the high priest's assistant would dump out the money and count it. Then the empty box would be taken back outside.
2CH.24.11	This happened day after day, and soon a large amount of money was collected. 
2CH.24.12	Joash and Jehoiada turned the money over to the men who were supervising the repairs to the temple. They used the money to hire stonecutters, carpenters, and experts in working with iron and bronze.
2CH.24.13	These workers went right to work repairing the temple, and when they were finished, it looked as good as new. 
2CH.24.14	They did not use all the tax money for the repairs, so the rest of it was handed over to Joash and Jehoiada, who then used it to make dishes and other gold and silver objects for the temple.
2CH.24.14	Sacrifices to please the 
2CH.24.15	He died at the ripe old age of 130 years, 
2CH.24.16	and he was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem, because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the temple.
2CH.24.17	After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted. 
2CH.24.18	The people of Judah soon stopped worshiping in the temple of the 
2CH.24.19	but he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.
2CH.24.21+2CH.24.22	King Joash forgot that Zechariah's father had always been a loyal friend. So when the people of Judah plotted to kill Zechariah, Joash joined them and gave orders for them to stone him to death in the courtyard of the temple. As Zechariah was dying, he said, “I pray that the 
2CH.24.23	In the spring of the following year, the Syrian army invaded Judah and Jerusalem, killing all of the nation's leaders. They collected everything of value that belonged to the people and took it back to their king in Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	The Syrian army was very small, but the 
2CH.24.25+2CH.24.26	Joash was severely wounded during the battle, and as soon as the Syrians left Judah, two of his officials, Zabad and Jehozabad,
2CH.24.27	 also tells more about the sons of Joash, what the prophets said about him, and how he repaired the temple. Amaziah son of Joash became king after his father's death.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem, the hometown of his mother Jehoaddin.
2CH.25.2	Even though Amaziah obeyed the 
2CH.25.3	For example, as soon as he had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father. 
2CH.25.4	 But the children of those officers were not killed; the 
2CH.25.5	Amaziah sent a message to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and called together all the men who were 20 years old and older. Three hundred thousand men went to Jerusalem, all of them ready for battle and able to fight with spears and shields. Amaziah grouped these soldiers according to their clans and put them under the command of his army officers. 
2CH.25.6	Amaziah also paid about 3.4 tons of silver to hire 100,000 soldiers from Israel.
2CH.25.7	One of God's prophets said, “Your Majesty, don't let these Israelite soldiers march into battle with you. The 
2CH.25.8	and so he will let your enemies defeat you, even if you fight hard. He is the one who brings both victory and defeat.”
2CH.25.9	Amaziah replied, “What am I supposed to do about all the silver I paid those troops?”
2CH.25.9	“The 
2CH.25.10	Amaziah ordered the troops from Israel to go home, but when they left, they were furious with the people of Judah.
2CH.25.11	After Amaziah got his courage back, he led his troops to Salt Valley, where he killed 10,000 Edomite soldiers in battle. 
2CH.25.12	He captured 10,000 more soldiers and dragged them to the top of a high cliff. Then he pushed them over the side, and they all were killed on the rocks below.
2CH.25.13	Meanwhile, the Israelite troops that Amaziah had sent home, raided the towns in Judah between Samaria and Beth-Horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off their possessions.
2CH.25.14	After Amaziah had defeated the Edomite army, he returned to Jerusalem. He took with him the idols of the Edomite gods and set them up. Then he bowed down and offered them sacrifices. 
2CH.25.15	This made the 
2CH.25.16	But before the prophet finished speaking, Amaziah interrupted and said, “You're not one of my advisors! Don't say another word, or I'll have you killed.”
2CH.25.16	The prophet stopped. But then he added, “First you sinned and now you've ignored my warning. It's clear that God has decided to punish you!”
2CH.25.17	King Amaziah of Judah talked with his officials, then sent a message to King Jehoash
2CH.25.18	Jehoash sent back a reply that said:
2CH.25.18	Once upon a time, a small thornbush in Lebanon arranged the marriage between his son and the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush.
2CH.25.19	Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. But stay at home and do your celebrating. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed.
2CH.25.20	God made Amaziah stubborn because he was planning to punish him for worshiping the Edomite gods. Amaziah refused to listen to Jehoash's warning, 
2CH.25.21	so Jehoash led his army to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops. 
2CH.25.22	During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home, 
2CH.25.23	and Jehoash captured Amaziah.
2CH.25.23	Jehoash took Amaziah with him when he went to attack Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly 200 meters long. 
2CH.25.24	He carried away the gold, the silver, and all the valuable furnishings from God's temple where the descendants of Obed-Edom stood guard. He robbed the king's treasury, took hostages, then returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	Amaziah lived 15 years after Jehoash died. 
2CH.25.26	Everything else Amaziah did while he was king is written in 
2CH.25.27	As soon as Amaziah started disobeying the 
2CH.25.28	His body was taken to Jerusalem on horseback and buried beside his ancestors.
2CH.26.1+2CH.26.2+2CH.26.3	After the death of King Amaziah, the people of Judah crowned his son Uzziah
2CH.26.4	He obeyed the 
2CH.26.5	Zechariah was Uzziah's advisor and taught him to obey God. And so, as long as Zechariah was alive, Uzziah was faithful to God, and God made him successful.
2CH.26.6	While Uzziah was king, he started a war against the Philistines. He smashed the walls of the cities of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, then rebuilt towns around Ashdod and in other parts of Philistia. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him defeat the Philistines, the Arabs living in Gur-Baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	Even the Ammonites paid taxes to Uzziah. He became very powerful, and people who lived as far away as Egypt heard about him.
2CH.26.9	In Jerusalem, Uzziah built fortified towers at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the place where the city wall turned inward.
2CH.26.10	He also built defense towers out in the desert.
2CH.26.10	He owned such a large herd of livestock in the western foothills and in the flatlands, that he had cisterns dug there to catch the rainwater. He loved farming, so he had crops and vineyards planted in the hill country wherever there was fertile soil, and he hired farmers to take care of them.
2CH.26.11	Uzziah's army was always ready for battle. Jeiel and Maaseiah were the officers who kept track of the number of soldiers, and these two men were under the command of Hananiah, one of Uzziah's officials. 
2CH.26.12+2CH.26.13	There were 307,500 trained soldiers, all under the command of 2,600 clan leaders. These powerful troops protected the king against any enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah supplied his army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and stones used for slinging. 
2CH.26.15	Some of his skilled workers invented machines that could shoot arrows and sling large stones. Uzziah set these up in Jerusalem at his defense towers and at the corners of the city wall.
2CH.26.15	God helped Uzziah become more and more powerful, and he was famous all over the world.
2CH.26.16	Uzziah became proud of his power, and this led to his downfall.
2CH.26.16	One day, Uzziah disobeyed the 
2CH.26.17	Azariah the priest and 80 other brave priests followed Uzziah into the temple 
2CH.26.18	 and said, “Your Majesty, this isn't right! You are not allowed to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Uzziah, who was standing next to the incense altar at the time, was holding the incense burner, ready to offer incense to the 
2CH.26.20	Azariah and the other priests saw it and immediately told him to leave the temple. Uzziah realized that the 
2CH.26.21	Uzziah had leprosy the rest of his life. He was no longer allowed in the temple or in his own palace. That's why his son Jotham lived there and ruled in his place.
2CH.26.22	Everything else Uzziah did while he was king is in the records written by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	 Since Uzziah had leprosy, he could not be buried in the royal tombs. Instead, he was buried in a nearby cemetery that the kings owned. His son Jotham then became king.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was 25 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 16 years. Jerushah his mother was the daughter of Zadok.
2CH.27.2	Jotham obeyed the 
2CH.27.3	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple and did a lot of work to repair the wall near Mount Ophel. 
2CH.27.4	He built towns in the mountains of Judah and built fortresses and defense towers in the forests.
2CH.27.5	During his rule he attacked and defeated the Ammonites. Then every year for the next three years, he forced them to pay 3.4 tons of silver, 1,000 tons of wheat, and 1,000 tons of barley.
2CH.27.6	Jotham remained faithful to the 
2CH.27.7	Everything else Jotham did while he was king, including the wars he fought, is written in 
2CH.27.8	After he had ruled Judah 16 years, he died at the age of 41. 
2CH.27.9	He was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Ahaz became king.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 16 years.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was nothing like his ancestor David. Ahaz disobeyed the 
2CH.28.2	and was as sinful as the kings of Israel. He made idols of the god Baal, 
2CH.28.3	and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley. Worst of all, Ahaz sacrificed his own sons, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the 
2CH.28.4	Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines,
2CH.28.5+2CH.28.6	The king of Syria attacked Judah and took many of its people to Damascus as prisoners. King Pekah
2CH.28.7	During that battle, an Israelite soldier named Zichri killed three men from Judah: Maaseiah the king's son; Azrikam, the official in charge of the palace; and Elkanah, the king's second in command. 
2CH.28.8	The Israelite troops captured 200,000 women and children and took them back to their capital city of Samaria, along with a large amount of their possessions. They did these things even though the people of Judah were their own relatives.
2CH.28.9	Oded lived in Samaria and was one of the 
2CH.28.9	The 
2CH.28.10	If you make slaves of the people of Judah and Jerusalem, you will be as guilty as they are of sinning against the 
2CH.28.11	Send these prisoners back home—they are your own relatives. If you don't, the 
2CH.28.12	About the same time, four of Israel's leaders arrived. They were Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai. They agreed with Oded that the Israelite troops were wrong, 
2CH.28.13	and they said:
2CH.28.13	If you bring these prisoners into Samaria, that will be one more thing we've done to sin against the 
2CH.28.14	So in front of the leaders and the crowd, the troops handed over their prisoners and the property they had taken from Judah. 
2CH.28.15	The four leaders took some of the stolen clothes and gave them to the prisoners who needed something to wear. They later gave them all a new change of clothes and shoes, then fixed them something to eat and drink, and cleaned their wounds with olive oil. They gave donkeys to those who were too weak to walk, and led all of them back to Jericho, the city known for its palm trees. The leaders then returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16+2CH.28.17+2CH.28.18	Some time later, the Edomites attacked the eastern part of Judah again and carried away prisoners. And at the same time, the Philistines raided towns in the western foothills and in the Southern Desert. They conquered the towns of Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo, including the villages around them. Then some of the Philistines went to live in these places.
2CH.28.16+2CH.28.17+2CH.28.18	Ahaz sent a message to King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria and begged for help. 
2CH.28.19	But God was punishing Judah with these disasters, because Ahaz had disobeyed him and refused to stop Judah from sinning. 
2CH.28.20	So Tiglath Pileser came to Judah, but instead of helping, he made things worse. 
2CH.28.21	Ahaz gave him gifts from the 
2CH.28.22	Even after all these terrible things happened to Ahaz, he sinned against the 
2CH.28.23	He said to himself, “The Syrian gods must have helped their kings defeat me. Maybe if I offer sacrifices to those gods, they will help me.” That was the sin that finally led to the downfall of Ahaz, as well as to the destruction of Judah.
2CH.28.24	Ahaz collected all the furnishings of the temple and smashed them to pieces. Then he locked the doors to the temple and set up altars to foreign gods on every street corner in Jerusalem. 
2CH.28.25	In every city and town in Judah he built local shrines
2CH.28.26	Everything else Ahaz did while he was king is written in 
2CH.28.27	 Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs. His son Hezekiah then became king.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	Hezekiah obeyed the 
2CH.29.3	In the first month
2CH.29.4	Then he called the priests and Levites to the east courtyard of the temple 
2CH.29.5	and said:
2CH.29.5	It's time to purify the temple of the 
2CH.29.6	Some of our ancestors were unfaithful and disobeyed the 
2CH.29.7	They locked the doors, then let the lamps go out and stopped burning incense and offering sacrifices to him. 
2CH.29.8	The 
2CH.29.9	our ancestors killed in battle, but our own children and wives were taken captive.
2CH.29.10	So I have decided to renew our agreement with the 
2CH.29.11	Let's not waste any time, my friends. You are the ones who were chosen to be the 
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	When Hezekiah finished talking, the following Levite leaders went to work:
2CH.29.12+2CH.29.13+2CH.29.14	Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohath clan; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merari clan; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershon clan; Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphan clan; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaph clan; Jehuel and Shimei from the Heman clan; Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthun clan.
2CH.29.15	These leaders gathered together the rest of the Levites, and they all went through the ceremony to make themselves clean. Then they began to purify the temple according to the Law of the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the temple and carried out everything that was unclean. They put these things in the courtyard, and from there, the Levites carried them outside the city to Kidron Valley.
2CH.29.17	The priests and Levites began their work on the first day of the first month.
2CH.29.18	they went back to Hezekiah and said:
2CH.29.18	Your Majesty, we have finished our work. The entire temple is now pure again, and so is the altar and its utensils, as well as the table for the sacred loaves of bread and its utensils. 
2CH.29.19	And we have brought back all the things that King Ahaz took from the temple during the time he was unfaithful to God. We purified them and put them back in front of the altar.
2CH.29.20	At once, Hezekiah called together the officials of Jerusalem, and they went to the temple. 
2CH.29.21	They brought with them seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven goats
2CH.29.22	The priests killed the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, then splattered the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	They took the goats to Hezekiah and the worshipers, and they laid their hands on the animals. 
2CH.29.24	The priests then killed the goats and splattered the blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sins of everyone in Israel, because Hezekiah had commanded that these sacrifices be made for all the people of Israel.
2CH.29.25	Next, Hezekiah assigned the Levites to their places in the temple. He gave them cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments, according to the instructions that the 
2CH.29.26	 The Levites were ready to play the instruments that had belonged to David; the priests were ready to blow the trumpets.
2CH.29.27	As soon as Hezekiah gave the signal for the sacrifices to be burned on the altar, the musicians began singing praises to the 
2CH.29.28	and everyone worshiped the 
2CH.29.29	After that, Hezekiah and the crowd of worshipers bowed down and worshiped the 
2CH.29.30	Then Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing the songs of praise that David and Asaph the prophet had written. And so they bowed down and joyfully sang praises to the 
2CH.29.31	Hezekiah said to the crowd, “Now that you are once again acceptable to the 
2CH.29.31	The people did this, and some of them voluntarily brought animals to be offered as sacrifices. 
2CH.29.32	Seventy bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs were brought as sacrifices to please the 
2CH.29.33	600 bulls and 3,000 sheep were brought as sacrifices to ask the 
2CH.29.34	There were not enough priests to skin all these animals, because many of the priests had not taken the time to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean. However, since all the Levites had made themselves clean, they helped the priests until the last animal was skinned. 
2CH.29.35	Besides all the sacrifices that were burned on the altar, the fat from the other animal sacrifices was burned, and the offerings of wine were poured over the altar.
2CH.29.35	So the temple was once again used for worshiping the 
2CH.29.36	Hezekiah and the people of Judah celebrated, because God had helped them make this happen so quickly.
2CH.30.1+2CH.30.2+2CH.30.3+2CH.30.4	Hezekiah sent a message to everyone in Israel and Judah, including those in the territories of Ephraim and West Manasseh, inviting them to the temple in Jerusalem for the celebration of Passover in honor of the 
2CH.30.5	Everyone from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north was invited. This was the largest crowd of people that had ever celebrated Passover, according to the official records.
2CH.30.6	Hezekiah's messengers went everywhere in Israel and Judah with the following letter:
2CH.30.6	People of Israel, now that you have survived the invasion of the Assyrian kings,
2CH.30.7	Don't follow the example of your ancestors and your Israelite relatives in the north. They were unfaithful to the 
2CH.30.8	Don't be stubborn like your ancestors. Decide now to obey the 
2CH.30.9	and the enemies that have captured your families will show pity and send them back home. The 
2CH.30.10	The messengers went to every town in Ephraim and West Manasseh as far north as the territory of Zebulun, but people laughed and insulted them. 
2CH.30.11	Only a few people from the tribes of Asher, West Manasseh, and Zebulun were humble and went to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	God also made everyone in Judah eager to do what Hezekiah and his officials had commanded.
2CH.30.13	In the second month,
2CH.30.14	They took all the foreign altars and incense altars in Jerusalem and threw them into Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15+2CH.30.16+2CH.30.17	Then, on the fourteenth day of that same month, the Levites began killing the lambs for Passover, because many of the worshipers were unclean and were not allowed to kill their own lambs. Meanwhile, some of the priests and Levites felt ashamed because they had not gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean. They immediately went through that ceremony and went to the temple, where they offered sacrifices to please the 
2CH.30.15+2CH.30.16+2CH.30.17	As the Levites killed the lambs, they handed some of the blood to the priests, who splattered it on the altar.
2CH.30.18+2CH.30.19	Most of the people that came from Ephraim, West Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not made themselves clean, but they ignored God's Law and ate the Passover lambs anyway. Hezekiah found out what they had done and prayed, “
2CH.30.20	The 
2CH.30.21	The worshipers in Jerusalem were very happy and celebrated the Festival for seven days. The Levites and priests sang praises to the 
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah thanked the Levites for doing such a good job, leading the celebration.
2CH.30.22	The worshipers celebrated for seven days by offering sacrifices, by eating the sacred meals, and by praising the 
2CH.30.23	Everyone was so excited that they agreed to celebrate seven more days.
2CH.30.24	So Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be offered as sacrifices and to be used as food for the sacred meals. His officials gave 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep, and many more priests agreed to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean. 
2CH.30.25	Everyone was very happy, including those from Judah and Israel, the priests and Levites, and the foreigners living in Judah and Israel. 
2CH.30.26	It was the biggest celebration in Jerusalem since the days of King Solomon, the son of David. 
2CH.30.27	The priests and Levites asked God to bless the people, and from his home in heaven, he did.
2CH.31.1	After the Festival, the people went to every town in Judah and smashed the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred poles
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah divided the priests and Levites into groups, according to their duties. Then he assigned them the responsibilities of offering sacrifices to please the 
2CH.31.3	 Hezekiah provided animals from his own herds and flocks to use for the morning and evening sacrifices, as well as for the sacrifices during the Sabbath celebrations, the New Moon Festivals, and the other religious feasts required by the Law of the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the people heard what the king wanted, they brought a tenth of everything they owned, including their best grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other crops. 
2CH.31.6	The people from the other towns of Judah brought a tenth of their herds and flocks, as well as a tenth of anything they had dedicated to the 
2CH.31.7	The people started bringing their offerings to Jerusalem in the third month,
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and his officials saw these offerings, they thanked the 
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the large amount of offerings. 
2CH.31.10	The high priest at the time was Azariah, a descendant of Zadok, and he replied, “Ever since the people have been bringing us their offerings, we have had more than enough food and supplies. The 
2CH.31.11	So the king gave orders for storerooms to be built in the temple, and when they were completed, 
2CH.31.12+2CH.31.13	all the extra offerings were taken there. Hezekiah and Azariah then appointed Conaniah the Levite to be in charge of these storerooms. His brother Shimei was his assistant, and the following Levites worked with them: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. 
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah was assigned to guard the East Gate, and he was put in charge of receiving the offerings voluntarily given to God and of dividing them among the priests and Levites. 
2CH.31.15+2CH.31.16	He had six assistants who were responsible for seeing that all the priests in the other towns of Judah also got their share of these offerings. They were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah.
2CH.31.15+2CH.31.16	Every priest and every Levite over 30
2CH.31.17	The priests were listed in the official records by clans, and the Levites 20 years old and older were listed by their duties. 
2CH.31.18	The official records also included their wives and children, because they had also been faithful in keeping themselves clean and acceptable to serve the 
2CH.31.19	Hezekiah also appointed other men to take food and supplies to the priests and Levites whose homes were in the pastureland around the towns of Judah. But the priests had to be descendants of Aaron, and the Levites had to be listed in the official records.
2CH.31.20+2CH.31.21	Everything Hezekiah did while he was king of Judah, including what he did for the temple in Jerusalem, was right and good. He was a successful king, because he obeyed the 
2CH.32.1	After King Hezekiah had faithfully obeyed the 
2CH.32.2	As soon as Hezekiah learned that Sennacherib was planning to attack Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3+2CH.32.4	he and his officials worked out a plan to cut off the supply of water outside the city, so that the Assyrians would have no water when they came to attack. The officials got together a large work force that stopped up the springs and streams near Jerusalem.
2CH.32.5	Hezekiah's workers also repaired the broken sections of the city wall. Then they built defense towers and an outer wall to help protect the one already there. The landfill on the east side of David's City was also strengthened.
2CH.32.5	He gave orders to make a large supply of weapons and shields, 
2CH.32.6	and he appointed army commanders over the troops. Then he gathered the troops together in the open area in front of the city gate and said to them:
2CH.32.7	Be brave and confident! There's no reason to be afraid of King Sennacherib and his powerful army. We are much more powerful, 
2CH.32.8	because the 
2CH.32.8	These words encouraged the army of Judah.
2CH.32.9	When Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish, he sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem. It said:
2CH.32.10	I am King Sennacherib of Assyria, and I have Jerusalem surrounded. Do you think you can survive my attack? 
2CH.32.11	Hezekiah your king is telling you that the 
2CH.32.12	Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the 
2CH.32.13	You've heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations. Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us? 
2CH.32.14	None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria. Do you really think your God can do any better? 
2CH.32.15	Don't be fooled by Hezekiah! No god of any nation has ever been able to stand up to Assyria. Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!
2CH.32.16	The Assyrian officials said terrible things about the 
2CH.32.17	Sennacherib's letter even made fun of the 
2CH.32.18	The officials said all these things in Hebrew, so that everyone listening from the city wall would understand and be terrified and surrender. 
2CH.32.19	The officials talked about the 
2CH.32.20	Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz begged the 
2CH.32.21	and he sent an angel that killed every soldier and commander in the Assyrian camp.
2CH.32.21	Sennacherib returned to Assyria, completely disgraced. Then one day he went into the temple of his god where some of his sons killed him.
2CH.32.22	The 
2CH.32.23	People brought offerings to Jerusalem for the 
2CH.32.24	About this same time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. He prayed, and the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah was so proud that he refused to thank the 
2CH.32.26	Hezekiah and the people later felt sorry and asked the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah was very rich, and everyone respected him. He built special rooms to store the silver, the gold, the precious stones and spices, the shields, and the other valuable possessions. 
2CH.32.28	Storehouses were also built for his supply of grain, wine, and olive oil; barns were built for his cattle, and pens were put up for his sheep. 
2CH.32.29	God made Hezekiah extremely rich, so he bought even more sheep, goats, and cattle. And he built towns where he could keep all these animals.
2CH.32.30	It was Hezekiah who built a tunnel that carried the water from Gihon Spring into the city of Jerusalem. In fact, everything he did was successful! 
2CH.32.31	Even when the leaders of Babylonia sent messengers to ask Hezekiah about the sign God had given him, God let Hezekiah give his own answer to test him and to see if he would remain faithful.
2CH.32.32	Everything else Hezekiah did while he was king, including how faithful he was to the 
2CH.32.33	When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the section of the royal tombs that was reserved for the most respected kings,
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 55 years from Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	 Manasseh disobeyed the 
2CH.33.3	He rebuilt the local shrines
2CH.33.4	In the temple, where only the 
2CH.33.5	and the stars. He placed these altars in both courtyards of the temple 
2CH.33.6+2CH.33.7	 and even set up a stone image of a foreign god. Manasseh practiced magic and witchcraft; he asked fortunetellers for advice and sacrificed his own sons in Hinnom Valley. He did many other sinful things and made the 
2CH.33.6+2CH.33.7	Years ago, God had told David and Solomon:
2CH.33.6+2CH.33.7	Jerusalem is the place I prefer above all others in Israel. It belongs to me, and there in the temple I will be worshiped forever. 
2CH.33.8	If my people will faithfully obey all the laws and teaching I gave to my servant Moses, I will never again force them to leave the land I gave to their ancestors.
2CH.33.9	But the people of Judah and Jerusalem listened to Manasseh and did even more sinful things than the nations the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	So he let Assyrian army commanders invade Judah and capture Manasseh. They put a hook in his nose and tied him up in chains, and they took him to Babylon. 
2CH.33.12	While Manasseh was held captive there, he asked the 
2CH.33.13	The 
2CH.33.14	Later, Manasseh rebuilt the eastern section of Jerusalem's outer wall and made it taller. This section went from Gihon Valley north to Fish Gate and around the part of the city called Mount Ophel. He also assigned army officers to each of the fortified cities in Judah.
2CH.33.15	Manasseh also removed the idols and the stone image of the foreign god from the temple, and he gathered the altars he had built near the temple and in other parts of Jerusalem. He threw all these things outside the city. 
2CH.33.16	Then he repaired the 
2CH.33.17	The people obeyed Manasseh, but they worshiped the 
2CH.33.18	Everything else Manasseh did while he was king, including his prayer to the 
2CH.33.19	Hozai
2CH.33.20	Manasseh died and was buried near the palace, and his son Amon became king.
2CH.33.21	Amon was 22 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 2 years. 
2CH.33.22	Amon disobeyed the 
2CH.33.23	Manasseh had turned back to the 
2CH.33.24	Some of Amon's officials plotted against him and killed him in his palace. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of Judah killed the murderers of Amon and made his son Josiah king.
2CH.34.2	He followed the example of his ancestor David and always obeyed the 
2CH.34.3	When Josiah was only 16 years old he began worshiping God, just as his ancestor David had done. Then, 4 years later, he decided to destroy the local shrines
2CH.34.4	 He watched as the altars for the worship of the god Baal were torn down, and as the nearby incense altars were smashed. The Asherah poles, the idols, and the stone images were also smashed, and the pieces were scattered over the graves of their worshipers. 
2CH.34.5	 Josiah then had the bones of the pagan priests burned on the altars.
2CH.34.5	And so Josiah got rid of the worship of foreign gods in Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	He did the same things in the towns and ruined villages
2CH.34.7	Everywhere in the northern kingdom of Israel, Josiah tore down pagan altars and Asherah poles; he crushed idols to dust and smashed incense altars.
2CH.34.7	Then Josiah went back to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of Josiah's rule in Judah, after he had removed all the sinful things from the land and from the 
2CH.34.9	These three men went to Hilkiah the high priest. They gave him the money that the Levite guards had collected from the people of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and the rest of Israel, as well as those living in Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	Then the money was turned over to the men who supervised the repairs to the temple. They used some of it to pay the workers, 
2CH.34.11	and they gave the rest of it to the carpenters and builders, who used it to buy the stone and wood they needed to repair the other buildings that Judah's kings had not taken care of.
2CH.34.12	The workers were honest, and their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah from the Levite clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Levite clan of Kohath. Other Levites, who were all skilled musicians, 
2CH.34.13	were in charge of carrying supplies and supervising the workers. Other Levites were appointed to stand guard around the temple.
2CH.34.14	While the money was being given to these supervisors, Hilkiah found the book that contained the laws that the 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah handed the book to Shaphan the official and said, “Look what I found here in the temple—
2CH.34.16	Shaphan took the book to Josiah and reported, “Your officials are doing everything you wanted. 
2CH.34.17	They have collected the money from the temple and have given it to the men supervising the repairs. 
2CH.34.18	But there's something else, Your Majesty. The priest Hilkiah gave me this book.” Then Shaphan read it aloud.
2CH.34.19	When Josiah heard what was in 
2CH.34.20	At once he called together Hilkiah, Shaphan, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah,
2CH.34.21	“The 
2CH.34.22	Hilkiah and the four other men left at once and went to talk with Huldah the prophet. Her husband was Shallum,
2CH.34.23	she said:
2CH.34.23	You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the 
2CH.34.24	“Josiah, I am the 
2CH.34.25	The people of Judah and Israel have rejected me. They have offered sacrifices to foreign gods and have worshiped their own idols. I can't stand it any longer. I am furious.
2CH.34.26+2CH.34.27	“Josiah, listen to what I am going to do. I noticed how sad you were when you heard that this country and its people would be completely wiped out. You even tore your clothes in sorrow, and I heard you cry. 
2CH.34.28	So before I destroy this place, I will let you die in peace.”
2CH.34.28	The men left and reported to Josiah what Huldah had said.
2CH.34.29	King Josiah called together the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	Then he went to the 
2CH.34.30	Finally, when everybody was there, he read aloud 
2CH.34.31	After Josiah had finished reading, he stood in the place reserved for the king. He promised in the 
2CH.34.32	Then he asked the people of Jerusalem and Benjamin to make that same promise and to obey the God their ancestors had worshiped.
2CH.34.33	Josiah destroyed all the idols in the territories of Israel, and he commanded everyone in Israel to worship only the 
2CH.35.1	Josiah commanded that Passover be celebrated in Jerusalem to honor the 
2CH.35.2	On that day, Josiah made sure the priests knew what duties they were to do in the temple. 
2CH.35.3	He called together the Levites who served the 
2CH.35.3	No longer will you have to carry the sacred chest from place to place. It will stay in the temple built by King Solomon son of David, where you will serve the 
2CH.35.4	 Get ready to do the work that David and Solomon assigned to you, according to your clans. 
2CH.35.5	Divide yourselves into groups, then arrange yourselves throughout the temple so that each family of worshipers will be able to get help from one of you.
2CH.35.6	When the people bring you their Passover lamb, you must kill it and prepare it to be sacrificed to the 
2CH.35.7	Josiah donated 30,000 sheep and goats, and 3,000 bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices. 
2CH.35.8	Josiah's officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people, the priests, and the Levites as sacrifices. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were the officials in charge of the temple, gave the priests 2,600 sheep and lambs and 300 bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah, his two brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad were leaders of the Levites, and they gave the other Levites 5,000 sheep and goats, and 500 bulls to offer as sacrifices.
2CH.35.10	When everything was ready to celebrate Passover, the priests and the Levites stood where Josiah had told them. 
2CH.35.11	Then the Levites killed and skinned the Passover lambs, and they handed some of the blood to the priests, who splattered it on the altar. 
2CH.35.12	The Levites set aside the parts of the animal that the worshipers needed for their sacrifices to please the 
2CH.35.13	 They sacrificed the Passover animals on the altar and boiled the meat for the other offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. Then they quickly handed the meat to the people so they could eat it.
2CH.35.14	All day long, the priests were busy offering sacrifices and burning the animals' fat on the altar. And when everyone had finished, the Levites prepared Passover animals for themselves and for the priests.
2CH.35.16	So on that day, Passover was celebrated to honor the 
2CH.35.17	 The worshipers then celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread for the next seven days.
2CH.35.18	People from Jerusalem and from towns all over Judah and Israel were there. Passover had not been observed like this since the days of Samuel the prophet. In fact, this was the greatest Passover celebration in Israel's history! 
2CH.35.19	All these things happened in the eighteenth year of Josiah's rule in Judah.
2CH.35.20	Some time later, King Neco of Egypt led his army to the city of Carchemish on the Euphrates River. And Josiah led his troops north to meet the Egyptians in battle.
2CH.35.21	Neco sent the following message to Josiah:
2CH.35.21	I'm not attacking you, king of Judah! We're not even at war. But God has told me to quickly attack my enemy. God is on my side, so if you try to stop me, he will punish you.
2CH.35.22	But Josiah ignored Neco's warning, even though it came from God! Instead, he disguised himself and marched into battle against Neco in the valley near Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	During the battle an Egyptian soldier shot Josiah with an arrow. Josiah told his servants, “Get me out of here! I've been hit.” 
2CH.35.24	They carried Josiah out of his chariot, then put him in the other chariot he had there and took him back to Jerusalem, where he soon died. He was buried beside his ancestors, and everyone in Judah and Jerusalem mourned his death.
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah the prophet wrote a funeral song in honor of Josiah. And since then, anyone in Judah who mourns the death of Josiah sings that song. It is included in the collection of funeral songs.
2CH.35.26	Everything else Josiah did while he was king, including how he faithfully obeyed the 
2CH.35.27	is written in 
2CH.36.1	After the death of Josiah, the people of Judah crowned his son Jehoahaz their new king. 
2CH.36.2	He was 23 years old at the time, and he ruled only 3 months from Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	King Neco of Egypt captured Jehoahaz and forced Judah to pay 3.4 tons of silver and 34 kilograms of gold as taxes. 
2CH.36.4	 Then Neco appointed Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim king of Judah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He led Jehoahaz away to Egypt as his prisoner.
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried off many of the valuable things in the 
2CH.36.8	Everything else Jehoiakim did while he was king, including all the disgusting and evil things, is written in 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was 18 years
2CH.36.10	 In the spring of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had Jehoiachin arrested and taken to Babylon, along with more of the valuable items in the temple. Then Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah king of Judah.
2CH.36.12	He disobeyed the 
2CH.36.14	The people of Judah and even the priests who were their leaders became more unfaithful. They followed the disgusting example of the nations around them and made the 
2CH.36.15	But the 
2CH.36.16	But the people only laughed and insulted these prophets. They ignored what the 
2CH.36.18	Nebuchadnezzar carried off everything that was left in the temple; he robbed the treasury and the personal storerooms of the king and his officials. He took everything back to Babylon.
2CH.36.20	The survivors were taken to Babylonia as prisoners, where they were slaves of the king and his sons, until Persia became a powerful nation.
2CH.36.22	In the first year that Cyrus was king of Persia,
2CH.36.23	 The message said:
2CH.36.23	I am King Cyrus of Persia.
2CH.36.23	The 
EZR.1.2+EZR.1.3	The 
EZR.1.4	Everyone else must provide what is needed. They must give money, supplies, and animals, as well as gifts for rebuilding God's temple.
EZR.1.5	Many people felt that the 
EZR.1.6	The others helped by giving silver articles, gold, personal possessions, cattle, and other valuable gifts, as well as offerings for the temple.
EZR.1.7	King Cyrus gave back the things that Nebuchadnezzar
EZR.1.8	Cyrus placed Mithredath, his chief treasurer, in charge of these things. Mithredath counted them and gave a list to Sheshbazzar, the governor of Judah. 
EZR.1.9+EZR.1.10	Included among them were: 30 large gold dishes; 1,000 large silver dishes; 29 other dishes;

EZR.2.59+EZR.2.60	There were 652 who returned from the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, though they could not prove that they were Israelites. They had lived in the Babylonian towns of Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer.
EZR.2.61+EZR.2.62	The families of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai could not prove that they were priests. The ancestor of the family of Barzillai had married the daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and had taken his wife's family name.

EZR.3.1	During the seventh month
EZR.3.2	 The priest Joshua son of Jozadak, together with the other priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his relatives rebuilt the altar of Israel's God. Then they were able to offer sacrifices there by following the instructions God had given to Moses, the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	 And they built the altar where it had stood before,
EZR.3.5	 They offered sacrifices to please the 
EZR.3.6	Although work on the temple itself had not yet begun, the people started offering sacrifices on the 
EZR.3.7	King Cyrus of Persia had said the Israelites could have cedar trees brought from Lebanon to Joppa by sea. So they sent grain, wine, and olive oil to the cities of Tyre and Sidon as payment for these trees, and they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters.
EZR.3.8	During the second month
EZR.3.9	The Levites in charge of the whole project were Joshua and his sons and relatives and Kadmiel and his sons from the family of Hodaviah.
EZR.3.11	 They praised the 
EZR.3.11	“The 
EZR.3.11	His faithful love for Israel
EZR.3.11	will last forever.”
EZR.3.11	Everyone started shouting and praising the 
EZR.3.12	 Many of the older priests and Levites and the heads of families wept bitterly because they remembered seeing the first temple years before. But others were so happy that they celebrated with joyful shouts. 
EZR.3.13	Their shouting and crying were so noisy that it all sounded alike and could be heard a long way off.
EZR.4.1	The enemies of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people had come back to rebuild the temple of the 
EZR.4.2	 So they went to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders and said, “Let us help! Ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the family leaders answered, “You cannot take part in building a temple for the 
EZR.4.4	Then the neighboring people began to do everything possible to frighten the Jews
EZR.4.5	During the time that Cyrus was king and even until Darius
EZR.4.7	Later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their advisors got together and wrote a letter to Artaxerxes when he was king of Persia.
EZR.4.11	This letter said:
EZR.4.11	Your Majesty King Artaxerxes, we are your servants from everywhere in Western Province, and we send you our greetings.
EZR.4.12	You should know that the Jews who left your country have moved back to Jerusalem and are now rebuilding that rebellious city. In fact, they have almost finished rebuilding the walls and repairing the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	You should also know that if the walls are completed and the city is rebuilt, the Jews won't pay any kind of taxes, and there will be less money in your treasury.
EZR.4.14	We are telling you this, because you have done so much for us, and we want everyone to respect you. 
EZR.4.15	If you look up the official records of your ancestors, you will find that Jerusalem has constantly rebelled and has led others to rebel against kings and provinces. That's why the city was destroyed in the first place. 
EZR.4.16	If Jerusalem is rebuilt and its walls completed, you will no longer have control over Western Province.
EZR.4.17	King Artaxerxes answered:
EZR.4.17	Greetings to Governor Rehum, Secretary Shimshai, and to your advisors in Samaria and other parts of Western Province.
EZR.4.18	After your letter was translated and read to me, 
EZR.4.19	I had the old records checked. It is true that for years Jerusalem has rebelled and caused trouble for other kings and nations. 
EZR.4.20	And powerful kings have ruled Western Province from Jerusalem and have collected all kinds of taxes.
EZR.4.21	I want you to command the people to stop rebuilding the city until I give further notice. 
EZR.4.22	Do this at once, so that no harm will come to the kingdom.
EZR.4.23	As soon as this letter was read, Governor Rehum, Secretary Shimshai, and their advisors went to Jerusalem and forced everyone to stop rebuilding the city.
EZR.5.2	 So Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the priest urged the people to start working on the temple again, and God's prophets encouraged them.
EZR.5.3	Governor Tattenai of Western Province and his assistant Shethar Bozenai got together with some of their officials. Then they went to Jerusalem and said to the people, “Who told you to rebuild this temple? 
EZR.5.4	Give us the names of the workers!”
EZR.5.5	But God was looking after the Jewish leaders. So the governor and his group decided not to make the people stop working on the temple until they could report to Darius and get his advice.
EZR.5.6	Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisors sent a report to Darius, 
EZR.5.7	which said:
EZR.5.7	King Darius, we wish you the best! 
EZR.5.8	We went to Judah, where the temple of the great God is being built with huge stones and wooden beams set in the walls. Everyone is working hard, and the building is going up quickly.
EZR.5.9	We asked those in charge to tell us who gave them permission to rebuild the temple. 
EZR.5.10	We also asked for the names of their leaders, so that we could write them down for you.
EZR.5.11	They claimed to be servants of the God who rules heaven and earth. And they said they were rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago by one of Israel's greatest kings.
EZR.5.13+EZR.5.14+EZR.5.15	 took its gold and silver articles, and put them in the temple of his own god in Babylon.
EZR.5.13+EZR.5.14+EZR.5.15	They also said that during the first year Cyrus was king of Babylonia,
EZR.5.16	Sheshbazzar then went to Jerusalem and laid the foundation for the temple, and the work is still going on.
EZR.5.17	Your Majesty, please order someone to look up the old records in Babylonia and find out if King Cyrus really did give orders to rebuild God's temple in Jerusalem. We will do whatever you think we should.
EZR.6.1	King Darius ordered someone to go through the old records kept in Babylonia. 
EZR.6.2	Finally, a scroll
EZR.6.2	This official record will show 
EZR.6.3	that in the first year Cyrus was king, he gave orders to rebuild God's temple in Jerusalem, so that sacrifices and offerings could be presented there.
EZR.6.4	with one
EZR.6.5	Then the gold and silver things that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple and brought to Babylonia are to be returned to their proper places.
EZR.6.6	King Darius sent this message:
EZR.6.6	Governor Tattenai of Western Province and Shethar Bozenai, you and your advisors must stay away from the temple. 
EZR.6.7	Let the Jewish governor and leaders rebuild it where it stood before. And stop slowing them down!
EZR.6.8	Starting at once, I am ordering you to help the leaders by paying their expenses from the tax money collected in Western Province. 
EZR.6.9	And don't fail to let the priests in Jerusalem have whatever they need each day so they can offer sacrifices to the God of heaven. Give them young bulls, rams, sheep, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil. 
EZR.6.10	I want them to be able to offer pleasing sacrifices to God and to pray for me and my family.
EZR.6.11	If any of you don't obey this order, a wooden beam will be taken from your house and sharpened on one end. Then it will be driven through your body,
EZR.6.12	I ask the God who is worshiped in Jerusalem to destroy any king or nation who tries either to change what I have said or to tear down his temple. I, Darius, give these orders, and I expect them to be followed carefully.
EZR.6.13	Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisors carefully obeyed King Darius. 
EZR.6.14	 With great success the Jewish leaders continued working on the temple, while Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them by their preaching. And so, the temple was completed at the command of the God of Israel and by the orders of kings Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes of Persia.
EZR.6.15	On the third day of the month of Adar
EZR.6.16	The people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned from exile were happy and celebrated as they dedicated God's temple. 
EZR.6.17	One hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs were offered as sacrifices at the dedication. Also twelve goats were sacrificed as sin offerings for the twelve tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	Then the priests and Levites were assigned their duties in God's temple in Jerusalem, according to the instructions Moses had written.
EZR.6.20	The priests and Levites had gone through a ceremony to make themselves acceptable to lead in worship. Then some of them killed Passover lambs for those who had returned, including the other priests and themselves.
EZR.6.21	The sacrifices were eaten by the Israelites who had returned and by the neighboring people who had given up the sinful customs of other nations in order to worship the 
EZR.6.22	For seven days they celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread. Everyone was happy because the 
EZR.7.1+EZR.7.2+EZR.7.3+EZR.7.4+EZR.7.5+EZR.7.6	Much later, when Artaxerxes
EZR.7.1+EZR.7.2+EZR.7.3+EZR.7.4+EZR.7.5+EZR.7.6	Ezra was an expert in the Law that the 
EZR.7.7	Other Jews, including priests, Levites, musicians, the temple guards, and servants, came to Jerusalem with Ezra. This happened during the seventh year that Artaxerxes
EZR.7.8+EZR.7.9	God helped Ezra, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month
EZR.7.10	Ezra had spent his entire life studying and obeying the Law of the 
EZR.7.11	Ezra was a priest and an expert in the laws and commands that the 
EZR.7.13+EZR.7.14	Any of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom may go with you to Jerusalem if they want to. My seven advisors and I agree that you may go to Jerusalem and Judah to find out if
EZR.7.15	When you go, take the silver and gold that I and my advisors are freely giving to the God of Israel, whose temple is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.16	Take the silver and gold that you collect from everywhere in Babylonia. Also take the gifts that your own people and priests have so willingly contributed for the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.17	Use the money carefully to buy the best bulls, rams, lambs, grain, and wine. Then sacrifice them on the altar at God's temple in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	If any silver or gold is left, you and your people may use it for whatever pleases your God. 
EZR.7.19	Give your God the other articles that have been contributed for use in his temple. 
EZR.7.20	If you need to get anything else for the temple, you may have the money you need from the royal treasury.
EZR.7.21	Ezra, you are a priest and an expert in the laws of the God of heaven, and I order all treasurers in Western Province to do their very best to help you. 
EZR.7.22	They will be allowed to give as much as 3.4 tons of silver, 10 tons of wheat, 2,000 liters of wine, 2,000 liters of olive oil, and all the salt you need.
EZR.7.23	They must provide whatever the God of heaven demands for his temple, so that he won't be angry with me and with the kings who rule after me. 
EZR.7.24	We want you to know that no priests, Levites, musicians, guards, temple servants, or any other temple workers will have to pay any kind of taxes.
EZR.7.25	Ezra, use the wisdom God has given you and choose officials and leaders to govern the people of Western Province. These leaders should know God's laws and have them taught to anyone who doesn't know them. 
EZR.7.26	Everyone who fails to obey God's Law or the king's law will be punished without pity. They will either be executed or put in prison or forced to leave their country, or have all they own taken away.
EZR.7.27	Because King Artaxerxes was so kind, Ezra said:
EZR.7.27	Praise the 
EZR.7.28	God has told the king, his advisors, and his powerful officials to treat me with kindness. The 
EZR.8.1	Artaxerxes was king of Persia when I

EZR.8.15	I
EZR.8.16	So I sent for the leaders Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were very wise counselors. 
EZR.8.17	Then I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia,
EZR.8.18	God was kind to us and caused them to send a skillful man named Sherebiah, who was a Levite from the family of Mahli. Eighteen of his relatives came with him. 
EZR.8.19	We were also sent Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the family of Merari along with 20 of their relatives. 
EZR.8.20	In addition, 220 others came to help the Levites in the temple. The ancestors of these workers had been chosen years ago by King David
EZR.8.21	Beside the Ahava River,
EZR.8.22	I was ashamed to ask the king to send soldiers and cavalry to protect us against enemies along the way. After all, we had told the king that our God takes care of everyone who truly worships him, but that he gets very angry and punishes anyone who refuses to obey. 
EZR.8.23	So we went without food and asked God himself to protect us, and he answered our prayers.
EZR.8.24	I
EZR.8.25+EZR.8.26+EZR.8.27	Then I weighed the gifts that had been given for God's temple, and I divided them among the twelve priests I had chosen. There were gifts of silver and gold, as well as the articles that the king, his advisors and officials, and the people of Israel had contributed. In all there were: 22 tons of silver; 100 silver articles weighing 70 kilograms; 3.4 tons of gold; 20 gold bowls weighing over 8 kilograms; and 2 polished bronze articles as valuable as gold.
EZR.8.28	I said to the priests:
EZR.8.28	You belong to the 
EZR.8.29	Be sure to guard them and keep them safe until you reach Jerusalem. Then weigh them inside God's temple in the presence of the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the Israelite families.
EZR.8.30	The priests and Levites then took charge of the gifts that had been weighed, so they could take them to the temple of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	On the twelfth day of the first month,
EZR.8.32	After arriving in Jerusalem, we rested for three days. 
EZR.8.33	Then on the fourth day we went to God's temple, where the silver, the gold, and the other things were weighed and given to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah. With him were Eleazar son of Phinehas and the two Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	Everything was counted, weighed, and recorded.
EZR.8.35	Those who had returned from exile offered sacrifices on the altar to the God of Israel. Twelve bulls were offered for all Israel. Ninety-six rams and 77 lambs
EZR.8.36	Some of those who had returned took the king's orders to the governors and officials in Western Province. Then the officials did what they could for the people and for the temple of God.
EZR.9.1	Later the Jewish leaders came to me
EZR.9.1	Many Israelites, including priests and Levites, are living just like the people around them. They are even guilty of some of the horrible sins of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
EZR.9.2	Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing. Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin, and now God's holy people are mixed with foreigners.
EZR.9.3	This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard. Then I just sat in shock 
EZR.9.4	until the time for the evening sacrifice. Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me, because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners.
EZR.9.5	At the time of the evening sacrifice, I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn. So I got down on my knees, then lifted my arms, 
EZR.9.6	and prayed:
EZR.9.6	I am much too ashamed to face you, 
EZR.9.7	Since the time of our ancestors, all of us have sinned. That's why we, our kings, and our priests have often been defeated by other kings. They have killed some of us and made slaves of others; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed, just as we are today.
EZR.9.8	But for now, 
EZR.9.9	We are slaves, but you have never turned your back on us. You love us, and because of you, the kings of Persia have helped us. It's as though you have given us new life! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	Our God, what can we say now? Even after all this, we have disobeyed the commands 
EZR.9.11	that were given to us by your servants the prophets. They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people, who never stop doing disgusting things.
EZR.9.12	 And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters.
EZR.9.12	Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace. You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land, then someday to leave it to our children forever.
EZR.9.13	You punished us because of our terrible sins. But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve, and you have brought some of us back home. 
EZR.9.14	Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all! 
EZR.9.15	 God of Israel, you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive. But once again, our sins have made us ashamed to face you.
EZR.10.1	While Ezra was down on his knees in front of God's temple, praying with tears in his eyes and confessing the sins of the people of Israel, a large number of men, women, and children gathered around him and cried bitterly.
EZR.10.2	Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said:
EZR.10.2	Ezra, we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women. But there is still hope for the people of Israel, 
EZR.10.3	if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God. We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away, together with their children.
EZR.10.4	Ezra, it's up to you to do something! We will support whatever you do. So be brave!
EZR.10.5	Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra left God's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He felt sorry because of what the people had done, and he did not eat or drink a thing.
EZR.10.7+EZR.10.8	The officials and leaders sent a message to all who had returned from Babylonia and were now living in Jerusalem and Judah. This message told them to meet in Jerusalem within three days, or else they would lose everything they owned and would no longer be considered part of the people that had returned from Babylonia.
EZR.10.9	Three days later, on the twentieth day of the ninth month,
EZR.10.10	Ezra the priest stood up and said:
EZR.10.10	You have broken God's Law by marrying foreign women, and you have made the whole nation guilty! 
EZR.10.11	Now you must confess your sins to the 
EZR.10.12	Everyone in the crowd shouted:
EZR.10.12	You're right! We will do what you say. 
EZR.10.13	But there are so many of us, and we can't just stay out here in this downpour. A lot of us have sinned by marrying foreign women, and the matter can't be settled in only a day or two.
EZR.10.14	Why can't our officials stay on in Jerusalem and take care of this for us? Let everyone who has sinned in this way meet here at a certain time with leaders and judges from their own towns. If we take care of this problem, God will surely stop being so terribly angry with us.
EZR.10.15	Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were the only ones who objected, except for the two Levites, Meshullam and Shabbethai.
EZR.10.16	Everyone else who had returned from exile agreed with the plan. So Ezra the priest chose men
EZR.10.17	and they did not finish until the first day of the first month
EZR.10.18+EZR.10.19	Here is a list of the priests who had agreed to divorce their foreign wives and to sacrifice a ram as a sin offering:
EZR.10.18+EZR.10.19	Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah from the family of Joshua son of Jozadak and his brothers; 
EZR.10.20	Hanani and Zebadiah from the family of Immer; 
EZR.10.21	Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah from the family of Harim; 
EZR.10.22	Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah from the family of Pashhur.
EZR.10.23	Those Levites who had foreign wives were: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	Eliashib, the musician, had a foreign wife.
EZR.10.24	These temple guards had foreign wives:
EZR.10.24	Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	Here is a list of the others from Israel who had foreign wives:
EZR.10.25	Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Hashabiah,
EZR.10.26	Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah from the family of Elam;
EZR.10.27	Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza from the family of Zattu;
EZR.10.28	Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai from the family of Bebai;
EZR.10.29	Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth from the family of Bani;
EZR.10.30	Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh from the family of Pahath Moab;
EZR.10.31+EZR.10.32	Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah from the family of Harim;
EZR.10.33	Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei from the family of Hashum;
EZR.10.34+EZR.10.35+EZR.10.36+EZR.10.37	Maadai, Amram, Uel, Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu from the family of Bani;
EZR.10.38+EZR.10.39+EZR.10.40+EZR.10.41+EZR.10.42	Shimei, Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph from the family of Binnui;
EZR.10.43	Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah from the family of Nebo.
EZR.10.44	These men divorced their foreign wives, then sent them and their children away.
NEH.1.1	I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and in this book I tell what I have done.
NEH.1.1	During the month of Chislev
NEH.1.2	when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah. So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped
NEH.1.3	They told me, “Those captives who have come back are having all kinds of troubles. They are terribly disgraced, Jerusalem's walls are broken down, and its gates have been burned.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard this, I sat down on the ground and cried. Then for several days, I mourned; I went without eating to show my sorrow, and I prayed:
NEH.1.6	I am your servant, so please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you. I, my family, and the rest of your people have sinned 
NEH.1.7	by choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses.
NEH.1.9	 But you also said that no matter how far away we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws. Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshiped.
NEH.1.10	Our 
NEH.1.11	Please answer my prayer and the prayer of your other servants who gladly honor your name. When I serve the king his wine today, make him pleased with me and let him do what I ask.
NEH.2.1	During the month of Nisan
NEH.2.2	So the king said, “Why do you look so sad? You're not sick. Something must be bothering you.”
NEH.2.2	Even though I was frightened, 
NEH.2.3	 I answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burned down.”
NEH.2.4	The king asked, “What do you want me to do?”
NEH.2.4	I prayed to the God who rules from heaven. 
NEH.2.5	Then I told the king, “Sir, if it's all right with you, please send me back to Judah, so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.”
NEH.2.6	The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me, “How long will it take, and when will you be back?” The king agreed to let me go, and I told him when I would return.
NEH.2.7	Then I asked, “Your Majesty, would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the Euphrates River, so that I can travel safely to Judah? 
NEH.2.8	I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live. And so, I would appreciate a letter to Asaph, who is in charge of the royal forest.” God was good to me, and the king did everything I asked.
NEH.2.9	The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me, and as I traveled through the Western Provinces, I gave the letters to the governors. 
NEH.2.10	But when Sanballat from Horon
NEH.2.11	Three days after arriving in Jerusalem, 
NEH.2.12	I got up during the night and left my house. I took some men with me, without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city. The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on. 
NEH.2.13	I went through Valley Gate on the west, then south past Dragon Spring, before coming to Garbage Gate. As I rode along, I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burned. 
NEH.2.14	On the east side of the city, I headed north to Fountain Gate and King's Pool, but then the trail became too narrow for my donkey. 
NEH.2.15	So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there. Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate.
NEH.2.16	None of the city officials knew what I had in mind. And I had not even told any of the Jews—not the priests, the leaders, the officials, or any other Jews who would be helping in the work. 
NEH.2.17	But when I got back, I said to them, “Jerusalem is truly in a mess! The gates have been torn down and burned, and everything is in ruins. We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city.”
NEH.2.18	Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said.
NEH.2.18	Immediately, they replied, “Let's start building now!” So they got everything ready.
NEH.2.19	When Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans, they started insulting us and saying, “Just look at you! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king?”
NEH.2.20	I answered, “We are servants of the God who rules from heaven, and he will make our work succeed. So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem, but you have no right to any of its property, because you have had no part in its history.”
NEH.3.1	These are the people who helped rebuild the wall and gates of Jerusalem:
NEH.3.1	The high priest Eliashib and the other priests rebuilt Sheep Gate and hung its doors. Then they dedicated Sheep Gate and the section of the wall as far as Hundred Tower and Hananel Tower.
NEH.3.2	The people of Jericho rebuilt the next section of the wall, and Zaccur son of Imri rebuilt the section after that.
NEH.3.3	The family of Hassenaah built Fish Gate. They put the beams in place and hung the doors, then they added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks.
NEH.3.4	Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, completed the next section of the wall.
NEH.3.4	Meshullam, son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, rebuilt the next section, and Zadok son of Baana rebuilt the section beside that.
NEH.3.5	The next section was to be repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their town leaders refused to do the hard work they were assigned.
NEH.3.6	Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah restored Ancient Gate. They put the beams in place, hung the doors, and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. 
NEH.3.7	Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men from Gibeon and Mizpah rebuilt the next section of the wall. This section reached as far as the house of the governor of West Euphrates Province.
NEH.3.8	Uzziel son of Harhaiah the goldsmith rebuilt the next section.
NEH.3.8	Hananiah the perfume maker rebuilt the section next after that, and it went as far as Broad Wall.
NEH.3.9	Rephaiah son of Hur ruled half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall.
NEH.3.10	The section after that was close to the home of Jedaiah son of Harumaph, and he rebuilt it.
NEH.3.10	Hattush son of Hashabneiah constructed the next section of the wall.
NEH.3.11	Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath Moab rebuilt the section after that, and they also built Oven Tower.
NEH.3.12	Shallum son of Hallohesh ruled the other half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. Shallum's daughters also worked with him.
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the people who lived in the town of Zanoah rebuilt Valley Gate. They hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. They also rebuilt the wall for 440 meters, all the way to Garbage Gate.
NEH.3.14	Malchijah son of Rechab ruled the district of Beth-Haccherem, and he rebuilt Garbage Gate. He hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks.
NEH.3.15	Shallum
NEH.3.16	Nehemiah son of Azbuk ruled half of the district of Beth-Zur, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. It went as far as the royal cemetery,
NEH.3.17	The Levites who worked on the next sections of the wall were Rehum son of Bani; Hashabiah, who ruled half of the district of Keilah and did this work for his district; 
NEH.3.18	Binnui
NEH.3.19	Ezer son of Jeshua, who ruled Mizpah, rebuilt the section of the wall that was in front of the armory and reached to the corner of the wall; 
NEH.3.20	Baruch son of Zabbai eagerly rebuilt the section of the wall that went all the way to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest; 
NEH.3.21	Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built up to the far end of Eliashib's house.
NEH.3.22	Here is a list of the priests who worked on the wall:
NEH.3.22	Priests from the region around Jerusalem rebuilt the next section of the wall.
NEH.3.23	Benjamin and Hasshub rebuilt the wall in front of their own houses.
NEH.3.23	Azariah, who was the son of Maaseiah and the grandson of Ananiah, rebuilt the section in front of his house.
NEH.3.24	Binnui son of Henadad rebuilt the section of the wall from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall.
NEH.3.25	Palal son of Uzai rebuilt the next section, which began at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard.
NEH.3.25	Pedaiah son of Parosh rebuilt the next section of the wall. 
NEH.3.26	He stopped at a place near the Water Gate on the east and the tower guarding the temple. This was close to a section in the city called Ophel, where the temple workers lived.
NEH.3.27	The men from Tekoa rebuilt the next section of the wall, and it was their second section.
NEH.3.28	Some priests rebuilt the next section of the wall. They began working north of Horse Gate, and each one worked on a section in front of his own house.
NEH.3.29	Zadok son of Immer rebuilt the wall in front of his house.
NEH.3.29	Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, who looked after the East Gate, rebuilt the section after that.
NEH.3.30	Hananiah and Hanun
NEH.3.30	Meshullam son of Berechiah rebuilt the next section, which happened to be in front of his house.
NEH.3.31	Malchijah, a goldsmith, rebuilt the next section, as far as the house used by the temple workers and merchants. This area was across from Gathering Gate, near the room on top of the wall at the northeast corner.
NEH.3.32	The goldsmiths and merchants rebuilt the last section of the wall, which went from the corner room all the way to Sheep Gate.
NEH.4.1	When Sanballat, the governor of Samaria, heard that we were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, he became angry and started insulting our people. 
NEH.4.2	In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said, “What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones?”
NEH.4.3	Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said, “Look at the wall they are building! Why, even a fox could knock over this pile of stones.”
NEH.4.4	But I prayed, “Our God, these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us. Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war. 
NEH.4.5	Don't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders.”
NEH.4.6	The people worked hard, and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again. 
NEH.4.7	But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired. So they became angry 
NEH.4.8	and decided to stir up trouble, and to fight against the people of Jerusalem. 
NEH.4.9	But we kept on praying to our God, and we also stationed guards day and night.
NEH.4.10	Meanwhile, the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song:
NEH.4.10	“So much rubble for us to haul!
NEH.4.10	Worn out and weary,
NEH.4.10	will we ever finish this wall?”
NEH.4.11	Our enemies were saying, “Before those Jews know what has happened, we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work.”
NEH.4.12	On at least ten different occasions, the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side,
NEH.4.13	and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it. I placed them according to families, and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows. 
NEH.4.14	Then I looked things over and told the leaders, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of your enemies! The Lord is great and fearsome. So think of him and fight for your relatives and children, your wives and homes!”
NEH.4.15	Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us, but God kept them from doing what they had planned. So we went back to work on the wall.
NEH.4.16	From then on, I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard. They wore armor and had spears and shields, as well as bows and arrows. The leaders helped the workers 
NEH.4.17	who were rebuilding the wall. Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon. 
NEH.4.18	Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword. The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me.
NEH.4.19	I told the people and their officials and leaders, “Our work is so spread out, that we are a long way from one another. 
NEH.4.20	If you hear the sound of the trumpet, come quickly and gather around me. Our God will help us fight.”
NEH.4.21	Every day from dawn to dark, half of the workers rebuilt the walls, while the rest stood guard with their spears.
NEH.4.22	I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night. So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day. 
NEH.4.23	I even slept in my work clothes at night; my relatives, the workers, and the guards slept in theirs as well. And we always kept our weapons close by.
NEH.5.1	Some of the men and their wives complained about the Jews in power 
NEH.5.2	and said, “We have large families, and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep us alive.”
NEH.5.3	Others said, “During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to them in order to buy grain.”
NEH.5.4	Then others said, “We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.”
NEH.5.6	When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry. 
NEH.5.7	 So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, “How can you charge your own people interest?”
NEH.5.7	Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders 
NEH.5.8	by saying, “We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!” The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true.
NEH.5.9	I continued, “What you have done is wrong! We must honor our God by the way we live, so the Gentiles can't find fault with us. 
NEH.5.10	My relatives, my friends, and I are also lending money and grain, but we must no longer demand payment in return. 
NEH.5.11	Now give back the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid.”
NEH.5.12	The leaders answered, “We will do whatever you say and return their property, without asking to be repaid.”
NEH.5.12	So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property. 
NEH.5.13	Then I emptied my pockets and said, “If you don't keep your promise, that's what God will do to you. He will empty out everything you own, even taking away your houses.”
NEH.5.13	The people answered, “We will keep our promise.” Then they praised the 
NEH.5.14	I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes
NEH.5.15	Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day. Even their officials had been a burden to the people. But I respected God, and I didn't think it was right to be so hard on them. 
NEH.5.16	I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property. Everyone working for me did the same thing. 
NEH.5.17	I usually fed 150 of our own Jewish people and their leaders, as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands. 
NEH.5.18	Each day one ox, six of the best sheep, and lots of chickens were prepared. Then every ten days, a large supply of wine was brought in. I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people, and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor.
NEH.5.19	I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people.
NEH.6.1	Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learned that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates. 
NEH.6.2	Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way. 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to tell them, “My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit with you.” 
NEH.6.4	They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go.
NEH.6.5	Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter, 
NEH.6.6	which said:
NEH.6.6	A rumor is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem
NEH.6.7	You even have prophets in Jerusalem, claiming you are now the king of Judah. You know the Persian king will hear about this, so let's get together and talk it over.
NEH.6.8	I sent a message back to Sanballat, saying, “None of this is true! You are making it all up.”
NEH.6.9	Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work. But I asked God to give me strength.
NEH.6.10	One day I went to visit Shemaiah.
NEH.6.11	I answered, “Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life? I won't go!”
NEH.6.12	Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message. But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me 
NEH.6.13	and to frighten me into doing something wrong, because they wanted to ruin my good name.
NEH.6.14	Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done. I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who, together with her, had tried to frighten me.
NEH.6.15	On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul,
NEH.6.16	When our enemies in the surrounding nations learned that the work was finished, they felt helpless, because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall.
NEH.6.17	All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth. 
NEH.6.18	Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons: Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law, and Tobiah's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
NEH.6.19	The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done, and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said. So Tobiah kept sending letters, trying to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	After the wall had been rebuilt and the gates hung, then the temple guards, the singers, and the other Levites were assigned their work. 
NEH.7.2	I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, because Hananiah could be trusted, and he respected God more than most people did. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Don't let the gates to the city be opened until the sun has been up for a while. And make sure that they are closed and barred before the guards go off duty at sunset. Choose people from Jerusalem to stand guard at different places around the wall and others to stand guard near their own houses.”
NEH.7.4	Although Jerusalem covered a large area, not many people lived there, and no new houses had been built. 
NEH.7.5+NEH.7.6	So God gave me the idea to bring together the people, their leaders, and officials and to check the family records of those who had returned from captivity in Babylonia, after having been taken there by King Nebuchadnezzar.
NEH.7.7	and that they had come with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.
NEH.7.8+NEH.7.9+NEH.7.10+NEH.7.11+NEH.7.12+NEH.7.13+NEH.7.14+NEH.7.15+NEH.7.16+NEH.7.17+NEH.7.18+NEH.7.19+NEH.7.20+NEH.7.21+NEH.7.22+NEH.7.23+NEH.7.24+NEH.7.25	This is a list of how many returned from each family group: 2,172 from Parosh; 372 from Shephatiah; 652 from Arah; 2,818 from Pahath Moab, who were all descendants of Jeshua and Joab; 1,254 from Elam; 845 from Zattu; 760 from Zaccai; 648 from Binnui; 628 from Bebai; 2,322 from Azgad; 667 from Adonikam; 2,067 from Bigvai; 655 from Adin; 98 from Ater, also known as Hezekiah; 328 from Hashum; 324 from Bezai; 112 from Hariph; and 95 from Gibeon.

NEH.7.61+NEH.7.62	There were 642 who returned from the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, though they could not prove they were Israelites. They had lived in the Babylonian towns of Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer.
NEH.7.63+NEH.7.64	The families of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai could not prove they were priests. The ancestor of the family of Barzillai had married the daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and had taken his wife's family name. But the records of these three families could not be found, and none of them were allowed to serve as priests. 
NEH.7.65	 In fact, the governor told them, “You cannot eat the food offered to God until he lets us know if you really are priests.”
NEH.7.66+NEH.7.67+NEH.7.68+NEH.7.69	There were 42,360 who returned, in addition to 7,337 servants and 245 musicians, counting both men and women. Altogether, they brought with them 736 horses, 245 mules,

The rest of the people gave 153 kilograms of gold, 1,325 kilograms of silver, and 67 robes for the priests.
NEH.8.1+NEH.8.2	On the first day of the seventh month,
NEH.8.3	From early morning till noon, he read the Law of Moses to them, and they listened carefully. 
NEH.8.4	Ezra stood on a high wooden platform that had been built for this occasion. Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah were standing to his right, while Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash Baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam were standing to his left.
NEH.8.5	Ezra was up on the high platform, where he could be seen by everyone, and when he opened the book, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra praised the great 
NEH.8.7+NEH.8.8	After this, the Levites Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah went among the people, explaining the meaning of what Ezra had read.
NEH.8.9	The people started crying when God's Law was read to them. Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher, and the Levites who had been teaching the people all said, “This is a special day for the 
NEH.8.10	Nehemiah told the people, “Enjoy your good food and wine and share some with those who didn't have anything to bring. Don't be sad! This is a special day for the 
NEH.8.11	The Levites encouraged the people by saying, “This is a sacred day, so don't worry or mourn!” 
NEH.8.12	When the people returned to their homes, they celebrated by eating and drinking and by sharing their food with those in need, because they had understood what had been read to them.
NEH.8.13	On the second day of the seventh month,
NEH.8.14	 that the 
NEH.8.15	They also learned that they were to go into the woods and gather branches of leafy trees such as olives, myrtles, and palms for making these shelters.
NEH.8.16	So the people gathered branches and made shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their yards, in the courtyard of the temple, and in the open areas around the Water Gate and Ephraim Gate. 
NEH.8.17	Everyone who had returned from Babylonia built shelters. They lived in them and joyfully celebrated the Festival of Shelters for the first time since the days of Joshua son of Nun. 
NEH.8.18	On each of the first seven days of the festival, Ezra read to the people from God's Law. Then on the eighth day, everyone gathered for worship, just as the Law had said they must.
NEH.9.1	On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month,
NEH.9.2	They refused to let foreigners join them, as they met to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors. 
NEH.9.3	For three hours they stood and listened to the Law of the 
NEH.9.4	Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the special platform for the Levites and prayed aloud to the 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said:
NEH.9.5	“Stand and shout praises
NEH.9.5	to your 
NEH.9.5	the eternal God!
NEH.9.5	Praise his wonderful name,
NEH.9.5	though he is greater
NEH.9.5	than words can express.”
NEH.9.6	You alone are the 
NEH.9.6	Creator of the heavens
NEH.9.6	and all the stars,
NEH.9.6	Creator of the earth
NEH.9.6	and those who live on it,
NEH.9.6	Creator of the ocean
NEH.9.6	and all its creatures.
NEH.9.6	You are the source of life,
NEH.9.6	praised by the stars
NEH.9.6	that fill the heavens.
NEH.9.7	the one who chose Abram—
NEH.9.7	you brought him from Ur
NEH.9.7	in Babylonia
NEH.9.7	and named him Abraham.
NEH.9.8	you made an agreement
NEH.9.8	to give his descendants
NEH.9.8	the land of the Canaanites
NEH.9.8	and Hittites,
NEH.9.8	of the Amorites and Perizzites,
NEH.9.8	and of the Jebusites
NEH.9.8	and Girgashites.
NEH.9.8	Now you have kept your promise,
NEH.9.8	just as you always do.
NEH.9.9	were in Egypt,
NEH.9.9	you saw their suffering;
NEH.9.9	when they were at the Red Sea,
NEH.9.9	you heard their cry for help.
NEH.9.10	and his officials and his nation
NEH.9.10	had mistreated your people.
NEH.9.10	So you worked fearsome miracles
NEH.9.10	against the Egyptians
NEH.9.10	and earned a reputation
NEH.9.10	that still remains.
NEH.9.11	and your people walked through
NEH.9.11	on dry land.
NEH.9.11	But you tossed their enemies in,
NEH.9.11	and they sank down
NEH.9.11	like a heavy stone.
NEH.9.12	with a thick cloud,
NEH.9.12	and at night you showed the way
NEH.9.12	with a flaming fire.
NEH.9.13	from heaven,
NEH.9.13	and you gave your people
NEH.9.13	good laws and teachings
NEH.9.13	that are fair and honest.
NEH.9.14	You commanded them to respect
NEH.9.14	your holy Sabbath,
NEH.9.14	and you instructed
NEH.9.14	your servant Moses
NEH.9.14	to teach them your laws.
NEH.9.15	you sent bread from heaven,
NEH.9.15	and when they were thirsty,
NEH.9.15	you let water flow
NEH.9.15	from a rock.
NEH.9.15	Then you commanded them
NEH.9.15	to capture the land
NEH.9.15	that you had solemnly promised.
NEH.9.15	* 
NEH.9.16	 Our stubborn ancestors
NEH.9.16	refused to obey—
NEH.9.16	they forgot about the miracles
NEH.9.16	you had worked for them,
NEH.9.16	and they were determined
NEH.9.16	to return to Egypt
NEH.9.16	and become slaves again.
NEH.9.17	and quick to forgive;
NEH.9.17	you are loving, kind,
NEH.9.17	and very patient.
NEH.9.17	So you never turned away
NEH.9.17	from them—
NEH.9.18	an idol shaped like a calf
NEH.9.18	and insulted you by claiming,
NEH.9.18	“This is the god who rescued us
NEH.9.18	from Egypt.”
NEH.9.19	you never abandoned them
NEH.9.19	in the desert.
NEH.9.19	And you always guided them
NEH.9.19	with a cloud by day
NEH.9.19	and a fire at night.
NEH.9.20	Your gentle Spirit
NEH.9.20	instructed them,
NEH.9.20	and you gave them manna
NEH.9.20	and water to drink.
NEH.9.21	You took good care of them,
NEH.9.21	and for forty years
NEH.9.21	they never lacked a thing.
NEH.9.21	Their clothes didn't wear out,
NEH.9.21	and their feet were never swollen.
NEH.9.22	and take their land,
NEH.9.22	including King Sihon of Heshbon
NEH.9.22	and King Og of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	that you had promised
NEH.9.23	their ancestors,
NEH.9.23	and you blessed their nation
NEH.9.23	with people that outnumbered
NEH.9.23	the stars in the sky.
NEH.9.24	conquered the land.
NEH.9.24	You helped them defeat
NEH.9.24	the kings and nations
NEH.9.24	and treat their enemies
NEH.9.24	however they wished.
NEH.9.25	and rich farmland;
NEH.9.25	they took furnished houses,
NEH.9.25	as well as cisterns,
NEH.9.25	vineyards, olive orchards,
NEH.9.25	and numerous fruit trees.
NEH.9.25	They ate till they were satisfied,
NEH.9.25	and they celebrated
NEH.9.25	your abundant blessings.
NEH.9.26	and disobeyed your laws.
NEH.9.26	They killed your prophets,
NEH.9.26	who warned them
NEH.9.26	to turn back to you,
NEH.9.26	and they cursed your name.
NEH.9.27	So you handed them over
NEH.9.27	to their enemies,
NEH.9.27	who treated them terribly.
NEH.9.27	But in their sufferings,
NEH.9.27	they begged you to help.
NEH.9.27	From heaven you listened
NEH.9.27	to their prayers
NEH.9.27	and because of your great mercy,
NEH.9.27	you sent leaders to rescue them.
NEH.9.28	they would turn against you,
NEH.9.28	and you would hand them over
NEH.9.28	to their enemies.
NEH.9.28	Then they would beg for help,
NEH.9.28	and because you are merciful,
NEH.9.28	you rescued them
NEH.9.28	over and over again.
NEH.9.29	and discover true life
NEH.9.29	by obeying your laws.
NEH.9.29	But they stubbornly refused
NEH.9.29	and continued to sin.
NEH.9.30	and your Spirit
NEH.9.30	with messages spoken
NEH.9.30	by your prophets.
NEH.9.30	Still they refused to listen,
NEH.9.30	and you handed them over
NEH.9.30	to their enemies.
NEH.9.31	But you are merciful and kind,
NEH.9.31	and so you never forgot them
NEH.9.31	or let them be destroyed.
NEH.9.32	fearsome, and faithful,
NEH.9.32	always true to your word.
NEH.9.32	So please keep in mind
NEH.9.32	the terrible sufferings
NEH.9.32	of our people, kings, leaders,
NEH.9.32	priests, and prophets,
NEH.9.32	from the time Assyria ruled
NEH.9.32	until this very day.
NEH.9.33	You have always been fair
NEH.9.33	when you punished us
NEH.9.33	for our sins.
NEH.9.34	Our kings and leaders,
NEH.9.34	our priests and ancestors
NEH.9.34	have never obeyed your commands
NEH.9.34	or heeded your warnings.
NEH.9.35	You blessed them with a kingdom
NEH.9.35	and with an abundance
NEH.9.35	of rich, fertile land,
NEH.9.35	but they refused to worship you
NEH.9.35	or turn from their evil.
NEH.9.36	Now we are slaves
NEH.9.36	in this fruitful land
NEH.9.36	you gave to our ancestors.
NEH.9.37	Its plentiful harvest is taken
NEH.9.37	by kings you placed over us
NEH.9.37	because of our sins.
NEH.9.37	Our suffering is unbearable,
NEH.9.37	because they do as they wish
NEH.9.37	to us and our livestock.
NEH.9.38	And so, a firm agreement was made that had the official approval of the leaders, the Levites, and priests.
NEH.10.1	As governor, I

NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
NEH.10.28+NEH.10.29	All of us, including priests, Levites, temple guards, singers, temple workers and leaders, together with our wives and children, have separated ourselves from the foreigners in this land and now enter into an agreement with a complete understanding of what we are doing. And so, we now place ourselves under the curse of the 
NEH.10.31	Every seven years we will let our fields rest, and we will cancel all debts.
NEH.10.33	This is to pay for the sacred bread, as well as for the daily sacrifices and special sacrifices such as those offered on the Sabbath and during the New Moon Festival and the other festivals. It will also pay for the sacrifices to forgive our sins and for all expenses connected with the worship of God in the temple.
NEH.10.34	We have decided that the families
NEH.10.37	We will bring ten percent of our grain harvest to those Levites who are responsible for collecting it in our towns. 
NEH.10.38	 A priest from the family of Aaron must be there when we give this to the Levites. Then the Levites will put one tenth of this part in the temple storeroom, 
NEH.10.39	which is also the place for the sacred objects used by the priests, the temple guards, and the singers.
NEH.10.39	Levites and everyone else must bring their gifts of grain, wine, and olive oil to this room.
NEH.10.39	We will not neglect the temple of our God.
NEH.11.1	The nation's leaders and their families settled in Jerusalem. But there was room for only one out of every ten of the remaining families, and so they asked God to show them
NEH.11.2	Then everyone else asked God to bless those who were willing to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.4+NEH.11.5+NEH.11.6	From the Judah tribe, two leaders settled in Jerusalem with their relatives. One of them was Athaiah son of Uzziah. His ancestors were Zechariah, Amariah, Shephatiah, Mahalalel, and Perez, the son of Judah. From the descendants of Perez, 468 of the best men lived in Jerusalem.

NEH.11.20	The rest of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, lived on their own property in the other towns of Judah. 
NEH.11.21	But the temple workers lived in the section of Jerusalem known as Ophel, and the two men in charge of them were Ziha and Gishpa.

NEH.11.36	Several groups of Levites from the territory of Judah were sent to live among the people of Benjamin.

NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and another Jedaiah. These were the leading priests and their assistants during the time of Joshua.
NEH.12.8	The Levites who returned were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah. They and their assistants were responsible for the songs of praise, 
NEH.12.9	while Bakbukiah and Unno, together with their assistants, were responsible for the choral responses.
NEH.12.10	Joshua was the father of Joiakim, the grandfather of Eliashib, and the great-grandfather of Joiada. 
NEH.12.11	Joiada was the father of Jonathan and the grandfather of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	When Joiakim was high priest, the following priests were leaders of their clans: Meraiah of the Seraiah clan, Hananiah of Jeremiah,

NEH.12.22	During the time of the high priests Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, and including the time that Darius was king of Persia, a record was kept of the heads of the Levite and priestly families. 
NEH.12.23	However, no official record was kept of the heads of the Levite clans after the death of Johanan,
NEH.12.24	Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel,
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were responsible for guarding the storerooms near the temple gates.
NEH.12.26	All of these men lived during the time of Joiakim
NEH.12.27	When the city wall was dedicated, Levites from everywhere in Judah were invited to join in the celebration with songs of praise and with the music of cymbals, small harps, and other stringed instruments. 
NEH.12.28+NEH.12.29	The Levite singers lived in villages around Jerusalem, and so they came from there, as well as from the villages around Netophah, Beth-Gilgal, Geba, and Azmaveth. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and Levites held special ceremonies to make themselves holy, and then they did the same for the rest of the people and for the gates and walls of the city.
NEH.12.31	I brought the leaders of Judah to the top of the city wall and put them in charge of the two groups that were to march around on top of the wall, singing praises to God. One group marched to the right in the direction of Garbage Gate. 
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half of the leaders followed them. 
NEH.12.33	Then came the priests Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	all of them blowing trumpets. Next, there was Zechariah of the Asaph clan
NEH.12.36	and his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They played musical instruments like those that had been played by David, the man of God. And they marched behind Ezra, the teacher of the Law. 
NEH.12.37	When they reached Fountain Gate, they climbed the steps to David's City and went past his palace, before stopping at the Water Gate near the eastern wall of the city.
NEH.12.38	The second group of singers marched along the wall in the opposite direction, and I followed them, together with the other half of the leaders of Judah. We went past Oven Tower, Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	Ephraim Gate, Old Gate, Fish Gate, Hananel Tower, Hundred Tower, and on to Sheep Gate. Finally, we stopped at Gate of the Guard, 
NEH.12.40	where we stood in front of the temple with the other group, praising God. In the group with me were half of the leaders, 
NEH.12.41	as well as the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, who were blowing trumpets. 
NEH.12.42	Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer also stood there, as Jezrahiah led the singers. 
NEH.12.43	God had made the people very happy, and so on that day they celebrated and offered many sacrifices. The women and children joined in the festivities, and joyful shouts could be heard far from the city of Jerusalem.
NEH.12.44	On that same day, some leaders were appointed to be responsible for the safekeeping of gifts for the temple and to be in charge of receiving the first part of the harvest and the ten percent of the crops and livestock that was offered to God. These same leaders also collected the part of crops that the Law of Moses taught was to be given to the Levites.
NEH.12.44	Everyone was pleased with the work of the priests and Levites, 
NEH.12.45	 when they performed the ceremonies to make people acceptable to worship God. And the singers and the temple guards did their jobs according to the instructions given by David and his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	In fact, ever since the days of David and Asaph, there had been song leaders and songs of praise and worship. 
NEH.12.47	During the time that Zerubbabel and I were in charge, everyone in Israel gave what they were supposed to give for the daily needs of the singers and temple guards from the Levi tribe. Then the Levites would give the priests their share from what they had received.
NEH.13.2	 This was because they had refused to give food and water to Israel and had hired Balaam
NEH.13.3	Following the reading of the Law of Moses, the people of Israel started sending away anyone who had any foreign ancestors.
NEH.13.4	The priest Eliashib was a relative of Tobiah and had earlier been put in charge of the temple storerooms. 
NEH.13.5	So he let Tobiah live in one of these rooms, where all kinds of things had been stored—the grain offerings, incense, utensils for the temple, as well as the tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil that had been given for the use of the Levites, singers, and temple guards, and the gifts for the priests.
NEH.13.6	This happened in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes
NEH.13.7	to return to Jerusalem. Only then did I find out that Eliashib had done this terrible thing of letting Tobiah have a room in the temple. 
NEH.13.8	It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah's furniture. 
NEH.13.9	Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils, the grain offerings, and the incense to be brought back into the room.
NEH.13.11	I called the leaders together and angrily asked them, “Why is the temple neglected?” Then I told them to start doing their jobs. 
NEH.13.12	 After this, everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain, wine, and olive oil to the temple storeroom. 
NEH.13.13	Finally, I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others. They were Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher of the Law, and Pedaiah the Levite. Their assistant was Hanan, the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah.
NEH.13.14	I pray that my God will remember these good things that I have done for his temple and for those who worship there.
NEH.13.16	People who had moved to Jerusalem from the city of Tyre were bringing in fish and other things to sell there on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.17	I got angry and said to the leaders of Judah, “This evil you are doing is an insult to the Sabbath! 
NEH.13.18	Didn't God punish us and this city because our ancestors did these very same things? And here you are, about to make God furious again by disgracing the Sabbath!”
NEH.13.19	I ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be closed on the eve of the Sabbath
NEH.13.20	Once or twice some merchants spent the night outside Jerusalem with their goods. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them, “If you do this again, I'll have you arrested.” From then on, they did not come on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	I ordered the Levites to make themselves holy and to guard the gates on the Sabbath, so that it would be kept holy.
NEH.13.22	God is truly merciful, and I pray that he will treat me with kindness and bless me for doing this.
NEH.13.24	About half of their children could not speak Hebrew—they spoke only the language of Ashdod or some other foreign language. 
NEH.13.25	So in my anger, I called down curses on those men. I had them beaten and even pulled out the hair of some of them. Then I made them promise:
NEH.13.25	In the name of God we solemnly promise not to let our sons and daughters marry foreigners. 
NEH.13.26	 God dearly loved King Solomon of Israel and made him the greatest king on earth, but Solomon's foreign wives led him into sin. 
NEH.13.27	So we will obey you and not rebel against our God by marrying foreign women.
NEH.13.29	I pray that God will punish them for breaking their priestly vows and disgracing the Levi tribe.
NEH.13.30	Then I made sure that the people were free from every foreign influence, and I assigned duties for the priests and Levites. 
NEH.13.31	I also arranged for the people to bring firewood to the altar each day and for them to bring the first part of their harvest to the temple.
NEH.13.31	I pray that God will bless me for the good I have done.
EST.1.3	During the third year of his rule, Xerxes gave a big dinner for all his officials and officers. The governors and leaders of the provinces were also invited, and even the commanders of the Persian and Median armies came. 
EST.1.4	For 180 days he showed off his wealth and spent a lot of money to impress his guests with the greatness of his kingdom.
EST.1.5	At the end of this time, King Xerxes gave another dinner and invited everyone in the city of Susa, no matter who they were. The eating and drinking lasted seven days in the beautiful palace gardens. 
EST.1.6	The area was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains tied back with purple linen cords that ran through silver rings fastened to marble columns. Couches of gold and silver rested on pavement that had all kinds of designs made from costly bright-colored stones and marble and mother-of-pearl.
EST.1.7	The guests drank from gold cups, and each cup had a different design. The king was generous 
EST.1.8	and said to them, “Drink all you want!” Then he told his servants, “Keep their cups full.”
EST.1.9	While the men were enjoying themselves, Queen Vashti gave the women a big dinner inside the royal palace.
EST.1.10	By the seventh day, King Xerxes was feeling happy because of so much wine. And he asked his seven personal servants, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti to him. The king wanted her to wear her crown and let his people and his officials see how beautiful she was. 
EST.1.12	The king's servants told Queen Vashti what he had said, but she refused to go to him, and this made him terribly angry.
EST.1.13+EST.1.14	The king called in the seven highest officials of Persia and Media. They were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were very wise and understood all the laws and customs of the country, and the king always asked them what they thought about such matters.
EST.1.15	The king said to them, “Queen Vashti refused to come to me when I sent my servants for her. What does the law say I should do about that?”
EST.1.16	Then Memucan told the king and the officials:
EST.1.16	Your Majesty, Queen Vashti has not only embarrassed you, but she has insulted your officials and everyone else in all the provinces.
EST.1.17	The women in the kingdom will hear about this, and they will refuse to respect their husbands. They will say, “If Queen Vashti doesn't obey her husband, why should we?” 
EST.1.18	Before this day is over, the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done, and they will refuse to obey their husbands. They won't respect their husbands, and their husbands will be angry with them.
EST.1.19	Your Majesty, if you agree, you should write for the Medes and Persians a law that can never be changed. This law would keep Queen Vashti from ever seeing you again. Then you could let someone who respects you be queen in her place.
EST.1.20	When the women in your great kingdom hear about this new law, they will respect their husbands, no matter if they are rich or poor.
EST.1.21	King Xerxes and his officials liked what Memucan had said, 
EST.1.22	and he sent letters to all of his provinces. Each letter was written in the language of the province to which it was sent, and it said that husbands should be in charge of their wives and children.
EST.2.1	After a while, King Xerxes got over being angry. But he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and the law that he had written because of her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king's personal servants said:
EST.2.2	Your Majesty, a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women. 
EST.2.3	You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives in the capital city of Susa. Put your servant Hegai in charge of them since that is his job. He can see to it that they are given the proper beauty treatments. 
EST.2.4	Then let the young woman who pleases you most take Vashti's place as queen.
EST.2.4	King Xerxes liked these suggestions, and he followed them.
EST.2.5	At this time a Jew named Mordecai was living in Susa. His father was Jair, and his grandfather Shimei was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin. 
EST.2.6	 Kish
EST.2.7	Mordecai had a very beautiful cousin named Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. He had raised her as his own daughter, after her father and mother died. 
EST.2.8	When the king ordered the search for beautiful women, many were taken to the king's palace in Susa, and Esther was one of them.
EST.2.8	Hegai was put in charge of all the women, 
EST.2.9	and from the first day, Esther was his favorite. He began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king's palace, and they had the best rooms.
EST.2.10	Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him. 
EST.2.11	He was anxious to see how Esther was getting along and to learn what had happened to her. So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the court where the women lived.
EST.2.12	The young women were given beauty treatments for one whole year. The first six months their skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh, and the last six months it was treated with perfumes and cosmetics. Then each of them spent the night alone with King Xerxes. 
EST.2.13	When a young woman went to the king, she could wear whatever clothes or jewelry she chose from the women's living quarters. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go to the king, and the following morning she would go to the place where his wives stayed after being with him. There a man named Shaashgaz was in charge of the king's wives.
EST.2.15+EST.2.16	Xerxes had been king for seven years when Esther's turn came to go to him during Tebeth,
EST.2.17	Xerxes liked Esther more than he did any of the other young women. None of them pleased him as much as she did, and he immediately fell in love with her and crowned her queen in place of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	In honor of Esther he gave a big dinner for his leaders and officials. Then he declared a holiday
EST.2.19	When the young women were brought together again, Esther's cousin Mordecai had become a palace official. 
EST.2.20	He had told Esther never to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him, just as she had always done.
EST.2.21	Bigthana and Teresh were the two men who guarded King Xerxes' rooms, but they got angry with the king and decided to kill him. 
EST.2.22	Mordecai found out about their plans and asked Queen Esther to tell the king what he had found out. 
EST.2.23	King Xerxes learned that Mordecai's report was true, and he had the two men hanged. Then the king had all of this written down in his record book as he watched.
EST.3.1	Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha to the highest position in his kingdom. Haman was a descendant of Agag,
EST.3.2	and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honor Haman by kneeling down to him. All of them obeyed except Mordecai. 
EST.3.3	When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king's command, 
EST.3.4	he said, “Because I am a Jew.” They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down, but he still refused to obey. Finally, they reported this to Haman, to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it.
EST.3.5	Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honor him. 
EST.3.6	And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough. Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed.
EST.3.7	It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes. During Nisan,
EST.3.8	Your Majesty, there are some people who live all over your kingdom and won't have a thing to do with anyone else. They have customs that are different from everyone else's, and they refuse to obey your laws. We would be better off to get rid of them! 
EST.3.9	Why not give orders for all of them to be killed? I can promise that you will get tons of silver for your treasury.
EST.3.10	The king handed his official ring to Haman, who hated the Jews, and the king told him, 
EST.3.11	“Do what you want with those people! You can keep their money.”
EST.3.12	On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman called in the king's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom. The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king's own ring.
EST.3.13	The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom, and this is what was said in the letters:
EST.3.13	On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, all Jewish men, women, and children are to be killed. And their property is to be taken.
EST.3.14+EST.3.15	King Xerxes gave orders for these letters to be posted where they could be seen by everyone all over the kingdom. The king's command was obeyed, and one of the letters was read aloud to the people in the walled city of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink together, but no one in the city
EST.4.1	When Mordecai heard about the letter, he tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he covered his head with ashes and went through the city, crying and weeping. 
EST.4.2	But he could go only as far as the palace gate, because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside the palace. 
EST.4.3	 In every province where the king's orders were read, the Jews cried and mourned, and they went without eating.
EST.4.4	When Esther's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing, she became very upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear in place of the sackcloth. But he refused to take them.
EST.4.5	Esther had a servant named Hathach, who had been given to her by the king. So she called him in and said, “Find out what's wrong with Mordecai and why he's acting this way.”
EST.4.6	Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the palace gate, 
EST.4.7	and Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He also told him how much money Haman had promised to add to the king's treasury, if all the Jews were killed.
EST.4.8	Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the orders for the murder of the Jews and told him that these had been read in Susa. He said, “Show this to Esther and explain what it means. Ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people, the Jews!”
EST.4.9	Hathach went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	She answered, “Tell Mordecai 
EST.4.11	there is a law about going in to see the king, and all his officials and his people know about this law. Anyone who goes in to see the king without being invited by him will be put to death. The only way that anyone can be saved is for the king to hold out the gold scepter to that person. And it's been thirty days since he has asked for me.”
EST.4.12	When Mordecai was told what Esther had said, 
EST.4.13	he sent back this reply, “Don't think that you will escape being killed with the rest of the Jews, just because you live in the king's palace. 
EST.4.14	If you don't speak up now, we will somehow get help, but you and your family will be killed. It could be that you were made queen for a time like this!”
EST.4.15	Esther sent a message to Mordecai, saying, 
EST.4.16	“Bring together all the Jews in Susa and tell them to go without eating for my sake! Don't eat or drink for three days and nights. My servant girls and I will do the same. Then I will go in to see the king, even if it means I must die.”
EST.4.17	Mordecai did everything Esther told him to do.
EST.5.1	Three days later, Esther dressed in her royal robes and went to the inner court of the palace in front of the throne. The king was sitting there, facing the open doorway. 
EST.5.2	He was happy to see Esther, and he held out the gold scepter to her.
EST.5.2	When Esther came up and touched the tip of the scepter, 
EST.5.3	the king said, “Esther, what brings you here? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”
EST.5.4	Esther answered, “Your Majesty, please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today.”
EST.5.5	The king said to his servants, “Hurry and get Haman, so we can accept Esther's invitation.”
EST.5.5	The king and Haman went to Esther's dinner, 
EST.5.6	and while they were drinking wine, the king asked her, “What can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”
EST.5.7+EST.5.8	Esther replied, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me and are willing to do what I want, please come again tomorrow with Haman to the dinner I will prepare for you. At that time I will answer Your Majesty's question.”
EST.5.9	Haman was feeling great as he left. But when he saw Mordecai at the palace gate, he noticed that Mordecai did not stand up or show him any respect. This made Haman really angry, 
EST.5.10	but he did not say a thing.
EST.5.10	When Haman got home, he called together his friends and his wife Zeresh 
EST.5.11	and started bragging about his great wealth and all his sons. He told them the many ways that the king had honored him and how all the other officials and leaders had to respect him. 
EST.5.12	Haman added, “That's not all! Besides the king himself, I'm the only person Queen Esther invited for dinner. She has also invited the king and me to dinner tomorrow. 
EST.5.13	But none of this makes me happy, as long as I see that Jew Mordecai serving the king.”
EST.5.14	Haman's wife and friends said to him, “Have a gallows built about 22 meters high, and tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai there. Then later, you can have dinner with the king and enjoy yourself.”
EST.5.14	This seemed like a good idea to Haman, and he had the gallows built.
EST.6.1	That night the king could not sleep, and he had a servant read him the records of what had happened since he had been king. 
EST.6.2	 When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king, 
EST.6.3	the king asked, “What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	“Nothing, Your Majesty!” the king's servants replied.
EST.6.4	About this time, Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows he had built. The king saw him and asked, “Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?”
EST.6.5	The king's servants answered, “Your Majesty, it is Haman.”
EST.6.5	“Tell him to come in,” the king commanded.
EST.6.6	When Haman entered the room, the king asked him, “What should I do for a man I want to honor?”
EST.6.6	Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honor. 
EST.6.7	So he replied, “Your Majesty, if you wish to honor a man, 
EST.6.8	get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy headdress. 
EST.6.9	Tell one of your highest officials to place your robe on this man and lead him through the streets on your horse, while someone shouts, ‘This is how the king honors a man!’ ”
EST.6.10	The king replied, “Hurry and do just what you have said! Don't forget a thing. Get the robe and the horse for Mordecai the Jew, who serves as one of the king's officials!”
EST.6.11	Haman got the king's robe and put it on Mordecai. He led him through the city on the horse and shouted as he went, “This is how the king honors a man!”
EST.6.12	Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his duties in the king's palace, and Haman hurried home, hiding his face in shame. 
EST.6.13	Haman told his wife and friends what had happened. Then his wife and his advisors said, “If Mordecai is a Jew, this is just the beginning of your troubles! You will end up a ruined man.” 
EST.6.14	They were still talking, when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	The king and Haman were dining with Esther 
EST.7.2	and drinking wine during the second dinner, when the king again said, “Esther, what can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom!”
EST.7.3	Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me and are willing to help, you can save me and my people. That's what I really want, 
EST.7.4	because a reward has been promised to anyone who kills my people. Your Majesty, if we were merely going to be sold as slaves, I would not have bothered you.”
EST.7.5	“Who would dare to do such a thing?” the king asked.
EST.7.6	Esther replied, “That evil Haman is the one out to get us!”
EST.7.6	Haman was terrified, as he looked at the king and the queen.
EST.7.7	The king was so angry that he got up, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden.
EST.7.7	Haman realized that the king had already decided what to do with him, and he stayed and begged Esther to save his life.
EST.7.8	Just as the king came back into the room, Haman got down on his knees beside Esther, who was lying on the couch. The king shouted, “Now you're even trying to rape my queen here in my own palace!”
EST.7.8	As soon as the king said this, his servants covered Haman's head. 
EST.7.9	Then Harbona, one of the king's personal servants, said, “Your Majesty, Haman built a gallows 22 meters high beside his house, so he could hang Mordecai on it. And Mordecai is the very one who spoke up and saved your life.”
EST.7.9	“Hang Haman from his own gallows!” the king commanded. 
EST.7.10	At once, Haman was hanged on the gallows he had built to hang Mordecai, and the king calmed down.
EST.8.1	Before the end of the day, King Xerxes gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. So the king made Mordecai one of his highest officials 
EST.8.2	and gave him the royal ring that Haman had worn. Then Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
EST.8.3	Once again Esther went to speak to the king. This time she fell down at his feet, crying and begging, “Please stop Haman's evil plan to have the Jews killed!” 
EST.8.4	King Xerxes held out the golden scepter to Esther, 
EST.8.5	and she got up and said, “Your Majesty, I know that you will do the right thing and that you really love me. Please stop what Haman has planned. He has already sent letters demanding that the Jews in all your provinces be killed, 
EST.8.6	and I can't bear to see my people and my own relatives destroyed.”
EST.8.7	King Xerxes then said to Esther and Mordecai, “I have already ordered Haman to be hanged and his house given to Esther, because of his evil plans to kill the Jews. 
EST.8.8	 I now give you permission to make a law that will save the lives of your people. You may use my ring to seal the law, so that it can never be changed.”
EST.8.9	On the twenty-third day of Sivan,
EST.8.10	They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring. Then they were taken by messengers who rode the king's finest and fastest horses.
EST.8.11+EST.8.12+EST.8.13	In these letters the king said:
EST.8.11+EST.8.12+EST.8.13	On the thirteenth day of Adar,
EST.8.11+EST.8.12+EST.8.13	A copy of this law is to be posted in every province and read by everyone.
EST.8.14+EST.8.15	Then the king ordered his messengers to take their fastest horses and deliver the law as quickly as possible to every province. When Mordecai left, he was wearing clothes fit for a king. He wore blue and white robes, a large gold crown, and a cape made of fine linen and purple cloth.
EST.8.14+EST.8.15	After the law was announced in Susa, everyone shouted and cheered, 
EST.8.16	and the Jews were no longer afraid. In fact, they were very happy and felt that they had won a victory.
EST.8.17	In every province and city where the law was sent, the Jews had parties and celebrated. Many of the people in the provinces accepted the Jewish religion, because they were now afraid of the Jews.
EST.9.1	The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar,
EST.9.2	and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies. Everyone was afraid of the Jews, and no one could do anything to oppose them.
EST.9.3	The leaders of the provinces, the rulers, the governors, and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews. 
EST.9.4	Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power.
EST.9.5	The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies, without showing any mercy. 
EST.9.6+EST.9.7+EST.9.8+EST.9.9+EST.9.10	They killed 500 people in Susa,
EST.9.11	Later that day, someone told the king how many people had been killed in Susa.
EST.9.12	Then he told Esther, “Five hundred people, including Haman's ten sons, have been killed in Susa alone. If that many were killed here, what must have happened in the provinces? Is there anything else you want done? Just tell me, and it will be done.”
EST.9.13	Esther answered, “Your Majesty, please let the Jews in Susa fight to defend themselves tomorrow, just as they did today. And order the bodies of Haman's ten sons to be hanged in public.”
EST.9.14	King Xerxes did what Esther had requested, and the bodies of Haman's sons were hung in Susa. 
EST.9.15	Then on the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of the city got together and killed 300 more people. But they still did not take anything that belonged to their enemies.
EST.9.16+EST.9.17	On the thirteenth day of Adar, the Jews in the provinces had come together to defend themselves. They killed 75,000 of their enemies, but the Jews did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed. Then on the fourteenth day of the month the Jews celebrated with a feast.
EST.9.19	This is why the Jews in the villages now celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month. It is a joyful holiday that they celebrate by feasting and sending gifts of food to each other.
EST.9.20	Mordecai wrote down everything that had happened. Then he sent letters to the Jews everywhere in the provinces 
EST.9.21	and told them:
EST.9.21	Each year you must celebrate on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar, 
EST.9.22	the days when we Jews defeated our enemies. Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy, and celebration took the place of crying. Celebrate by having parties and by giving to the poor and by sharing gifts of food with each other.
EST.9.23	They followed Mordecai's instructions and set aside these two days every year as a time of celebration.
EST.9.25	Esther went to King Xerxes and asked him to save her people. Then the king gave written orders for Haman and his sons to be punished in the same terrible way that Haman had in mind for the Jews. So they were hanged. 
EST.9.26	Mordecai's letter had said that the Jews must celebrate for two days because of what had happened to them. This time of celebration is called Purim,
EST.9.27	Now every year the Jews set aside these two days for having parties and celebrating, just as they were told to do. 
EST.9.28	From now on, all Jewish families must remember to celebrate Purim on these two days each year.
EST.9.29	Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, wanted to give full authority to Mordecai's letter about the Festival of Purim, and with his help she wrote a letter about the feast. 
EST.9.30	Copies of this letter were sent to Jews in the 127 provinces of King Xerxes. In the letter they said:
EST.9.30	We pray that all of you will live in peace and safety.
EST.9.31	You and your descendants must always remember to celebrate Purim at the time and in the way that we have said. You must also follow the instructions that we have given you about mourning and going without eating.
EST.9.32	These laws about Purim are written by the authority of Queen Esther.
EST.10.1	King Xerxes made everyone in his kingdom pay taxes, even those in lands across the sea. 
EST.10.2	All the great and famous things that King Xerxes did are written in the record books of the kings of Media and Persia. These records also tell about the honors that the king gave to Mordecai. 
EST.10.3	Next to the king himself, Mordecai was the highest official in the kingdom. He was a popular leader of the Jews, because he helped them in many ways and would even speak to the king on their behalf.
JOB.1.1	Many years ago, a man named Job lived in the land of Uz.
JOB.1.2	Job had 7 sons and 3 daughters. 
JOB.1.3	He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 pair of oxen, 500 donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the richest person in the East.
JOB.1.4	Job's sons took turns having feasts in their homes, and they always invited their three sisters to join in the eating and drinking. 
JOB.1.5	After each feast, Job would send for his children and perform a ceremony, as a way of asking God to forgive them of any wrongs they may have done. He would get up early the next morning and offer a sacrifice for each of them, just in case they had sinned or silently cursed God.
JOB.1.7	the 
JOB.1.7	Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.10	“You are like a wall protecting not only him, but his entire family and all his property. You make him successful in whatever he does, and his flocks and herds are everywhere. 
JOB.1.11	Try taking away everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face.”
JOB.1.12	The 
JOB.1.12	Then Satan left.
JOB.1.13	Job's sons and daughters were having a feast in the home of his oldest son, 
JOB.1.14	when someone rushed up to Job and said, “While your servants were plowing with your oxen, and your donkeys were nearby eating grass, 
JOB.1.15	a gang of Sabeans
JOB.1.16	That servant was still speaking, when a second one came running and said, “God sent down a fire that killed your sheep and your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.17	Before that servant finished speaking, a third one raced up and said, “Three gangs of Chaldeans
JOB.1.18	That servant was still speaking, when a fourth one dashed up and said, “Your children were having a feast and drinking wine at the home of your oldest son, 
JOB.1.19	when suddenly a windstorm from the desert blew the house down, crushing all of your children. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	When Job heard this, he tore his clothes and shaved his head because of his great sorrow. He knelt on the ground, then worshiped God 
JOB.1.21	 and said:
JOB.1.21	“We bring nothing at birth;
JOB.1.21	we take nothing
JOB.1.21	with us at death.
JOB.1.21	The 
JOB.1.21	Praise the name of the 
JOB.1.22	In spite of everything, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing wrong.
JOB.2.1	When the angels
JOB.2.2	and the 
JOB.2.2	Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.4	Satan answered, “There's no pain like your own.
JOB.2.5	Try striking Job's own body with pain, and he will curse you to your face.”
JOB.2.6	“All right!” the 
JOB.2.7	Satan left and caused painful sores to break out all over Job's body—from head to toe.
JOB.2.8	Then Job sat on the ash-heap to show his sorrow. And while he was scraping his sores with a broken piece of pottery, 
JOB.2.9	his wife asked, “Why do you still trust God? Why don't you curse him and die?”
JOB.2.10	Job replied, “Don't talk like a fool! If we accept blessings from God, we must accept trouble as well.” In all that happened, Job never once said anything against God.
JOB.2.11	Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah
JOB.2.12	When they came near enough to see Job, they could hardly recognize him. And in their great sorrow, they tore their clothes, then sprinkled dust on their heads and cried bitterly. 
JOB.2.13	For seven days and nights, they sat silently on the ground beside him, because they realized what terrible pain he was in.
JOB.3.1	of his birth
JOB.3.2	by saying to God:
JOB.3.3	Blot out the day of my birth
JOB.3.3	and the night when my parents
JOB.3.3	created a son.
JOB.3.4	Forget about that day,
JOB.3.4	cover it with darkness,
JOB.3.5	and send thick, gloomy shadows
JOB.3.5	to fill it with dread.
JOB.3.6	Erase that night from the calendar
JOB.3.6	and conceal it with darkness.
JOB.3.7	Don't let children be created
JOB.3.7	or joyful shouts be heard
JOB.3.7	ever again in that night.
JOB.3.8	Let those with magic powers
JOB.3.8	place a curse on that day.
JOB.3.9	Darken its morning stars
JOB.3.9	and remove all hope of light,
JOB.3.10	because it let me be born
JOB.3.10	into a world of trouble.
JOB.3.11	Why didn't I die at birth?
JOB.3.12	Why was I accepted
JOB.3.12	and allowed to nurse
JOB.3.12	at my mother's breast?
JOB.3.13	Now I would be at peace
JOB.3.13	in the silent world below
JOB.3.14	with kings and their advisors
JOB.3.14	whose palaces lie in ruins,
JOB.3.15	and with rulers once rich
JOB.3.15	with silver and gold.
JOB.3.16	I wish I had been born dead
JOB.3.16	and then buried, never to see
JOB.3.16	the light of day.
JOB.3.17	In the world of the dead,
JOB.3.17	the wicked and the weary rest
JOB.3.17	without a worry.
JOB.3.17	* 
JOB.3.18	Everyone is there—
JOB.3.19	where captives and slaves
JOB.3.19	are free at last.
JOB.3.20	Why does God let me live
JOB.3.20	when life is miserable
JOB.3.20	and so bitter?
JOB.3.21	more than I would seek
JOB.3.21	a valuable treasure.
JOB.3.22	Nothing could make me happier
JOB.3.22	than to be in the grave.
JOB.3.23	Why do I go on living
JOB.3.23	when God has me surrounded,
JOB.3.23	and I can't see the road?
JOB.3.24	Moaning and groaning
JOB.3.24	are my food and drink,
JOB.3.25	and my worst fears
JOB.3.25	have all come true.
JOB.3.26	I have no peace or rest—
JOB.3.26	only troubles and worries.
JOB.4.1	Eliphaz from Teman
JOB.4.2	Please be patient and listen
JOB.4.2	to what I have to say.
JOB.4.2	* 
JOB.4.3	Remember how your words
JOB.4.4	have guided and encouraged
JOB.4.4	many in need.
JOB.4.5	But now you feel discouraged
JOB.4.5	when struck by trouble.
JOB.4.6	You respect God and live right,
JOB.4.6	so don't lose hope!
JOB.4.7	No truly innocent person
JOB.4.7	has ever died young.
JOB.4.8	In my experience, only those
JOB.4.8	who plant seeds of evil
JOB.4.8	harvest trouble,
JOB.4.9	and then they are swept away
JOB.4.9	by the angry breath of God.
JOB.4.10	They may roar and growl
JOB.4.10	like powerful lions.
JOB.4.10	But when God breaks their teeth,
JOB.4.11	they starve, and their children
JOB.4.11	are scattered.
JOB.4.12	A secret was told to me
JOB.4.12	in a faint whisper—
JOB.4.13	but disturbed by dreams;
JOB.4.14	I trembled with fear,
JOB.4.15	and my hair stood on end,
JOB.4.15	as a wind blew past my face.
JOB.4.16	It stopped and stood still.
JOB.4.16	Then a form appeared—
JOB.4.16	a shapeless form.
JOB.4.16	And from the silence,
JOB.4.16	I heard a voice say,
JOB.4.17	“No humans are innocent
JOB.4.17	in the eyes of God
JOB.4.17	their Creator.
JOB.4.18	He finds fault with his servants
JOB.4.18	and even with his angels.
JOB.4.19	Humans are formed from clay
JOB.4.19	and are fragile as moths,
JOB.4.19	so what chance do you have?
JOB.4.20	Born after daybreak,
JOB.4.20	you die before nightfall
JOB.4.20	and disappear forever.
JOB.4.21	Your tent pegs are pulled up,
JOB.4.21	and you leave this life,
JOB.4.21	having gained no wisdom.”
JOB.5.1	Job, call out for help
JOB.5.1	and see if an angel comes!
JOB.5.2	Envy and jealousy
JOB.5.2	will kill a stupid fool.
JOB.5.3	I have seen fools take root.
JOB.5.3	But God sends a curse,
JOB.5.3	suddenly uprooting them
JOB.5.4	and leaving their children
JOB.5.4	helpless in court.
JOB.5.5	Then hungry and greedy people
JOB.5.5	gobble up their crops
JOB.5.5	and grab their wealth.
JOB.5.6	Our suffering isn't caused
JOB.5.6	by the failure of crops;
JOB.5.7	it's all part of life,
JOB.5.7	like sparks shooting skyward.
JOB.5.8	Job, if I were you,
JOB.5.8	I would ask God for help.
JOB.5.9	more than we can count.
JOB.5.10	God sends showers on earth
JOB.5.10	and waters the fields.
JOB.5.11	He protects the sorrowful
JOB.5.11	and lifts up those
JOB.5.11	who have been disgraced.
JOB.5.11	* 
JOB.5.12	God swiftly traps the wicked
JOB.5.13	and their wisdom fails.
JOB.5.14	Darkness is their only companion,
JOB.5.14	hiding their path at noon.
JOB.5.15	God rescues the needy
JOB.5.15	from the words of the wicked
JOB.5.15	and the fist of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	The poor are filled with hope,
JOB.5.16	and injustice is silenced.
JOB.5.17	if God All-Powerful
JOB.5.17	chooses to correct you.
JOB.5.18	but he will bandage and heal
JOB.5.18	your cuts and bruises.
JOB.5.19	God will protect you from harm,
JOB.5.19	no matter how often
JOB.5.19	trouble may strike.
JOB.5.20	In times of war and famine,
JOB.5.20	God will keep you safe.
JOB.5.21	You will be sheltered,
JOB.5.21	without fear of hurtful words
JOB.5.21	or any other weapon.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at the threat
JOB.5.22	of destruction and famine.
JOB.5.22	And you won't be afraid
JOB.5.22	of wild animals—
JOB.5.23	they will no longer be fierce,
JOB.5.23	and your rocky fields
JOB.5.23	will become friendly.
JOB.5.24	Your home will be secure,
JOB.5.24	and your sheep will be safe.
JOB.5.25	You will have more descendants
JOB.5.25	than there are blades of grass
JOB.5.25	on the face of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will live a very long life,
JOB.5.26	and your body will be strong
JOB.5.26	until the day you die.
JOB.5.27	Our experience has proven
JOB.5.27	these things to be true,
JOB.5.27	so listen and learn.
JOB.6.1	Job said:
JOB.6.2	It's impossible to weigh
JOB.6.2	my misery and grief!
JOB.6.3	They outweigh the sand
JOB.6.3	along the beach,
JOB.6.3	and that's why I have spoken
JOB.6.3	without thinking first.
JOB.6.4	The fearsome arrows
JOB.6.4	of God All-Powerful
JOB.6.4	have filled my soul
JOB.6.4	with their poison.
JOB.6.5	Do oxen and wild donkeys
JOB.6.5	cry out in distress
JOB.6.5	unless they are hungry?
JOB.6.6	What is food without salt?
JOB.6.6	What is more tasteless
JOB.6.6	than the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	That's how my food tastes,
JOB.6.7	and my appetite is gone.
JOB.6.7	* 
JOB.6.8	How I wish that God
JOB.6.8	would answer my prayer
JOB.6.9	and do away with me.
JOB.6.10	Then I would be comforted,
JOB.6.10	knowing that in all of my pain
JOB.6.10	I have never disobeyed God.
JOB.6.11	Why should I patiently hope
JOB.6.11	when my strength is gone?
JOB.6.12	I am not strong as stone
JOB.6.12	or bronze,
JOB.6.13	and I have finally reached
JOB.6.13	the end of my rope.
JOB.6.14	My friends, I am desperate,
JOB.6.14	and you should help me,
JOB.6.14	even if I no longer respect
JOB.6.14	God All-Powerful.
JOB.6.14	* 
JOB.6.15	But you are treacherous
JOB.6.16	like streams that swell
JOB.6.16	with melting snow,
JOB.6.17	then suddenly disappear
JOB.6.17	in the summer heat.
JOB.6.18	I am like a caravan,
JOB.6.18	lost in the desert
JOB.6.18	while searching for water.
JOB.6.19	Caravans from Tema and Sheba
JOB.6.20	thought they would find water.
JOB.6.20	But they were disappointed,
JOB.6.21	just as I am with you.
JOB.6.21	Only one look at my suffering,
JOB.6.21	and you run away scared.
JOB.6.22	Have I ever asked any of you
JOB.6.22	to give me a gift
JOB.6.23	or to purchase my freedom
JOB.6.23	from brutal enemies?
JOB.6.24	What have I done wrong?
JOB.6.24	Show me,
JOB.6.24	and I will keep quiet.
JOB.6.25	The truth is always painful,
JOB.6.25	but your arguments
JOB.6.25	prove nothing.
JOB.6.26	Here I am desperate,
JOB.6.26	and you consider my words
JOB.6.26	as worthless as wind.
JOB.6.27	Why, you would sell an orphan
JOB.6.27	or your own neighbor!
JOB.6.28	Look me straight in the eye;
JOB.6.28	I won't lie to you.
JOB.6.29	Stop accusing me falsely;
JOB.6.29	my reputation is at stake.
JOB.6.30	I know right from wrong,
JOB.6.30	and I am not telling lies.
JOB.7.1	Why is life so hard?
JOB.7.1	Why do we suffer?
JOB.7.2	We are slaves in search of shade;
JOB.7.2	we are laborers longing
JOB.7.2	for our wages.
JOB.7.3	God has made my days drag on
JOB.7.3	and my nights miserable.
JOB.7.4	I pray for night to end,
JOB.7.4	but it stretches out
JOB.7.4	while I toss and turn.
JOB.7.5	My parched skin is covered
JOB.7.5	with worms, dirt, and sores,
JOB.7.6	and my days are running out
JOB.7.6	quicker than the thread
JOB.7.6	of a fast-moving needle.
JOB.7.7	I beg you, God, don't forget!
JOB.7.7	My life is just a breath,
JOB.7.7	and trouble lies ahead.
JOB.7.8	I will vanish from sight,
JOB.7.8	and no one, including you,
JOB.7.8	will ever see me again.
JOB.7.9	or vanish from sight
JOB.7.9	like a passing cloud.
JOB.7.10	Never will I return home;
JOB.7.10	soon I will be forgotten.
JOB.7.11	And so, I cry out to you
JOB.7.11	in agony and distress.
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea or a sea monster?
JOB.7.12	Is that why you imprison me?
JOB.7.13	I go to bed, hoping for rest,
JOB.7.14	but you torture me
JOB.7.14	with terrible dreams.
JOB.7.14	* 
JOB.7.15	I'd rather choke to death
JOB.7.15	than live in this body.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone and let me die;
JOB.7.16	my life has no meaning.
JOB.7.17	about us humans?
JOB.7.18	Why do you test us
JOB.7.18	from sunrise to sunset?
JOB.7.19	Won't you look away
JOB.7.19	just long enough
JOB.7.19	for me to swallow?
JOB.7.20	Why do you watch us so closely?
JOB.7.20	What's it to you, if I sin?
JOB.7.20	Why am I your target
JOB.7.20	and such a heavy burden?
JOB.7.21	Why do you refuse to forgive?
JOB.7.21	Soon you won't find me,
JOB.7.21	because I'll be dead.
JOB.8.1	Bildad from Shuah
JOB.8.2	How long will you talk
JOB.8.2	and keep saying nothing?
JOB.8.3	Does God All-Powerful
JOB.8.3	stand in the way of justice?
JOB.8.4	He made your children pay
JOB.8.4	for their sins.
JOB.8.5	So why don't you turn to him
JOB.8.6	and start living right?
JOB.8.6	Then he will decide
JOB.8.6	to rescue and restore you
JOB.8.6	to your place of honor.
JOB.8.7	Your future will be brighter
JOB.8.7	by far than your past.
JOB.8.8	so learn from them.
JOB.8.9	Our own time has been short,
JOB.8.9	like a fading shadow,
JOB.8.9	and we know very little.
JOB.8.10	But they will instruct you
JOB.8.10	with great understanding.
JOB.8.11	Papyrus reeds grow healthy
JOB.8.11	only in a swamp,
JOB.8.12	and if the water dries up,
JOB.8.12	they die sooner than grass.
JOB.8.13	Such is the hopeless future
JOB.8.13	of all who turn from God
JOB.8.14	and trust in something as frail
JOB.8.14	as a spider's web—
JOB.8.15	they take hold and fall
JOB.8.15	because it's so flimsy.
JOB.8.16	Sinful people are like plants
JOB.8.16	with spreading roots and plenty
JOB.8.16	of sun and water.
JOB.8.17	They wrap their roots tightly
JOB.8.17	around rocks.
JOB.8.18	But once they are pulled up,
JOB.8.18	they have no more place;
JOB.8.19	their life slips away,
JOB.8.19	and other plants grow there.
JOB.8.20	We know God doesn't reject
JOB.8.20	an innocent person
JOB.8.20	or help a sinner.
JOB.8.21	And so, he will make you happy
JOB.8.21	and give you something
JOB.8.21	to smile about.
JOB.8.22	But your evil enemies
JOB.8.22	will be put to shame
JOB.8.22	and disappear forever.
JOB.9.1	Job said:
JOB.9.2	No human is innocent
JOB.9.2	in the sight of God.
JOB.9.3	Not once in a thousand times
JOB.9.3	could we win our case
JOB.9.3	if we took him to court.
JOB.9.4	God is wise and powerful—
JOB.9.4	who could possibly
JOB.9.4	oppose him and win?
JOB.9.5	When God becomes angry,
JOB.9.5	he can move mountains
JOB.9.5	before they even know it.
JOB.9.6	God can shake the earth loose
JOB.9.6	from its foundations
JOB.9.7	to hold back their light.
JOB.9.8	God alone stretched out the sky,
JOB.9.8	stepped on the sea,
JOB.9.9	the Big Dipper and Orion,
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades and the stars
JOB.9.9	in the southern sky.
JOB.9.10	Of all the miracles God works,
JOB.9.10	we cannot understand a one.
JOB.9.11	God walks right past me,
JOB.9.11	without making a sound.
JOB.9.12	And if he grabs something,
JOB.9.12	who can stop him
JOB.9.12	or raise a question?
JOB.9.13	When God showed his anger,
JOB.9.13	the servants of the sea monster
JOB.9.13	fell at his feet.
JOB.9.14	How, then, could I possibly
JOB.9.14	argue my case with God?
JOB.9.15	Even though I am innocent,
JOB.9.15	I can only beg for mercy.
JOB.9.16	And if God came into court
JOB.9.16	when I called him,
JOB.9.16	he would not hear my case.
JOB.9.17	He would strike me with a storm
JOB.9.17	and increase my injuries
JOB.9.17	for no reason at all.
JOB.9.18	Before I could get my breath,
JOB.9.18	my miseries would multiply.
JOB.9.19	God is much stronger than I am,
JOB.9.19	and who would call me into court
JOB.9.19	to give me justice?
JOB.9.20	Even if I were innocent,
JOB.9.20	God would prove me wrong.
JOB.9.21	I am not guilty,
JOB.9.21	but I no longer care
JOB.9.21	what happens to me.
JOB.9.22	What difference does it make?
JOB.9.22	God destroys the innocent
JOB.9.22	along with the guilty.
JOB.9.23	When a good person dies
JOB.9.23	a sudden death,
JOB.9.23	God sits back and laughs.
JOB.9.24	And who else but God
JOB.9.24	blindfolds the judges,
JOB.9.24	then lets the wicked
JOB.9.24	take over the earth?
JOB.9.25	My life is speeding by,
JOB.9.25	without a hope of happiness.
JOB.9.26	Each day passes swifter
JOB.9.26	than a sailing ship
JOB.9.26	or an eagle swooping down.
JOB.9.27	Sometimes I try to be cheerful
JOB.9.27	and to stop complaining,
JOB.9.28	but my sufferings frighten me,
JOB.9.28	because I know that God
JOB.9.28	still considers me guilty.
JOB.9.29	So what's the use of trying
JOB.9.29	to prove my innocence?
JOB.9.30	Even if I washed myself
JOB.9.30	with the strongest soap,
JOB.9.31	God would throw me into a pit
JOB.9.31	of stinking slime, leaving me
JOB.9.31	disgusting to my clothes.
JOB.9.32	God isn't a mere human like me.
JOB.9.32	I can't put him on trial.
JOB.9.33	Who could possibly judge
JOB.9.33	between the two of us?
JOB.9.34	Can someone snatch away
JOB.9.34	the stick God carries
JOB.9.34	to frighten me?
JOB.9.35	Then I could speak up
JOB.9.35	without fear of him,
JOB.9.35	but for now, I cannot speak.
JOB.10.1	I am sick of life!
JOB.10.1	And from my deep despair,
JOB.10.1	I complain to you, my God.
JOB.10.2	Don't just condemn me!
JOB.10.2	Point out my sin.
JOB.10.3	Why do you take such delight
JOB.10.3	in destroying those you created
JOB.10.3	and in smiling on sinners?
JOB.10.4	Do you look at things
JOB.10.4	the way we humans do?
JOB.10.5	Is your life as short as ours?
JOB.10.6	Is that why you are so quick
JOB.10.6	to find fault with me?
JOB.10.7	but who can defend me
JOB.10.7	against you?
JOB.10.8	Will you now destroy
JOB.10.8	someone you created?
JOB.10.9	Remember that you molded me
JOB.10.9	like a piece of clay.
JOB.10.9	So don't turn me back
JOB.10.9	into dust once again.
JOB.10.10	you created my body
JOB.10.10	from a tiny drop.
JOB.10.11	Then you tied my bones together
JOB.10.11	with muscles and covered them
JOB.10.11	with flesh and skin.
JOB.10.12	You, the source of my life,
JOB.10.12	showered me with kindness
JOB.10.12	and watched over me.
JOB.10.13	You have not explained
JOB.10.13	all of your mysteries,
JOB.10.14	but you catch and punish me
JOB.10.14	each time I sin.
JOB.10.15	Guilty or innocent,
JOB.10.15	I am condemned and ashamed
JOB.10.15	because of my troubles.
JOB.10.16	No matter how hard I try,
JOB.10.16	you keep hunting me down
JOB.10.16	like a powerful lion.
JOB.10.17	You never stop accusing me;
JOB.10.17	you become furious and attack
JOB.10.17	over and over again.
JOB.10.18	Why did you let me be born?
JOB.10.18	I would rather have died
JOB.10.18	before birth
JOB.10.19	and been carried to the grave
JOB.10.19	without ever breathing.
JOB.10.20	I have only a few days left.
JOB.10.20	Why don't you leave me alone?
JOB.10.20	Let me find some relief,
JOB.10.20	* 
JOB.10.21	before I travel to the land
JOB.10.22	of darkness and despair,
JOB.10.22	the place of no return.
JOB.11.1	Zophar from Naamah
JOB.11.2	So much foolish talk
JOB.11.2	cannot go unanswered.
JOB.11.3	Your words have silenced others
JOB.11.3	and made them ashamed;
JOB.11.3	now it is only right for you
JOB.11.3	to be put to shame.
JOB.11.4	You claim to be innocent
JOB.11.4	and argue that your beliefs
JOB.11.4	are acceptable to God.
JOB.11.5	But I wish God would speak
JOB.11.6	and let you know that wisdom
JOB.11.6	has many different sides.
JOB.11.6	You would then discover
JOB.11.6	that God has punished you
JOB.11.6	less than you deserve.
JOB.11.7	Can you understand the mysteries
JOB.11.7	surrounding God All-Powerful?
JOB.11.8	They are higher than the heavens
JOB.11.8	and deeper than the grave.
JOB.11.8	So what can you do
JOB.11.8	when you know so little,
JOB.11.9	and these mysteries outreach
JOB.11.9	the earth and the ocean?
JOB.11.10	If God puts you in prison
JOB.11.10	or drags you to court,
JOB.11.10	what can you do?
JOB.11.11	God has the wisdom to know
JOB.11.11	when someone is worthless
JOB.11.11	and sinful,
JOB.11.12	but it's easier to tame
JOB.11.12	a wild donkey
JOB.11.12	than to make a fool wise.
JOB.11.13	Surrender your heart to God,
JOB.11.13	turn to him in prayer,
JOB.11.14	and give up your sins—
JOB.11.14	even those you do in secret.
JOB.11.15	Then you won't be ashamed;
JOB.11.15	you will be confident
JOB.11.15	and fearless.
JOB.11.16	Your troubles will go away
JOB.11.16	like water beneath a bridge,
JOB.11.17	and your darkest night
JOB.11.17	will be brighter than noon.
JOB.11.18	You will rest safe and secure,
JOB.11.18	filled with hope
JOB.11.18	and emptied of worry.
JOB.11.19	You will sleep without fear
JOB.11.19	and be greatly respected.
JOB.11.20	But those who are evil
JOB.11.20	will go blind and lose their way.
JOB.11.20	Their only escape is death!
JOB.12.1	Job said to his friends:
JOB.12.2	You think you are so great,
JOB.12.2	with all the answers.
JOB.12.3	But I know as much as you do,
JOB.12.3	and so does everyone else.
JOB.12.4	I have always lived right,
JOB.12.4	and God answered my prayers;
JOB.12.4	now friends make fun of me.
JOB.12.5	It's easy to condemn
JOB.12.5	those who are suffering,
JOB.12.5	when you have no troubles.
JOB.12.6	Robbers and other godless people
JOB.12.6	live safely at home and say,
JOB.12.6	“God is in our hands!”
JOB.12.7	If you want to learn,
JOB.12.7	then go and ask
JOB.12.7	the wild animals and the birds,
JOB.12.8	the flowers and the fish.
JOB.12.9	Any of them can tell you
JOB.12.9	what the 
JOB.12.10	Every living creature
JOB.12.10	is in the hands of God.
JOB.12.11	We hear with our ears,
JOB.12.11	taste with our tongues,
JOB.12.12	and gain some wisdom from those
JOB.12.12	who have lived a long time.
JOB.12.13	But God is the real source
JOB.12.13	of wisdom and strength.
JOB.12.14	No one can rebuild
JOB.12.14	what he destroys, or release
JOB.12.14	those he has imprisoned.
JOB.12.15	God can hold back the rain
JOB.12.15	or send a flood,
JOB.12.16	just as he rules over liars
JOB.12.16	and those they lie to.
JOB.12.17	God shames counselors,
JOB.12.17	turns judges into fools,
JOB.12.18	and makes slaves of kings.
JOB.12.19	God removes priests and others
JOB.12.19	who have great power—
JOB.12.20	he confuses wise,
JOB.12.20	experienced advisors,
JOB.12.21	puts mighty kings to shame,
JOB.12.21	and takes away their power.
JOB.12.22	God turns darkness to light;
JOB.12.23	he makes nations strong,
JOB.12.23	then shatters their strength.
JOB.12.24	God strikes their rulers senseless,
JOB.12.24	then leaves them to roam
JOB.12.24	through barren deserts,
JOB.12.25	lost in the dark, staggering
JOB.12.25	like someone drunk.
JOB.13.1	I know and understand
JOB.13.1	every bit of this.
JOB.13.2	None of you are smarter
JOB.13.2	than I am;
JOB.13.2	there's nothing you know
JOB.13.2	that I don't.
JOB.13.3	But I prefer to argue my case
JOB.13.3	with God All-Powerful—
JOB.13.4	you are merely useless doctors,
JOB.13.4	who treat me with lies.
JOB.13.5	The wisest thing you can do
JOB.13.5	is to keep quiet 
JOB.13.6	and listen
JOB.13.6	to my argument.
JOB.13.7	Are you telling lies for God
JOB.13.8	and not telling the whole truth
JOB.13.8	when you argue his case?
JOB.13.9	If he took you to court,
JOB.13.9	could you fool him,
JOB.13.9	just as you fool others?
JOB.13.10	If you were secretly unfair,
JOB.13.10	he would correct you,
JOB.13.11	and his glorious splendor
JOB.13.11	would make you terrified.
JOB.13.12	Your wisdom and arguments
JOB.13.12	will blow away like dust.
JOB.13.13	Be quiet while I speak,
JOB.13.13	and we'll see what happens.
JOB.13.14	I will be responsible
JOB.13.14	for what happens to me.
JOB.13.15	God may kill me, but still
JOB.13.15	I will trust him
JOB.13.15	and offer my defense.
JOB.13.16	This may be what saves me,
JOB.13.16	because no guilty person
JOB.13.16	would come to his court.
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my words!
JOB.13.18	I have prepared my case well,
JOB.13.18	and I am certain to win.
JOB.13.19	If you can prove me guilty,
JOB.13.19	I will give up and die.
JOB.13.20	I ask only two things
JOB.13.20	of you, my God,
JOB.13.20	and I will no longer
JOB.13.20	hide from you—
JOB.13.21	stop punishing
JOB.13.21	and terrifying me!
JOB.13.22	Then speak, and I will reply;
JOB.13.22	or else let me speak,
JOB.13.22	and you reply.
JOB.13.23	Please point out my sins,
JOB.13.23	so I will know them.
JOB.13.24	Why have you turned your back
JOB.13.24	and count me your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Do you really enjoy
JOB.13.25	frightening a fallen leaf?
JOB.13.26	Why do you accuse me
JOB.13.26	of horrible crimes
JOB.13.26	and make me pay for sins
JOB.13.26	I did in my youth?
JOB.13.27	and keep me surrounded;
JOB.13.28	I am rotting away like cloth
JOB.13.28	eaten by worms.
JOB.14.1	for every living soul.
JOB.14.2	We are flowers that fade
JOB.14.2	and shadows that vanish.
JOB.14.3	And so, I ask you, God,
JOB.14.3	why pick on me?
JOB.14.4	There's no way a human
JOB.14.4	can be completely pure.
JOB.14.5	Our time on earth is brief;
JOB.14.5	the number of our days
JOB.14.5	is already decided by you.
JOB.14.6	Why don't you leave us alone
JOB.14.6	and let us find some happiness
JOB.14.6	while we toil and labor?
JOB.14.7	When a tree is chopped down,
JOB.14.7	there is always the hope
JOB.14.7	that it will sprout again.
JOB.14.8	Its roots and stump may rot,
JOB.14.9	but at the touch of water,
JOB.14.9	it sprouts once again.
JOB.14.10	Humans are different—
JOB.14.10	we die, and that's the end.
JOB.14.11	We are like streams and lakes
JOB.14.11	after the water has gone;
JOB.14.12	we fall into the sleep of death,
JOB.14.12	never to rise again,
JOB.14.12	until the sky disappears.
JOB.14.13	Please hide me, God,
JOB.14.13	deep in the ground—
JOB.14.13	and when you are angry no more,
JOB.14.13	remember to rescue me.
JOB.14.14	Will we humans live again?
JOB.14.14	I would gladly suffer
JOB.14.14	and wait for my time.
JOB.14.15	My Creator, you would want me;
JOB.14.15	you would call out,
JOB.14.15	and I would answer.
JOB.14.16	You would take care of me,
JOB.14.16	but not count my sins—
JOB.14.17	you would put them in a bag,
JOB.14.17	tie it tight,
JOB.14.17	and toss them away.
JOB.14.18	But in the real world,
JOB.14.18	mountains tumble,
JOB.14.18	and rocks crumble;
JOB.14.19	streams wear away stones
JOB.14.19	and wash away soil.
JOB.14.19	And you destroy our hopes!
JOB.14.20	You change the way we look,
JOB.14.20	then send us away,
JOB.14.20	wiped out forever.
JOB.14.21	We never live to know
JOB.14.21	if our children are praised
JOB.14.21	or disgraced.
JOB.14.22	We feel no pain but our own,
JOB.14.22	and when we mourn,
JOB.14.22	it's only for ourselves.
JOB.15.1	Eliphaz from Teman
JOB.15.1	* 
JOB.15.2	Job, if you had any sense,
JOB.15.3	you would stop spreading
JOB.15.3	all of this hot air.
JOB.15.4	Your words are enough
JOB.15.4	to make others turn from God
JOB.15.4	and lead them to doubt.
JOB.15.5	And your sinful, scheming mind
JOB.15.5	is the source of all you say.
JOB.15.6	I am not here as your judge;
JOB.15.6	your own words are witnesses
JOB.15.6	against you.
JOB.15.7	Were you the first human?
JOB.15.7	Are you older than the hills?
JOB.15.8	Have you ever been present
JOB.15.8	when God's council
JOB.15.8	Do you alone have wisdom?
JOB.15.9	Do you know and understand
JOB.15.9	something we don't?
JOB.15.10	We have the benefit of wisdom
JOB.15.10	older than your father.
JOB.15.11	And you have been offered
JOB.15.11	comforting words from God.
JOB.15.11	Isn't this enough?
JOB.15.12	Your emotions are out of control,
JOB.15.12	making you look fierce;
JOB.15.13	that's why you attack God
JOB.15.13	with everything you say.
JOB.15.15	and neither are angels—
JOB.15.15	not in the sight of God.
JOB.15.15	If God doesn't trust his angels,
JOB.15.16	what chance do humans have?
JOB.15.16	We are so terribly evil
JOB.15.16	that we thirst for sin.
JOB.15.17	Just listen to what I know,
JOB.15.17	and you will learn
JOB.15.18	wisdom known by others
JOB.15.18	since ancient times.
JOB.15.19	Those who gained such insights
JOB.15.19	also gained the land,
JOB.15.19	and they were not influenced
JOB.15.19	by foreign teachings.
JOB.15.20	But suffering is in store
JOB.15.20	each day for those who sin.
JOB.15.21	Even in times of success,
JOB.15.21	they constantly hear
JOB.15.21	the threat of doom.
JOB.15.22	Darkness, despair, and death
JOB.15.22	are their destiny.
JOB.15.23	They scrounge around for food,
JOB.15.23	all the while dreading
JOB.15.23	the approaching darkness.
JOB.15.24	They are overcome with despair,
JOB.15.24	like frightened soldiers facing
JOB.15.24	a fearsome king in battle.
JOB.15.25	This is because they rebelled
JOB.15.25	against God All-Powerful
JOB.15.26	and have attacked him
JOB.15.26	with their weapons.
JOB.15.27	They may be rich and fat,
JOB.15.28	but they will live in the ruins
JOB.15.28	of deserted towns.
JOB.15.29	Their property and wealth
JOB.15.29	will shrink and disappear.
JOB.15.30	They won't escape the darkness,
JOB.15.30	and the blazing breath of God
JOB.15.30	will set their future aflame.
JOB.15.30	* 
JOB.15.31	They have put their trust
JOB.15.31	in something worthless;
JOB.15.31	now they will become worthless
JOB.15.32	like a date palm tree
JOB.15.32	without a leaf.
JOB.15.33	Or like vineyards or orchards
JOB.15.33	whose blossoms and unripe fruit
JOB.15.33	drop to the ground.
JOB.15.34	Yes, the godless and the greedy
JOB.15.34	will have nothing but flames
JOB.15.34	feasting on their homes,
JOB.15.35	because they are the parents
JOB.15.35	of trouble and vicious lies.
JOB.16.1	Job said:
JOB.16.2	I have often heard this,
JOB.16.2	and it offers no comfort.
JOB.16.3	So why don't you keep quiet?
JOB.16.3	What's bothering you?
JOB.16.4	If I were in your place,
JOB.16.4	it would be easy to criticize
JOB.16.4	or to give advice.
JOB.16.5	But I would offer hope
JOB.16.5	and comfort instead.
JOB.16.6	If I speak, or if I don't,
JOB.16.6	I hurt all the same.
JOB.16.6	My torment continues.
JOB.16.7	God has worn me down
JOB.16.7	and destroyed my family;
JOB.16.8	my shriveled up skin proves
JOB.16.8	that I am his prisoner.
JOB.16.9	God is my hateful enemy,
JOB.16.9	glaring at me and attacking
JOB.16.9	with his sharp teeth.
JOB.16.10	Everyone is against me;
JOB.16.10	they sneer and slap my face.
JOB.16.11	And God is the one
JOB.16.11	who handed me over
JOB.16.11	to this merciless mob.
JOB.16.12	Everything was going well,
JOB.16.12	until God grabbed my neck
JOB.16.12	and shook me to pieces.
JOB.16.12	God set me up as the target
JOB.16.13	for his arrows,
JOB.16.13	and without showing mercy,
JOB.16.13	he slashed my stomach open,
JOB.16.13	spilling out my insides.
JOB.16.14	God never stops attacking,
JOB.16.15	and so, in my sorrow
JOB.16.15	I dress in sackcloth
JOB.16.15	and sit in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red with tears,
JOB.16.16	and dark shadows
JOB.16.16	circle my eyes,
JOB.16.17	though I am not violent,
JOB.16.17	and my prayers are sincere.
JOB.16.18	If I should die,
JOB.16.18	I beg the earth not to cover
JOB.16.18	my cry for justice.
JOB.16.19	is both my witness
JOB.16.19	and my protector.
JOB.16.20	My friends have rejected me,
JOB.16.20	but God is the one I beg
JOB.16.21	to show that I am right,
JOB.16.21	just as a friend should.
JOB.16.22	Because in only a few years,
JOB.16.22	I will be dead and gone.
JOB.17.1	My hopes have died,
JOB.17.1	my time is up,
JOB.17.1	and the grave is ready.
JOB.17.2	All I can see are angry crowds,
JOB.17.2	making fun of me.
JOB.17.3	If you, 
JOB.17.3	who will pay the price
JOB.17.3	for my release?
JOB.17.4	My friends won't really listen,
JOB.17.4	all because of you,
JOB.17.4	and so you must be the one
JOB.17.4	to prove them wrong.
JOB.17.5	They have condemned me,
JOB.17.5	just to benefit themselves;
JOB.17.5	now blind their children.
JOB.17.6	You, God, are the reason
JOB.17.6	I am insulted and spit on.
JOB.17.7	I am almost blind with grief;
JOB.17.7	my body is a mere shadow.
JOB.17.8	People who are truly good
JOB.17.8	would feel so alarmed,
JOB.17.8	that they would become angry
JOB.17.8	with my worthless friends.
JOB.17.9	They would do the right thing
JOB.17.9	and because they did,
JOB.17.9	they would grow stronger.
JOB.17.10	But none of my friends
JOB.17.10	show any sense.
JOB.17.11	My life is drawing to an end;
JOB.17.11	hope has disappeared.
JOB.17.12	But all my friends can do
JOB.17.12	is offer empty hopes.
JOB.17.13	I could tell the world below
JOB.17.13	to prepare me a bed.
JOB.17.14	Then I could greet the grave
JOB.17.14	as my father
JOB.17.14	and say to the worms,
JOB.17.14	“Hello, mother and sisters!”
JOB.17.15	But what kind of hope is that?
JOB.17.16	Will it keep me company
JOB.17.16	in the world of the dead?
JOB.18.1	Bildad from Shuah
JOB.18.2	How long will you talk?
JOB.18.2	Be sensible! Let us speak.
JOB.18.3	Or do you think that we
JOB.18.3	are dumb animals?
JOB.18.4	You cut yourself in anger.
JOB.18.4	Will that shake the earth
JOB.18.4	or even move the rocks?
JOB.18.4	* 
JOB.18.5	 The lamps of sinful people
JOB.18.5	soon are snuffed out,
JOB.18.6	leaving their tents dark.
JOB.18.7	Their powerful legs become weak,
JOB.18.7	and they stumble on schemes
JOB.18.7	of their own doing.
JOB.18.7	* 
JOB.18.8	Before they know it,
JOB.18.9	they are trapped in a net,
JOB.18.10	hidden along the path.
JOB.18.11	Terror strikes and pursues
JOB.18.11	from every side.
JOB.18.12	Starving, they run,
JOB.18.12	only to meet disaster,
JOB.18.13	then afterwards to be eaten alive
JOB.18.13	by death itself.
JOB.18.14	Those sinners are dragged
JOB.18.14	from the safety of their tents
JOB.18.14	to die a gruesome death.
JOB.18.15	Then their tents and possessions
JOB.18.15	are burned to ashes,
JOB.18.16	and they are left like trees,
JOB.18.16	dried up from the roots.
JOB.18.17	They are gone and forgotten,
JOB.18.18	thrown far from the light
JOB.18.18	into a world of darkness,
JOB.18.19	without any children
JOB.18.19	to carry on their name.
JOB.18.20	Everyone, from east to west,
JOB.18.20	is overwhelmed with horror.
JOB.18.21	Such is the fate of sinners
JOB.18.21	and their families
JOB.18.21	who don't know God.
JOB.19.1	Job said:
JOB.19.2	How long will you torture me
JOB.19.2	with your words?
JOB.19.3	Isn't ten times enough
JOB.19.3	for you to accuse me?
JOB.19.3	Aren't you ashamed?
JOB.19.4	Even if I have sinned,
JOB.19.4	you haven't been harmed.
JOB.19.5	You boast of your goodness,
JOB.19.5	claiming I am suffering
JOB.19.5	because I am guilty.
JOB.19.6	But God is the one at fault
JOB.19.6	for finding fault with me.
JOB.19.7	Though I pray to be rescued
JOB.19.7	from this torment,
JOB.19.7	no whisper of justice
JOB.19.7	answers me.
JOB.19.8	God has me trapped
JOB.19.8	with a wall of darkness
JOB.19.9	and stripped of respect.
JOB.19.10	God rips me apart,
JOB.19.10	uproots my hopes,
JOB.19.11	and attacks with fierce anger,
JOB.19.11	as though I were his enemy.
JOB.19.12	His entire army advances,
JOB.19.12	then surrounds my tent.
JOB.19.12	* 
JOB.19.13	God has turned relatives
JOB.19.13	and friends against me,
JOB.19.14	and I am forgotten.
JOB.19.15	My guests and my servants
JOB.19.15	consider me a stranger,
JOB.19.16	and when I call my servants,
JOB.19.16	they pay no attention.
JOB.19.17	My breath disgusts my wife;
JOB.19.17	everyone in my family
JOB.19.17	turns away.
JOB.19.18	Young children can't stand me,
JOB.19.18	and when I come near,
JOB.19.18	they make fun.
JOB.19.19	have turned from me.
JOB.19.20	I am skin and bones—
JOB.19.20	just barely alive.
JOB.19.21	My friends, I beg you for pity!
JOB.19.21	God has made me his target.
JOB.19.22	Hasn't he already done enough?
JOB.19.22	Why do you join the attack?
JOB.19.23	I wish that my words
JOB.19.23	could be written down
JOB.19.24	or chiseled into rock.
JOB.19.25	I know that my Protector
JOB.19.25	and at the end
JOB.19.25	he will stand on this earth.
JOB.19.26	My flesh may be destroyed,
JOB.19.26	yet from this body
JOB.19.26	I will see God.
JOB.19.27	Yes, I will see him for myself,
JOB.19.27	and I long for that moment.
JOB.19.28	My friends, you think up ways
JOB.19.28	to blame and torment me, saying
JOB.19.28	I brought it on myself.
JOB.19.29	But watch out for the judgment,
JOB.19.29	when God will punish you!
JOB.20.1	Zophar from Naamah
JOB.20.2	Your words are disturbing;
JOB.20.2	now I must speak.
JOB.20.3	You have accused
JOB.20.3	and insulted me,
JOB.20.3	and reason requires a reply.
JOB.20.4	Since the time of creation,
JOB.20.4	everyone has known
JOB.20.5	that sinful people are happy
JOB.20.5	for only a while.
JOB.20.6	Though their pride and power
JOB.20.6	may reach to the sky,
JOB.20.7	they will disappear like dust,
JOB.20.7	and those who knew them
JOB.20.7	will wonder what happened.
JOB.20.8	like a dream
JOB.20.9	and vanish from the sight
JOB.20.9	of family and friends.
JOB.20.10	Their children will have to repay
JOB.20.10	what the parents took
JOB.20.10	from the poor.
JOB.20.11	Indeed, the wicked will die
JOB.20.11	and go to their graves
JOB.20.11	in the prime of life.
JOB.20.12	Sinners love the taste of sin;
JOB.20.12	they relish every bite
JOB.20.13	and swallow it slowly.
JOB.20.14	But their food will turn sour
JOB.20.14	and poison their stomachs.
JOB.20.15	Then God will make them lose
JOB.20.15	the wealth they gobbled up.
JOB.20.16	They will die from the fangs
JOB.20.16	of poisonous snakes
JOB.20.17	and never enjoy rivers flowing
JOB.20.17	with milk and honey.
JOB.20.18	Their hard work will result
JOB.20.18	in nothing gained,
JOB.20.19	because they cheated the poor
JOB.20.19	and took their homes.
JOB.20.20	Greedy people want everything
JOB.20.20	and are never satisfied.
JOB.20.21	But when nothing remains
JOB.20.21	for them to grab,
JOB.20.21	they will be nothing.
JOB.20.22	Once they have everything,
JOB.20.22	distress and despair
JOB.20.22	will strike them down,
JOB.20.23	and God will make them swallow
JOB.20.23	his blazing anger.
JOB.20.24	they will be killed
JOB.20.24	by arrows of bronze,
JOB.20.25	whose shining tips go straight
JOB.20.25	through their bodies.
JOB.20.25	They will be trapped by terror,
JOB.20.26	and what they treasure most
JOB.20.26	will be lost in the dark.
JOB.20.26	God will send flames
JOB.20.26	to destroy them in their tents
JOB.20.26	with all their property.
JOB.20.27	The heavens and the earth
JOB.20.27	will testify against them,
JOB.20.28	and all their possessions
JOB.20.28	will be dragged off
JOB.20.28	when God becomes angry.
JOB.20.29	This is what God has decided
JOB.20.29	for those who are evil.
JOB.21.1	Job said:
JOB.21.2	If you want to offer comfort,
JOB.21.2	then listen to me.
JOB.21.3	And when I have finished,
JOB.21.3	you can start your insults
JOB.21.3	all over again.
JOB.21.4	My complaint is against God;
JOB.21.4	that's why I am impatient.
JOB.21.5	Just looking at me is enough
JOB.21.5	to make you sick,
JOB.21.6	and the very thought of myself
JOB.21.6	fills me with disgust.
JOB.21.7	Why do evil people live so long
JOB.21.7	and gain such power?
JOB.21.8	Why are they allowed to see
JOB.21.8	their children grow up?
JOB.21.9	They have no worries at home,
JOB.21.9	and God never punishes them.
JOB.21.10	Their cattle have lots of calves
JOB.21.10	without ever losing one;
JOB.21.11	their children play and dance
JOB.21.11	safely by themselves.
JOB.21.12	These people sing and celebrate
JOB.21.12	to the sound of tambourines,
JOB.21.12	small harps, and flutes,
JOB.21.13	and they are successful,
JOB.21.13	without a worry,
JOB.21.13	until the day they die.
JOB.21.14	Those who are evil say
JOB.21.14	to God All-Powerful,
JOB.21.14	“Leave us alone! Don't bother us
JOB.21.14	with your teachings.
JOB.21.15	What do we gain from praying
JOB.21.15	and worshiping you?
JOB.21.16	We succeeded all on our own.”
JOB.21.16	And so, I keep away from them
JOB.21.16	and their evil schemes.
JOB.21.17	How often does God become angry
JOB.21.17	and send disaster and darkness
JOB.21.17	to punish sinners?
JOB.21.18	How often does he strike them
JOB.21.18	like a windstorm
JOB.21.18	that scatters straw?
JOB.21.19	You say, “God will punish
JOB.21.19	those sinners' children
JOB.21.19	in place of those sinners.”
JOB.21.19	But I say, “Let him punish
JOB.21.19	those sinners themselves
JOB.21.19	until they really feel it.
JOB.21.20	Let God All-Powerful force them
JOB.21.20	to drink their own destruction
JOB.21.20	from the cup of his anger.
JOB.21.21	Because after they are dead,
JOB.21.21	they won't care what happens
JOB.21.21	to their children.”
JOB.21.22	Who can tell God what to do?
JOB.21.22	He judges powerful rulers.
JOB.21.22	* 
JOB.21.23	Some of us die prosperous,
JOB.21.24	enjoying good health,
JOB.21.25	while others die in poverty,
JOB.21.25	having known only pain.
JOB.21.26	But we all end up dead,
JOB.21.26	beneath a blanket of worms.
JOB.21.27	My friends, I know that you
JOB.21.27	are plotting against me.
JOB.21.28	You ask, “Where is the home
JOB.21.28	of that important person
JOB.21.28	who does so much evil?”
JOB.21.29	Everyone, near and far, agrees
JOB.21.30	that those who do wrong
JOB.21.30	never suffer disaster,
JOB.21.30	when God becomes angry.
JOB.21.31	No one points out their sin
JOB.21.31	or punishes them.
JOB.21.32	Then at their funerals,
JOB.21.32	they are highly praised;
JOB.21.33	the earth welcomes them home,
JOB.21.33	while crowds mourn.
JOB.21.34	But empty, meaningless words
JOB.21.34	are the comfort you offer me.
JOB.22.1	Eliphaz from Teman
JOB.22.2	to God,
JOB.22.2	even the wisest of us?
JOB.22.3	If you were completely sinless,
JOB.22.3	that would still mean nothing
JOB.22.3	to God All-Powerful.
JOB.22.4	Is he correcting you
JOB.22.4	for worshiping him?
JOB.22.5	No! It's because of
JOB.22.5	your terrible and endless sins.
JOB.22.6	To guarantee payment of a debt,
JOB.22.6	you have taken clothes
JOB.22.6	from innocent people.
JOB.22.7	And you refused bread and water
JOB.22.7	to the hungry and thirsty,
JOB.22.8	although you were rich,
JOB.22.8	respected, and powerful.
JOB.22.9	You have turned away widows
JOB.22.9	and have broken the arms
JOB.22.9	of orphans.
JOB.22.10	That's why you were suddenly
JOB.22.10	trapped by terror,
JOB.22.11	blinded by darkness,
JOB.22.11	and drowned in a flood.
JOB.22.12	God lives in the heavens
JOB.22.12	above the highest stars,
JOB.22.12	where he sees everything.
JOB.22.13	Do you think the deep darkness
JOB.22.13	hides you from God?
JOB.22.14	Do thick clouds cover his eyes,
JOB.22.14	as he walks around heaven's dome
JOB.22.14	high above the earth?
JOB.22.15	Give up those ancient ideas
JOB.22.15	believed by sinners,
JOB.22.16	who were swept away
JOB.22.16	without warning.
JOB.22.17	They rejected God All-Powerful,
JOB.22.17	feeling he was helpless,
JOB.22.18	although he had been kind
JOB.22.18	to their families.
JOB.22.18	The beliefs of these sinners
JOB.22.18	are truly disgusting.
JOB.22.19	When God's people see
JOB.22.19	the godless swept away,
JOB.22.19	they celebrate, 
JOB.22.20	saying,
JOB.22.20	“Our enemies are gone,
JOB.22.20	and fire has destroyed
JOB.22.20	their possessions.”
JOB.22.21	Surrender to God All-Powerful!
JOB.22.21	You will find peace
JOB.22.21	and prosperity.
JOB.22.22	Listen to his teachings
JOB.22.22	and take them to heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to God
JOB.22.23	and turn from sin,
JOB.22.23	all will go well for you.
JOB.22.24	So get rid of your finest gold,
JOB.22.24	as though it were sand.
JOB.22.25	Let God All-Powerful
JOB.22.25	be your silver and gold,
JOB.22.26	and you will find happiness
JOB.22.26	by worshiping him.
JOB.22.27	God will answer your prayers,
JOB.22.27	and you will keep the promises
JOB.22.27	you made to him.
JOB.22.28	He will do whatever you ask,
JOB.22.28	and life will be bright.
JOB.22.29	When others are disgraced,
JOB.22.29	God will clear their names
JOB.22.29	in answer to your prayers.
JOB.22.30	Even those who are guilty
JOB.22.30	will be forgiven,
JOB.22.30	because you obey God.
JOB.23.1	Job said:
JOB.23.2	Today I complain bitterly,
JOB.23.2	because God has been cruel
JOB.23.2	and made me suffer.
JOB.23.3	If I knew where to find God,
JOB.23.3	I would go there
JOB.23.4	and argue my case.
JOB.23.5	Then I would discover
JOB.23.5	what he wanted to say.
JOB.23.6	Would he overwhelm me
JOB.23.6	with his greatness?
JOB.23.6	No! He would listen
JOB.23.7	because I am innocent,
JOB.23.7	and he would say,
JOB.23.7	“I now set you free!”
JOB.23.8	I cannot find God anywhere—
JOB.23.8	in front or back of me,
JOB.23.9	to my left or my right.
JOB.23.9	God is always at work,
JOB.23.9	though I never see him.
JOB.23.10	But he knows what I am doing,
JOB.23.10	and when he tests me,
JOB.23.10	I will be pure as gold.
JOB.23.10	* 
JOB.23.11	I have never refused to follow
JOB.23.11	any of his commands,
JOB.23.12	and I have always treasured
JOB.23.12	his teachings.
JOB.23.13	But he alone is God,
JOB.23.13	and who can oppose him?
JOB.23.13	God does as he pleases,
JOB.23.14	and he will do exactly
JOB.23.14	what he intends with me.
JOB.23.14	* 
JOB.23.15	Merely the thought
JOB.23.15	of God All-Powerful
JOB.23.16	makes me tremble with fear.
JOB.23.17	God has covered me
JOB.23.17	with darkness,
JOB.23.17	but I refuse to be silent.
JOB.24.1	Why doesn't God
JOB.24.1	set a time for court?
JOB.24.1	Why don't his people know
JOB.24.1	where he can be found?
JOB.24.2	Sinners remove boundary markers
JOB.24.2	and take care of sheep
JOB.24.2	they have stolen.
JOB.24.3	They cheat orphans and widows
JOB.24.3	by taking their donkeys
JOB.24.3	and oxen.
JOB.24.4	The poor are trampled
JOB.24.4	and forced to hide
JOB.24.5	in the desert,
JOB.24.5	where they and their children
JOB.24.5	must live like wild donkeys
JOB.24.5	and search for food.
JOB.24.6	If they want grain or grapes,
JOB.24.6	they must go to the property
JOB.24.6	of these sinners.
JOB.24.7	They sleep naked in the cold,
JOB.24.7	because they have no cover,
JOB.24.8	and during a storm
JOB.24.8	their only shelters are caves
JOB.24.8	among the rocky cliffs.
JOB.24.9	Children whose fathers have died
JOB.24.9	are taken from their mothers
JOB.24.9	as payment for a debt.
JOB.24.10	Then they are forced to work
JOB.24.10	naked in the grain fields
JOB.24.10	because they have no clothes,
JOB.24.10	and they go hungry.
JOB.24.11	They crush olives to make oil
JOB.24.11	and grapes to make wine—
JOB.24.11	but still they go thirsty.
JOB.24.12	And along the city streets,
JOB.24.12	the wounded and dying cry out,
JOB.24.12	yet God does nothing.
JOB.24.13	Some rebel and refuse
JOB.24.13	to follow the light.
JOB.24.14	Soon after sunset they murder
JOB.24.14	the poor and the needy,
JOB.24.14	and at night they steal.
JOB.24.15	Others wait for the dark,
JOB.24.15	thinking they won't be seen
JOB.24.15	if they sleep with the wife
JOB.24.15	or husband of someone else.
JOB.24.16	Robbers hide during the day,
JOB.24.16	then break in after dark
JOB.24.16	because they reject the light.
JOB.24.17	They prefer night to day,
JOB.24.17	since the terrors of the night
JOB.24.17	are their friends.
JOB.24.18	Those sinners are filthy foam
JOB.24.18	on the surface of the water.
JOB.24.18	And so, their fields and vineyards
JOB.24.18	will fall under a curse
JOB.24.18	and won't produce.
JOB.24.19	Just as the heat of summer
JOB.24.19	swallows the snow,
JOB.24.19	the world of the dead
JOB.24.19	swallows those who sin.
JOB.24.20	Forgotten here on earth,
JOB.24.20	and with their power broken,
JOB.24.20	they taste sweet to worms.
JOB.24.21	Sinners take advantage of widows
JOB.24.21	and other helpless women.
JOB.24.22	But God's mighty strength
JOB.24.22	destroys those in power.
JOB.24.22	Even if they seem successful,
JOB.24.22	they are doomed to fail.
JOB.24.23	God may let them feel secure,
JOB.24.23	but they are never
JOB.24.23	out of his sight.
JOB.24.24	Great for a while; gone forever!
JOB.24.24	Sinners are mowed down
JOB.24.24	like weeds,
JOB.24.24	then they wither and die.
JOB.24.25	If I haven't spoken the truth,
JOB.24.25	then prove me wrong.
JOB.25.1	Bildad from Shuah
JOB.25.2	God is the one to fear,
JOB.25.2	because God is in control
JOB.25.2	and rules the heavens.
JOB.25.3	Who can count his army of stars?
JOB.25.3	Isn't God the source of light?
JOB.25.4	How can anyone be innocent
JOB.25.4	in the sight of God?
JOB.25.5	To him, not even the light
JOB.25.5	of the moon and stars
JOB.25.5	can ever be pure.
JOB.25.6	So how can we humans,
JOB.25.6	when we are merely worms?
JOB.26.1	Job said:
JOB.26.2	You have really been helpful
JOB.26.2	to someone weak and weary.
JOB.26.3	You have given great advice
JOB.26.3	and wonderful wisdom
JOB.26.3	to someone truly in need.
JOB.26.4	How can anyone possibly speak
JOB.26.4	with such understanding?
JOB.26.5	Remember the terrible trembling
JOB.26.5	of those in the world of the dead
JOB.26.5	below the mighty ocean.
JOB.26.6	Nothing in that land
JOB.26.6	of death and destruction
JOB.26.6	is hidden from God,
JOB.26.7	who hung the northern sky
JOB.26.7	and suspended the earth
JOB.26.7	on empty space.
JOB.26.8	God stores water in clouds,
JOB.26.8	but they don't burst,
JOB.26.9	and he wraps them around
JOB.26.9	the face of the moon.
JOB.26.10	On the surface of the ocean,
JOB.26.10	God has drawn a boundary line
JOB.26.10	between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	And columns supporting the sky
JOB.26.11	tremble at his command.
JOB.26.12	By his power and wisdom,
JOB.26.12	God conquered the force
JOB.26.12	of the mighty ocean.
JOB.26.13	The heavens became bright
JOB.26.13	when he breathed,
JOB.26.13	and the escaping sea monster
JOB.26.13	died at his hands.
JOB.26.14	These things are merely a whisper
JOB.26.14	of God's power at work.
JOB.26.14	How little we would understand
JOB.26.14	if this whisper
JOB.26.14	ever turned into thunder!
JOB.27.1	Job said:
JOB.27.2	I am desperate because
JOB.27.2	God All-Powerful refuses
JOB.27.2	to do what is right.
JOB.27.2	As surely as God lives,
JOB.27.3	and while he gives me breath,
JOB.27.4	I will tell only the truth.
JOB.27.5	Until the day I die,
JOB.27.5	I will refuse to do wrong
JOB.27.5	by saying you are right,
JOB.27.6	because each day my conscience
JOB.27.6	agrees that I am innocent.
JOB.27.7	I pray that my enemies
JOB.27.7	will suffer no less
JOB.27.7	than the wicked.
JOB.27.8	Such people are hopeless,
JOB.27.8	and God All-Powerful
JOB.27.8	will cut them down,
JOB.27.9	without listening
JOB.27.9	when they beg for mercy.
JOB.27.10	And that is what God should do,
JOB.27.10	because they don't like him
JOB.27.10	or ever pray.
JOB.27.11	Now I will explain in detail
JOB.27.11	what God All-Powerful does.
JOB.27.12	All of you have seen these things
JOB.27.12	for yourselves.
JOB.27.12	So you have no excuse.
JOB.27.13	Here is how God All-Powerful
JOB.27.13	treats those who are wicked
JOB.27.13	and brutal.
JOB.27.14	They may have many children,
JOB.27.14	but most of them will go hungry
JOB.27.14	or suffer a violent death.
JOB.27.15	Others will die of disease,
JOB.27.15	and their widows
JOB.27.15	won't be able to weep.
JOB.27.16	The wicked may collect riches
JOB.27.16	and clothes in abundance
JOB.27.16	as easily as clay.
JOB.27.17	But God's people will wear
JOB.27.17	clothes taken from them
JOB.27.17	and divide up their riches.
JOB.27.18	No homes built by the wicked
JOB.27.18	will outlast a cocoon
JOB.27.18	or a shack.
JOB.27.19	Those sinners may go to bed rich,
JOB.27.19	but they will wake up poor.
JOB.27.20	Terror will strike at night
JOB.27.20	like a flood or a storm.
JOB.27.21	Then a scorching wind
JOB.27.21	will sweep them away
JOB.27.22	without showing mercy,
JOB.27.22	as they try to escape.
JOB.27.23	At last, the wind will celebrate
JOB.27.23	because they are gone.
JOB.28.1	Gold and silver are mined,
JOB.28.1	then purified;
JOB.28.2	the same is done
JOB.28.2	with iron and copper.
JOB.28.3	Miners carry lanterns
JOB.28.3	deep into the darkness
JOB.28.3	to search for these metals.
JOB.28.4	They dig tunnels
JOB.28.4	in distant, unknown places,
JOB.28.4	where they dangle by ropes.
JOB.28.5	Far beneath the grain fields,
JOB.28.5	fires are built
JOB.28.5	to break loose those rocks
JOB.28.6	that have jewels or gold.
JOB.28.7	Miners go to places unseen
JOB.28.7	by the eyes of hawks;
JOB.28.8	they walk on soil unknown
JOB.28.8	to the proudest lions.
JOB.28.9	With their own hands
JOB.28.9	they remove sharp rocks
JOB.28.9	and uproot mountains.
JOB.28.10	They dig through the rocks
JOB.28.10	in search of jewels
JOB.28.10	and precious metals.
JOB.28.11	They also uncover
JOB.28.11	the sources of
JOB.28.11	and discover secret places.
JOB.28.14	Nor can it be discovered
JOB.28.14	in the deepest sea.
JOB.28.14	* 
JOB.28.15	It is worth much more
JOB.28.15	than silver or pure gold
JOB.28.16	or precious stones.
JOB.28.17	Nothing is its equal—
JOB.28.17	not gold or costly glass.
JOB.28.18	Wisdom is worth much more than
JOB.28.18	coral, jasper,
JOB.28.19	All the topaz
JOB.28.19	and the finest gold
JOB.28.19	cannot compare with it.
JOB.28.20	Where then is wisdom?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from human eyes
JOB.28.21	and even from birds.
JOB.28.22	Death and destruction
JOB.28.22	have merely heard rumors
JOB.28.22	about where it is found.
JOB.28.23	the way to wisdom;
JOB.28.24	he alone sees everything
JOB.28.24	beneath the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When God divided out
JOB.28.25	the wind and the water,
JOB.28.26	and when he decided the path
JOB.28.26	for rain and lightning,
JOB.28.27	and defined wisdom.
JOB.28.28	that you respect me, the Lord,
JOB.28.28	and turn from sin.”
JOB.29.1	Job said:
JOB.29.2	I long for the past,
JOB.29.2	when God took care of me,
JOB.29.3	and the light from his lamp
JOB.29.3	showed me the way
JOB.29.3	through the dark.
JOB.29.4	I was in the prime of life,
JOB.29.4	God All-Powerful
JOB.29.4	was my closest friend,
JOB.29.5	and all of my children
JOB.29.5	were nearby.
JOB.29.6	My herds gave enough milk
JOB.29.6	to bathe my feet,
JOB.29.6	and from my olive harvest
JOB.29.6	flowed rivers of oil.
JOB.29.6	* 
JOB.29.7	When I sat down at the meeting
JOB.29.7	of the city council,
JOB.29.8	the young leaders stepped aside,
JOB.29.8	* 
JOB.29.9	while the older ones stood
JOB.29.10	and remained silent.
JOB.29.11	Everyone was pleased
JOB.29.11	with what I said and did.
JOB.29.12	When poor people or orphans
JOB.29.12	cried out for help,
JOB.29.12	I came to their rescue.
JOB.29.13	And I was highly praised
JOB.29.13	for my generosity to widows
JOB.29.13	and others in poverty.
JOB.29.14	Kindness and justice
JOB.29.14	were my coat and hat;
JOB.29.15	I was helpful to the blind
JOB.29.15	and to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy,
JOB.29.16	and I defended them in court,
JOB.29.16	even if they were strangers.
JOB.29.17	When criminals attacked,
JOB.29.17	I broke their teeth
JOB.29.17	and set their victims free.
JOB.29.18	I felt certain that I would live
JOB.29.18	a long and happy life,
JOB.29.18	then die in my own bed.
JOB.29.19	In those days I was strong
JOB.29.19	like a tree with deep roots
JOB.29.19	and with plenty of water,
JOB.29.20	or like an archer's new bow.
JOB.29.21	Everyone listened in silence
JOB.29.21	to my welcome advice,
JOB.29.22	and when I finished speaking,
JOB.29.22	nothing needed to be said.
JOB.29.23	My words were eagerly accepted
JOB.29.23	like the showers of spring,
JOB.29.24	and the smile on my face
JOB.29.24	renewed everyone's hopes.
JOB.29.25	My advice was followed
JOB.29.25	as though I were a king
JOB.29.25	leading my troops,
JOB.29.25	or someone comforting
JOB.29.25	those in sorrow.
JOB.30.1	Young people now insult me,
JOB.30.1	although their fathers
JOB.30.1	would have been a disgrace
JOB.30.1	to my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	And those who insult me
JOB.30.2	are helpless themselves.
JOB.30.3	They must claw the desert sand
JOB.30.3	in the dark for something
JOB.30.3	to satisfy their hunger.
JOB.30.4	They gather tasteless shrubs
JOB.30.4	for food and firewood,
JOB.30.5	and they are run out of towns,
JOB.30.5	as though they were thieves.
JOB.30.6	Their only homes are ditches
JOB.30.6	or holes between rocks,
JOB.30.7	where they bray like donkeys
JOB.30.7	gathering around shrubs.
JOB.30.8	And like senseless donkeys
JOB.30.8	they are chased away.
JOB.30.9	Those worthless nobodies
JOB.30.9	make up jokes and songs
JOB.30.9	to disgrace me.
JOB.30.10	They are hateful
JOB.30.10	and keep their distance,
JOB.30.10	even while spitting
JOB.30.10	in my direction.
JOB.30.11	God has destroyed me,
JOB.30.11	and so they don't care
JOB.30.11	what they do.
JOB.30.12	Their attacks never stop,
JOB.30.12	though I am defenseless,
JOB.30.12	and my feet are trapped.
JOB.30.13	Without any help,
JOB.30.13	they prevent my escape,
JOB.30.13	destroying me completely
JOB.30.14	and leaving me crushed.
JOB.30.15	Terror has me surrounded;
JOB.30.15	my reputation and my riches
JOB.30.15	have vanished like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	I am sick at heart!
JOB.30.16	Pain has taken its toll.
JOB.30.17	Night chews on my bones,
JOB.30.17	causing endless torment,
JOB.30.18	and God has shrunk my skin,
JOB.30.18	choking me to death.
JOB.30.19	I have been thrown in the dirt
JOB.30.19	and now am dirt myself.
JOB.30.20	I beg God for help,
JOB.30.20	but there is no answer;
JOB.30.20	and when I stand up,
JOB.30.20	he simply stares.
JOB.30.21	God has turned brutal,
JOB.30.22	stirring up a windstorm
JOB.30.22	to toss me about.
JOB.30.23	Soon he will send me home
JOB.30.23	to the world of the dead,
JOB.30.23	where we all must go.
JOB.30.24	No one refuses help to others,
JOB.30.24	when disaster strikes.
JOB.30.25	I mourned for the poor
JOB.30.25	and those who suffered.
JOB.30.26	But when I beg for relief
JOB.30.26	and light,
JOB.30.26	all I receive are disaster
JOB.30.26	and darkness.
JOB.30.27	My stomach is tied in knots;
JOB.30.27	pain is my daily companion.
JOB.30.28	My days are dark and gloomy
JOB.30.28	and in the city council
JOB.30.28	I stand and cry out,
JOB.30.29	making mournful sounds
JOB.30.29	like jackals
JOB.30.30	My skin is so parched,
JOB.30.30	that it peels right off,
JOB.30.30	and my bones are burning.
JOB.30.31	My only songs are sorrow
JOB.30.31	and sadness.
JOB.31.1	I promised myself
JOB.31.1	never to stare with desire
JOB.31.1	at a young woman.
JOB.31.2	God All-Powerful punishes
JOB.31.2	men who do that.
JOB.31.3	In fact, God sends disaster
JOB.31.3	on all who sin,
JOB.31.4	and he keeps a close watch
JOB.31.4	on everything I do.
JOB.31.5	I am not dishonest or deceitful,
JOB.31.6	and I beg God to prove
JOB.31.6	my innocence.
JOB.31.7	If I have disobeyed him
JOB.31.7	or even wanted to,
JOB.31.8	then others can eat my harvest
JOB.31.8	and uproot my crops.
JOB.31.9	If I have desired someone's wife
JOB.31.9	and chased after her,
JOB.31.10	then let some stranger
JOB.31.10	steal my wife from me.
JOB.31.11	If I took someone's wife,
JOB.31.11	it would be a horrible crime,
JOB.31.12	sending me to destruction
JOB.31.12	and my crops to the flames.
JOB.31.13	When my servants
JOB.31.13	complained against me,
JOB.31.13	I was fair to them.
JOB.31.14	Otherwise, what answer
JOB.31.14	would I give to God
JOB.31.14	when he judges me?
JOB.31.15	After all, God is the one
JOB.31.15	who gave life to each of us
JOB.31.15	before we were born.
JOB.31.16	or others in need,
JOB.31.17	and I have always shared
JOB.31.17	my food with orphans.
JOB.31.18	Since the time I was young,
JOB.31.18	I have cared for orphans
JOB.31.18	and helped widows.
JOB.31.19	I provided clothes for the poor,
JOB.31.20	and I was praised
JOB.31.20	for supplying woolen garments
JOB.31.20	to keep them warm.
JOB.31.21	If I have ever raised my arm
JOB.31.21	to threaten an orphan
JOB.31.21	when the power was mine,
JOB.31.22	I hope that arm will fall
JOB.31.22	from its socket.
JOB.31.23	I could not have been abusive;
JOB.31.23	I was terrified at the thought
JOB.31.23	that God might punish me.
JOB.31.24	the power of wealth,
JOB.31.25	or taken pride in owning
JOB.31.25	many possessions.
JOB.31.25	* 
JOB.31.26	I have never openly or secretly
JOB.31.27	worshiped the sun or moon.
JOB.31.28	Such horrible sins
JOB.31.28	would have deserved
JOB.31.28	punishment from God.
JOB.31.29	I have never laughed
JOB.31.29	when my enemies
JOB.31.29	were struck by disaster.
JOB.31.30	Neither have I sinned
JOB.31.30	by asking God
JOB.31.30	to send down on them
JOB.31.30	the curse of death.
JOB.31.31	No one ever went hungry
JOB.31.31	at my house,
JOB.31.32	and travelers
JOB.31.32	were always welcome.
JOB.31.33	Many have attempted to hide
JOB.31.33	their sins from others—
JOB.31.33	but I refused.
JOB.31.34	And the fear of public disgrace
JOB.31.34	never forced me to keep silent
JOB.31.34	about what I had done.
JOB.31.35	Why doesn't God All-Powerful
JOB.31.35	listen and answer?
JOB.31.35	If God has something against me,
JOB.31.35	let him speak up
JOB.31.35	or put it in writing!
JOB.31.36	Then I would wear his charges
JOB.31.36	on my clothes and forehead.
JOB.31.37	And with my head held high,
JOB.31.37	I would tell him everything
JOB.31.37	I have ever done.
JOB.31.38	I have never mistreated
JOB.31.38	the land I farmed
JOB.31.38	and made it mourn.
JOB.31.39	Nor have I cheated
JOB.31.39	my workers
JOB.31.39	and caused them pain.
JOB.31.40	If I had, I would pray
JOB.31.40	for weeds instead of wheat
JOB.31.40	to grow in my fields.
JOB.31.40	After saying these things,
JOB.31.40	Job was silent.
JOB.32.1	Finally, these three men stopped arguing with Job, because he refused to admit he was guilty.
JOB.32.2	Elihu from Buz
JOB.32.3	He was also angry with Job's three friends for not being able to prove that Job was wrong. 
JOB.32.4	Elihu was younger than these three, and he let them speak first. 
JOB.32.5	But he became irritated when they could not answer Job, 
JOB.32.6	and he said to them:
JOB.32.6	I am much younger than you,
JOB.32.6	so I have shown respect
JOB.32.6	by keeping silent.
JOB.32.7	I once believed age
JOB.32.7	was the source of wisdom;
JOB.32.8	now I truly realize
JOB.32.8	wisdom comes from God.
JOB.32.9	Age is no guarantee of wisdom
JOB.32.9	and understanding.
JOB.32.10	That's why I ask you
JOB.32.10	to listen to me.
JOB.32.10	* 
JOB.32.11	I eagerly listened
JOB.32.11	to each of your arguments,
JOB.32.12	but not one of you proved
JOB.32.12	Job to be wrong.
JOB.32.13	You shouldn't say,
JOB.32.13	“We know what's right!
JOB.32.13	Let God punish him.”
JOB.32.14	Job hasn't spoken against me,
JOB.32.14	and so I won't answer him
JOB.32.14	with your arguments.
JOB.32.15	All of you are shocked;
JOB.32.15	you don't know what to say.
JOB.32.16	But am I to remain silent,
JOB.32.16	just because you
JOB.32.16	have stopped speaking?
JOB.32.17	No! I will give my opinion,
JOB.32.18	because I have so much to say,
JOB.32.18	that I can't keep quiet.
JOB.32.19	I am like a swollen wineskin,
JOB.32.19	and I will burst
JOB.32.20	if I don't speak.
JOB.32.20	* 
JOB.32.21	I don't know how to be unfair
JOB.32.21	or to flatter anyone—
JOB.32.22	if I did, my Creator
JOB.32.22	would quickly destroy me!
JOB.33.1	Job, listen to me!
JOB.33.1	Pay close attention.
JOB.33.1	* 
JOB.33.2	Everything I will say
JOB.33.3	is true and sincere,
JOB.33.4	just as surely as the Spirit
JOB.33.4	of God All-Powerful
JOB.33.4	gave me the breath of life.
JOB.33.5	Now line up your arguments
JOB.33.5	and prepare to face me.
JOB.33.6	We each were made from clay,
JOB.33.6	and God has no favorites,
JOB.33.7	so don't be afraid of me
JOB.33.7	or what I might do.
JOB.33.8	I have heard you argue
JOB.33.9	that you are innocent,
JOB.33.9	guilty of nothing.
JOB.33.10	You claim that God
JOB.33.10	has made you his enemy,
JOB.33.11	and blocked your path.
JOB.33.12	But, Job, you're wrong—
JOB.33.12	God is greater
JOB.33.12	than any human.
JOB.33.13	So why do you challenge God
JOB.33.13	to answer you?
JOB.33.14	God speaks in different ways,
JOB.33.14	and we don't always
JOB.33.14	recognize his voice.
JOB.33.14	* 
JOB.33.15	 Sometimes in the night,
JOB.33.15	he uses terrifying dreams
JOB.33.16	to give us warnings.
JOB.33.17	God does this to make us turn
JOB.33.17	from sin and pride
JOB.33.18	and to protect us
JOB.33.18	from being swept away
JOB.33.18	to the world of the dead.
JOB.33.19	Sometimes we are punished
JOB.33.19	with a serious illness
JOB.33.19	and aching joints.
JOB.33.20	Merely the thought
JOB.33.20	of our favorite food
JOB.33.20	makes our stomachs sick,
JOB.33.21	and we become so skinny
JOB.33.21	that our bones stick out.
JOB.33.22	We feel death and the grave
JOB.33.22	taking us in their grip.
JOB.33.23	One of a thousand angels
JOB.33.23	then comes to our rescue
JOB.33.23	by saying we are innocent.
JOB.33.24	The angel shows kindness,
JOB.33.24	commanding death to release us,
JOB.33.24	because the price was paid.
JOB.33.25	Our health is restored,
JOB.33.25	we feel young again,
JOB.33.26	and we ask God to accept us.
JOB.33.26	Then we joyfully worship God,
JOB.33.26	and we are rewarded
JOB.33.26	because we are innocent.
JOB.33.27	When that happens,
JOB.33.27	we tell everyone,
JOB.33.27	“I sinned and did wrong,
JOB.33.27	but God forgave me
JOB.33.28	and rescued me from death!
JOB.33.28	Now I will see the light.”
JOB.33.29	God gives each of us
JOB.33.29	chance after chance
JOB.33.30	to be saved from death
JOB.33.30	and brought into the light
JOB.33.30	that gives life.
JOB.33.31	So, Job, pay attention
JOB.33.31	and don't interrupt,
JOB.33.32	though I would gladly listen
JOB.33.32	to anything you say
JOB.33.32	that proves you are right.
JOB.33.33	Otherwise, listen in silence
JOB.33.33	to my wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Elihu said:
JOB.34.2	You men think you are wise,
JOB.34.2	but just listen to me!
JOB.34.3	Think about my words,
JOB.34.3	as you would taste food.
JOB.34.4	Then we can decide the case
JOB.34.4	and give a just verdict.
JOB.34.5	Job claims he is innocent
JOB.34.5	and God is guilty
JOB.34.5	of mistreating him.
JOB.34.6	Job also argues that God
JOB.34.6	considers him a liar
JOB.34.6	and that he is suffering severely
JOB.34.6	in spite of his innocence.
JOB.34.7	But to tell the truth,
JOB.34.7	Job is shameless!
JOB.34.8	He spends his time with sinners,
JOB.34.9	because he has said,
JOB.34.9	“It doesn't pay to please God.”
JOB.34.10	If any of you are smart,
JOB.34.10	you will listen and learn
JOB.34.10	that God All-Powerful
JOB.34.10	does what is right.
JOB.34.11	the way they deserve,
JOB.34.12	and he is never unfair.
JOB.34.13	From the very beginning,
JOB.34.13	God has been in control
JOB.34.13	of all the world.
JOB.34.14	If God took back the breath
JOB.34.14	that he breathed into us,
JOB.34.15	we humans would die
JOB.34.15	and return to the soil.
JOB.34.16	So be smart and listen!
JOB.34.17	The mighty God is the one
JOB.34.17	who brings about justice,
JOB.34.17	and you are condemning him.
JOB.34.18	Indeed, God is the one
JOB.34.18	who condemns unfair rulers.
JOB.34.19	And God created us all;
JOB.34.19	he has no favorites,
JOB.34.19	whether rich or poor.
JOB.34.20	Even powerful rulers die
JOB.34.20	in the darkness of night
JOB.34.20	when they least expect it,
JOB.34.20	just like the rest of us.
JOB.34.21	God watches everything we do.
JOB.34.22	No evil person can hide
JOB.34.22	in the deepest darkness.
JOB.34.23	And so, God doesn't need
JOB.34.23	to set a time for judgment.
JOB.34.24	Without asking for advice,
JOB.34.24	God removes mighty leaders
JOB.34.24	and puts others in their place.
JOB.34.25	He knows what they are like,
JOB.34.25	and he wipes them out
JOB.34.25	in the middle of the night.
JOB.34.26	And while others look on,
JOB.34.26	he punishes them
JOB.34.26	because they were evil
JOB.34.27	and refused to obey him.
JOB.34.28	The persons they mistreated
JOB.34.28	had prayed for help,
JOB.34.28	until God answered
JOB.34.28	their prayers.
JOB.34.29	When God does nothing,
JOB.34.29	can any person or nation
JOB.34.29	find fault with him?
JOB.34.30	But still, he punishes rulers
JOB.34.30	who abuse their people.
JOB.34.31	Job, you should tell God
JOB.34.31	that you are guilty
JOB.34.31	and promise to do better.
JOB.34.32	Then ask him to point out
JOB.34.32	what you did wrong,
JOB.34.32	so you won't do it again.
JOB.34.33	Do you make the rules,
JOB.34.33	or does God?
JOB.34.33	You have to decide—
JOB.34.33	I can't do it for you;
JOB.34.33	now make up your mind.
JOB.34.34	Job, anyone with good sense
JOB.34.34	can easily see
JOB.34.35	that you are speaking nonsense
JOB.34.35	and lack good judgment.
JOB.34.36	So I pray for you to suffer
JOB.34.36	as much as possible
JOB.34.36	for talking like a sinner.
JOB.34.37	You have rebelled against God,
JOB.34.37	time after time,
JOB.34.37	and have even insulted us.
JOB.35.1	Elihu said:
JOB.35.2	Job, are you really innocent
JOB.35.2	in the sight of God?
JOB.35.3	Don't you honestly believe
JOB.35.3	it pays to obey him?
JOB.35.4	I will give the answers
JOB.35.4	to you and your friends.
JOB.35.4	* 
JOB.35.5	Look up to the heavens
JOB.35.6	Do your sins hurt God?
JOB.35.7	Is any good you may have done
JOB.35.7	at all helpful to him?
JOB.35.8	The evil or good you do
JOB.35.8	only affects other humans.
JOB.35.9	In times of trouble,
JOB.35.9	everyone begs the mighty God
JOB.35.9	to have mercy.
JOB.35.10	But after their Creator
JOB.35.10	helps them through hard times,
JOB.35.10	they forget about him,
JOB.35.11	though he makes us wiser
JOB.35.11	than animals or birds.
JOB.35.12	God won't listen to the prayers
JOB.35.12	of proud and evil people.
JOB.35.13	If God All-Powerful refuses
JOB.35.13	to answer their empty prayers,
JOB.35.14	he will surely deny
JOB.35.14	your impatient request
JOB.35.14	to face him in court.
JOB.35.15	Job, you were wrong to say
JOB.35.15	God doesn't punish sin.
JOB.35.16	Everything you have said
JOB.35.16	adds up to nonsense.
JOB.36.1	Elihu said:
JOB.36.2	Be patient a while longer;
JOB.36.2	I have something else to say
JOB.36.2	in God's defense.
JOB.36.3	God always does right—
JOB.36.3	and this knowledge
JOB.36.3	comes straight from God.
JOB.36.4	You can rest assured
JOB.36.4	that what I say is true.
JOB.36.5	Although God is mighty,
JOB.36.5	he cares about everyone
JOB.36.5	and makes fair decisions.
JOB.36.6	The wicked are cut down,
JOB.36.6	and those who are wronged
JOB.36.6	receive justice.
JOB.36.7	God watches over good people
JOB.36.7	and places them in positions
JOB.36.7	of power and honor forever.
JOB.36.8	But when people are prisoners
JOB.36.8	of suffering and pain,
JOB.36.8	* 
JOB.36.9	God points out their sin
JOB.36.9	and their pride,
JOB.36.10	then he warns them
JOB.36.10	to turn back to him.
JOB.36.11	And if they obey,
JOB.36.11	they will be successful
JOB.36.11	and happy from then on.
JOB.36.12	But if they foolishly refuse,
JOB.36.12	they will be rewarded
JOB.36.12	with a violent death.
JOB.36.13	Godless people are too angry
JOB.36.13	to ask God for help
JOB.36.13	when he punishes them.
JOB.36.14	So they die young
JOB.36.14	in shameful disgrace.
JOB.36.15	Hard times and trouble
JOB.36.15	are God's way
JOB.36.15	of getting our attention!
JOB.36.16	And at this very moment,
JOB.36.16	God deeply desires
JOB.36.16	to lead you from trouble
JOB.36.16	and to spread your table
JOB.36.16	with your favorite food.
JOB.36.17	Now that the judgment
JOB.36.17	for your sins
JOB.36.17	has fallen upon you,
JOB.36.18	don't let your anger
JOB.36.18	and the pain you endured
JOB.36.18	make you sneer at God.
JOB.36.19	Your reputation and riches
JOB.36.19	cannot protect you
JOB.36.19	from distress,
JOB.36.20	nor can you find safety
JOB.36.20	in the dark world below.
JOB.36.21	Be on guard! Don't turn to evil
JOB.36.21	as a way of escape.
JOB.36.22	God's power is unlimited.
JOB.36.22	He needs no teachers
JOB.36.23	to guide or correct him.
JOB.36.24	Others have praised God
JOB.36.24	for what he has done,
JOB.36.24	so join with them.
JOB.36.25	From down here on earth,
JOB.36.25	everyone has looked up and seen
JOB.36.26	how great God is—
JOB.36.26	God is more than we imagine;
JOB.36.26	no one can count the years
JOB.36.26	he has lived.
JOB.36.26	* 
JOB.36.27	God gathers moisture
JOB.36.27	into the clouds
JOB.36.28	and supplies us with rain.
JOB.36.29	Who can understand
JOB.36.29	how God scatters the clouds
JOB.36.29	and speaks from his home
JOB.36.29	in the thunderstorm?
JOB.36.30	And when God sends lightning,
JOB.36.30	it can be seen
JOB.36.30	at the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	By producing such rainstorms,
JOB.36.31	God rules the world
JOB.36.31	and provides us with food.
JOB.36.32	Each flash of lightning
JOB.36.32	is one of his arrows
JOB.36.32	striking its target,
JOB.36.33	and the thunder tells
JOB.36.33	of his anger against sin.
JOB.37.1	I am frightened
JOB.37.1	and tremble all over,
JOB.37.2	when I hear the roaring voice
JOB.37.2	of God in the thunder,
JOB.37.3	and when I see his lightning
JOB.37.3	flash across the sky.
JOB.37.4	God's majestic voice
JOB.37.4	thunders his commands,
JOB.37.5	creating miracles too marvelous
JOB.37.5	for us to understand.
JOB.37.6	Snow and heavy rainstorms
JOB.37.7	make us stop and think
JOB.37.7	about God's power,
JOB.37.8	and they force animals
JOB.37.8	to seek shelter.
JOB.37.9	The windstorms of winter strike,
JOB.37.10	and the breath of God
JOB.37.10	freezes streams and rivers.
JOB.37.11	Rain clouds filled with lightning
JOB.37.11	appear at God's command,
JOB.37.12	traveling across the sky
JOB.37.13	to release their cargo—
JOB.37.13	sometimes as punishment for sin,
JOB.37.13	sometimes as kindness.
JOB.37.14	Job, consider carefully
JOB.37.14	the many wonders of God.
JOB.37.15	Can you explain why lightning
JOB.37.15	flashes at the orders
JOB.37.16	of God who knows all things?
JOB.37.16	Or how he hangs the clouds
JOB.37.16	in empty space?
JOB.37.17	You almost melt in the heat
JOB.37.17	of fierce desert winds
JOB.37.17	when the sky is like brass.
JOB.37.18	God can hammer out the clouds
JOB.37.18	in spite of the oppressive heat,
JOB.37.18	but can you?
JOB.37.19	Tell us what to say to God!
JOB.37.19	Our minds are in the dark,
JOB.37.19	and we don't know how
JOB.37.19	to argue our case.
JOB.37.20	Should I risk my life
JOB.37.20	by telling God
JOB.37.20	that I want to speak?
JOB.37.21	No one can stare at the sun
JOB.37.21	after a breeze has blown
JOB.37.21	the clouds from the sky.
JOB.37.22	Yet the glorious splendor
JOB.37.22	of God All-Powerful
JOB.37.22	is brighter by far.
JOB.37.23	God cannot be seen—
JOB.37.23	but his power is great,
JOB.37.23	and he is always fair.
JOB.37.24	And so we humans fear God,
JOB.37.24	because he shows no respect
JOB.37.24	for those who are proud
JOB.37.24	and think they know so much.
JOB.38.1	From out of a storm,
JOB.38.1	the 
JOB.38.2	Why do you talk so much
JOB.38.2	when you know so little?
JOB.38.3	Now get ready to face me!
JOB.38.3	Can you answer
JOB.38.3	the questions I ask?
JOB.38.4	How did I lay the foundation
JOB.38.4	for the earth?
JOB.38.4	Were you there?
JOB.38.5	Doubtless you know who decided
JOB.38.5	its length and width.
JOB.38.6	What supports the foundation?
JOB.38.6	Who placed the cornerstone,
JOB.38.7	and angels rejoiced?
JOB.38.8	I set its boundaries
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in blankets
JOB.38.9	of thickest fog.
JOB.38.10	Then I built a wall around it,
JOB.38.10	locked the gates, 
JOB.38.11	and said,
JOB.38.11	“Your powerful waves stop here!
JOB.38.11	They can go no farther.”
JOB.38.12	Did you ever tell the sun to rise?
JOB.38.12	And did it obey?
JOB.38.13	Did it take hold of the earth
JOB.38.13	and shake out the wicked
JOB.38.13	like dust from a rug?
JOB.38.14	Early dawn outlines the hills
JOB.38.14	like stitches on clothing
JOB.38.14	or sketches on clay.
JOB.38.15	But its light is too much
JOB.38.15	for those who are evil,
JOB.38.15	and their power is broken.
JOB.38.16	Job, have you ever walked
JOB.38.16	on the ocean floor?
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gate
JOB.38.17	to the world of the dead?
JOB.38.18	And how large is the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell me, if you know!
JOB.38.19	Where is the home of light,
JOB.38.19	and where does darkness live?
JOB.38.20	Can you lead them home?
JOB.38.21	I'm certain you must be able to,
JOB.38.21	since you were already born
JOB.38.21	when I created everything.
JOB.38.22	Have you been to the places
JOB.38.22	where I keep snow and hail,
JOB.38.23	until I use them to punish
JOB.38.23	and conquer nations?
JOB.38.24	From where does lightning leap,
JOB.38.24	or the east wind blow?
JOB.38.25	Who carves out a path
JOB.38.25	for thunderstorms?
JOB.38.25	Who sends torrents of rain
JOB.38.26	on empty deserts
JOB.38.26	where no one lives?
JOB.38.27	Rain that changes barren land
JOB.38.27	to meadows green with grass.
JOB.38.28	Who is the father of the dew
JOB.38.28	and of the rain?
JOB.38.29	Who gives birth to the sleet
JOB.38.29	and the frost
JOB.38.30	that fall in winter,
JOB.38.30	when streams and lakes
JOB.38.30	freeze solid as a rock?
JOB.38.31	such as Orion
JOB.38.31	and the Pleiades?
JOB.38.32	Do you control the stars
JOB.38.32	or set in place the Big Dipper
JOB.38.32	and the Little Dipper?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws
JOB.38.33	that govern the heavens,
JOB.38.33	and can you make them rule
JOB.38.33	the earth?
JOB.38.34	Can you order the clouds
JOB.38.34	to send a downpour,
JOB.38.35	or will lightning flash
JOB.38.35	at your command?
JOB.38.36	Did you teach birds to know
JOB.38.36	that rain or floods
JOB.38.36	are on their way?
JOB.38.37	Can you count the clouds
JOB.38.37	or pour out their water
JOB.38.38	on the dry, lumpy soil?
JOB.38.39	When lions are hungry,
JOB.38.39	do you help them hunt?
JOB.38.40	Do you send an animal
JOB.38.40	into their den?
JOB.38.41	And when starving young ravens
JOB.38.41	cry out to me for food,
JOB.38.41	do you satisfy their hunger?
JOB.39.1	When do mountain goats
JOB.39.1	and deer give birth?
JOB.39.1	Have you been there
JOB.39.1	when their young are born?
JOB.39.1	* 
JOB.39.2	How long are they pregnant
JOB.39.3	before they deliver?
JOB.39.4	Soon their young grow strong
JOB.39.4	and then leave
JOB.39.4	to be on their own.
JOB.39.5	Who set wild donkeys free?
JOB.39.6	I alone help them survive
JOB.39.6	in salty desert sand.
JOB.39.7	They stay far from crowded cities
JOB.39.7	and refuse to be tamed.
JOB.39.8	Instead, they roam the hills,
JOB.39.8	searching for pastureland.
JOB.39.9	Would a wild ox agree
JOB.39.9	to live in your barn
JOB.39.9	and labor for you?
JOB.39.10	Could you force him to plow
JOB.39.10	or to drag a heavy log
JOB.39.10	to smooth out the soil?
JOB.39.11	Can you depend on him
JOB.39.11	to use his great strength
JOB.39.11	and do your heavy work?
JOB.39.12	Can you trust him
JOB.39.12	to harvest your grain
JOB.39.12	or take it to your barn
JOB.39.12	from the threshing place?
JOB.39.13	An ostrich proudly
JOB.39.13	flaps her wings,
JOB.39.13	but not because
JOB.39.13	she loves her young.
JOB.39.14	She abandons her eggs
JOB.39.14	and lets the dusty ground
JOB.39.14	keep them warm.
JOB.39.15	And she doesn't seem to worry
JOB.39.15	that the feet of an animal
JOB.39.15	could crush them all.
JOB.39.16	She treats her eggs as though
JOB.39.16	they were not her own,
JOB.39.16	unconcerned that her work
JOB.39.16	might be for nothing.
JOB.39.17	I myself made her foolish
JOB.39.17	and without common sense.
JOB.39.18	But once she starts running,
JOB.39.18	she laughs at a rider
JOB.39.18	on the fastest horse.
JOB.39.19	Did you give horses their strength
JOB.39.19	and the flowing hair
JOB.39.19	along their necks?
JOB.39.20	Did you make them able
JOB.39.20	to jump like grasshoppers
JOB.39.20	or to frighten people
JOB.39.20	with their snorting?
JOB.39.21	Before horses are ridden
JOB.39.21	into battle,
JOB.39.21	they paw at the ground,
JOB.39.21	proud of their strength.
JOB.39.22	Laughing at fear, they rush
JOB.39.22	toward the fighting,
JOB.39.23	while the weapons of their riders
JOB.39.23	rattle and flash in the sun.
JOB.39.24	Unable to stand still,
JOB.39.24	they gallop eagerly into battle
JOB.39.24	when trumpets blast.
JOB.39.25	Stirred by the distant smells
JOB.39.25	and sounds of war, they snort
JOB.39.25	in reply to the trumpet.
JOB.39.26	Did you teach hawks to fly south
JOB.39.26	for the winter?
JOB.39.26	* 
JOB.39.27	Did you train eagles
JOB.39.28	their nests on rocky cliffs,
JOB.39.29	where they can look down
JOB.39.29	to spot their next meal?
JOB.39.30	wherever the victim lies.
JOB.40.1	I am the 
JOB.40.2	but you have argued
JOB.40.2	that I am wrong.
JOB.40.2	Now you must answer me.
JOB.40.3	Job said to the 
JOB.40.4	Who am I to answer you?
JOB.40.5	I did speak once or twice,
JOB.40.5	but never again.
JOB.40.6	Then out of the storm
JOB.40.6	the 
JOB.40.7	Face me and answer
JOB.40.7	the questions I ask!
JOB.40.8	Are you trying to prove
JOB.40.8	that you are innocent
JOB.40.8	by accusing me of injustice?
JOB.40.9	Do you have a powerful arm
JOB.40.9	and a thundering voice
JOB.40.9	that compare with mine?
JOB.40.10	If so, then surround yourself
JOB.40.10	with glory and majesty.
JOB.40.10	* 
JOB.40.11	Show your furious anger!
JOB.40.11	Throw down and crush
JOB.40.12	all who are proud and evil.
JOB.40.13	Wrap them in grave clothes
JOB.40.13	and bury them together
JOB.40.13	in the dusty soil.
JOB.40.14	Do this, and I will agree
JOB.40.14	that you have won
JOB.40.14	this argument.
JOB.40.15	I created both you
JOB.40.15	and the hippopotamus.
JOB.40.15	It eats only grass like an ox,
JOB.40.16	but look at the mighty muscles
JOB.40.16	in its body 
JOB.40.17	and legs.
JOB.40.17	Its tail is like a cedar tree,
JOB.40.17	and its thighs are thick.
JOB.40.18	The bones in its legs
JOB.40.18	are like bronze or iron.
JOB.40.19	I made it more powerful
JOB.40.19	than any other creature,
JOB.40.19	yet I am stronger still.
JOB.40.20	Undisturbed, it eats grass
JOB.40.20	while the other animals
JOB.40.20	play nearby.
JOB.40.20	* 
JOB.40.21	It rests in the shade of trees
JOB.40.21	along the riverbank
JOB.40.22	or hides among reeds
JOB.40.22	in the swamp.
JOB.40.23	It remains calm and unafraid
JOB.40.23	with the Jordan River rushing
JOB.40.23	and splashing in its face.
JOB.40.24	There is no way to capture
JOB.40.24	a hippopotamus—
JOB.40.24	not even by hooking its nose
JOB.40.24	or blinding its eyes.
JOB.41.1	by using a fishhook?
JOB.41.1	Can you tie its mouth shut
JOB.41.1	with a rope?
JOB.41.2	Can it be led around
JOB.41.2	by a ring in its nose
JOB.41.2	or a hook in its jaw?
JOB.41.3	Will it beg for mercy?
JOB.41.4	Will it surrender
JOB.41.4	as a slave for life?
JOB.41.5	Can it be tied by the leg
JOB.41.5	like a pet bird
JOB.41.5	for little girls?
JOB.41.6	Is it ever chopped up
JOB.41.6	and its pieces bargained for
JOB.41.6	in the fish-market?
JOB.41.7	Can it be killed
JOB.41.7	with harpoons or spears?
JOB.41.8	Wrestle it just once—
JOB.41.8	that will be the end.
JOB.41.9	Merely a glimpse of this monster
JOB.41.9	makes all courage melt.
JOB.41.10	And if it is too fierce
JOB.41.10	for anyone to attack,
JOB.41.10	who would dare oppose me?
JOB.41.11	I am in command of the world
JOB.41.11	and in debt to no one.
JOB.41.12	What powerful legs,
JOB.41.12	what a stout body
JOB.41.12	this monster possesses!
JOB.41.13	Who could strip off its armor
JOB.41.13	or bring it under control
JOB.41.13	with a harness?
JOB.41.14	Who would try to open its jaws,
JOB.41.14	full of fearsome teeth?
JOB.41.14	* 
JOB.41.15	Its back
JOB.41.15	with shield after shield,
JOB.41.16	firmly bound and closer together
JOB.41.17	than breath to breath.
JOB.41.18	When this monster sneezes,
JOB.41.18	lightning flashes, and its eyes
JOB.41.18	glow like the dawn.
JOB.41.19	Sparks and fiery flames
JOB.41.19	explode from its mouth.
JOB.41.20	And smoke spews from its nose
JOB.41.20	like steam
JOB.41.20	from a boiling pot,
JOB.41.21	while its blazing breath
JOB.41.21	scorches everything in sight.
JOB.41.22	Its neck is so tremendous
JOB.41.22	that everyone trembles,
JOB.41.23	the weakest parts of its body
JOB.41.23	are harder than iron,
JOB.41.24	and its heart is stone.
JOB.41.25	When this noisy monster appears,
JOB.41.25	even the most powerful
JOB.41.25	turn and run in fear.
JOB.41.26	No sword or spear can harm it,
JOB.41.27	and weapons of bronze or iron
JOB.41.27	are as useless as straw
JOB.41.27	or rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	Rocks thrown from a sling
JOB.41.28	cause it no more harm
JOB.41.28	than husks of grain.
JOB.41.28	This monster fears no arrows,
JOB.41.29	it simply smiles at spears,
JOB.41.29	and striking it with a stick
JOB.41.29	is like slapping it with straw.
JOB.41.30	As it crawls through the mud,
JOB.41.30	its sharp and spiny hide
JOB.41.30	tears the ground apart.
JOB.41.31	And when it swims down deep,
JOB.41.31	the sea starts churning
JOB.41.31	like boiling oil,
JOB.41.32	and it leaves behind a trail
JOB.41.32	of shining white foam.
JOB.41.33	No other creature on earth
JOB.41.33	is so fearless.
JOB.41.34	It is king of all proud creatures,
JOB.41.34	and it looks upon the others
JOB.41.34	as nothing.
JOB.42.1	Job said:
JOB.42.2	No one can oppose you,
JOB.42.2	because you have the power
JOB.42.2	to do what you want.
JOB.42.3	when I know so little.
JOB.42.3	I have talked about things
JOB.42.3	that are far beyond
JOB.42.3	my understanding.
JOB.42.4	and answer your questions.
JOB.42.5	I heard about you from others;
JOB.42.5	now I have seen you
JOB.42.5	with my own eyes.
JOB.42.6	That's why I hate myself
JOB.42.6	and sit here in dust and ashes
JOB.42.6	to show my sorrow.
JOB.42.7	The 
JOB.42.7	What my servant Job has said about me is true, but I am angry with you and your two friends for not telling the truth. 
JOB.42.8	So I want you to go over to Job and offer seven bulls and seven goats on an altar as a sacrifice to please me.
JOB.42.9	Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar obeyed the 
JOB.42.11	Then Job gave a feast for his brothers and sisters and for his old friends. They expressed their sorrow for the suffering the 
JOB.42.12	The 
JOB.42.13	In addition to seven sons, Job had three daughters, 
JOB.42.14	whose names were Jemimah, Keziah, and Keren Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	They were the most beautiful women in that part of the world, and Job gave them shares of his property, along with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	Job lived for another 140 years—long enough to see his great-grandchildren have children of their own— 
JOB.42.17	and when he finally died, he was very old.
PSA.1.1	God blesses those people
PSA.1.1	who refuse evil advice
PSA.1.1	and won't follow sinners
PSA.1.1	or join in sneering at God.
PSA.1.2	Instead, they find happiness
PSA.1.2	in the Teaching of the 
PSA.1.2	and they think about it
PSA.1.2	day and night.
PSA.1.3	growing beside a stream,
PSA.1.3	trees that produce
PSA.1.3	fruit in season
PSA.1.3	and always have leaves.
PSA.1.3	Those people succeed
PSA.1.3	in everything they do.
PSA.1.4	That isn't true of those
PSA.1.4	who are evil—
PSA.1.4	they are like straw
PSA.1.4	blown by the wind.
PSA.1.5	Sinners won't have an excuse
PSA.1.5	on the day of judgment,
PSA.1.5	and they won't have a place
PSA.1.5	with the people of God.
PSA.1.6	The 
PSA.1.6	who follows him,
PSA.1.6	but the wicked follow a road
PSA.1.6	that leads to ruin.
PSA.2.1	and why do their people
PSA.2.1	make useless plans?
PSA.2.2	The kings of this earth
PSA.2.2	have all joined together
PSA.2.2	to turn against the 
PSA.2.2	and his chosen king.
PSA.2.3	They say, “Let's cut the ropes
PSA.2.3	and set ourselves free!”
PSA.2.4	In heaven the 
PSA.2.4	as he sits on his throne,
PSA.2.4	making fun of the nations.
PSA.2.5	The 
PSA.2.5	and threatens them.
PSA.2.5	His anger terrifies them
PSA.2.5	as he says,
PSA.2.6	“I've put my king on Zion,
PSA.2.6	my sacred hill.”
PSA.2.7	that the 
PSA.2.7	“You are my son, because today
PSA.2.7	I have become your father.
PSA.2.8	Ask me for the nations,
PSA.2.8	and every nation on earth
PSA.2.8	will belong to you.
PSA.2.9	with an iron rod
PSA.2.9	and shatter them
PSA.2.9	like dishes of clay.”
PSA.2.10	Be smart, all you rulers,
PSA.2.10	and pay close attention.
PSA.2.11	Serve and honor the 
PSA.2.11	be glad and tremble.
PSA.2.12	Show respect to his son
PSA.2.12	because if you don't,
PSA.2.12	the 
PSA.2.12	and suddenly destroy you.
PSA.2.12	But he blesses and protects
PSA.2.12	everyone who runs to him.
PSA.3.1	Many fight against 
PSA.3.2	me and say,
PSA.3.2	“God won't rescue you!”
PSA.3.3	But you are my shield,
PSA.3.3	and you give me victory
PSA.3.3	and great honor.
PSA.3.4	I pray to you, and you answer
PSA.3.4	from your sacred hill.
PSA.3.5	I sleep and wake up refreshed
PSA.3.5	because you, 
PSA.3.5	protect me.
PSA.3.6	Ten thousand enemies attack
PSA.3.6	from every side,
PSA.3.6	but I am not afraid.
PSA.3.7	Come and save me, 
PSA.3.7	Break my enemies' jaws
PSA.3.7	and shatter their teeth,
PSA.3.8	because you protect
PSA.3.8	and bless your people.
PSA.4.1	You are my God and protector.
PSA.4.1	Please answer my prayer.
PSA.4.1	I was in terrible distress,
PSA.4.1	but you set me free.
PSA.4.1	Now have pity and listen
PSA.4.1	as I pray.
PSA.4.2	How long will you people
PSA.4.2	refuse to respect me?
PSA.4.2	You love foolish things,
PSA.4.2	and you run after
PSA.4.2	what is worthless.
PSA.4.3	The 
PSA.4.3	everyone who is faithful
PSA.4.3	to be his very own,
PSA.4.3	and he answers my prayers.
PSA.4.4	had better tremble
PSA.4.4	and turn from your sins.
PSA.4.4	Silently search your heart
PSA.4.4	as you lie in bed.
PSA.4.5	Offer the proper sacrifices
PSA.4.5	and trust the 
PSA.4.6	There are some who ask,
PSA.4.6	“Who will be good to us?”
PSA.4.6	Let your kindness, 
PSA.4.6	shine brightly on us.
PSA.4.7	You brought me more happiness
PSA.4.7	than a rich harvest
PSA.4.7	of grain and grapes.
PSA.4.8	I can lie down
PSA.4.8	and sleep soundly
PSA.4.8	because you, 
PSA.4.8	will keep me safe.
PSA.5.1	Listen, 
PSA.5.1	Pay attention when I groan.
PSA.5.2	You are my King and my God.
PSA.5.2	Answer my cry for help
PSA.5.2	because I pray to you.
PSA.5.3	Each morning you listen
PSA.5.3	to my prayer,
PSA.5.3	as I bring my requests
PSA.5.3	and wait for your reply.
PSA.5.4	You are not the kind of God
PSA.5.4	who is pleased with evil.
PSA.5.4	Sinners can't stay with you.
PSA.5.5	No one who boasts can stand
PSA.5.5	in your presence, 
PSA.5.5	and you hate evil people.
PSA.5.6	You destroy every liar,
PSA.5.6	and you despise violence
PSA.5.6	and deceit.
PSA.5.7	Because of your great mercy,
PSA.5.7	I come to your house, 
PSA.5.7	and I am filled with wonder
PSA.5.7	as I bow down to worship
PSA.5.7	at your holy temple.
PSA.5.8	You do what is right,
PSA.5.8	and I ask you to guide me.
PSA.5.8	Make your teaching clear
PSA.5.8	because of my enemies.
PSA.5.9	They just want to destroy.
PSA.5.9	Their words are deceitful
PSA.5.9	like a hidden pit,
PSA.5.9	and their tongues are good
PSA.5.9	only for telling lies.
PSA.5.10	Punish them, God,
PSA.5.10	and let their own plans
PSA.5.10	bring their downfall.
PSA.5.10	Get rid of them!
PSA.5.10	They keep committing crimes
PSA.5.10	and turning against you.
PSA.5.11	Let all who run to you
PSA.5.11	for protection
PSA.5.11	always sing joyful songs.
PSA.5.11	Provide shelter for those
PSA.5.11	who truly love you
PSA.5.11	and let them rejoice.
PSA.5.12	Our 
PSA.5.12	who live right,
PSA.5.12	and you shield them
PSA.5.12	with your kindness.
PSA.6.1	or even correct me
PSA.6.1	when you are angry!
PSA.6.2	Have pity on me and heal
PSA.6.2	my feeble body.
PSA.6.2	My bones tremble with fear,
PSA.6.3	and I am in deep distress.
PSA.6.3	How long will it be?
PSA.6.4	Turn and come to my rescue.
PSA.6.4	Show your wonderful love
PSA.6.4	and save me, 
PSA.6.5	If I die, I cannot praise you
PSA.6.5	or even remember you.
PSA.6.6	My groaning has worn me out.
PSA.6.6	At night my bed and pillow
PSA.6.6	are soaked with tears.
PSA.6.7	Sorrow has made my eyes dim,
PSA.6.7	and my sight has failed
PSA.6.7	because of my enemies.
PSA.6.8	and those hateful people
PSA.6.8	had better leave me alone.
PSA.6.9	You have answered my prayer
PSA.6.9	and my plea for mercy.
PSA.6.10	My enemies will be ashamed
PSA.6.10	and terrified,
PSA.6.10	as they quickly run away
PSA.6.10	in complete disgrace.
PSA.7.1	You, 
PSA.7.1	are my protector.
PSA.7.1	Rescue me and keep me safe
PSA.7.1	from all who chase me.
PSA.7.2	Or else they will rip me apart
PSA.7.2	like lions attacking a victim,
PSA.7.2	and no one will save me.
PSA.7.3	I am innocent, 
PSA.7.4	I have not betrayed a friend
PSA.7.4	or had pity on an enemy
PSA.7.4	who attacks for no reason.
PSA.7.5	If I have done any of this,
PSA.7.5	then let my enemies
PSA.7.5	chase and capture me.
PSA.7.5	Let them trample me to death
PSA.7.5	and leave me in the dirt.
PSA.7.6	Get angry, 
PSA.7.6	Do something!
PSA.7.6	Attack my furious enemies.
PSA.7.6	See that justice is done.
PSA.7.7	Make the nations come to you,
PSA.7.7	as you sit on your throne
PSA.7.7	above them all.
PSA.7.8	Our 
PSA.7.8	Judge me and show that I
PSA.7.8	am honest and innocent.
PSA.7.9	and you always do right.
PSA.7.9	Now make violent people stop,
PSA.7.9	but protect all of us
PSA.7.9	who obey you.
PSA.7.10	You, God, are my shield,
PSA.7.10	the protector of everyone
PSA.7.10	whose heart is right.
PSA.7.11	You see that justice is done,
PSA.7.11	and each day
PSA.7.11	you take revenge.
PSA.7.12	Whenever your enemies refuse
PSA.7.12	to change their ways,
PSA.7.12	you sharpen your sword
PSA.7.12	and string your bow.
PSA.7.13	Your deadly arrows are ready
PSA.7.13	with flaming tips.
PSA.7.14	An evil person is like a woman
PSA.7.14	about to give birth
PSA.7.14	to a hateful, deceitful,
PSA.7.14	and rebellious child.
PSA.7.15	then fall in it themselves.
PSA.7.16	The trouble they cause
PSA.7.16	comes back on them,
PSA.7.16	and their heads are crushed
PSA.7.16	by their own evil deeds.
PSA.7.17	I will praise you, 
PSA.7.17	You always do right.
PSA.7.17	I will sing about you,
PSA.7.17	the 
PSA.8.1	Our 
PSA.8.1	your name is wonderful
PSA.8.1	everywhere on earth!
PSA.8.1	You let your glory be seen
PSA.8.1	in the heavens above.
PSA.8.2	and from tiny infants,
PSA.8.2	you have built a fortress.
PSA.8.2	It makes your enemies silent,
PSA.8.2	and all who turn against you
PSA.8.2	are left speechless.
PSA.8.3	I often think of the heavens
PSA.8.3	your hands have made,
PSA.8.3	and of the moon and stars
PSA.8.3	you put in place.
PSA.8.4	about us humans?
PSA.8.4	Why are you concerned
PSA.8.4	for us weaklings?”
PSA.8.5	than you yourself,
PSA.8.5	and you have crowned us
PSA.8.5	with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	your hands have made.
PSA.8.6	And you put all of it
PSA.8.6	under our power—
PSA.8.7	the sheep and the cattle,
PSA.8.7	and every wild animal,
PSA.8.8	the birds in the sky,
PSA.8.8	the fish in the sea,
PSA.8.8	and all ocean creatures.
PSA.8.9	Our 
PSA.8.9	your name is wonderful
PSA.8.9	everywhere on earth!
PSA.9.1	I will praise you, 
PSA.9.1	with all my heart
PSA.9.1	and tell about the wonders
PSA.9.1	you have worked.
PSA.9.2	God Most High, I will rejoice;
PSA.9.2	I will celebrate and sing
PSA.9.2	because of you.
PSA.9.3	When my enemies face you,
PSA.9.3	they run away and stumble
PSA.9.3	and are destroyed.
PSA.9.4	You take your seat as judge,
PSA.9.4	and your fair decisions prove
PSA.9.4	that I was in the right.
PSA.9.5	You warn the nations
PSA.9.5	and destroy evil people;
PSA.9.5	you wipe out their names
PSA.9.5	forever and ever.
PSA.9.6	Our enemies are destroyed
PSA.9.6	completely for all time.
PSA.9.6	Their cities are torn down,
PSA.9.6	and they will never
PSA.9.6	be remembered again.
PSA.9.7	You rule forever, 
PSA.9.7	and you are on your throne,
PSA.9.7	ready for judgment.
PSA.9.8	You judge the world fairly
PSA.9.8	and treat all nations
PSA.9.8	with justice.
PSA.9.9	The poor can run to you
PSA.9.9	because you are a fortress
PSA.9.9	in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	Everyone who honors your name
PSA.9.10	can trust you,
PSA.9.10	because you are faithful
PSA.9.10	to all who depend on you.
PSA.9.11	You rule from Zion, 
PSA.9.11	and we sing about you
PSA.9.11	to let the nations know
PSA.9.11	everything you have done.
PSA.9.12	You did not forget
PSA.9.12	to punish the guilty
PSA.9.12	or listen to the cries
PSA.9.12	of those in need.
PSA.9.13	My enemies mistreat me.
PSA.9.13	Keep me from the gates
PSA.9.13	that lead to death,
PSA.9.14	and I will sing about you
PSA.9.14	at the gate to Zion.
PSA.9.14	I will be happy there
PSA.9.14	because you rescued me.
PSA.9.15	into their own pits,
PSA.9.15	and their feet were caught
PSA.9.15	in their own traps.
PSA.9.16	You showed what you are like,
PSA.9.16	and you made certain
PSA.9.16	that justice is done,
PSA.9.16	but evil people are trapped
PSA.9.16	by their own evil deeds.
PSA.9.17	The wicked will go down
PSA.9.17	to the world of the dead
PSA.9.17	to be with those nations
PSA.9.17	that forgot about you.
PSA.9.18	The poor and the homeless
PSA.9.18	won't always be forgotten
PSA.9.18	and without hope.
PSA.9.19	Do something, 
PSA.9.19	Don't let the nations win.
PSA.9.19	Make them stand trial
PSA.9.19	in your court of law.
PSA.9.20	Make the nations afraid
PSA.9.20	and let them all discover
PSA.9.20	just how weak they are.
PSA.10.1	Why are you far away, 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide yourself
PSA.10.1	when I am in trouble?
PSA.10.2	Proud and brutal people
PSA.10.2	hunt down the poor.
PSA.10.2	But let them get caught
PSA.10.2	by their own evil plans!
PSA.10.3	The wicked brag about
PSA.10.3	their deepest desires.
PSA.10.3	Those greedy people hate
PSA.10.3	and curse you, 
PSA.10.4	The wicked are too proud
PSA.10.4	to turn to you
PSA.10.4	or even think about you.
PSA.10.5	They are always successful,
PSA.10.5	though they can't understand
PSA.10.5	your teachings,
PSA.10.5	and they keep sneering
PSA.10.5	at their enemies.
PSA.10.6	In their hearts they say,
PSA.10.6	“Nothing can hurt us!
PSA.10.6	We'll always be happy
PSA.10.6	and free from trouble.”
PSA.10.7	and all they talk about
PSA.10.7	is how to be cruel
PSA.10.7	or how to do wrong.
PSA.10.8	They hide outside villages,
PSA.10.8	waiting to strike and murder
PSA.10.8	some innocent victim.
PSA.10.9	They are hungry lions
PSA.10.9	hiding in the bushes,
PSA.10.9	hoping to catch
PSA.10.9	some helpless passerby.
PSA.10.9	They trap the poor in nets
PSA.10.9	and drag them away.
PSA.10.10	They crouch down and wait
PSA.10.10	to grab a victim.
PSA.10.11	They say, “God can't see!
PSA.10.11	He's got on a blindfold.”
PSA.10.12	Do something, 
PSA.10.12	and use your powerful arm
PSA.10.12	to help those in need.
PSA.10.13	The wicked don't respect you.
PSA.10.13	In their hearts they say,
PSA.10.13	“God won't punish us!”
PSA.10.14	But you see the trouble
PSA.10.14	and the distress,
PSA.10.14	and you will do something.
PSA.10.14	The poor can count on you,
PSA.10.14	and so can orphans.
PSA.10.15	Now break the power
PSA.10.15	of all merciless people.
PSA.10.15	Punish them for doing wrong
PSA.10.15	and make them stop.
PSA.10.16	Our 
PSA.10.16	but every godless nation
PSA.10.16	will vanish from the earth.
PSA.10.17	You listen to the longings
PSA.10.17	of those who suffer.
PSA.10.17	You offer them hope,
PSA.10.17	and you pay attention
PSA.10.17	to their cries for help.
PSA.10.18	You defend orphans
PSA.10.18	and everyone else in need,
PSA.10.18	so that no one on earth
PSA.10.18	can terrify others again.
PSA.11.1	The 
PSA.11.1	Don't say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Escape like a bird
PSA.11.1	to the mountains!”
PSA.11.2	You tell me, “Watch out!
PSA.11.2	Those evil people have put
PSA.11.2	their arrows on their bows,
PSA.11.2	and they are standing
PSA.11.2	in the shadows,
PSA.11.2	aiming at good people.
PSA.11.3	What can an honest person do
PSA.11.3	when everything crumbles?”
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	in his sacred temple
PSA.11.4	on his throne in heaven.
PSA.11.4	He knows everything we do
PSA.11.4	because he sees us all.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	but despises those
PSA.11.5	who are cruel
PSA.11.5	and love violence.
PSA.11.6	He will send fiery coals
PSA.11.6	and flaming sulfur
PSA.11.6	down on the wicked,
PSA.11.6	and they will drink nothing
PSA.11.6	but a scorching wind.
PSA.11.7	The 
PSA.11.7	and wants justice done.
PSA.11.7	Everyone who does right
PSA.11.7	will see his face.
PSA.12.1	Please help me, 
PSA.12.1	All who were faithful
PSA.12.1	and all who were loyal
PSA.12.1	have disappeared.
PSA.12.2	Everyone tells lies,
PSA.12.2	and no one is sincere.
PSA.12.3	Won't you chop off
PSA.12.3	all flattering tongues
PSA.12.3	that brag so loudly?
PSA.12.4	They say to themselves,
PSA.12.4	“We are great speakers.
PSA.12.4	No one else has a chance.”
PSA.12.5	But you, 
PSA.12.5	“I will do something!
PSA.12.5	The poor are mistreated
PSA.12.5	and helpless people moan.
PSA.12.5	I'll rescue all who suffer.”
PSA.12.6	Our 
PSA.12.6	to your promises,
PSA.12.6	and your word is like silver
PSA.12.6	heated seven times
PSA.12.6	in a fiery furnace.
PSA.12.7	You will protect us
PSA.12.7	and always keep us safe
PSA.12.7	from those people.
PSA.12.8	But all who are wicked
PSA.12.8	will keep on strutting,
PSA.12.8	while everyone praises
PSA.12.8	their shameless deeds.
PSA.13.1	How much longer, 
PSA.13.1	will you forget about me?
PSA.13.1	Will it be forever?
PSA.13.1	How long will you hide?
PSA.13.2	How long must I be confused
PSA.13.2	and miserable all day?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemies
PSA.13.2	keep beating me down?
PSA.13.3	Please listen, 
PSA.13.3	and answer my prayers.
PSA.13.3	Make my eyes sparkle again,
PSA.13.3	or else I will fall
PSA.13.3	into the sleep of death.
PSA.13.4	My enemies will say,
PSA.13.4	“Now we've won!”
PSA.13.4	They will be greatly pleased
PSA.13.4	when I am defeated.
PSA.13.5	I trust your love,
PSA.13.5	and I feel like celebrating
PSA.13.5	because you rescued me.
PSA.13.6	You have been good to me, 
PSA.13.6	and I will sing about you.
PSA.14.1	“There is no God!”
PSA.14.1	People like that are worthless;
PSA.14.1	they are heartless and cruel
PSA.14.1	and never do right.
PSA.14.2	From heaven the 
PSA.14.2	looks down to see
PSA.14.2	if anyone is wise enough
PSA.14.2	to search for him.
PSA.14.3	But all of them are corrupt;
PSA.14.3	no one does right.
PSA.14.4	Won't you evil people learn?
PSA.14.4	You refuse to pray,
PSA.14.4	and you gobble up
PSA.14.4	the 
PSA.14.5	But you will be frightened,
PSA.14.5	because God is on the side
PSA.14.5	of every good person.
PSA.14.6	You may spoil the plans
PSA.14.6	of the poor,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	I long for someone from Zion
PSA.14.7	to come and save Israel!
PSA.14.7	Our 
PSA.14.7	your people again,
PSA.14.7	Jacob's family will be glad,
PSA.14.7	and Israel will celebrate.
PSA.15.1	Who may stay in God's temple
PSA.15.1	or live on the holy mountain
PSA.15.1	of the 
PSA.15.2	Only those who obey God
PSA.15.2	and do as they should.
PSA.15.2	They speak the truth
PSA.15.3	and don't spread gossip;
PSA.15.3	they treat others fairly
PSA.15.3	and don't say cruel things.
PSA.15.4	They hate worthless people,
PSA.15.4	but show respect for all
PSA.15.4	who worship the 
PSA.15.4	And they keep their promises,
PSA.15.4	no matter what the cost.
PSA.15.5	They lend their money
PSA.15.5	without charging interest,
PSA.15.5	and they don't take bribes
PSA.15.5	to hurt the innocent.
PSA.15.5	Those who do these things
PSA.15.5	will always stand firm.
PSA.16.1	Protect me, 
PSA.16.1	I run to you for safety,
PSA.16.2	and I have said,
PSA.16.2	“Only you are my Lord!
PSA.16.2	Every good thing I have
PSA.16.2	is a gift from you.”
PSA.16.3	Your people are wonderful,
PSA.16.3	and they make me happy,
PSA.16.4	but worshipers of other gods
PSA.16.4	will have much sorrow.
PSA.16.4	I refuse to offer sacrifices
PSA.16.4	of blood to those gods
PSA.16.4	or worship in their name.
PSA.16.5	You, 
PSA.16.5	You are my choice,
PSA.16.5	and you keep me safe.
PSA.16.6	You make my life pleasant,
PSA.16.6	and my future is bright.
PSA.16.7	I praise you, 
PSA.16.7	for being my guide.
PSA.16.7	Even in the darkest night,
PSA.16.7	your teachings fill my mind.
PSA.16.8	as you stand beside me
PSA.16.8	and protect me from fear.
PSA.16.9	With all my heart,
PSA.16.9	I will celebrate,
PSA.16.9	and I can safely rest.
PSA.16.10	You won't leave me in the grave
PSA.16.10	or let my body decay.
PSA.16.11	You have shown me
PSA.16.11	the path to life,
PSA.16.11	and you make me glad
PSA.16.11	by being near to me.
PSA.16.11	Sitting at your right side,
PSA.16.11	I will always be joyful.
PSA.17.1	I am innocent, 
PSA.17.1	Won't you listen as I pray
PSA.17.1	and beg for help?
PSA.17.1	I am honest!
PSA.17.1	Please hear my prayer.
PSA.17.2	Only you can say
PSA.17.2	that I am innocent,
PSA.17.2	because only your eyes
PSA.17.2	can see the truth.
PSA.17.3	You know my heart,
PSA.17.3	and even during the night
PSA.17.3	you have tested me
PSA.17.3	and found me innocent.
PSA.17.3	I have made up my mind
PSA.17.3	never to tell a lie.
PSA.17.4	I don't do like others.
PSA.17.4	I obey your teachings
PSA.17.4	and am not cruel.
PSA.17.5	I have followed you,
PSA.17.5	without ever stumbling.
PSA.17.6	I pray to you, God,
PSA.17.6	because you will help me.
PSA.17.6	Listen and answer my prayer!
PSA.17.7	Show your wonderful love.
PSA.17.7	Your mighty arm protects those
PSA.17.7	who run to you for safety
PSA.17.7	from their enemies.
PSA.17.8	Protect me as you would
PSA.17.8	your very own eyes;
PSA.17.8	hide me in the shadow
PSA.17.8	of your wings.
PSA.17.9	Don't let my brutal enemies
PSA.17.9	attack from all sides
PSA.17.9	and kill me.
PSA.17.10	They refuse to show mercy,
PSA.17.10	and they keep bragging.
PSA.17.11	They have caught up with me!
PSA.17.11	My enemies are everywhere,
PSA.17.11	eagerly hoping to smear me
PSA.17.11	in the dirt.
PSA.17.12	They are like hungry lions
PSA.17.12	hunting for food,
PSA.17.12	or like young lions
PSA.17.12	hiding in ambush.
PSA.17.13	Do something, 
PSA.17.13	Attack and defeat them.
PSA.17.13	Take your sword and save me
PSA.17.13	from those evil people.
PSA.17.14	Use your powerful arm
PSA.17.14	and rescue me
PSA.17.14	from the hands of mere humans
PSA.17.14	whose world won't last.
PSA.17.14	You provide food
PSA.17.14	for those you love.
PSA.17.14	Their children have plenty,
PSA.17.14	and their grandchildren
PSA.17.14	will have more than enough.
PSA.17.15	I am innocent, 
PSA.17.15	and I will see your face!
PSA.17.15	When I awake, all I want
PSA.17.15	is to see you as you are.
PSA.18.1	I love you, 
PSA.18.1	and you make me strong.
PSA.18.2	You are my mighty rock,
PSA.18.2	my fortress, my protector,
PSA.18.2	the rock where I am safe,
PSA.18.2	my shield, my powerful weapon,
PSA.18.2	and my place of shelter.
PSA.18.3	I praise you, 
PSA.18.3	I prayed, and you rescued me
PSA.18.3	from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	Death had wrapped
PSA.18.4	its ropes around me,
PSA.18.4	and I was almost swallowed
PSA.18.4	by its flooding waters.
PSA.18.5	Ropes from the world
PSA.18.5	of the dead
PSA.18.5	had coiled around me,
PSA.18.5	and death had set a trap
PSA.18.5	in my path.
PSA.18.6	I was in terrible trouble
PSA.18.6	when I called out to you,
PSA.18.6	but from your temple
PSA.18.6	you heard me
PSA.18.6	and answered my prayer.
PSA.18.7	The earth shook and shivered,
PSA.18.7	and the mountains trembled
PSA.18.7	down to their roots.
PSA.18.7	You were angry
PSA.18.8	and breathed out smoke.
PSA.18.8	Scorching heat and fiery flames
PSA.18.8	spewed from your mouth.
PSA.18.9	You opened the heavens
PSA.18.9	like curtains,
PSA.18.9	and you came down
PSA.18.9	with storm clouds
PSA.18.9	under your feet.
PSA.18.10	You rode on the backs
PSA.18.10	of flying creatures
PSA.18.10	and swooped down
PSA.18.10	with the wind as wings.
PSA.18.11	Darkness was your robe;
PSA.18.11	thunderclouds filled the sky,
PSA.18.11	hiding you from sight.
PSA.18.12	Hailstones and fiery coals
PSA.18.12	lit up the sky
PSA.18.12	in front of you.
PSA.18.13	thundered from the heavens,
PSA.18.13	as hailstones and fiery coals
PSA.18.13	poured down like rain.
PSA.18.14	You scattered your enemies
PSA.18.14	with arrows of lightning.
PSA.18.15	You roared at the sea,
PSA.18.15	and its deepest channels
PSA.18.15	could be seen.
PSA.18.15	You snorted,
PSA.18.15	and the earth shook
PSA.18.15	to its foundations.
PSA.18.16	You reached down from heaven,
PSA.18.16	and you lifted me
PSA.18.16	from deep in the ocean.
PSA.18.17	You rescued me from enemies,
PSA.18.17	who were hateful
PSA.18.17	and too powerful for me.
PSA.18.18	On the day disaster struck,
PSA.18.18	they came and attacked,
PSA.18.18	but you defended me.
PSA.18.19	When I was fenced in,
PSA.18.19	you freed and rescued me
PSA.18.19	because you love me.
PSA.18.20	You are good to me, 
PSA.18.20	because I do right,
PSA.18.20	and you reward me
PSA.18.20	because I am innocent.
PSA.18.21	I do what you want
PSA.18.21	and never turn to do evil.
PSA.18.22	I keep your laws in mind
PSA.18.22	and never look away
PSA.18.22	from your teachings.
PSA.18.23	I obey you completely
PSA.18.23	and guard against sin.
PSA.18.24	You have been good to me
PSA.18.24	because I do right;
PSA.18.24	you have rewarded me
PSA.18.24	for being innocent
PSA.18.24	by your standards.
PSA.18.25	You are always loyal
PSA.18.25	to your loyal people,
PSA.18.25	and you are faithful
PSA.18.25	to the faithful.
PSA.18.26	With all who are sincere,
PSA.18.26	you are sincere,
PSA.18.26	but you treat the unfaithful
PSA.18.26	as their deeds deserve.
PSA.18.27	You rescue the humble,
PSA.18.27	but you put down all
PSA.18.27	who are proud.
PSA.18.28	You, the 
PSA.18.28	keep my lamp burning
PSA.18.28	and turn darkness to light.
PSA.18.29	You help me defeat armies
PSA.18.29	and capture cities.
PSA.18.30	Your way is perfect, 
PSA.18.30	and your word is correct.
PSA.18.30	You are a shield for those
PSA.18.30	who run to you for help.
PSA.18.31	You alone are God!
PSA.18.31	Only you are a mighty rock.
PSA.18.32	You give me strength
PSA.18.32	and guide me right.
PSA.18.33	as those of a deer,
PSA.18.33	and you help me stand
PSA.18.33	on the mountains.
PSA.18.34	You teach my hands to fight
PSA.18.34	and my arms to use
PSA.18.34	a bow of bronze.
PSA.18.35	You alone are my shield.
PSA.18.35	Your right hand supports me,
PSA.18.35	and by coming to help me,
PSA.18.35	you have made me famous.
PSA.18.36	You clear the way for me,
PSA.18.36	and now I won't stumble.
PSA.18.37	I kept chasing my enemies,
PSA.18.37	until I caught them
PSA.18.37	and destroyed them.
PSA.18.38	I stuck my sword
PSA.18.38	through my enemies,
PSA.18.38	and they were crushed
PSA.18.38	under my feet.
PSA.18.39	You helped me win victories,
PSA.18.39	and you forced my attackers
PSA.18.39	to fall victim to me.
PSA.18.40	You made my enemies run,
PSA.18.40	and I killed them.
PSA.18.41	They cried out for help,
PSA.18.41	but no one saved them;
PSA.18.41	they called out to you,
PSA.18.41	but there was no answer.
PSA.18.42	I ground them to dust
PSA.18.42	blown by the wind,
PSA.18.42	and I poured them out
PSA.18.42	like mud in the streets.
PSA.18.43	You rescued me
PSA.18.43	from stubborn people,
PSA.18.43	and you made me the leader
PSA.18.43	of foreign nations,
PSA.18.43	who are now my slaves.
PSA.18.44	They obey and come crawling.
PSA.18.45	They have lost all courage,

PSA.22.1	Why are you so far away?
PSA.22.1	Won't you listen to my groans
PSA.22.1	and come to my rescue?
PSA.22.2	I cry out day and night,
PSA.22.2	but you don't answer,
PSA.22.2	and I can never rest.
PSA.22.3	Yet you are the holy God,
PSA.22.3	ruling from your throne
PSA.22.3	and praised by Israel.
PSA.22.4	and you rescued them.
PSA.22.5	When they cried out for help,
PSA.22.5	you saved them,
PSA.22.5	and you did not let them down
PSA.22.5	when they depended on you.
PSA.22.6	But I am merely a worm,
PSA.22.6	far less than human,
PSA.22.6	and I am hated and rejected
PSA.22.6	by people everywhere.

PSA.22.13	roaring and attacking
PSA.22.13	with jaws open wide.
PSA.22.14	I have no more strength
PSA.22.14	than a few drops of water.
PSA.22.14	All my bones are out of joint;
PSA.22.14	my heart is like melted wax.
PSA.22.15	My strength has dried up
PSA.22.15	like a broken clay pot,
PSA.22.15	and my tongue sticks
PSA.22.15	to the roof of my mouth.
PSA.22.15	You, God, have left me
PSA.22.15	to die in the dirt.
PSA.22.16	Brutal enemies attack me
PSA.22.16	like a pack of dogs,
PSA.22.16	tearing at
PSA.22.16	and my feet.

PSA.22.17	and my enemies just stare
PSA.22.17	and sneer at me.
PSA.22.18	and gambled for them.

PSA.30.7	and you made me strong
PSA.30.7	as a mighty mountain.
PSA.30.7	But when you hid your face,
PSA.30.7	I was crushed.
PSA.30.8	I prayed to you, 
PSA.30.8	and in my prayer I said,
PSA.30.9	“What good will it do you
PSA.30.9	if I am in the grave?
PSA.30.9	Once I have turned to dust,
PSA.30.9	how can I praise you
PSA.30.9	or tell how loyal you are?
PSA.30.10	Have pity, 
PSA.30.11	You have turned my sorrow
PSA.30.11	into joyful dancing.
PSA.30.11	No longer am I sad
PSA.30.11	and wearing sackcloth.
PSA.30.12	I thank you from my heart,
PSA.30.12	and I will never stop
PSA.30.12	singing your praises,
PSA.30.12	my 
PSA.31.1	I come to you, 
PSA.31.1	for protection.
PSA.31.1	Don't let me be ashamed.
PSA.31.1	Do as you have promised
PSA.31.1	and rescue me.
PSA.31.2	Listen to my prayer
PSA.31.2	and hurry to save me.
PSA.31.2	Be my mighty rock
PSA.31.2	and the fortress
PSA.31.2	where I am safe.
PSA.31.3	You, 
PSA.31.3	are my mighty rock
PSA.31.3	and my fortress.
PSA.31.3	Lead me and guide me,
PSA.31.3	so that your name
PSA.31.3	will be honored.
PSA.31.4	Protect me from hidden traps
PSA.31.4	and keep me safe.
PSA.31.5	and I trust you
PSA.31.5	because you rescued me.
PSA.31.6	I hate the worshipers
PSA.31.6	of worthless idols,
PSA.31.6	but I trust you, 
PSA.31.7	I celebrate and shout
PSA.31.7	because you are kind.
PSA.31.7	You saw all my suffering,
PSA.31.7	and you cared for me.
PSA.31.8	You kept me from the hands
PSA.31.8	of my enemies,
PSA.31.8	and you set me free.
PSA.31.9	Have pity, 
PSA.31.9	I am hurting and almost blind.
PSA.31.9	My whole body aches.
PSA.31.10	I have known only sorrow
PSA.31.10	all my life long, and I suffer
PSA.31.10	year after year.
PSA.31.10	I am weak from sin,
PSA.31.10	and my bones are limp.
PSA.31.11	My enemies insult me.
PSA.31.11	Neighbors are even worse,
PSA.31.11	and I disgust my friends.
PSA.31.11	People meet me on the street,
PSA.31.11	and they turn and run.
PSA.31.12	I am completely forgotten
PSA.31.12	like someone dead.
PSA.31.12	I am merely a broken dish.
PSA.31.13	I hear the crowds whisper,
PSA.31.13	“Everyone is afraid!”
PSA.31.13	They are plotting and scheming
PSA.31.13	to murder me.
PSA.31.14	But I trust you, 
PSA.31.14	and I claim you as my God.
PSA.31.15	My life is in your hands.
PSA.31.15	Save me from enemies
PSA.31.15	who hunt me down.
PSA.31.16	Smile on me, your servant.
PSA.31.16	Have pity and rescue me.
PSA.31.17	I pray only to you.
PSA.31.17	Don't disappoint me.
PSA.31.17	Disappoint my cruel enemies
PSA.31.17	until they lie silent
PSA.31.17	in their graves.
PSA.31.18	Silence those proud liars!
PSA.31.18	Make them stop bragging
PSA.31.18	and insulting your people.
PSA.31.19	You are wonderful,
PSA.31.19	and while everyone watches,
PSA.31.19	you store up blessings for all
PSA.31.19	who honor and trust you.
PSA.31.20	You are their shelter
PSA.31.20	from harmful plots,
PSA.31.20	and you are their protection
PSA.31.20	from vicious gossip.
PSA.31.21	I will praise you, 
PSA.31.21	for showing great kindness
PSA.31.21	when I was like a city
PSA.31.21	under attack.
PSA.31.22	I was terrified and thought,
PSA.31.22	“They've chased me
PSA.31.22	far away from you!”
PSA.31.22	But you answered my prayer
PSA.31.22	when I shouted for help.
PSA.31.23	show how you love him.
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	but he severely punishes
PSA.31.23	everyone who is proud.
PSA.31.24	All who trust the 
PSA.31.24	be cheerful and strong.
PSA.32.1	whose sins you forgive
PSA.32.1	and wipe away.
PSA.32.2	You bless them by saying,
PSA.32.2	“You told me your sins,
PSA.32.2	without trying to hide them,
PSA.32.2	and now I forgive you.”
PSA.32.3	Before I confessed my sins,
PSA.32.3	my bones felt limp,
PSA.32.3	and I groaned all day long.
PSA.32.4	Night and day your hand
PSA.32.4	weighed heavily on me,
PSA.32.4	and my strength was gone
PSA.32.4	as in the summer heat.
PSA.32.5	So I confessed my sins
PSA.32.5	and told them all to you.
PSA.32.5	I said, “I'll tell the 
PSA.32.5	each one of my sins.”
PSA.32.5	Then you forgave me
PSA.32.5	and took away my guilt.
PSA.32.6	We worship you, Lord,
PSA.32.6	and we should always pray
PSA.32.6	whenever we find out
PSA.32.6	that we have sinned.
PSA.32.6	Then we won't be swept away
PSA.32.6	by a raging flood.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place!
PSA.32.7	You protect me from trouble,
PSA.32.7	and you put songs in my heart
PSA.32.7	because you have saved me.
PSA.32.8	You said to me,
PSA.32.8	“I will point out the road
PSA.32.8	that you should follow.
PSA.32.8	I will be your teacher
PSA.32.8	and watch over you.
PSA.32.9	Don't be stupid
PSA.32.9	like horses and mules
PSA.32.9	that must be led with ropes
PSA.32.9	to make them obey.”
PSA.32.10	All kinds of troubles
PSA.32.10	will strike the wicked,
PSA.32.10	but your kindness shields those
PSA.32.10	who trust you, 
PSA.32.11	And so your good people
PSA.32.11	should celebrate and shout.
PSA.33.1	You are the 
PSA.33.1	Obey him and celebrate!
PSA.33.1	He deserves your praise.
PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.2	Use harps with ten strings
PSA.33.2	to make music for him.
PSA.33.3	Sing a new song. Shout!
PSA.33.3	Play beautiful music.
PSA.33.4	The 
PSA.33.4	he can be trusted.
PSA.33.5	He loves justice and fairness,
PSA.33.5	and he is kind to everyone
PSA.33.5	everywhere on earth.
PSA.33.6	The 
PSA.33.6	and everything in them
PSA.33.6	by his word.
PSA.33.7	He scooped up the ocean
PSA.33.7	and stored the water.
PSA.33.8	Everyone in this world
PSA.33.8	should worship and honor
PSA.33.8	the 
PSA.33.9	As soon as he spoke
PSA.33.9	the world was created;
PSA.33.9	at his command,
PSA.33.9	the earth was formed.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	and spoils the schemes
PSA.33.10	of the nations.
PSA.33.11	But what the 
PSA.33.11	will stand forever.
PSA.33.11	His thoughts never change.
PSA.33.12	The 
PSA.33.12	that worships only him.
PSA.33.12	He blesses his chosen ones.
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.14	from his throne in heaven,
PSA.33.14	and he watches us all.
PSA.33.15	The 
PSA.33.15	and nothing we do
PSA.33.15	can be hidden from him.
PSA.33.16	cannot win wars for a king;
PSA.33.16	great strength by itself
PSA.33.16	cannot keep a soldier safe.
PSA.33.17	In war the strength of a horse
PSA.33.17	cannot be trusted
PSA.33.17	to take you to safety.
PSA.33.18	But the 
PSA.33.18	all
PSA.33.18	who honor him
PSA.33.18	and trust his kindness.
PSA.33.19	He protects them from death
PSA.33.19	and starvation.
PSA.33.20	We depend on you, 
PSA.33.20	to help and protect us.
PSA.33.21	You make our hearts glad
PSA.33.21	because we trust you,
PSA.33.21	the only God.
PSA.33.22	Be kind and bless us!
PSA.33.22	We depend on you.
PSA.34.2	With all my heart,
PSA.34.2	I will praise the 
PSA.34.2	Let all who are helpless,
PSA.34.2	listen and be glad.
PSA.34.3	Honor the 
PSA.34.3	Celebrate his great name.
PSA.34.4	I asked the 
PSA.34.4	and he saved me
PSA.34.4	from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	Keep your eyes on the 
PSA.34.5	You will shine like the sun
PSA.34.5	and never blush with shame.
PSA.34.6	I was a nobody, but I prayed,
PSA.34.6	and the 
PSA.34.6	from all my troubles.
PSA.34.7	If you honor the 
PSA.34.7	his angel will protect you.
PSA.34.8	that the 
PSA.34.8	Come to him for protection,
PSA.34.8	and you will be glad.
PSA.34.9	Honor the 
PSA.34.9	You are his special people.
PSA.34.9	No one who honors the 
PSA.34.9	will ever be in need.
PSA.34.10	Young lions
PSA.34.10	or even starve,
PSA.34.10	but if you trust the 
PSA.34.10	you will never miss out
PSA.34.10	on anything good.
PSA.34.11	Come, my children, listen
PSA.34.11	as I teach you
PSA.34.11	to respect the 
PSA.34.12	and enjoy a long life?
PSA.34.13	Then don't say cruel things
PSA.34.13	and don't tell lies.
PSA.34.14	Do good instead of evil
PSA.34.14	and try to live at peace.
PSA.34.15	If you obey the 
PSA.34.15	he will watch over you
PSA.34.15	and answer your prayers.
PSA.34.16	But God despises evil people,
PSA.34.16	and he will wipe them all
PSA.34.16	from the earth,
PSA.34.16	till they are forgotten.
PSA.34.17	When his people pray for help,
PSA.34.17	he listens and rescues them
PSA.34.17	from their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	all
PSA.34.18	who are discouraged
PSA.34.18	and have given up hope.
PSA.34.19	The 
PSA.34.19	may suffer a lot,
PSA.34.19	but he will always
PSA.34.19	bring them safely through.
PSA.34.20	will ever be broken.
PSA.34.21	Wicked people are killed
PSA.34.21	by their own evil deeds,
PSA.34.21	and if you hate God's people
PSA.34.21	you will be punished.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	of his servants.
PSA.34.22	Run to him for protection,
PSA.34.22	and you won't be punished.
PSA.35.1	Fight my enemies, 
PSA.35.1	Attack my attackers!
PSA.35.2	Shield me and help me.
PSA.35.3	Aim your spear at everyone
PSA.35.3	who hunts me down,
PSA.35.3	but promise to save me.
PSA.35.4	Let all who want to kill me
PSA.35.4	be disgraced
PSA.35.4	and put to shame.
PSA.35.4	Chase away and confuse
PSA.35.4	all who plan to harm me.
PSA.35.5	Send your angel after them
PSA.35.5	and let them be like straw
PSA.35.5	in the wind.
PSA.35.6	Make them run in the dark
PSA.35.6	on a slippery road,
PSA.35.6	as your angel chases them.
PSA.35.7	I did them no harm,
PSA.35.7	but they hid a net
PSA.35.7	to trap me,
PSA.35.7	and they dug a deep pit
PSA.35.7	to catch and kill me.
PSA.35.8	Trap them in their own nets
PSA.35.8	and let them fall and rot
PSA.35.8	in the pits they have dug.
PSA.35.9	I will celebrate and be joyful
PSA.35.9	because you, 
PSA.35.9	have saved me.
PSA.35.10	Every bone in my body
PSA.35.10	will shout:
PSA.35.10	“No one is like the 
PSA.35.10	You protect the helpless
PSA.35.10	from those in power;
PSA.35.10	you save the poor and needy
PSA.35.10	from those who hurt them.
PSA.35.11	Liars accuse me of crimes
PSA.35.11	I know nothing about.
PSA.35.12	They repay evil for good,
PSA.35.12	and I feel all alone.
PSA.35.13	When they were sick,
PSA.35.13	I wore sackcloth
PSA.35.13	and went without food.
PSA.35.13	I truly prayed for them,
PSA.35.14	as I would for a friend
PSA.35.14	or a relative.
PSA.35.14	I was in sorrow and mourned,
PSA.35.14	as I would for my mother.
PSA.35.15	I have stumbled,
PSA.35.15	and worthless liars
PSA.35.15	I don't even know
PSA.35.15	surround me and sneer.
PSA.35.16	Worthless people make fun
PSA.35.16	and never stop laughing.
PSA.35.17	But all you do is watch!
PSA.35.17	When will you do something?
PSA.35.17	Save me from the attack
PSA.35.17	of those vicious lions.
PSA.35.18	And when your people meet,
PSA.35.18	I will praise you
PSA.35.18	and thank you, Lord,
PSA.35.18	in front of them all.
PSA.35.19	be glad because of me.
PSA.35.19	They hate me for no reason.
PSA.35.19	Don't let them wink
PSA.35.19	behind my back.
PSA.35.20	They say hurtful things,
PSA.35.20	and they lie to people
PSA.35.20	who want to live in peace.
PSA.35.21	They are quick to accuse me.
PSA.35.21	They say, “You did it!
PSA.35.21	We saw you ourselves.”
PSA.35.22	You see everything, 
PSA.35.22	Please don't keep silent
PSA.35.22	or stay so far away.
PSA.35.23	Fight to defend me, Lord God,
PSA.35.24	and prove that I am right
PSA.35.24	by your standards.
PSA.35.24	Don't let them laugh at me
PSA.35.25	or say to each other,
PSA.35.25	“Now we've got what we want!
PSA.35.25	We'll gobble him up!”
PSA.35.26	Disappoint and confuse
PSA.35.26	all who are glad
PSA.35.26	to see me in trouble;
PSA.35.26	disgrace and embarrass
PSA.35.26	my proud enemies who say to me,
PSA.35.26	“You are nothing!”
PSA.35.27	Let all who want me to win
PSA.35.27	be happy and joyful.
PSA.35.27	From now on let them say,
PSA.35.27	“The 
PSA.35.27	God is glad when all goes well
PSA.35.27	for his servant.”
PSA.35.28	Then I will shout all day,
PSA.35.28	“Praise the 
PSA.35.28	He did what was right.”
PSA.36.1	sin is all they think about.
PSA.36.2	They like themselves too much
PSA.36.2	to hate their own sins
PSA.36.2	or even to see them.
PSA.36.3	They tell deceitful lies,
PSA.36.3	and they don't have the sense
PSA.36.3	to live right.
PSA.36.4	Those people stay awake,
PSA.36.4	thinking up mischief,
PSA.36.4	and they follow the wrong road,
PSA.36.4	refusing to turn from sin.
PSA.36.5	Your love is faithful, 
PSA.36.5	and even the clouds in the sky
PSA.36.5	can depend on you.
PSA.36.6	Your decisions are always fair.
PSA.36.6	They are firm like mountains,
PSA.36.6	deep like the sea,
PSA.36.6	and all people and animals
PSA.36.6	are under your care.
PSA.36.7	Your love is a treasure,
PSA.36.7	and everyone finds shelter
PSA.36.7	in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	You give your guests a feast
PSA.36.8	in your house,
PSA.36.8	and you serve a tasty drink
PSA.36.8	that flows like a river.
PSA.36.9	The life-giving fountain
PSA.36.9	belongs to you,
PSA.36.9	and your light gives light
PSA.36.9	to each of us.
PSA.36.10	Our 
PSA.36.10	to everyone who knows you,
PSA.36.10	and use your power to save all
PSA.36.10	whose thoughts please you.
PSA.36.11	Don't let those proud
PSA.36.11	and merciless people
PSA.36.11	kick me around
PSA.36.11	or chase me away.
PSA.36.12	Look at those wicked people!
PSA.36.12	They are knocked down,
PSA.36.12	never to get up again.
PSA.37.1	Don't be annoyed by anyone
PSA.37.1	who does wrong,
PSA.37.1	and don't envy them.
PSA.37.2	They will soon disappear
PSA.37.2	like grass without rain.
PSA.37.3	Trust the 
PSA.37.3	The land will be yours,
PSA.37.3	and you will be safe.
PSA.37.4	Do what the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you
PSA.37.4	your heart's desire.
PSA.37.5	Let the 
PSA.37.5	and trust him to help.
PSA.37.6	Then it will be as clear
PSA.37.6	as the noonday sun
PSA.37.6	that you were right.
PSA.37.7	Be patient and trust the 
PSA.37.7	Don't let it bother you
PSA.37.7	when all goes well for those
PSA.37.7	who do sinful things.
PSA.37.8	Don't be angry or furious.
PSA.37.8	Anger can lead to sin.
PSA.37.9	All sinners will disappear,
PSA.37.9	but if you trust the 
PSA.37.9	the land will be yours.
PSA.37.10	Sinners will soon disappear,
PSA.37.10	never to be found,
PSA.37.11	and enjoy a big harvest.
PSA.37.12	Merciless people make plots
PSA.37.12	against good people
PSA.37.12	and snarl like animals,
PSA.37.13	but the Lord laughs and knows
PSA.37.13	their time is coming soon.
PSA.37.14	The wicked kill with swords
PSA.37.14	and shoot arrows to murder
PSA.37.14	the poor and the needy
PSA.37.14	and all who do right.
PSA.37.15	But they will be killed
PSA.37.15	by their own swords,
PSA.37.15	and their arrows
PSA.37.15	will be broken.
PSA.37.16	It is better to live right
PSA.37.16	and be poor
PSA.37.16	than to be sinful and rich.
PSA.37.17	The wicked will lose all
PSA.37.17	of their power,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.17	to everyone who is good.
PSA.37.18	Those who obey the 
PSA.37.18	are daily in his care,
PSA.37.18	and what he has given them
PSA.37.18	will be theirs forever.
PSA.37.19	They won't be in trouble
PSA.37.19	when times are bad,
PSA.37.19	and they will have plenty
PSA.37.19	when food is scarce.
PSA.37.20	Wicked people are enemies
PSA.37.20	of the 
PSA.37.20	and will vanish like smoke
PSA.37.20	from a field on fire.
PSA.37.21	An evil person borrows
PSA.37.21	and never pays back;
PSA.37.21	a good person is generous
PSA.37.21	and never stops giving.
PSA.37.22	Everyone the 
PSA.37.22	will receive the land;
PSA.37.22	everyone the 
PSA.37.22	will be destroyed.
PSA.37.23	If you do what the 
PSA.37.23	he will make certain
PSA.37.23	each step you take is sure.
PSA.37.24	The 
PSA.37.24	and if you stumble,
PSA.37.24	you still won't fall.
PSA.37.25	As long as I can remember,
PSA.37.25	good people have never
PSA.37.25	been left helpless,
PSA.37.25	and their children have never
PSA.37.25	gone begging for food.
PSA.37.26	They gladly give and lend,
PSA.37.26	and their children
PSA.37.26	turn out good.
PSA.37.27	If you stop sinning
PSA.37.27	and start doing right,
PSA.37.27	you will keep living
PSA.37.27	and be secure forever.
PSA.37.28	The 
PSA.37.28	and he won't ever desert
PSA.37.28	his faithful people.
PSA.37.28	He always protects them,
PSA.37.28	but destroys the children
PSA.37.28	of the wicked.
PSA.37.29	God's people will own the land
PSA.37.29	and live here forever.
PSA.37.30	Words of wisdom come
PSA.37.30	when good people speak
PSA.37.30	for justice.
PSA.37.31	They remember God's teachings,
PSA.37.31	and they never take
PSA.37.31	a wrong step.
PSA.37.32	The wicked try to trap
PSA.37.32	and kill good people,
PSA.37.33	but the 
PSA.37.33	and he will defend them
PSA.37.33	when they are on trial.
PSA.37.34	Trust the 
PSA.37.34	He will give you the land,
PSA.37.34	and you will see
PSA.37.34	the wicked destroyed.
PSA.37.35	I have seen brutal people
PSA.37.35	abuse others and grow strong
PSA.37.35	like trees in rich soil.
PSA.37.36	Suddenly they disappeared!
PSA.37.36	I looked, but they were gone
PSA.37.36	and no longer there.
PSA.37.37	Think of the bright future
PSA.37.37	waiting for all the families
PSA.37.37	of honest, innocent,
PSA.37.37	and peace-loving people.
PSA.37.38	But not a trace will be left
PSA.37.38	of the wicked
PSA.37.38	or their families.
PSA.37.39	The 
PSA.37.39	and they can come to him
PSA.37.39	in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	and saves them from the wicked
PSA.37.40	because they run to him.
PSA.38.1	When you are angry, 
PSA.38.1	please don't punish me
PSA.38.1	or even correct me.
PSA.38.2	You shot me with your arrows,
PSA.38.2	and you struck me
PSA.38.2	with your hand.
PSA.38.3	My body hurts all over
PSA.38.3	because of your anger.
PSA.38.3	Even my bones are in pain,
PSA.38.3	and my sins 
PSA.38.4	are so heavy
PSA.38.4	that I am crushed.
PSA.38.5	Because of my foolishness,
PSA.38.5	I am covered with sores
PSA.38.5	that stink and spread.
PSA.38.6	My body is twisted and bent,
PSA.38.6	and I groan all day long.
PSA.38.7	Fever has my back in flames,
PSA.38.7	and I hurt everywhere.
PSA.38.8	I am worn out and weak,
PSA.38.8	moaning and in distress.
PSA.38.9	You, Lord, know every one
PSA.38.9	of my deepest desires,
PSA.38.9	and my noisy groans
PSA.38.9	are no secret to you.
PSA.38.10	My heart is beating fast.
PSA.38.10	I feel weak all over,
PSA.38.10	and my eyes are red.
PSA.38.11	Because of my sickness,
PSA.38.11	no friends or neighbors
PSA.38.11	will come near me.
PSA.38.12	All who want me dead
PSA.38.12	set traps to catch me,
PSA.38.12	and those who want
PSA.38.12	to harm and destroy me
PSA.38.12	plan and plot all day.
PSA.38.13	I am not able to hear
PSA.38.13	or speak a word;
PSA.38.14	I am completely deaf
PSA.38.14	and can't make a sound.
PSA.38.15	I trust you, 
PSA.38.15	and you will do something.
PSA.38.16	I said, “Don't let them laugh
PSA.38.16	or brag when I slip and fall.”
PSA.38.17	I am about to collapse
PSA.38.17	from constant pain.
PSA.38.18	I told you my sins,
PSA.38.18	and I am sorry for them.
PSA.38.19	Many deadly and powerful
PSA.38.19	enemies hate me,
PSA.38.20	and they repay evil for good
PSA.38.20	because I try to do right.
PSA.38.21	You are the 
PSA.38.21	Stay nearby
PSA.38.21	and don't desert me.
PSA.38.22	You are the one who saves me.
PSA.38.22	Please hurry and help.
PSA.39.1	I told myself, “I'll be careful
PSA.39.1	not to sin by what I say,
PSA.39.1	and I'll muzzle my mouth
PSA.39.1	when evil people are near.”
PSA.39.2	I kept completely silent,
PSA.39.2	but it did no good,
PSA.39.2	and I hurt even worse.
PSA.39.3	I felt a fire burning inside,
PSA.39.3	and the more I thought,
PSA.39.3	the more it burned,
PSA.39.3	until at last I said:
PSA.39.4	“Please, 
PSA.39.4	show me my future.
PSA.39.4	Will I soon be gone?
PSA.39.5	You made my life short,
PSA.39.5	so brief that the time
PSA.39.5	means nothing to you.
PSA.39.5	“Human life is but a breath,
PSA.39.6	and it disappears
PSA.39.6	like a shadow.
PSA.39.6	Our struggles are senseless;
PSA.39.6	we store up more and more,
PSA.39.6	without ever knowing
PSA.39.6	who will get it all.
PSA.39.7	“What am I waiting for?
PSA.39.7	I depend on you, Lord!
PSA.39.8	Save me from my sins.
PSA.39.8	Don't let fools sneer at me.
PSA.39.9	You treated me like this,
PSA.39.9	and I kept silent,
PSA.39.9	not saying a word.
PSA.39.10	“Won't you stop punishing me?
PSA.39.10	You have worn me down.
PSA.39.11	You punish us severely
PSA.39.11	because of our sins.
PSA.39.11	Like a moth, you destroy
PSA.39.11	what we treasure most.
PSA.39.11	We are as frail as a breath.
PSA.39.12	“Listen, 
PSA.39.12	My eyes are flooded with tears,
PSA.39.12	as I pray to you.
PSA.39.12	I am merely a stranger
PSA.39.12	visiting in your home
PSA.39.12	as my ancestors did.
PSA.39.13	Stop being angry with me
PSA.39.13	and let me smile again
PSA.39.13	before I am dead and gone.”
PSA.40.1	I patiently waited, 
PSA.40.1	for you to hear my prayer.
PSA.40.1	You listened 
PSA.40.2	and pulled me
PSA.40.2	from a lonely pit
PSA.40.2	full of mud and mire.
PSA.40.2	You let me stand on a rock
PSA.40.2	with my feet firm,
PSA.40.3	and you gave me a new song,
PSA.40.3	a song of praise to you.
PSA.40.3	Many will see this,
PSA.40.3	and they will honor and trust
PSA.40.3	you, the 
PSA.40.4	You bless all of those
PSA.40.4	who trust you, 
PSA.40.4	and refuse to worship idols
PSA.40.4	or follow false gods.
PSA.40.5	You, 
PSA.40.5	many wonderful things,
PSA.40.5	and you have planned
PSA.40.5	marvelous things for us.
PSA.40.5	No one is like you!
PSA.40.5	I would never be able to tell
PSA.40.5	all you have done.
PSA.40.6	are not what please you;
PSA.40.6	gifts and payment for sin
PSA.40.6	are not what you demand.
PSA.40.6	But you made me willing
PSA.40.6	to listen and obey.
PSA.40.7	And so, I said, “I am here
PSA.40.7	to do what is written
PSA.40.7	about me in the book,
PSA.40.7	where it says,
PSA.40.8	‘I enjoy pleasing you.
PSA.40.8	Your Law is in my heart.’ ”
PSA.40.9	When your people worshiped,
PSA.40.9	you know I told them,
PSA.40.9	“Our 
PSA.40.10	When all your people met,
PSA.40.10	I did not keep silent.
PSA.40.10	I said, “Our 
PSA.40.10	He is faithful and caring,
PSA.40.10	and he saves us.”
PSA.40.11	You, 
PSA.40.11	to have pity on me;
PSA.40.11	your love and faithfulness
PSA.40.11	always keep me secure.
PSA.40.12	I have more troubles
PSA.40.12	than I can count.
PSA.40.12	My sins are all around me,
PSA.40.12	and I can't find my way.
PSA.40.12	My sins outnumber
PSA.40.12	the hairs on my head,
PSA.40.12	and I feel weak.
PSA.40.13	Please show that you care
PSA.40.13	and come to my rescue.
PSA.40.13	Hurry and help me!
PSA.40.14	Disgrace and confuse
PSA.40.14	all who want me dead;
PSA.40.14	turn away and disgrace
PSA.40.14	all who want to hurt me.
PSA.40.15	Embarrass and shame
PSA.40.15	everyone who says,
PSA.40.15	“Just look at you now!”
PSA.40.16	Our 
PSA.40.16	rejoice and be glad.
PSA.40.16	They love you for saving them,
PSA.40.16	so let them always say,
PSA.40.16	“The 
PSA.40.17	I am poor and needy,
PSA.40.17	but, 
PSA.40.17	you care about me,
PSA.40.17	and you come to my rescue.
PSA.40.17	Please hurry and help.
PSA.41.1	You, 
PSA.41.1	who cares for the poor,
PSA.41.1	and you rescue those people
PSA.41.1	in times of trouble.
PSA.41.2	You protect them
PSA.41.2	and keep them alive.
PSA.41.2	You make them happy here
PSA.41.2	in this land,
PSA.41.2	and you don't hand them over
PSA.41.2	to their enemies.
PSA.41.3	You always heal them
PSA.41.3	and restore their strength
PSA.41.3	when they are sick.
PSA.41.4	I prayed, “Have pity, 
PSA.41.4	Heal me, though I have sinned
PSA.41.4	against you.”
PSA.41.5	My vicious enemies ask me,
PSA.41.5	“When will you die
PSA.41.5	and be forgotten?”
PSA.41.6	When visitors come,
PSA.41.6	all they ever bring
PSA.41.6	are worthless words,
PSA.41.6	and when they leave,
PSA.41.6	they spread gossip.
PSA.41.7	My enemies whisper about me.
PSA.41.7	They think the worst,
PSA.41.8	and they say,
PSA.41.8	“You have some fatal disease!
PSA.41.8	You'll never get well.”
PSA.41.9	has turned against me,
PSA.41.9	though he ate at my table.
PSA.41.10	Have pity, 
PSA.41.10	so I can pay them back.
PSA.41.11	Then my enemies
PSA.41.11	won't defeat me,
PSA.41.11	and I will know
PSA.41.11	that you really care.
PSA.41.12	You have helped me
PSA.41.12	because I am innocent,
PSA.41.12	and you will always
PSA.41.12	be close to my side.
PSA.41.13	will be praised forever!
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen.
PSA.42.1	As a deer gets thirsty
PSA.42.1	for streams of water,
PSA.42.1	I truly am thirsty
PSA.42.1	for you, my God.
PSA.42.2	In my heart, I am thirsty
PSA.42.2	for you, the living God.
PSA.42.2	When will I see your face?
PSA.42.3	Day and night my tears
PSA.42.3	are my only food,
PSA.42.3	as everyone keeps asking,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	Sorrow floods my heart,
PSA.42.4	when I remember
PSA.42.4	leading the worshipers
PSA.42.4	to your house.
PSA.42.4	I can still hear them shout
PSA.42.4	their joyful praises.
PSA.42.5	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.42.5	Why am I restless?
PSA.42.5	I should trust you, 
PSA.42.5	I will praise you again
PSA.42.5	because you help me,
PSA.42.6	and you are my God.
PSA.42.6	I am deeply discouraged,
PSA.42.6	and so I think about you
PSA.42.6	here where the Jordan begins
PSA.42.6	at Mount Hermon
PSA.42.6	and at Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Your vicious waves
PSA.42.7	have swept over me
PSA.42.7	like an angry ocean
PSA.42.7	or a roaring waterfall.
PSA.42.8	Every day, you are kind,
PSA.42.8	and at night
PSA.42.8	you give me a song
PSA.42.8	as my prayer to you,
PSA.42.8	the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	You are my mighty rock.
PSA.42.9	Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must enemies mistreat me
PSA.42.9	and make me sad?
PSA.42.10	Even my bones are in pain,
PSA.42.10	while all day long
PSA.42.10	my enemies sneer and ask,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.42.11	Why am I restless?
PSA.42.11	I trust you, 
PSA.42.11	And I will praise you again
PSA.42.11	because you help me,
PSA.42.11	and you are my God.
PSA.43.1	Show that I am right, God!
PSA.43.1	Defend me against everyone
PSA.43.1	who doesn't know you;
PSA.43.1	rescue me from each
PSA.43.1	of those deceitful liars.
PSA.43.2	I run to you for protection.
PSA.43.2	Why do you turn me away?
PSA.43.2	Why must enemies mistreat me
PSA.43.2	and make me sad?
PSA.43.3	Send your light and your truth
PSA.43.3	to guide me.
PSA.43.3	Let them lead me to your house
PSA.43.3	on your sacred mountain.
PSA.43.4	Then I will worship
PSA.43.4	at your altar because you
PSA.43.4	make me joyful.
PSA.43.4	You are my God,
PSA.43.4	and I will praise you.
PSA.43.4	Yes, I will praise you
PSA.43.4	as I play my harp.
PSA.43.5	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.43.5	Why am I restless?
PSA.43.5	I trust you, 
PSA.43.5	And I will praise you again
PSA.43.5	because you help me,
PSA.43.5	and you are my God.
PSA.44.1	Our God, our ancestors told us
PSA.44.1	what wonders you worked
PSA.44.1	and we listened carefully.
PSA.44.2	You chased off the nations
PSA.44.2	by causing them trouble
PSA.44.2	with your powerful arm.
PSA.44.2	Then you let our ancestors
PSA.44.2	take over their land.
PSA.44.3	Their strength and weapons
PSA.44.3	were not what won the land
PSA.44.3	and gave them victory!
PSA.44.3	You loved them and fought
PSA.44.3	with your powerful arm
PSA.44.3	and your shining glory.
PSA.44.4	You are my God and King,
PSA.44.4	and you give victory
PSA.44.4	to the people of Jacob.
PSA.44.5	By your great power,
PSA.44.5	we knocked our enemies down
PSA.44.5	and trampled on them.
PSA.44.6	I don't depend on my arrows
PSA.44.6	or my sword to save me.
PSA.44.7	But you saved us
PSA.44.7	from our hateful enemies,
PSA.44.7	and you put them to shame.
PSA.44.8	We boast about you, our God,
PSA.44.8	and we are always grateful.
PSA.44.9	But now you have rejected us;
PSA.44.9	you don't lead us into battle,
PSA.44.9	and we look foolish.
PSA.44.10	You made us retreat,
PSA.44.10	and our enemies have taken
PSA.44.10	everything we own.
PSA.44.11	You let us be slaughtered
PSA.44.11	like sheep,
PSA.44.11	and you scattered us
PSA.44.11	among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sold your people
PSA.44.12	for little or nothing,
PSA.44.12	and you earned no profit.
PSA.44.13	You made us look foolish
PSA.44.13	to our neighbors;
PSA.44.13	people who live nearby
PSA.44.13	insult us and sneer.
PSA.44.14	Foreigners joke about us
PSA.44.14	and shake their heads.
PSA.44.15	I am embarrassed every day,
PSA.44.15	and I blush with shame.
PSA.44.16	But others mock and sneer,
PSA.44.16	as they watch my enemies
PSA.44.16	take revenge on me.
PSA.44.17	All this happened to us,
PSA.44.17	though we didn't forget you
PSA.44.17	or break our agreement.
PSA.44.18	We always kept you in mind
PSA.44.18	and followed your teaching.
PSA.44.19	But you crushed us,
PSA.44.19	and you covered us
PSA.44.19	with deepest darkness
PSA.44.19	where wild animals live.
PSA.44.20	We did not forget you
PSA.44.20	or lift our hands in prayer
PSA.44.20	to foreign gods.
PSA.44.21	You would have known it
PSA.44.21	because you discover
PSA.44.21	every secret thought.
PSA.44.22	We are like sheep on their way
PSA.44.22	to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Wake up! Do something, Lord!
PSA.44.23	Why are you sleeping?
PSA.44.23	Don't desert us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do you keep looking away?
PSA.44.24	Don't forget our sufferings
PSA.44.24	and all our troubles.
PSA.44.25	We are flat on the ground,
PSA.44.25	holding on to the dust.
PSA.44.26	Do something! Help us!
PSA.44.26	Show how kind you are
PSA.44.26	and come to our rescue.
PSA.45.1	My thoughts are filled
PSA.45.1	with beautiful words
PSA.45.1	for the king,
PSA.45.1	and I will use my voice
PSA.45.1	as a writer would use
PSA.45.1	pen and ink.
PSA.45.2	No one is as handsome as you!
PSA.45.2	Your words are always kind.
PSA.45.2	That is why God
PSA.45.2	will always bless you.
PSA.45.3	Mighty king, glorious ruler,
PSA.45.3	strap on your sword
PSA.45.4	and ride out in splendor!
PSA.45.4	Win victories for truth
PSA.45.4	and mercy and justice.
PSA.45.4	Do fearsome things
PSA.45.4	with your powerful arm.
PSA.45.5	Send your sharp arrows
PSA.45.5	through enemy hearts
PSA.45.5	and make all nations fall
PSA.45.5	at your feet.
PSA.45.6	forever as king.
PSA.45.6	Your royal power
PSA.45.6	brings about justice.
PSA.45.7	You love justice and hate evil.
PSA.45.7	And so, your God chose you
PSA.45.7	and made you happier
PSA.45.7	than any of your friends.
PSA.45.8	The sweet aroma of the spices
PSA.45.8	myrrh, aloes, and cassia
PSA.45.8	covers your royal robes.
PSA.45.8	You enjoy the music of harps
PSA.45.8	in palaces decorated
PSA.45.8	with ivory.
PSA.45.9	Daughters of kings are here,
PSA.45.9	and your bride stands
PSA.45.9	at your right side,
PSA.45.9	wearing a wedding gown
PSA.45.9	trimmed with pure gold.
PSA.45.10	Bride of the king,
PSA.45.10	listen carefully to me.
PSA.45.10	Forget your own people
PSA.45.10	and your father's family. 
PSA.45.11	The king adores you.
PSA.45.11	He is your master,
PSA.45.11	so do what he desires.
PSA.45.12	All of the richest people
PSA.45.12	from the city of Tyre
PSA.45.12	will try to influence you
PSA.45.13	with precious treasures.
PSA.45.13	Your bride, my king,
PSA.45.13	has inward beauty,
PSA.45.13	and her wedding gown is woven
PSA.45.13	with threads of gold.
PSA.45.14	Wearing the finest garments,
PSA.45.14	she is brought to you,
PSA.45.14	followed by her young friends,
PSA.45.14	the bridesmaids.
PSA.45.15	Everyone is excited,
PSA.45.15	as they follow you
PSA.45.15	to the royal palace.
PSA.45.16	Your sons and your grandsons
PSA.45.16	will also be kings
PSA.45.16	as your ancestors were.
PSA.45.16	You will make them rulers
PSA.45.16	everywhere on earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make your name famous
PSA.45.17	from now on,
PSA.45.17	and you will be praised
PSA.45.17	forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our mighty fortress,
PSA.46.1	always ready to help
PSA.46.1	in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	And so, we won't be afraid!
PSA.46.2	Let the earth tremble
PSA.46.2	and the mountains tumble
PSA.46.2	into the deepest sea.
PSA.46.3	Let the ocean roar and foam,
PSA.46.3	and its raging waves
PSA.46.3	shake the mountains.
PSA.46.4	A river and its streams
PSA.46.4	bring joy to the city,
PSA.46.4	which is the sacred home
PSA.46.4	of God Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in that city,
PSA.46.5	and it won't be shaken.
PSA.46.5	He will help it at dawn.
PSA.46.6	Nations rage! Kingdoms fall!
PSA.46.6	But at the voice of God
PSA.46.6	the earth itself melts.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	is with us.
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob
PSA.46.7	is our fortress.
PSA.46.8	Come! See the fearsome things
PSA.46.8	the 
PSA.46.9	God brings wars to an end
PSA.46.9	all over the world.
PSA.46.9	He breaks the arrows,
PSA.46.9	shatters the spears,
PSA.46.9	and burns the shields.
PSA.46.10	Our God says, “Calm down,
PSA.46.10	and learn that I am God!
PSA.46.10	All nations on earth
PSA.46.10	will honor me.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	is with us.
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob
PSA.46.11	is our fortress.
PSA.47.1	All of you nations,
PSA.47.1	clap your hands and shout
PSA.47.1	joyful praises to God.
PSA.47.2	The 
PSA.47.2	the ruler of all the earth.
PSA.47.3	God has put every nation
PSA.47.3	under our power,
PSA.47.4	and he chose for us the land
PSA.47.4	that was the pride of Jacob,
PSA.47.4	his favorite.
PSA.47.5	God goes up to his throne,
PSA.47.5	as people shout
PSA.47.5	and trumpets blast.
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God our King,
PSA.47.7	the ruler of all the earth!
PSA.47.7	Praise God with songs.
PSA.47.8	God rules the nations
PSA.47.8	from his sacred throne.
PSA.47.9	Their leaders come together
PSA.47.9	and are now the people
PSA.47.9	of Abraham's God.
PSA.47.9	All rulers on earth
PSA.47.9	surrender their weapons,
PSA.47.9	and God is greatly praised!
PSA.48.1	The 
PSA.48.1	He deserves all praise
PSA.48.1	in the city where he lives.
PSA.48.1	His holy mountain,
PSA.48.2	brings joy to all on earth.
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion, truly sacred,
PSA.48.2	is home for the Great King.
PSA.48.3	God is there to defend it
PSA.48.3	and has proved to be
PSA.48.3	its protector.
PSA.48.4	Kings joined forces
PSA.48.4	to attack the city,
PSA.48.5	but when they saw it,
PSA.48.5	they were terrified
PSA.48.5	and ran away.
PSA.48.6	They trembled all over
PSA.48.6	like women giving birth
PSA.48.7	or like seagoing ships
PSA.48.7	wrecked by eastern winds.
PSA.48.8	We had heard about it,
PSA.48.8	and now we have seen it
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God,
PSA.48.8	the 
PSA.48.8	This is the city that God
PSA.48.8	will let stand forever.
PSA.48.9	Our God, here in your temple
PSA.48.9	we think about your love.
PSA.48.10	You are famous and praised
PSA.48.10	everywhere on earth,
PSA.48.10	as you win victories
PSA.48.10	with your powerful arm.
PSA.48.11	Mount Zion will celebrate,
PSA.48.11	and all Judah will be glad,
PSA.48.11	because you bring justice.
PSA.48.12	Let's walk around Zion
PSA.48.12	and count its towers.
PSA.48.13	We will see its strong walls
PSA.48.13	and visit each fortress.
PSA.48.13	Then you can say
PSA.48.13	to future generations,
PSA.48.14	“Our God is like this forever
PSA.48.14	and will always
PSA.49.1	Everyone on this earth,
PSA.49.1	now listen to what I say!
PSA.49.2	Listen, no matter who you are,
PSA.49.2	rich or poor.
PSA.49.3	I speak words of wisdom,
PSA.49.3	and my thoughts make sense.
PSA.49.4	I have in mind a mystery
PSA.49.4	that I will explain
PSA.49.4	while playing my harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I be afraid
PSA.49.5	in times of trouble,
PSA.49.5	when I am surrounded
PSA.49.5	by vicious enemies?
PSA.49.6	They trust in their riches
PSA.49.6	and brag about
PSA.49.6	all their wealth.
PSA.49.7	You cannot buy back your life
PSA.49.7	or pay off God!
PSA.49.8	It costs far too much
PSA.49.8	to buy back your life.
PSA.49.8	You can never pay God enough
PSA.49.9	to stay alive forever
PSA.49.9	and safe from death.
PSA.49.10	and so do stupid fools.
PSA.49.10	Then their money is left
PSA.49.10	for someone else.
PSA.49.11	The grave
PSA.49.11	forever and ever,
PSA.49.11	although they once had land
PSA.49.11	of their own.
PSA.49.12	Our human glory disappears,
PSA.49.12	and, like animals, we die.
PSA.49.13	Here is what happens to fools
PSA.49.13	and to those who trust
PSA.49.13	the words of fools:
PSA.49.14	They are like sheep
PSA.49.14	with death as their shepherd,
PSA.49.14	leading them to the grave.
PSA.49.14	In the morning God's people
PSA.49.14	will walk all over them,
PSA.49.14	as their bodies lie rotting
PSA.49.14	in their home, the grave.
PSA.49.15	But God will rescue me
PSA.49.15	from the power of death.
PSA.49.16	Don't let it bother you
PSA.49.16	when others get rich
PSA.49.16	and live in luxury.
PSA.49.17	Soon they will die
PSA.49.17	and all their wealth
PSA.49.17	will be left behind.
PSA.49.18	We humans are praised
PSA.49.18	when we do well,
PSA.49.18	and all of us are glad
PSA.49.18	to be alive.
PSA.49.19	But we each will go down
PSA.49.19	to our ancestors,
PSA.49.19	never again to see
PSA.49.19	the light of day.
PSA.49.20	Our human glory disappears,
PSA.49.20	and, like animals, we die.
PSA.50.1	From east to west,
PSA.50.1	the powerful 
PSA.50.1	has been calling together
PSA.50.1	everyone on earth.
PSA.50.2	God shines brightly from Zion,
PSA.50.2	the most beautiful city.
PSA.50.3	Our God approaches,
PSA.50.3	but not silently;
PSA.50.3	a flaming fire comes first,
PSA.50.3	and a storm surrounds him.
PSA.50.4	God comes to judge his people.
PSA.50.4	He shouts to the heavens
PSA.50.4	and to the earth,
PSA.50.5	“Call my followers together!
PSA.50.5	They offered me a sacrifice,
PSA.50.5	and we made an agreement.”
PSA.50.6	The heavens announce,
PSA.50.6	“God is the judge,
PSA.50.6	and he is always honest.”
PSA.50.7	My people, I am God!
PSA.50.7	Israel, I am your God.
PSA.50.7	Listen to my charges
PSA.50.7	against you.
PSA.50.8	Although you offer sacrifices
PSA.50.8	and always bring gifts,
PSA.50.9	I won't accept your offerings
PSA.50.9	of bulls and goats.
PSA.50.10	Every animal in the forest
PSA.50.10	belongs to me,
PSA.50.10	and so do the cattle
PSA.50.10	on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the birds
PSA.50.11	in the mountains,
PSA.50.11	and every wild creature
PSA.50.11	is in my care.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry,
PSA.50.12	I wouldn't tell you,
PSA.50.12	because I own the world
PSA.50.12	and everything in it.
PSA.50.13	I don't eat the meat of bulls
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats.
PSA.50.14	I am God Most High!
PSA.50.14	The only sacrifice I want
PSA.50.14	is for you to be thankful
PSA.50.14	and to keep your word.
PSA.50.15	Pray to me in time of trouble.
PSA.50.15	I will rescue you,
PSA.50.15	and you will honor me.
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked I say:
PSA.50.16	“You don't have the right
PSA.50.16	to mention my laws or claim
PSA.50.16	to keep our agreement!
PSA.50.17	You refused correction
PSA.50.17	and rejected my commands.
PSA.50.18	You made friends
PSA.50.18	with every crook you met,
PSA.50.18	and you liked people who break
PSA.50.18	their wedding vows.
PSA.50.19	You talked only about violence
PSA.50.19	and told nothing but lies;
PSA.50.20	you sat around gossiping,
PSA.50.20	ruining the reputation
PSA.50.20	of your own relatives.”
PSA.50.21	When you did all this,
PSA.50.21	I didn't say a word,
PSA.50.21	and you thought,
PSA.50.21	“God is just like us!”
PSA.50.21	But now I will accuse you.
PSA.50.22	You have ignored me!
PSA.50.22	So pay close attention
PSA.50.22	or I will tear you apart,
PSA.50.22	and no one can help you.
PSA.50.23	The sacrifice that honors me
PSA.50.23	is a thankful heart.
PSA.50.23	Obey me,
PSA.50.23	will show my power to save.
PSA.51.1	Please have pity on me.
PSA.51.1	You are always merciful!
PSA.51.1	Please wipe away my sins.
PSA.51.2	Wash me clean from all
PSA.51.2	of my sin and guilt.
PSA.51.3	I know about my sins,
PSA.51.3	and I cannot forget
PSA.51.3	the burden of my guilt.
PSA.51.4	I have sinned against;
PSA.51.4	I have disobeyed you
PSA.51.4	and have done wrong.
PSA.51.4	So it is right and fair for you
PSA.51.4	to correct and punish me.
PSA.51.5	I have sinned and done wrong
PSA.51.5	since the day I was born.
PSA.51.6	But you want complete honesty,
PSA.51.6	so teach me true wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Wash me with hyssop
PSA.51.7	until I am clean
PSA.51.7	and whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Let me be happy and joyful!
PSA.51.8	You crushed my bones,
PSA.51.8	now let them celebrate.
PSA.51.9	Turn your eyes from my sin
PSA.51.9	and cover my guilt.
PSA.51.10	Create pure thoughts in me
PSA.51.10	and make me faithful again.
PSA.51.11	Don't chase me away from you
PSA.51.11	or take your Holy Spirit
PSA.51.11	away from me.
PSA.51.12	Make me as happy as you did
PSA.51.12	when you saved me;
PSA.51.12	make me want to obey!
PSA.51.13	I will teach sinners your Law,
PSA.51.13	and they will return to you.
PSA.51.14	Keep me from any deadly sin.
PSA.51.14	Only you can save me!
PSA.51.14	Then I will shout and sing
PSA.51.14	about your power to save.
PSA.51.15	Help me to speak,
PSA.51.15	and I will praise you, Lord.
PSA.51.16	Offerings and sacrifices
PSA.51.16	are not what you want.
PSA.51.17	The way to please you
PSA.51.17	is to be truly sorry
PSA.51.17	deep in our hearts.
PSA.51.17	This is the kind of sacrifice
PSA.51.17	you won't refuse.
PSA.51.18	Please be willing, Lord,
PSA.51.18	to help the city of Zion
PSA.51.18	and to rebuild its walls.
PSA.51.19	Then you will be pleased
PSA.51.19	with the proper sacrifices,
PSA.51.19	and we will offer bulls
PSA.51.19	on your altar once again.
PSA.52.1	and brag about your sins,
PSA.52.1	but God can be trusted
PSA.52.1	day after day.
PSA.52.2	You plan brutal crimes,
PSA.52.2	and your lying words cut
PSA.52.2	like a sharp razor.
PSA.52.3	You would rather do evil
PSA.52.3	than good, and tell lies
PSA.52.3	than speak the truth.
PSA.52.4	You love to say cruel things,
PSA.52.4	and your words are a trap.
PSA.52.5	God will destroy you forever!
PSA.52.5	He will grab you and drag you
PSA.52.5	from your homes.
PSA.52.5	You will be uprooted
PSA.52.5	and left to die.
PSA.52.6	When good people see
PSA.52.6	this fearsome sight,
PSA.52.6	they will laugh and say,
PSA.52.7	“Just look at them now!
PSA.52.7	Instead of trusting God,
PSA.52.7	they trusted their wealth
PSA.52.7	and their cruelty.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree
PSA.52.8	growing in God's house,
PSA.52.8	and I can count on his love
PSA.52.8	forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will always thank God
PSA.52.9	for what he has done;
PSA.52.9	I will praise his good name
PSA.52.9	when his people meet.
PSA.53.1	“There is no God!”
PSA.53.1	People like that are worthless!
PSA.53.1	They are heartless and cruel
PSA.53.1	and never do right.
PSA.53.2	From heaven God
PSA.53.2	looks down to see
PSA.53.2	if anyone is wise enough
PSA.53.2	to search for him.
PSA.53.3	But all of them
PSA.53.3	are crooked and corrupt.
PSA.53.3	Not one of them does right.
PSA.53.4	Won't you lawbreakers learn?
PSA.53.4	You refuse to pray,
PSA.53.4	and you gobble up
PSA.53.4	the people of God.
PSA.53.5	But you will be terrified
PSA.53.5	worse than ever before.
PSA.53.5	God will scatter the bones
PSA.53.5	of his enemies,
PSA.53.5	and you will be ashamed
PSA.53.5	when God rejects you.
PSA.53.6	I long for someone from Zion
PSA.53.6	to come and save Israel!
PSA.53.6	Our God, when you bless
PSA.53.6	your people again,
PSA.53.6	Jacob's family will be glad,
PSA.53.6	and Israel will celebrate.
PSA.54.1	and prove that I am right.
PSA.54.2	Listen to my prayer
PSA.54.2	and hear what I say.
PSA.54.3	Cruel strangers have attacked
PSA.54.3	and want me dead.
PSA.54.3	Not one of them cares
PSA.54.3	about you.
PSA.54.4	You will help me, Lord God,
PSA.54.4	and keep me from falling;
PSA.54.5	you will punish my enemies
PSA.54.5	for their evil deeds.
PSA.54.5	Be my faithful friend
PSA.54.5	and destroy them.
PSA.54.6	I will bring a gift
PSA.54.6	and offer a sacrifice
PSA.54.6	to you, 
PSA.54.6	I will praise your name
PSA.54.6	because you are good.
PSA.54.7	You have rescued me
PSA.54.7	from all my troubles,
PSA.54.7	and my own eyes have seen
PSA.54.7	my enemies fall.
PSA.55.1	Listen, God, to my prayer!
PSA.55.1	Don't reject my request.
PSA.55.2	Please listen and help me.
PSA.55.2	My thoughts are troubled,
PSA.55.2	and I keep groaning
PSA.55.3	because my enemies attack
PSA.55.3	with loud shouts.
PSA.55.3	They treat me terribly
PSA.55.3	and hold angry grudges.
PSA.55.4	My heart is racing fast,
PSA.55.4	and I am afraid of dying.
PSA.55.5	I am trembling with fear,
PSA.55.5	completely terrified.
PSA.55.6	I wish I had wings
PSA.55.6	like a dove,
PSA.55.6	so I could fly far away
PSA.55.6	and be at peace.
PSA.55.7	I would go and live
PSA.55.7	in some distant desert.
PSA.55.8	I would quickly find shelter
PSA.55.8	from howling winds
PSA.55.8	and raging storms.
PSA.55.9	Confuse my enemies, Lord!
PSA.55.9	Upset their plans.
PSA.55.9	Cruelty and violence
PSA.55.9	are all I see in the city,
PSA.55.10	and they are like guards
PSA.55.10	on patrol day and night.
PSA.55.10	The city is full of trouble,
PSA.55.10	evil, 
PSA.55.11	and corruption.
PSA.55.11	Troublemakers and liars
PSA.55.11	freely roam the streets.
PSA.55.12	My enemies are not the ones
PSA.55.12	who sneer and make fun.
PSA.55.12	I could put up with that
PSA.55.12	or even hide from them.
PSA.55.13	But it was my closest friend,
PSA.55.13	the one I trusted most.
PSA.55.14	We enjoyed being together,
PSA.55.14	when we went with others
PSA.55.14	to your house, our God.
PSA.55.15	All who hate me are controlled
PSA.55.15	by the power of evil.
PSA.55.15	Sentence them to death
PSA.55.15	and send them down alive
PSA.55.15	to the world of the dead.
PSA.55.16	I ask for your help, 
PSA.55.16	and you will keep me safe.
PSA.55.17	Morning, noon, and night
PSA.55.17	you hear my concerns
PSA.55.17	and my complaints.
PSA.55.18	I am attacked from all sides,
PSA.55.18	but you will rescue me
PSA.55.18	unharmed by the battle.
PSA.55.19	You have always ruled,
PSA.55.19	and you will hear me.
PSA.55.19	You will defeat my enemies
PSA.55.19	because they won't turn
PSA.55.19	and worship you.
PSA.55.20	My friend turned against me
PSA.55.20	and broke his promise.
PSA.55.21	His words were smoother
PSA.55.21	than butter, and softer
PSA.55.21	than olive oil.
PSA.55.21	But hatred filled his heart,
PSA.55.21	and he was ready to attack
PSA.55.21	with a sword.
PSA.55.22	Our 
PSA.55.22	We tell you what worries us,
PSA.55.22	and you won't let us fall.
PSA.55.23	But what about those people
PSA.55.23	who are cruel and brutal?
PSA.55.23	You will throw them down
PSA.55.23	into the deepest pit
PSA.55.23	long before their time.
PSA.55.23	I trust you, 
PSA.56.1	My enemies chase me all day.
PSA.56.2	Many of them are pursuing
PSA.56.2	and attacking me,
PSA.56.3	but even when I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I keep on trusting you.
PSA.56.4	I praise your promises!
PSA.56.4	I trust you and am not afraid.
PSA.56.4	No one can harm me.
PSA.56.5	Enemies spend the whole day
PSA.56.5	finding fault with me;
PSA.56.5	all they think about
PSA.56.5	is how to do me harm.
PSA.56.6	They attack from ambush,
PSA.56.6	watching my every step
PSA.56.6	and hoping to kill me.
PSA.56.7	They won't get away
PSA.56.7	with these crimes, God,
PSA.56.7	because when you get angry,
PSA.56.7	you destroy people.
PSA.56.8	You have kept record
PSA.56.8	of my days of wandering.
PSA.56.8	You have stored my tears
PSA.56.8	in your bottle
PSA.56.8	and counted each of them.
PSA.56.9	When I pray, 
PSA.56.9	my enemies will retreat,
PSA.56.9	because I know for certain
PSA.56.9	that you are with me.
PSA.56.10	I praise your promises!
PSA.56.11	I trust you and am not afraid.
PSA.56.11	No one can harm me.
PSA.56.12	I will keep my promises
PSA.56.12	to you, my God,
PSA.56.12	and bring you gifts.
PSA.56.13	You protected me from death
PSA.56.13	and kept me from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	so that I would please you
PSA.56.13	and follow the light
PSA.56.13	that leads to life.
PSA.57.1	Have mercy. I run to you
PSA.57.1	for safety.
PSA.57.1	In the shadow of your wings,
PSA.57.1	I seek protection
PSA.57.1	till danger dies down.
PSA.57.2	I pray to you, my protector.
PSA.57.3	You will send help from heaven
PSA.57.3	and save me,
PSA.57.3	but you will bring trouble
PSA.57.3	on my attackers.
PSA.57.3	You are faithful,
PSA.57.3	and you can be trusted.
PSA.57.4	My enemies are fierce,
PSA.57.4	much worse than lions!
PSA.57.4	They have spears and arrows
PSA.57.4	instead of teeth,
PSA.57.4	and they have sharp swords
PSA.57.4	instead of tongues.
PSA.57.5	May you, my God, be honored
PSA.57.5	above the heavens;
PSA.57.5	may your glory be seen
PSA.57.5	everywhere on earth.
PSA.57.6	and struck me down.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit in my path,
PSA.57.6	but fell in it themselves.
PSA.57.7	I am faithful to you,
PSA.57.7	and you can trust me.
PSA.57.7	I will sing and play music
PSA.57.7	for you, my God.
PSA.57.8	I feel wide awake!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up my harp
PSA.57.8	and wake up the sun.
PSA.57.9	I will praise you, Lord,
PSA.57.9	for everyone to hear,
PSA.57.9	and I will sing hymns to you
PSA.57.9	in every nation.
PSA.57.10	Your love reaches higher
PSA.57.10	than the heavens;
PSA.57.10	your loyalty extends
PSA.57.10	beyond the clouds.
PSA.57.11	May you, my God, be honored
PSA.57.11	above the heavens;
PSA.57.11	may your glory be seen
PSA.57.11	everywhere on earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you mighty people
PSA.58.1	only to oppose justice?
PSA.58.1	Don't you ever judge fairly?
PSA.58.2	You are always planning evil,
PSA.58.2	and you are brutal.
PSA.58.3	You have done wrong and lied
PSA.58.3	from the day you were born.
PSA.58.4	Your words spread poison
PSA.58.4	like the bite of a cobra
PSA.58.5	that refuses to listen
PSA.58.5	to the snake charmer.
PSA.58.6	My enemies are fierce
PSA.58.6	as lions, 
PSA.58.6	Shatter their teeth.
PSA.58.6	Snatch out their fangs.
PSA.58.7	Make them disappear
PSA.58.7	like leaking water,
PSA.58.7	and make their arrows miss.
PSA.58.8	Let them dry up like snails
PSA.58.8	or be like a child that dies
PSA.58.8	before seeing the sun.
PSA.58.9	Wipe them out quicker
PSA.58.9	than a pot can be heated
PSA.58.9	by setting thorns on fire.
PSA.58.10	Good people will be glad
PSA.58.10	when they see the wicked
PSA.58.10	getting what they deserve,
PSA.58.10	and they will wash their feet
PSA.58.10	in their enemies' blood.
PSA.58.11	Everyone will say, “It's true!
PSA.58.11	Good people are rewarded.
PSA.58.11	God does indeed rule the earth
PSA.58.11	with justice.”
PSA.59.1	from enemy attacks!
PSA.59.2	Keep me safe from brutal people
PSA.59.2	who want to kill me.
PSA.59.3	Merciless enemies, 
PSA.59.3	are hiding and plotting,
PSA.59.3	hoping to kill me.
PSA.59.3	I have not hurt them
PSA.59.3	in any way at all.
PSA.59.4	But they are ready to attack.
PSA.59.4	Do something! Help me!
PSA.59.4	Look at what's happening.
PSA.59.5	you are the God of Israel.
PSA.59.5	Punish the other nations
PSA.59.5	and don't pity those terrible
PSA.59.5	and rebellious people.
PSA.59.6	My enemies return at evening,
PSA.59.6	growling like dogs
PSA.59.6	roaming the city.
PSA.59.7	They curse, and their words
PSA.59.7	cut like swords,
PSA.59.7	as they say to themselves,
PSA.59.7	“No one can hear us!”
PSA.59.8	You, 
PSA.59.8	and sneer at the nations.
PSA.59.9	You are my mighty fortress,
PSA.59.9	and I depend on you.
PSA.59.10	You love me and will let me
PSA.59.10	see my enemies defeated.
PSA.59.11	Don't kill them,
PSA.59.11	or everyone may forget!
PSA.59.11	Just use your mighty power
PSA.59.11	to make them tremble
PSA.59.11	and fall.
PSA.59.11	You are a shield
PSA.59.11	for your people.
PSA.59.12	My enemies are liars!
PSA.59.12	So let them be trapped
PSA.59.12	by their boastful lies.
PSA.59.13	Get angry and destroy them.
PSA.59.13	Leave them in ruin.
PSA.59.13	Then all the nations will know
PSA.59.13	that you rule in Israel.
PSA.59.14	Those liars return at evening,
PSA.59.14	growling like dogs
PSA.59.14	roaming the city.
PSA.59.15	They search for scraps of food,
PSA.59.15	and they snarl
PSA.59.15	until they are stuffed.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing about
PSA.59.16	your strength, my God,
PSA.59.16	and I will celebrate
PSA.59.16	because of your love.
PSA.59.16	You are my fortress,
PSA.59.16	my place of protection
PSA.59.16	in times of trouble.
PSA.59.17	I will sing your praises!
PSA.59.17	You are my mighty fortress,
PSA.59.17	and you love me.
PSA.60.1	We are rejected and crushed.
PSA.60.1	Make us strong again!
PSA.60.2	You made the earth shake
PSA.60.2	and split wide open;
PSA.60.2	now heal its wounds
PSA.60.2	and stop its trembling.
PSA.60.3	You brought hard times
PSA.60.3	on your people,
PSA.60.3	and you gave us wine
PSA.60.3	that made us stagger.
PSA.60.4	You gave a signal to those
PSA.60.4	who worship you,
PSA.60.4	so they could escape
PSA.60.4	from enemy arrows.
PSA.60.5	Answer our prayers, God!
PSA.60.5	Use your powerful arm
PSA.60.5	and give us victory.
PSA.60.5	Then the people you love
PSA.60.5	will be safe.
PSA.60.6	Our God, you solemnly promised,
PSA.60.6	“I would gladly divide up
PSA.60.6	the city of Shechem
PSA.60.6	and give away Succoth Valley
PSA.60.6	piece by piece.
PSA.60.7	The lands of Gilead
PSA.60.7	and Manasseh are mine.
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is my war helmet,
PSA.60.7	and Judah is the symbol
PSA.60.7	of my royal power.
PSA.60.8	Moab is merely my washbasin.
PSA.60.8	Edom belongs to me,
PSA.60.8	and I shout in triumph
PSA.60.8	over the Philistines.”
PSA.60.9	Our God, who will bring me
PSA.60.9	to the fortress,
PSA.60.9	or lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Have you rejected us
PSA.60.10	and deserted our armies?
PSA.60.11	Help us defeat our enemies!
PSA.60.11	No one else can rescue us.
PSA.60.12	You will give us victory
PSA.60.12	and crush our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Please listen, God,
PSA.61.1	and answer my prayer!
PSA.61.2	I feel hopeless,
PSA.61.2	and I cry out to you
PSA.61.2	from a faraway land.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the mighty rock
PSA.61.2	high above me.
PSA.61.3	You are a strong tower,
PSA.61.3	where I am safe
PSA.61.3	from my enemies.
PSA.61.4	Let me live with you forever
PSA.61.4	and find protection
PSA.61.4	under your wings, my God.
PSA.61.5	You heard my promises,
PSA.61.5	and you have blessed me,
PSA.61.5	just as you bless everyone
PSA.61.5	who worships you.
PSA.61.6	Let the king have a long
PSA.61.6	and healthy life.
PSA.61.7	May he always rule
PSA.61.7	with you, God, at his side;
PSA.61.7	may your love and loyalty
PSA.61.7	watch over him.
PSA.61.8	I will sing your praises
PSA.61.8	forever, God, and will always
PSA.61.8	keep my promises.
PSA.62.1	Only God can save me,
PSA.62.1	and I calmly wait for
PSA.62.2	God alone is the mighty rock
PSA.62.2	that keeps me safe
PSA.62.2	and the fortress
PSA.62.2	where I am secure.
PSA.62.3	I feel like a shaky fence
PSA.62.3	or a sagging wall.
PSA.62.3	How long will all of you
PSA.62.3	attack and assault me?
PSA.62.4	You want to bring me down
PSA.62.4	from my place of honor.
PSA.62.4	You love to tell lies,
PSA.62.4	and when your words are kind,
PSA.62.4	hatred hides in your heart.
PSA.62.5	Only God gives inward peace,
PSA.62.5	and I depend on him.
PSA.62.6	God alone is the mighty rock
PSA.62.6	that keeps me safe,
PSA.62.6	and he is the fortress
PSA.62.6	where I feel secure.
PSA.62.7	God saves me and honors me.
PSA.62.7	He is that mighty rock
PSA.62.7	where I find safety.
PSA.62.8	Trust God, my friends,
PSA.62.8	and always tell him
PSA.62.8	each of your concerns.
PSA.62.8	God is our place of safety.
PSA.62.9	We humans are only a breath;
PSA.62.9	none of us are truly great.
PSA.62.9	All of us together weigh less
PSA.62.9	than a puff of air.
PSA.62.10	Don't trust in violence
PSA.62.10	or depend on dishonesty
PSA.62.10	or rely on great wealth.
PSA.62.11	I heard God say two things:
PSA.62.11	“I am powerful,
PSA.62.12	The Lord rewards each of us
PSA.62.12	according to what we do.
PSA.63.1	In my heart, I long for you,
PSA.63.1	as I would long for a stream
PSA.63.1	in a scorching desert.
PSA.63.2	I have seen your power
PSA.63.2	and your glory
PSA.63.2	in the place of worship.
PSA.63.3	Your love means more
PSA.63.3	than life to me,
PSA.63.3	and I praise you.
PSA.63.4	As long as I live,
PSA.63.4	I will pray to you.
PSA.63.5	I will sing joyful praises
PSA.63.5	and be filled with excitement
PSA.63.5	like a guest at a banquet.
PSA.63.6	I think about you, God,
PSA.63.6	before I go to sleep,
PSA.63.6	and my thoughts turn to you
PSA.63.6	during the night.
PSA.63.7	You have helped me,
PSA.63.7	and I sing happy songs
PSA.63.7	in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.63.8	I stay close to you,
PSA.63.8	and your powerful arm
PSA.63.8	supports me.
PSA.63.9	All who want to kill me
PSA.63.9	will end up in the ground.
PSA.63.10	Swords will run them through,
PSA.63.10	and wild dogs will eat them.
PSA.63.11	Because of you, our God,
PSA.63.11	the king will celebrate
PSA.63.11	with your faithful followers,
PSA.63.11	but liars will be silent.
PSA.64.1	Listen to my concerns, God,
PSA.64.1	and protect me
PSA.64.1	from my enemies' threats.
PSA.64.2	Keep me safe from secret plots
PSA.64.2	of corrupt and evil gangs.
PSA.64.3	Their words cut like swords,
PSA.64.3	and their cruel remarks
PSA.64.3	sting like sharp arrows.
PSA.64.4	They fearlessly ambush
PSA.64.4	and shoot innocent people.
PSA.64.5	They are determined to do evil,
PSA.64.5	and they tell themselves,
PSA.64.5	“Let's set traps!
PSA.64.5	No one can see us.”
PSA.64.6	They make evil plans and say,
PSA.64.6	“We'll commit a perfect crime.
PSA.64.6	No one knows our thoughts.”
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot his arrows
PSA.64.7	and quickly wound them.
PSA.64.8	They will be destroyed
PSA.64.8	by their own words,
PSA.64.8	and everyone who sees them
PSA.64.8	will tremble with fear.
PSA.64.9	They will be afraid and say,
PSA.64.9	“Look at what God has done
PSA.64.9	and keep it all in mind.”
PSA.64.10	May the 
PSA.64.10	with peace and happiness
PSA.64.10	and let them celebrate.
PSA.65.1	Our God, you deserve
PSA.65.1	in Zion, where we keep
PSA.65.1	our promises to you.
PSA.65.2	Everyone will come to you
PSA.65.2	because you answer prayer.
PSA.65.3	When our sins get us down,
PSA.65.3	you forgive us.
PSA.65.4	You bless your chosen ones,
PSA.65.4	and you invite them
PSA.65.4	to live near you
PSA.65.4	in your temple.
PSA.65.4	We will enjoy your house,
PSA.65.4	the sacred temple.
PSA.65.5	Our God, you save us,
PSA.65.5	and your fearsome deeds answer
PSA.65.5	our prayers for justice!
PSA.65.5	You give hope to people
PSA.65.5	everywhere on earth,
PSA.65.5	even those across the sea.
PSA.65.6	You are strong,
PSA.65.6	and your mighty power
PSA.65.6	put the mountains in place.
PSA.65.7	You silence the roaring waves
PSA.65.7	and the noisy shouts
PSA.65.7	of the nations.
PSA.65.8	People far away marvel
PSA.65.8	at your fearsome deeds,
PSA.65.8	and all who live under the sun
PSA.65.8	celebrate and sing
PSA.65.8	because of you.
PSA.65.9	You take care of the earth
PSA.65.9	and send rain to help the soil
PSA.65.9	grow all kinds of crops.
PSA.65.9	Your rivers never run dry,
PSA.65.9	and you prepare the earth
PSA.65.9	to produce abundant grain.
PSA.65.10	You water all its fields
PSA.65.10	and level the lumpy ground.
PSA.65.10	You send showers of rain
PSA.65.10	to soften the soil
PSA.65.10	and help the plants sprout.
PSA.65.11	Wherever your footsteps
PSA.65.11	touch the earth,
PSA.65.11	a rich harvest is gathered.
PSA.65.12	Desert pastures blossom,
PSA.65.12	and mountains celebrate.
PSA.65.13	Meadows are filled
PSA.65.13	with sheep and goats;
PSA.65.13	valleys overflow with grain
PSA.65.13	and echo with joyful songs.
PSA.66.1	Tell everyone on this earth
PSA.66.1	to shout praises to God!
PSA.66.2	Sing about his glorious name.
PSA.66.2	Honor him with praises.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “Everything you do
PSA.66.3	is fearsome,
PSA.66.3	and your mighty power makes
PSA.66.3	your enemies come crawling.
PSA.66.4	You are worshiped by everyone!
PSA.66.4	We all sing praises to you.”
PSA.66.5	Come and see the fearsome things
PSA.66.5	our God has done!
PSA.66.6	our people walked across,
PSA.66.6	and because of him,
PSA.66.6	we celebrated there.
PSA.66.7	His mighty power rules forever,
PSA.66.7	and nothing the nations do
PSA.66.7	can be hidden from him.
PSA.66.7	So don't turn against God.
PSA.66.8	All of you people,
PSA.66.8	come praise our God!
PSA.66.8	Let his praises be heard.
PSA.66.9	God protects us from death
PSA.66.9	and keeps us steady.
PSA.66.10	Our God, you tested us,
PSA.66.10	just as silver is tested.
PSA.66.11	You trapped us in a net
PSA.66.11	and gave us heavy burdens.
PSA.66.12	You sent war chariots
PSA.66.12	to crush our skulls.
PSA.66.12	We traveled through fire
PSA.66.12	and through floods,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us
PSA.66.12	to a land of plenty.
PSA.66.13	I will bring sacrifices
PSA.66.13	into your house, my God,
PSA.66.13	and I will do what I promised
PSA.66.14	when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will sacrifice my best sheep
PSA.66.15	and offer bulls and goats
PSA.66.15	on your altar.
PSA.66.16	All who worship God,
PSA.66.16	come here and listen;
PSA.66.16	I will tell you everything
PSA.66.16	God has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I prayed to the Lord,
PSA.66.17	and I praised him.
PSA.66.18	If my thoughts had been sinful,
PSA.66.18	he would have refused
PSA.66.18	to hear me.
PSA.66.19	But God did listen
PSA.66.19	and answered my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Let's praise God!
PSA.66.20	He listened when I prayed,
PSA.66.20	and he is always kind.
PSA.67.1	Our God, be kind and bless us!
PSA.67.1	Be pleased and smile.
PSA.67.2	Then everyone on earth
PSA.67.2	will learn to follow you,
PSA.67.2	and all nations will see
PSA.67.2	your power to save us.
PSA.67.3	Make everyone praise you
PSA.67.3	and shout your praises.
PSA.67.4	Let the nations celebrate
PSA.67.4	with joyful songs,
PSA.67.4	because you judge fairly
PSA.67.4	and guide all nations.
PSA.67.5	Make everyone praise you, God,
PSA.67.5	and shout your praises.
PSA.67.6	Our God has blessed the earth
PSA.67.6	with a wonderful harvest!
PSA.67.7	Pray for his blessings
PSA.67.7	to continue
PSA.67.7	and for everyone on earth
PSA.67.7	to worship our God.
PSA.68.1	Do something, God!
PSA.68.1	Scatter your hateful enemies.
PSA.68.1	Make them turn and run.
PSA.68.2	Scatter them like smoke!
PSA.68.2	When you come near,
PSA.68.2	make them melt
PSA.68.2	like wax in a fire.
PSA.68.3	But let your people be happy
PSA.68.3	and celebrate because of you.
PSA.68.4	Our God, you are the one
PSA.68.4	who rides on the clouds,
PSA.68.4	and we praise you.
PSA.68.4	Your name is the 
PSA.68.4	and we celebrate
PSA.68.4	as we worship you.
PSA.68.5	Our God, from your sacred home
PSA.68.5	you take care of orphans
PSA.68.5	and protect widows.
PSA.68.6	You find families
PSA.68.6	for those who are lonely.
PSA.68.6	You set prisoners free
PSA.68.6	and let them prosper,
PSA.68.6	but all who rebel will live
PSA.68.6	in a scorching desert.
PSA.68.7	You set your people free,
PSA.68.7	and you led them
PSA.68.7	through the desert.
PSA.68.8	the earth trembled,
PSA.68.8	and rain poured down.
PSA.68.8	You alone are the God
PSA.68.8	who rules from Mount Sinai.
PSA.68.9	When your land was thirsty,
PSA.68.9	you sent showers
PSA.68.9	to refresh it.
PSA.68.10	Your people settled there,
PSA.68.10	and you were generous
PSA.68.10	to everyone in need.
PSA.68.11	You gave the command, 
PSA.68.11	and a chorus of women told
PSA.68.11	what had happened:
PSA.68.12	“Kings and their armies
PSA.68.12	retreated and ran,
PSA.68.12	and everything they left
PSA.68.12	is now being divided.
PSA.68.13	And for those who stayed back
PSA.68.13	to guard the sheep,
PSA.68.13	there are metal doves
PSA.68.13	with silver-coated wings
PSA.68.13	and shiny gold feathers.”
PSA.68.14	God All-Powerful, you scattered
PSA.68.14	the kings like snow falling
PSA.68.14	on Mount Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	Our 
PSA.68.15	Bashan is a mighty mountain
PSA.68.15	covered with peaks.
PSA.68.16	Why is it jealous of Zion,
PSA.68.16	the mountain you chose
PSA.68.16	as your home forever?
PSA.68.17	When you, 
PSA.68.17	to your people
PSA.68.17	you came with thousands
PSA.68.17	of mighty chariots.
PSA.68.18	the high mountain,
PSA.68.18	you took prisoners with you
PSA.68.18	and were given gifts.
PSA.68.18	Your enemies didn't want you
PSA.68.18	to live there,
PSA.68.18	but they gave you gifts.
PSA.68.19	We praise you, Lord God!
PSA.68.19	You treat us with kindness
PSA.68.19	day after day,
PSA.68.19	and you rescue us.
PSA.68.20	You always protect us
PSA.68.20	and save us from death.
PSA.68.21	Our Lord and our God,
PSA.68.21	your terrible enemies
PSA.68.21	are ready for war,
PSA.68.21	but you will crush
PSA.68.21	their skulls.
PSA.68.22	You promised to bring them
PSA.68.22	from Bashan
PSA.68.22	and from the deepest sea.
PSA.68.23	Then we could wash our feet
PSA.68.23	in their blood,
PSA.68.23	and our dogs could chew
PSA.68.23	on their bones.
PSA.68.24	We have seen crowds marching
PSA.68.24	to your place of worship,
PSA.68.24	our God and King.
PSA.68.25	Singers come first,
PSA.68.25	and then the musicians,
PSA.68.25	surrounded by young women
PSA.68.25	playing tambourines.
PSA.68.26	They come shouting,
PSA.68.26	“People of Israel,
PSA.68.26	praise the 
PSA.68.27	The small tribe of Benjamin
PSA.68.27	leads the way,
PSA.68.27	followed by the leaders
PSA.68.27	from Judah.
PSA.68.27	Then come the leaders
PSA.68.27	from Zebulun and Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Our God, show your strength!
PSA.68.28	Show us once again.
PSA.68.29	Then kings will bring gifts
PSA.68.29	to your temple
PSA.68.29	in Jerusalem.
PSA.68.30	Punish that animal
PSA.68.30	that lives in the swamp!
PSA.68.30	Punish that nation
PSA.68.30	whose leaders and people
PSA.68.30	are like wild bulls.
PSA.68.30	Make them come crawling
PSA.68.30	with gifts of silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter those nations
PSA.68.30	that enjoy making war.
PSA.68.31	Force the Egyptians to bring
PSA.68.31	gifts of bronze;
PSA.68.31	make the Ethiopians
PSA.68.31	to offer presents.
PSA.68.32	Now sing praises to God!
PSA.68.32	Every kingdom on earth,
PSA.68.32	sing to the Lord!
PSA.68.33	Praise the one who rides
PSA.68.33	across the ancient skies;
PSA.68.33	listen as he speaks
PSA.68.33	with a mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Tell about God's power!
PSA.68.34	He is honored in Israel,
PSA.68.34	and he rules the skies.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel is fearsome
PSA.68.35	in his temple,
PSA.68.35	and he makes us strong.
PSA.68.35	Let's praise our God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, God!
PSA.69.1	I am about to drown.
PSA.69.2	I am sinking deep in the mud,
PSA.69.2	and my feet are slipping.
PSA.69.2	I am about to be swept under
PSA.69.2	by a mighty flood.
PSA.69.3	I am worn out from crying,
PSA.69.3	and my throat is dry.
PSA.69.3	I have waited for you
PSA.69.3	till my eyes are blurred.
PSA.69.4	who hate me for no reason
PSA.69.4	than there are hairs
PSA.69.4	on my head.
PSA.69.4	Many terrible enemies
PSA.69.4	want to destroy me, God.
PSA.69.4	Am I supposed to give back
PSA.69.4	something I didn't steal?
PSA.69.5	You know my foolish sins.
PSA.69.5	Not one is hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	ruler of Israel,
PSA.69.6	don't let me embarrass anyone
PSA.69.6	who trusts and worships you.
PSA.69.7	It is for your sake alone
PSA.69.7	that I am insulted
PSA.69.7	and blush with shame.
PSA.69.8	I am like a stranger
PSA.69.8	to my relatives
PSA.69.8	and like a foreigner
PSA.69.8	to my own family.
PSA.69.9	burns in me like a fire,
PSA.69.9	and when others insult you,
PSA.69.9	they insulted me as well.
PSA.69.10	I cried and went without food,
PSA.69.10	but they still insulted me.
PSA.69.11	They sneered at me
PSA.69.11	for wearing sackcloth
PSA.69.11	to show my sorrow.
PSA.69.12	Rulers and judges gossip
PSA.69.12	about me,
PSA.69.12	and drunkards make up songs
PSA.69.12	to mock me.
PSA.69.13	But I pray to you, 
PSA.69.13	So when the time is right,
PSA.69.13	answer me and help me
PSA.69.13	with your wonderful love.
PSA.69.14	Don't let me sink in the mud,
PSA.69.14	but save me from my enemies
PSA.69.14	and from the deep water.
PSA.69.15	Don't let me be
PSA.69.15	swept away by a flood
PSA.69.15	or drowned in the ocean
PSA.69.15	or swallowed by death.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, 
PSA.69.16	You are kind and good.
PSA.69.16	Pay attention to me!
PSA.69.16	You are truly merciful.
PSA.69.17	Don't turn away from me.
PSA.69.17	I am your servant,
PSA.69.17	and I am in trouble.
PSA.69.17	Please hurry and help!
PSA.69.18	Come and save me
PSA.69.18	from my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know how I am insulted,
PSA.69.19	mocked, and disgraced;
PSA.69.19	you know every one
PSA.69.19	of my enemies.
PSA.69.20	I am crushed by insults,
PSA.69.20	and I feel sick.
PSA.69.20	I had hoped for mercy and pity,
PSA.69.20	but there was none.
PSA.69.21	and when I was thirsty,
PSA.69.21	they gave me vinegar.
PSA.69.22	for them and their friends.
PSA.69.23	Blind them with darkness
PSA.69.23	and make them tremble.
PSA.69.24	Show them how angry you are!
PSA.69.24	Be furious and catch them.
PSA.69.25	and don't let anyone live
PSA.69.25	in their tents.
PSA.69.26	They cause trouble for people
PSA.69.26	you have already punished;
PSA.69.26	their gossip hurts those
PSA.69.26	you have wounded.
PSA.69.27	Make them guiltier than ever
PSA.69.27	and don't forgive them.
PSA.69.28	of the living;
PSA.69.28	remove them from the list
PSA.69.28	of the innocent.
PSA.69.29	I am mistreated and in pain.
PSA.69.29	Protect me, God,
PSA.69.29	and keep me safe!
PSA.69.30	I will praise the 
PSA.69.30	with a song
PSA.69.30	and a thankful heart.
PSA.69.31	This will please the 
PSA.69.31	better than offering an ox
PSA.69.31	or a full-grown bull.
PSA.69.32	When those in need see this,
PSA.69.32	they will be happy,
PSA.69.32	and the 
PSA.69.32	will be encouraged.
PSA.69.33	The 
PSA.69.33	when the homeless cry out,
PSA.69.33	and he will never forget
PSA.69.33	his people in prison.
PSA.69.34	Heaven and earth
PSA.69.34	will praise our God,
PSA.69.34	and so will the oceans
PSA.69.34	and everything in them.
PSA.69.35	God will rescue Jerusalem,
PSA.69.35	and he will rebuild
PSA.69.35	the towns of Judah.
PSA.69.35	His people will live there
PSA.69.35	on their own land,
PSA.69.36	and when the time comes,
PSA.69.36	their children will inherit
PSA.69.36	the land.
PSA.69.36	Then everyone who loves God
PSA.69.36	will also settle there.
PSA.70.1	Save me, 
PSA.70.1	Hurry and help.
PSA.70.2	Disappoint and confuse
PSA.70.2	all who want to kill me.
PSA.70.2	Turn away and disgrace
PSA.70.2	all who want to hurt me.
PSA.70.3	Embarrass and shame those
PSA.70.3	who say, “We told you so!”
PSA.70.4	Let your worshipers celebrate
PSA.70.4	and be glad because of you.
PSA.70.4	They love your saving power,
PSA.70.4	so let them always say,
PSA.70.4	“God is wonderful!”
PSA.70.5	I am poor and needy,
PSA.70.5	but you, the 
PSA.70.5	care about me.
PSA.70.5	You are the one who saves me.
PSA.70.5	Please hurry and help!
PSA.71.1	I run to you, 
PSA.71.1	for protection.
PSA.71.1	Don't disappoint me.
PSA.71.2	You do what is right,
PSA.71.2	so come to my rescue.
PSA.71.2	Listen to my prayer
PSA.71.2	and keep me safe.
PSA.71.3	Be my mighty rock,
PSA.71.3	where I can always run
PSA.71.3	for protection.
PSA.71.3	Save me by your command!
PSA.71.3	You are my mighty rock
PSA.71.3	and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Come and save me, 
PSA.71.4	from vicious and cruel
PSA.71.4	and brutal enemies!
PSA.71.5	I depend on you,
PSA.71.5	and I have trusted you
PSA.71.5	since I was young.
PSA.71.6	I have relied on you
PSA.71.6	from the day I was born.
PSA.71.6	You brought me safely
PSA.71.6	through birth,
PSA.71.6	and I always praise you.
PSA.71.7	Many people think of me
PSA.71.7	as something evil.
PSA.71.7	But you are my mighty protector,
PSA.71.8	and I praise and honor you
PSA.71.8	all day long.
PSA.71.9	Don't throw me aside
PSA.71.9	when I am old;
PSA.71.9	don't desert me
PSA.71.9	when my strength is gone.
PSA.71.10	My enemies are plotting
PSA.71.10	because they want me dead.
PSA.71.11	They say, “Now we'll catch you!
PSA.71.11	God has deserted you,
PSA.71.11	and no one can save you.”
PSA.71.12	Come closer, God!
PSA.71.12	Please hurry and help.
PSA.71.13	Embarrass and destroy
PSA.71.13	all who want me dead;
PSA.71.13	disgrace and confuse
PSA.71.13	all who want to hurt me.
PSA.71.14	I will never give up hope
PSA.71.14	or stop praising you.
PSA.71.15	All day long I will tell
PSA.71.15	the wonderful things you do
PSA.71.15	to save your people.
PSA.71.15	But you have done much more
PSA.71.15	than I could possibly know.
PSA.71.16	I will praise you, 
PSA.71.16	for your mighty deeds
PSA.71.16	and your power to save.
PSA.71.17	You have taught me
PSA.71.17	since I was a child,
PSA.71.17	and I never stop telling about
PSA.71.17	your marvelous deeds.
PSA.71.18	Don't leave me when I am old
PSA.71.18	and my hair turns gray.
PSA.71.18	Let me tell future generations
PSA.71.18	about your mighty power.
PSA.71.19	Your deeds of kindness
PSA.71.19	are known in the heavens.
PSA.71.19	No one is like you!
PSA.71.20	You made me suffer a lot,
PSA.71.20	but you will bring me
PSA.71.20	back from this deep pit
PSA.71.20	and give me new life.
PSA.71.21	You will make me truly great
PSA.71.21	and take my sorrow away.
PSA.71.22	I will praise you, God,
PSA.71.22	the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.22	You are faithful.
PSA.71.22	I will play the harp
PSA.71.22	and sing your praises.
PSA.71.23	You have rescued me!
PSA.71.23	I will celebrate and shout,
PSA.71.23	singing praises to you
PSA.71.23	with all my heart.
PSA.71.24	All day long I will announce
PSA.71.24	your power to save.
PSA.71.24	I will tell how you disgraced
PSA.71.24	and disappointed those
PSA.71.24	who wanted to hurt me.
PSA.72.1	Please help the king
PSA.72.1	to be honest and fair
PSA.72.1	just like you, our God.
PSA.72.2	Let him be honest and fair
PSA.72.2	with all your people,
PSA.72.2	especially the poor.
PSA.72.3	Let peace and justice rule
PSA.72.3	every mountain and hill.
PSA.72.4	Let the king defend the poor,
PSA.72.4	rescue the homeless, and crush
PSA.72.4	everyone who hurts them.
PSA.72.5	Let the king live
PSA.72.5	like the sun and the moon.
PSA.72.6	Let him be as helpful as rain
PSA.72.6	that refreshes the meadows
PSA.72.6	and the ground.
PSA.72.7	Let the king be fair
PSA.72.7	with everyone,
PSA.72.7	and let there be peace
PSA.72.7	until the moon
PSA.72.7	falls from the sky.
PSA.72.8	from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	from the Euphrates River
PSA.72.8	across all the earth.
PSA.72.9	Force the desert tribes
PSA.72.9	to accept his rule,
PSA.72.9	and make his enemies
PSA.72.9	crawl in the dirt.
PSA.72.10	Force the rulers of Tarshish
PSA.72.10	and of the islands
PSA.72.10	to pay taxes to him.
PSA.72.10	Make the kings of Sheba
PSA.72.10	and of Seba
PSA.72.11	Make other rulers bow down
PSA.72.11	and all nations serve him.
PSA.72.12	Do this because the king
PSA.72.12	rescues the homeless
PSA.72.12	when they cry out,
PSA.72.12	and he helps everyone
PSA.72.12	who is poor and in need.
PSA.72.13	The king has pity
PSA.72.13	on the weak and the helpless
PSA.72.13	and protects those in need.
PSA.72.14	He cares when they hurt,
PSA.72.14	and he saves them from cruel
PSA.72.14	and violent deaths.
PSA.72.15	Long live the king!
PSA.72.15	Give him gold from Sheba.
PSA.72.15	Always pray for the king
PSA.72.15	and praise him each day.
PSA.72.16	Let cities overflow with food
PSA.72.16	and hills be covered with grain,
PSA.72.16	just like Mount Lebanon.
PSA.72.16	Let the people in the cities
PSA.72.16	prosper like wild flowers.
PSA.72.17	May the glory of the king
PSA.72.17	shine brightly forever
PSA.72.17	like the sun in the sky.
PSA.72.17	Let him make nations prosper
PSA.72.17	and learn to praise him.
PSA.72.18	we praise you.
PSA.72.18	Only you can work miracles.
PSA.72.19	We will always praise
PSA.72.19	your glorious name.
PSA.72.19	Let your glory be seen
PSA.72.19	everywhere on earth.
PSA.72.19	Amen and amen.
PSA.72.20	This ends the prayers
PSA.72.20	of David, the son of Jesse.
PSA.73.1	God is truly good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	especially to everyone
PSA.73.1	with a pure heart.
PSA.73.2	But I almost stumbled and fell,
PSA.73.3	because it made me jealous
PSA.73.3	to see proud and evil people
PSA.73.3	and to watch them prosper.
PSA.73.4	They never have to suffer,
PSA.73.4	they stay healthy,
PSA.73.5	and they don't have troubles
PSA.73.5	like everyone else.
PSA.73.6	Their pride is like a necklace,
PSA.73.6	and they commit sin more often
PSA.73.6	than they dress themselves.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes bulge with fat,
PSA.73.7	and their minds are flooded
PSA.73.7	with foolish thoughts.
PSA.73.8	They sneer and say cruel things,
PSA.73.8	and because of their pride,
PSA.73.8	they make violent threats.
PSA.73.9	They dare to speak against God
PSA.73.9	and to order others around.
PSA.73.10	God will bring his people back,
PSA.73.10	and they will drink the water
PSA.73.10	he so freely gives.
PSA.73.11	Only evil people would say,
PSA.73.11	“God Most High cannot
PSA.73.11	know everything!”
PSA.73.12	Yet all goes well for them,
PSA.73.12	and they live in peace.
PSA.73.13	What good did it do me
PSA.73.13	to keep my thoughts pure
PSA.73.13	and refuse to do wrong?
PSA.73.14	I am sick all day,
PSA.73.14	and I am punished
PSA.73.14	each morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said evil things,
PSA.73.15	I would not have been loyal
PSA.73.15	to your people.
PSA.73.16	It was hard for me
PSA.73.16	to understand all this!
PSA.73.17	Then I went to your temple,
PSA.73.17	and there I understood
PSA.73.17	what will happen
PSA.73.17	to my enemies.
PSA.73.18	You will make them stumble,
PSA.73.18	never to get up again.
PSA.73.19	They will be terrified,
PSA.73.19	suddenly swept away
PSA.73.19	and no longer there.
PSA.73.20	They will disappear, Lord,
PSA.73.20	despised like a bad dream
PSA.73.20	the morning after.
PSA.73.21	Once I was bitter
PSA.73.21	and brokenhearted.
PSA.73.22	I was stupid and ignorant,
PSA.73.22	and I treated you
PSA.73.22	as a wild animal would.
PSA.73.23	But I never really left you,
PSA.73.23	and you hold my right hand.
PSA.73.24	Your advice has been my guide,
PSA.73.24	and later you will welcome me
PSA.73.24	in glory.
PSA.73.25	In heaven I have only you,
PSA.73.25	and on this earth
PSA.73.25	you are all I want.
PSA.73.26	My body and mind may fail,
PSA.73.26	but you are my strength
PSA.73.26	and my choice forever.
PSA.73.27	All-Powerful 
PSA.73.27	those who stay far from you
PSA.73.27	will be lost,
PSA.73.27	and you will destroy those
PSA.73.27	who are unfaithful.
PSA.73.28	It is good for me
PSA.73.28	to be near you.
PSA.73.28	I choose you as my protector,
PSA.73.28	and I will tell about
PSA.73.28	your wonderful deeds.
PSA.74.1	Our God, why have you
PSA.74.1	completely rejected us?
PSA.74.1	Why are you so angry
PSA.74.1	with the ones you care for?
PSA.74.2	Remember the people
PSA.74.2	you rescued long ago,
PSA.74.2	the tribe you chose
PSA.74.2	for your very own.
PSA.74.2	Think of Mount Zion,
PSA.74.2	your home;
PSA.74.3	walk over to the temple
PSA.74.3	left in ruins forever
PSA.74.3	by those who hate us.
PSA.74.4	Your enemies roared like lions
PSA.74.4	in your holy temple,
PSA.74.4	and they have placed
PSA.74.4	their banners there.
PSA.74.5	It looks like a forest
PSA.74.5	chopped to pieces.
PSA.74.6	They used axes and hatchets
PSA.74.6	to smash the carvings.
PSA.74.7	They burned down your temple
PSA.74.7	and badly disgraced it.
PSA.74.8	They said to themselves,
PSA.74.8	“We'll crush them!”
PSA.74.8	Then they burned every one
PSA.74.8	of your meeting places
PSA.74.8	all over the country.
PSA.74.9	There are no more miracles
PSA.74.9	and no more prophets.
PSA.74.9	Who knows how long
PSA.74.9	it will be like this?
PSA.74.10	Our God, how much longer
PSA.74.10	will our enemies sneer?
PSA.74.10	Won't they ever stop
PSA.74.10	insulting you?
PSA.74.11	Why don't you punish them?
PSA.74.11	Why are you holding back?
PSA.74.12	Our God and King,
PSA.74.12	you have ruled
PSA.74.12	since ancient times;
PSA.74.12	you have won victories
PSA.74.12	everywhere on this earth.
PSA.74.13	through the sea,
PSA.74.13	and you smashed the heads
PSA.74.13	of sea monsters.
PSA.74.14	of the monster Leviathan,
PSA.74.14	then fed him to wild creatures
PSA.74.14	in the desert.
PSA.74.15	You opened the ground
PSA.74.15	for streams and springs
PSA.74.15	and dried up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	You rule the day and the night,
PSA.74.16	and you put the moon
PSA.74.16	and the sun in place.
PSA.74.17	You made summer and winter
PSA.74.17	and gave them to the earth.
PSA.74.18	Remember your enemies, 
PSA.74.18	They foolishly sneer
PSA.74.18	and won't respect you.
PSA.74.19	You treat us like pet doves,
PSA.74.19	but they mistreat us.
PSA.74.19	Don't keep forgetting us
PSA.74.19	and letting us be fed
PSA.74.19	to those wild animals.
PSA.74.20	Remember the agreement
PSA.74.20	you made with us.
PSA.74.20	Violent enemies are hiding
PSA.74.20	in every dark corner
PSA.74.20	of the earth.
PSA.74.21	Don't disappoint those in need
PSA.74.21	or make them turn from you,
PSA.74.21	but help the poor and homeless
PSA.74.21	to shout your praises.
PSA.74.22	Do something, God!
PSA.74.22	Defend yourself.
PSA.74.22	Remember how those fools
PSA.74.22	sneer at you all day long.
PSA.74.23	Don't forget the loud shouts
PSA.74.23	of your enemies.
PSA.75.1	Our God, we thank you
PSA.75.1	for being so near to us!
PSA.75.1	Everyone celebrates
PSA.75.1	your wonderful deeds.
PSA.75.2	You have set a time
PSA.75.2	to judge with fairness.
PSA.75.3	The earth trembles,
PSA.75.3	and its people shake;
PSA.75.3	you alone keep
PSA.75.3	its foundations firm.
PSA.75.4	You tell every bragger,
PSA.75.4	“Stop bragging!”
PSA.75.4	And to the wicked you say,
PSA.75.4	“Don't boast of your power!
PSA.75.5	Stop bragging! Quit telling me
PSA.75.5	how great you are.”
PSA.75.6	Our 
PSA.75.6	victory doesn't come
PSA.75.6	from the east or the west
PSA.75.6	or from the desert.
PSA.75.7	You are the one who judges.
PSA.75.7	You can take away power
PSA.75.7	and give it to others.
PSA.75.8	You hold in your hand
PSA.75.8	a cup filled with wine,
PSA.75.8	strong and foaming.
PSA.75.8	You will pour out some
PSA.75.8	for every sinful person
PSA.75.8	on this earth,
PSA.75.8	and they will have to drink
PSA.75.8	until it is gone.
PSA.75.9	But I will always tell about
PSA.75.9	you, the God of Jacob,
PSA.75.9	and I will sing your praise.
PSA.75.10	Our Lord, you will destroy
PSA.75.10	the power of evil people,
PSA.75.10	but you will give strength
PSA.75.10	to those who are good.
PSA.76.1	You, our God,
PSA.76.1	are famous in Judah
PSA.76.1	and honored in Israel.
PSA.76.2	Your home is on Mount Zion,
PSA.76.2	the city of peace.
PSA.76.3	There you destroyed
PSA.76.3	fiery arrows, shields, swords,
PSA.76.3	and all the other weapons.
PSA.76.4	You are more glorious than
PSA.76.4	the eternal mountains.
PSA.76.5	Brave warriors were robbed
PSA.76.5	of what they had taken,
PSA.76.5	and now they lie dead,
PSA.76.5	unable to lift an arm.
PSA.76.6	God of Jacob, when you roar,
PSA.76.6	enemy chariots and horses
PSA.76.6	drop dead in their tracks.
PSA.76.7	Our God, you are fearsome,
PSA.76.7	and no one can oppose you
PSA.76.7	when you are angry.
PSA.76.8	From heaven you announced
PSA.76.8	your decisions as judge!
PSA.76.8	And all who live on this earth
PSA.76.8	were terrified and silent
PSA.76.9	when you took over as judge,
PSA.76.9	ready to rescue
PSA.76.9	everyone in need.
PSA.76.10	Even the most angry people
PSA.76.10	will praise you
PSA.76.10	when you are furious.
PSA.76.11	Everyone, make your promises
PSA.76.11	to the 
PSA.76.11	and do what you promise.
PSA.76.11	The 
PSA.76.11	and all his servants
PSA.76.11	should bring him gifts.
PSA.76.12	God destroys the courage
PSA.76.12	of rulers and kings
PSA.76.12	and makes cowards of them.
PSA.77.1	I pray to you, Lord God,
PSA.77.1	and I beg you to listen.
PSA.77.2	In days filled with trouble,
PSA.77.2	I search for you.
PSA.77.2	And at night I tirelessly
PSA.77.2	lift my hands in prayer,
PSA.77.2	refusing comfort.
PSA.77.3	When I think of you,
PSA.77.3	I feel restless and weak.
PSA.77.4	Because of you, Lord God,
PSA.77.4	I can't sleep.
PSA.77.4	I am restless
PSA.77.4	and can't even talk.
PSA.77.5	I think of times gone by,
PSA.77.5	of those years long ago.
PSA.77.6	Each night my mind
PSA.77.6	is flooded with questions:
PSA.77.7	“Have you rejected me forever?
PSA.77.7	Won't you be kind again?
PSA.77.8	Is this the end of your love
PSA.77.8	and your promises?
PSA.77.9	Have you forgotten
PSA.77.9	how to have pity?
PSA.77.9	Do you refuse to show mercy
PSA.77.9	because of your anger?”
PSA.77.10	Then I said, “God Most High,
PSA.77.10	what hurts me most
PSA.77.10	is that you no longer help us
PSA.77.10	with your mighty arm.”
PSA.77.11	Our 
PSA.77.11	the things you have done,
PSA.77.11	your miracles of long ago.
PSA.77.12	I will think about each one
PSA.77.12	of your mighty deeds.
PSA.77.13	Everything you do is right,
PSA.77.13	and no other god
PSA.77.13	compares with you.
PSA.77.14	You alone work miracles,
PSA.77.14	and you have let nations
PSA.77.14	see your mighty power.
PSA.77.15	With your own arm you rescued
PSA.77.15	your people, the descendants
PSA.77.15	of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.16	The ocean looked at you, God,
PSA.77.16	and it trembled deep down
PSA.77.16	with fear.
PSA.77.17	Water flowed from the clouds.
PSA.77.17	Thunder was heard above
PSA.77.17	as your arrows of lightning
PSA.77.17	flashed about.
PSA.77.18	Your thunder roared
PSA.77.18	like chariot wheels.
PSA.77.18	The world was made bright
PSA.77.18	by lightning,
PSA.77.18	and all the earth trembled.
PSA.77.19	You walked through the water
PSA.77.19	of the mighty sea,
PSA.77.19	but your footprints
PSA.77.19	were never seen.
PSA.77.20	You guided your people
PSA.77.20	like a flock of sheep,
PSA.77.20	and you chose Moses and Aaron
PSA.77.20	to be their leaders.
PSA.78.1	My friends, I beg you
PSA.78.1	to listen as I teach.
PSA.78.2	and explain the mystery
PSA.78.2	of what happened long ago.
PSA.78.3	These are things we learned
PSA.78.3	from our ancestors,
PSA.78.4	and we will tell them
PSA.78.4	to the next generation.
PSA.78.4	We won't keep secret
PSA.78.4	the glorious deeds
PSA.78.4	and the mighty miracles
PSA.78.4	of the 
PSA.78.5	God gave his Law
PSA.78.5	to Jacob's descendants,
PSA.78.5	the people of Israel.
PSA.78.5	And he told our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach their children,
PSA.78.6	so that each new generation
PSA.78.6	would know his Law
PSA.78.6	and tell it to the next.
PSA.78.7	Then they would trust God
PSA.78.7	and obey his teachings,
PSA.78.7	without forgetting anything
PSA.78.7	God had done.
PSA.78.8	They would be different
PSA.78.8	from their ancestors,
PSA.78.8	who were stubborn, rebellious,
PSA.78.8	and unfaithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The warriors from Ephraim
PSA.78.9	were armed with arrows,
PSA.78.9	but they ran away
PSA.78.9	when the battle began.
PSA.78.10	They broke their agreement
PSA.78.10	with God,
PSA.78.10	and they turned their backs
PSA.78.10	on his teaching.
PSA.78.11	They forgot all he had done,
PSA.78.11	even the mighty miracles
PSA.78.12	near Zoan
PSA.78.13	and piled up the water
PSA.78.13	as he led them across.
PSA.78.14	with a cloud,
PSA.78.14	and each night he led them
PSA.78.14	with a flaming fire.
PSA.78.15	from rocks he split open
PSA.78.15	in the desert,
PSA.78.15	and his people drank freely,
PSA.78.15	as though from a lake.
PSA.78.16	He made streams gush out
PSA.78.16	like rivers from rocks.
PSA.78.17	But in the desert,
PSA.78.17	the people of God Most High
PSA.78.17	kept sinning and rebelling.
PSA.78.18	and demanded from him
PSA.78.18	what they wanted to eat.
PSA.78.19	They challenged God by saying,
PSA.78.19	“Can God provide food
PSA.78.19	out here in the desert?
PSA.78.20	It's true God struck the rock
PSA.78.20	and water gushed out
PSA.78.20	like a river,
PSA.78.20	but can he give his people
PSA.78.20	bread and meat?”
PSA.78.21	When the 
PSA.78.21	he was angry and furious
PSA.78.21	with Jacob's descendants,
PSA.78.21	the people of Israel.
PSA.78.22	They had refused to trust him,
PSA.78.22	and they had doubted
PSA.78.22	his saving power.
PSA.78.23	But God gave a command
PSA.78.23	to the clouds,
PSA.78.23	and he opened the doors
PSA.78.23	in the skies.
PSA.78.24	that they called manna.
PSA.78.25	He gave them more than enough,
PSA.78.25	and each one of them ate
PSA.78.25	this special food.
PSA.78.26	God's mighty power
PSA.78.26	sent a strong wind
PSA.78.26	from the southeast,
PSA.78.27	and it brought birds
PSA.78.27	that covered the ground,
PSA.78.27	like sand on the beach.
PSA.78.28	Then God made the birds fall
PSA.78.28	in the camp of his people
PSA.78.28	near their tents.
PSA.78.29	God gave his people
PSA.78.29	all they wanted,
PSA.78.29	and each of them ate
PSA.78.29	until they were full.
PSA.78.30	But before they had swallowed
PSA.78.30	the last bite,
PSA.78.31	God became angry and killed
PSA.78.31	the strongest and best
PSA.78.31	from the families of Israel.
PSA.78.32	But the rest kept on sinning
PSA.78.32	and would not trust
PSA.78.32	God's miracles.
PSA.78.33	So he cut their lives short
PSA.78.33	and made them terrified.
PSA.78.34	After he killed some of them,
PSA.78.34	the others turned to him
PSA.78.34	with all their hearts.
PSA.78.35	They remembered God Most High,
PSA.78.35	the mighty rock
PSA.78.35	that kept them safe.
PSA.78.36	But they tried to flatter God,
PSA.78.36	and they told him lies;
PSA.78.37	and broke their promises.
PSA.78.38	Yet God was kind.
PSA.78.38	He kept forgiving their sins
PSA.78.38	and didn't destroy them.
PSA.78.38	He often became angry,
PSA.78.38	but never lost his temper.
PSA.78.39	God remembered that they
PSA.78.39	were made of flesh
PSA.78.39	and were like a wind
PSA.78.39	that blows once
PSA.78.39	and then dies down.
PSA.78.40	While they were in the desert,
PSA.78.40	they often rebelled
PSA.78.40	and made God sad.
PSA.78.41	They kept testing him
PSA.78.41	and caused terrible pain
PSA.78.41	for the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They forgot about his power
PSA.78.42	and how he had rescued them
PSA.78.42	from their enemies.
PSA.78.43	God showed them all kinds
PSA.78.43	of wonderful miracles
PSA.78.43	near Zoan
PSA.78.44	into blood,
PSA.78.44	and no one could drink
PSA.78.44	from the streams.
PSA.78.45	to pester the Egyptians,
PSA.78.45	and he sent frogs
PSA.78.45	to cause them trouble.
PSA.78.46	eat their crops.
PSA.78.47	and their fig trees
PSA.78.47	with hail and floods.
PSA.78.48	Then he killed their cattle
PSA.78.48	with hail
PSA.78.48	and their other animals
PSA.78.48	with lightning.
PSA.78.49	God was so angry and furious
PSA.78.49	that he went into a rage
PSA.78.49	and caused them great trouble
PSA.78.49	by sending swarms
PSA.78.49	of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	God released his anger
PSA.78.50	and slaughtered them
PSA.78.50	in a terrible way.
PSA.78.51	of each Egyptian family.
PSA.78.52	out of Egypt
PSA.78.52	and guided them in the desert
PSA.78.52	like a flock of sheep.
PSA.78.53	and they were not afraid,
PSA.78.53	but their enemies drowned
PSA.78.53	in the sea.
PSA.78.54	to the sacred mountain
PSA.78.54	that he had taken
PSA.78.54	by his own power.
PSA.78.55	from the tribes of Israel,
PSA.78.55	and he let the tribes
PSA.78.55	take over their land.
PSA.78.56	God Most High,
PSA.78.56	and they refused
PSA.78.56	to obey his laws.
PSA.78.57	They were as unfaithful
PSA.78.57	as their ancestors,
PSA.78.57	and they were as crooked
PSA.78.57	as a twisted arrow.
PSA.78.58	God demanded all their love,
PSA.78.58	but they made him angry
PSA.78.58	by worshiping idols.
PSA.78.59	So God became furious
PSA.78.59	and completely rejected
PSA.78.59	the people of Israel.
PSA.78.60	at Shiloh, where he lived
PSA.78.60	here on earth.
PSA.78.61	the sacred chest
PSA.78.61	and let them dishonor him.
PSA.78.62	God took out his anger
PSA.78.62	on his chosen ones
PSA.78.62	and let them be killed
PSA.78.62	by enemy swords.
PSA.78.63	Fire destroyed the young men,
PSA.78.63	and the young women were left
PSA.78.63	with no one to marry.
PSA.78.64	Priests died violent deaths,
PSA.78.64	but their widows
PSA.78.64	were not allowed to mourn.
PSA.78.65	Finally the Lord woke up,
PSA.78.65	like a soldier
PSA.78.65	startled from a drunken sleep.
PSA.78.66	God scattered his enemies
PSA.78.66	and made them ashamed
PSA.78.66	forever.
PSA.78.67	Then the Lord decided
PSA.78.67	not to make his home
PSA.78.67	with Joseph's descendants
PSA.78.67	in Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	Instead he chose the tribe
PSA.78.68	of Judah,
PSA.78.68	and he chose Mount Zion,
PSA.78.68	the place he loves.
PSA.78.69	There he built his temple
PSA.78.69	as lofty as the mountains
PSA.78.69	and as solid as the earth
PSA.78.69	he made to last forever.
PSA.78.70	to be his servant and took him
PSA.78.70	from tending sheep
PSA.78.71	and from caring for lambs.
PSA.78.71	Then God made him the leader
PSA.78.71	of Israel, his own nation.
PSA.78.72	David treated the people fairly
PSA.78.72	and guided them with wisdom.
PSA.79.1	have taken your land,
PSA.79.1	disgraced your temple,
PSA.79.1	and left Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have fed the bodies
PSA.79.2	of your servants
PSA.79.2	to flesh-eating birds;
PSA.79.2	your loyal people are food
PSA.79.2	for savage animals.
PSA.79.3	All Jerusalem is covered
PSA.79.3	with their blood,
PSA.79.3	and there is no one left
PSA.79.3	to bury them.
PSA.79.4	Every nation around us
PSA.79.4	sneers and makes fun.
PSA.79.5	Our 
PSA.79.5	being angry?
PSA.79.5	Will your angry feelings
PSA.79.5	keep flaming up like fire?
PSA.79.6	Get angry with those nations
PSA.79.6	that don't know you
PSA.79.6	and won't worship you!
PSA.79.7	They have gobbled up
PSA.79.7	Jacob's descendants
PSA.79.7	and left the land in ruins.
PSA.79.8	of our ancestors.
PSA.79.8	Have pity and come quickly!
PSA.79.8	We are completely helpless.
PSA.79.9	Our God, you keep us safe.
PSA.79.9	Now help us! Rescue us.
PSA.79.9	Forgive our sins
PSA.79.9	and bring honor to yourself.
PSA.79.10	Why should nations ask us,
PSA.79.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.79.10	Let us and the other nations
PSA.79.10	see you take revenge
PSA.79.10	for your servants who died
PSA.79.10	a violent death.
PSA.79.11	Listen to the prisoners groan!
PSA.79.11	Let your mighty power save all
PSA.79.11	who are sentenced to die.
PSA.79.12	Each of those nations sneered
PSA.79.12	at you, our Lord.
PSA.79.12	Now let others sneer at them,
PSA.79.12	seven times as much.
PSA.79.13	Then we, your people,
PSA.79.13	will always thank you.
PSA.79.13	We are like sheep
PSA.79.13	with you as our shepherd,
PSA.79.13	and all generations
PSA.79.13	will hear us praise you.
PSA.80.1	the descendants of Joseph,
PSA.80.1	and you sit on your throne
PSA.80.1	above the winged creatures.
PSA.80.1	Listen to our prayer
PSA.80.1	and let your light shine
PSA.80.2	for the tribes of Ephraim,
PSA.80.2	Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Save us by your power.
PSA.80.3	Our God, make us strong again!
PSA.80.3	Smile on us and save us.
PSA.80.4	how much longer
PSA.80.4	will the prayers of your people
PSA.80.4	make you angry?
PSA.80.5	You gave us tears for food,
PSA.80.5	and you made us drink them
PSA.80.5	by the bowlful.
PSA.80.6	Because of you,
PSA.80.6	our enemies who live nearby
PSA.80.6	laugh and joke about us.
PSA.80.7	Our God, make us strong again!
PSA.80.7	Smile on us and save us.
PSA.80.8	We were like a grapevine
PSA.80.8	you brought out of Egypt.
PSA.80.8	You chased other nations away
PSA.80.8	and planted us here.
PSA.80.9	Then you cleared the ground,
PSA.80.9	and we put our roots deep,
PSA.80.9	spreading over the land.
PSA.80.10	Shade from this vine covered
PSA.80.10	the mountains.
PSA.80.10	Its branches climbed
PSA.80.10	the mighty cedars
PSA.80.11	and stretched to the sea;
PSA.80.11	its new growth reached
PSA.80.11	to the river.
PSA.80.12	Our Lord, why have you
PSA.80.12	torn down the wall
PSA.80.12	from around the vineyard?
PSA.80.12	You let everyone who walks by
PSA.80.12	pick the grapes.
PSA.80.13	Now the vine is gobbled up
PSA.80.13	by pigs from the forest
PSA.80.13	and other wild animals.
PSA.80.14	God All-Powerful,
PSA.80.14	please do something!
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven
PSA.80.14	and see what's happening
PSA.80.14	to this vine.
PSA.80.15	With your own hands
PSA.80.15	you planted its roots,
PSA.80.15	and you raised it
PSA.80.15	as your very own.
PSA.80.16	Enemies chopped the vine down
PSA.80.16	and set it on fire.
PSA.80.16	Now show your anger
PSA.80.16	and destroy them.
PSA.80.17	But help the one who sits
PSA.80.17	at your right side,
PSA.80.17	the one you raised
PSA.80.17	to be your very own.
PSA.80.18	Then we will never turn away.
PSA.80.18	Put new life into us,
PSA.80.18	and we will worship you.
PSA.80.19	make us strong again!
PSA.80.19	Smile on us and save us.
PSA.81.1	Be happy and shout to God
PSA.81.1	who makes us strong!
PSA.81.1	Shout praises to the God
PSA.81.1	of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Sing as you play tambourines
PSA.81.2	and the lovely sounding
PSA.81.2	stringed instruments.
PSA.81.3	the New Moon Festival.
PSA.81.3	We must also celebrate
PSA.81.3	when the moon is full.
PSA.81.4	This is the law in Israel,
PSA.81.4	and it was given to us
PSA.81.4	by the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	The descendants of Joseph
PSA.81.5	were told to obey it,
PSA.81.5	when God led them out
PSA.81.5	from the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	In a voice unknown to me,
PSA.81.5	I heard someone say:
PSA.81.6	“I lifted the burden
PSA.81.6	from your shoulder
PSA.81.6	and took the heavy basket
PSA.81.6	from your hands.
PSA.81.7	I rescued you,
PSA.81.7	and from the thunderclouds,
PSA.81.7	I answered your prayers.
PSA.81.7	Later I tested you
PSA.81.7	at Meribah Spring.
PSA.81.8	“Listen, my people,
PSA.81.8	while I, the Lord,
PSA.81.8	correct you!
PSA.81.8	Israel, if you would only
PSA.81.8	pay attention to me!
PSA.81.9	or bow down to gods
PSA.81.9	you know nothing about.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	I rescued you from Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Just ask, and I will give you
PSA.81.10	whatever you need.
PSA.81.11	“But, my people, Israel,
PSA.81.11	you refused to listen,
PSA.81.11	and you would have nothing
PSA.81.11	to do with me!
PSA.81.12	So I let you be stubborn
PSA.81.12	and keep on following
PSA.81.12	your own advice.
PSA.81.13	“My people, Israel,
PSA.81.13	if only you would listen
PSA.81.13	and do as I say!
PSA.81.14	I, the 
PSA.81.14	defeat your enemies
PSA.81.14	with my mighty power.
PSA.81.15	Everyone who hates me
PSA.81.15	would come crawling,
PSA.81.15	and that would be the end
PSA.81.15	of them.
PSA.81.16	But I would feed you
PSA.81.16	with the finest bread
PSA.81.16	and with the best honey
PSA.81.16	until you were full.”
PSA.82.1	When all the other gods
PSA.82.1	have come together,
PSA.82.1	the Lord God judges them
PSA.82.1	and says:
PSA.82.2	“How long will you
PSA.82.2	keep judging unfairly
PSA.82.2	and favoring evil people?
PSA.82.3	Be fair to the poor
PSA.82.3	and to orphans.
PSA.82.3	Defend the helpless
PSA.82.3	and everyone in need.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and homeless
PSA.82.4	from the powerful hands
PSA.82.4	of heartless people.
PSA.82.5	“None of you know
PSA.82.5	or understand a thing.
PSA.82.5	You live in darkness,
PSA.82.5	while the foundations
PSA.82.5	of the earth tremble.
PSA.82.6	that all of you are gods
PSA.82.6	and also my own children.
PSA.82.7	But you will die,
PSA.82.7	just like everyone else,
PSA.82.7	including powerful rulers.”
PSA.82.8	Do something, God!
PSA.82.8	Judge the nations of the earth;
PSA.82.8	they belong to you.
PSA.83.1	Our God, don't just sit there,
PSA.83.1	silently doing nothing!
PSA.83.2	Your hateful enemies
PSA.83.2	are turning against you
PSA.83.2	and rebelling.
PSA.83.3	They are sly, and they plot
PSA.83.3	against those you treasure.
PSA.83.4	They say, “Let's wipe out
PSA.83.4	the nation of Israel
PSA.83.4	and make sure that no one
PSA.83.4	remembers its name!”
PSA.83.5	All of them fully agree
PSA.83.5	in their plans against you,
PSA.83.5	and among them are
PSA.83.6	Edom and the Ishmaelites;
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;
PSA.83.7	Philistia and Phoenicia.
PSA.83.8	Even Assyria has joined forces
PSA.83.8	with Moab and Ammon.
PSA.83.9	as you punished Midian.
PSA.83.9	Destroy them, as you destroyed
PSA.83.9	Sisera and Jabin
PSA.83.9	at Kishon Creek 
PSA.83.10	near Endor,
PSA.83.10	and let their bodies rot.
PSA.83.11	Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	Zebah and Zalmunna.
PSA.83.12	All of them said, “We'll take
PSA.83.12	God's valuable land!”
PSA.83.13	Our God, scatter them around
PSA.83.13	like dust in a whirlwind.
PSA.83.14	Just as flames destroy forests
PSA.83.14	on the mountains,
PSA.83.15	pursue and terrify them
PSA.83.15	with storms of your own.
PSA.83.16	Make them blush with shame,
PSA.83.16	until they turn and worship
PSA.83.16	you, our 
PSA.83.17	Let them be forever ashamed
PSA.83.17	and confused.
PSA.83.17	Let them die in disgrace.
PSA.83.18	Make them realize that you
PSA.83.18	are the 
PSA.83.18	the only ruler of earth!
PSA.84.1	your temple is so lovely!
PSA.84.2	Deep in my heart I long
PSA.84.2	for your temple,
PSA.84.2	and with all that I am
PSA.84.2	I sing joyful songs to you.
PSA.84.3	my King and my God,
PSA.84.3	sparrows find a home
PSA.84.3	near your altars;
PSA.84.3	swallows build nests there
PSA.84.3	to raise their young.
PSA.84.4	You bless everyone
PSA.84.4	who lives in your house,
PSA.84.4	and they sing your praises.
PSA.84.5	You bless all who depend
PSA.84.5	on you for their strength
PSA.84.5	and all who deeply desire
PSA.84.5	to visit your temple.
PSA.84.6	When they reach Dry Valley,
PSA.84.6	springs start flowing,
PSA.84.6	and the autumn rain fills it
PSA.84.6	with pools of water.
PSA.84.7	Your people grow stronger,
PSA.84.7	and you, the God of gods,
PSA.84.7	will be seen in Zion.
PSA.84.8	the God of Jacob,
PSA.84.8	please answer my prayer!
PSA.84.9	You are the shield
PSA.84.9	that protects your people,
PSA.84.9	and I am your chosen one.
PSA.84.9	Won't you smile on me?
PSA.84.10	One day in your temple
PSA.84.10	is better than a thousand
PSA.84.10	anywhere else.
PSA.84.10	I would rather serve
PSA.84.10	in your house,
PSA.84.10	than live in the homes
PSA.84.10	of the wicked.
PSA.84.11	Our 
PSA.84.11	you are like the sun
PSA.84.11	and also like a shield.
PSA.84.11	You treat us with kindness
PSA.84.11	and with honor,
PSA.84.11	never denying any good thing
PSA.84.11	to those who live right.
PSA.84.12	you bless everyone
PSA.84.12	who trusts you.
PSA.85.1	Our 
PSA.85.1	your land
PSA.85.1	and made all go well
PSA.85.1	for Jacob's descendants.
PSA.85.2	You have forgiven the sin
PSA.85.2	and taken away the guilt
PSA.85.2	of your people.
PSA.85.3	Your fierce anger is no longer
PSA.85.3	aimed at us.
PSA.85.4	Our 
PSA.85.4	you save us!
PSA.85.4	Please bring us back home
PSA.85.4	and don't be angry.
PSA.85.5	Will you always be angry
PSA.85.5	with us and our families?
PSA.85.6	Won't you give us fresh life
PSA.85.6	and let your people be glad
PSA.85.6	because of you?
PSA.85.7	Show us your love
PSA.85.7	and save us!
PSA.85.8	I will listen to you, 
PSA.85.8	because you promise peace
PSA.85.8	to those who are faithful
PSA.85.8	and no longer foolish.
PSA.85.9	You are ready to rescue
PSA.85.9	everyone who worships you,
PSA.85.9	so that you will live with us
PSA.85.9	in all your glory.
PSA.85.10	Love and loyalty
PSA.85.10	will come together;
PSA.85.10	goodness and peace
PSA.85.10	will unite.
PSA.85.11	Loyalty will sprout
PSA.85.11	from the ground;
PSA.85.11	justice will look down
PSA.85.11	from the sky above.
PSA.85.12	Our 
PSA.85.12	our land will produce
PSA.85.12	wonderful crops.
PSA.85.13	Justice will march in front,
PSA.85.13	making a path
PSA.85.13	for you to follow.
PSA.86.1	Please listen, 
PSA.86.1	and answer my prayer!
PSA.86.1	I am poor and helpless.
PSA.86.2	Protect me and save me
PSA.86.2	because you are my God.
PSA.86.2	I am your faithful servant,
PSA.86.2	and I trust you.
PSA.86.3	Be kind to me!
PSA.86.3	I pray to you all day.
PSA.86.4	Make my heart glad!
PSA.86.4	I serve you,
PSA.86.4	and my prayer is sincere.
PSA.86.5	You willingly forgive,
PSA.86.5	and your love is always there
PSA.86.5	for those who pray to you.
PSA.86.6	Please listen, 
PSA.86.6	Answer my prayer for help.
PSA.86.7	When I am in trouble, I pray,
PSA.86.7	knowing you will listen.
PSA.86.8	No other gods are like you;
PSA.86.8	only you work miracles.
PSA.86.9	and they will all bow down
PSA.86.9	to worship and honor you.
PSA.86.10	You perform great wonders
PSA.86.10	because you alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me to follow you,
PSA.86.11	and I will obey your truth.
PSA.86.11	Always keep me faithful.
PSA.86.12	With all my heart I thank you.
PSA.86.12	I praise you, 
PSA.86.13	Your love for me is so great
PSA.86.13	that you protected me
PSA.86.13	from death and the grave.
PSA.86.14	Proud and violent enemies,
PSA.86.14	who don't care about you,
PSA.86.14	have ganged up to attack
PSA.86.14	and kill me.
PSA.86.15	But you, the Lord God,
PSA.86.15	are kind and merciful.
PSA.86.15	You don't easily get angry,
PSA.86.15	and your love
PSA.86.15	can always be trusted.
PSA.86.16	I serve you, 
PSA.86.16	and I am the child
PSA.86.16	of one of your servants.
PSA.86.16	Look on me with kindness.
PSA.86.16	Make me strong and save me.
PSA.86.17	Show that you approve of me!
PSA.86.17	Then my hateful enemies
PSA.86.17	will feel like fools,
PSA.86.17	because you have helped
PSA.86.17	and comforted me.
PSA.87.1	Zion was built by the 
PSA.87.1	on the holy mountain,
PSA.87.2	and he loves that city
PSA.87.2	more than any other place
PSA.87.2	in all of Israel.
PSA.87.3	Zion, you are the city of God,
PSA.87.3	and wonderful things
PSA.87.3	are told about you.
PSA.87.4	Egypt,
PSA.87.4	Phoenicia,
PSA.87.4	are some of those nations
PSA.87.4	that know you,
PSA.87.4	and their people all say,
PSA.87.4	“I was born in Zion.”
PSA.87.5	God Most High will strengthen
PSA.87.5	the city of Zion.
PSA.87.5	Then everyone will say,
PSA.87.5	“We were born here too.”
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	of his people,
PSA.87.6	and all who were born here
PSA.87.6	will be included.
PSA.87.7	All who sing or dance will say,
PSA.87.7	“I too am from Zion.”
PSA.88.1	You keep me safe, 
PSA.88.1	So when I pray at night,
PSA.88.2	please listen carefully
PSA.88.2	to each of my concerns.
PSA.88.3	I am deeply troubled
PSA.88.3	and close to death;
PSA.88.4	I am as good as dead
PSA.88.4	and completely helpless.
PSA.88.5	I am no better off
PSA.88.5	than those in the grave,
PSA.88.5	those you have forgotten
PSA.88.5	and no longer help.
PSA.88.6	You have put me in the deepest
PSA.88.6	and darkest grave;
PSA.88.7	your anger rolls over me
PSA.88.7	like ocean waves.
PSA.88.8	You have made my friends turn
PSA.88.8	in horror from me.
PSA.88.8	I am a prisoner
PSA.88.8	who cannot escape,
PSA.88.9	and I am almost blind
PSA.88.9	because of my sorrow.
PSA.88.9	Each day I lift my hands
PSA.88.9	in prayer to you, 
PSA.88.10	Do you work miracles
PSA.88.10	for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do they stand up
PSA.88.10	and praise you?
PSA.88.11	Are your love and loyalty
PSA.88.11	announced in the world
PSA.88.11	of the dead?
PSA.88.12	Do they know of your miracles
PSA.88.12	or your saving power
PSA.88.12	in the dark world below
PSA.88.12	where all is forgotten?
PSA.88.13	Each morning I pray
PSA.88.13	to you, 
PSA.88.14	Why do you reject me?
PSA.88.14	Why do you turn from me?
PSA.88.15	Ever since I was a child,
PSA.88.15	I have been sick
PSA.88.15	and close to death.
PSA.88.15	You have terrified me
PSA.88.15	and made me helpless.
PSA.88.16	Your anger is like a flood!
PSA.88.16	And I am shattered
PSA.88.16	by your furious attacks
PSA.88.17	that strike each day
PSA.88.17	and from every side.
PSA.88.18	My friends and neighbors
PSA.88.18	have turned against me
PSA.88.18	because of you,
PSA.88.18	and now darkness
PSA.88.18	is my only companion.
PSA.89.1	of your love forever.
PSA.89.1	Everyone yet to be born
PSA.89.1	will hear me praise
PSA.89.1	your faithfulness.
PSA.89.2	I will tell them, “God's love
PSA.89.2	can always be trusted,
PSA.89.2	and his faithfulness lasts
PSA.89.2	as long as the heavens.”
PSA.89.3	You said, “David, my servant,
PSA.89.3	is my chosen one,
PSA.89.3	and this is the agreement
PSA.89.3	I made with him:
PSA.89.4	will always be king.”
PSA.89.5	Our 
PSA.89.5	now praise your miracles,
PSA.89.5	and let all your angels
PSA.89.5	praise your faithfulness.
PSA.89.6	None who live in the heavens
PSA.89.6	can compare with you.
PSA.89.7	You are the most fearsome
PSA.89.7	of all who live in heaven;
PSA.89.7	all the others fear
PSA.89.7	and greatly honor you.
PSA.89.8	You are 
PSA.89.8	No one is as loving
PSA.89.8	and faithful as you are.
PSA.89.9	You rule the roaring sea
PSA.89.9	and calm its waves.
PSA.89.10	You crushed the monster Rahab,
PSA.89.10	and with your powerful arm
PSA.89.10	you scattered your enemies.
PSA.89.11	The heavens and the earth
PSA.89.11	belong to you.
PSA.89.11	And so does the world
PSA.89.11	with all its people
PSA.89.11	because you created them
PSA.89.12	and everything else.
PSA.89.12	Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon
PSA.89.12	gladly praise you.
PSA.89.13	You are strong and mighty!
PSA.89.14	Your kingdom is ruled
PSA.89.14	by justice and fairness
PSA.89.14	with love and faithfulness
PSA.89.14	leading the way.
PSA.89.15	Our 
PSA.89.15	who join in the festival
PSA.89.15	and walk in the brightness
PSA.89.15	of your presence.
PSA.89.16	We are happy all day
PSA.89.16	because of you,
PSA.89.16	and your saving power
PSA.89.16	brings honor to us.
PSA.89.17	Your own glorious power
PSA.89.17	makes us strong,
PSA.89.17	and because of your kindness,
PSA.89.17	our strength increases.
PSA.89.18	Our 
PSA.89.18	the Holy One of Israel,
PSA.89.18	you are truly our shield.
PSA.89.19	In a vision, you once said
PSA.89.19	to your faithful followers:
PSA.89.19	“I have helped a mighty hero.
PSA.89.19	I chose him from my people
PSA.89.19	and made him famous.
PSA.89.20	I chose to be king,
PSA.89.21	and I will always be there
PSA.89.21	to help and strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	“No enemy will outsmart David,
PSA.89.22	and he won't be defeated
PSA.89.22	by any hateful people.
PSA.89.23	I will strike down and crush
PSA.89.23	his troublesome enemies.
PSA.89.24	He will always be able
PSA.89.24	to depend on my love,
PSA.89.24	and I will make him strong
PSA.89.24	with my own power.
PSA.89.25	I will let him rule the lands
PSA.89.25	across the rivers and seas.
PSA.89.26	He will say to me,
PSA.89.26	‘You are my Father
PSA.89.26	and my God,
PSA.89.26	as well as the mighty rock
PSA.89.26	where I am safe.’
PSA.89.27	as my first-born son,
PSA.89.27	and he will be the ruler
PSA.89.27	of all kings on earth.
PSA.89.28	My love for him will last,
PSA.89.28	and my agreement with him
PSA.89.28	will never be broken.
PSA.89.29	“One of David's descendants
PSA.89.29	will always be king,
PSA.89.29	and his family will rule
PSA.89.29	until the sky disappears.
PSA.89.30	Suppose some of his children
PSA.89.30	should reject my Law
PSA.89.30	and refuse my instructions.
PSA.89.31	Or suppose they should disobey
PSA.89.31	all of my teachings.
PSA.89.32	Then I will correct
PSA.89.32	and punish them
PSA.89.32	because of their sins.
PSA.89.33	But I will always love David
PSA.89.33	and faithfully keep all
PSA.89.33	of my promises to him.
PSA.89.34	“I won't break my agreement
PSA.89.34	or go back on my word.
PSA.89.35	I have sworn once and for all
PSA.89.35	by my own holy name,
PSA.89.35	and I won't lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His family will always rule.
PSA.89.36	I will let his kingdom last
PSA.89.36	as long as the sun 
PSA.89.37	and moon
PSA.89.37	appear in the sky.”
PSA.89.38	You are now angry, 
PSA.89.38	and you have turned your back
PSA.89.38	on your chosen king.
PSA.89.39	You broke off your agreement
PSA.89.39	with your servant, the king,
PSA.89.39	and you completely destroyed
PSA.89.39	his kingdom.
PSA.89.40	The walls of his city
PSA.89.40	have been broken through,
PSA.89.40	and every fortress
PSA.89.40	now lies in ruins.
PSA.89.41	All who pass by
PSA.89.41	take what they want,
PSA.89.41	and nations everywhere
PSA.89.41	joke about the king.
PSA.89.42	You made his enemies powerful
PSA.89.42	and let them celebrate.
PSA.89.43	But you forced him to retreat
PSA.89.43	because you did not fight
PSA.89.43	on his side.
PSA.89.44	You took his crown
PSA.89.44	and threw his throne
PSA.89.44	in the dirt.
PSA.89.45	You made an old man of him
PSA.89.45	and put him to shame.
PSA.89.46	How much longer, 
PSA.89.46	Will you hide forever?
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger
PSA.89.46	keep burning like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember, life is short!
PSA.89.47	Why did you empty our lives
PSA.89.47	of all meaning?
PSA.89.48	No one can escape the power
PSA.89.48	of death and the grave.
PSA.89.49	Our Lord, where is the love
PSA.89.49	you have always shown
PSA.89.49	and that you promised
PSA.89.49	so faithfully to David?
PSA.89.50	Remember your servant, Lord!
PSA.89.50	People make jokes about me,
PSA.89.50	and I suffer many insults.
PSA.89.51	I am your chosen one,
PSA.89.51	but your enemies chase
PSA.89.51	and make fun of me.
PSA.89.52	Our 
PSA.89.52	forever. Amen and amen.
PSA.90.1	Our Lord, in all generations
PSA.90.1	you have been our home.
PSA.90.2	You have always been God—
PSA.90.2	long before the birth
PSA.90.2	of the mountains,
PSA.90.2	even before you created
PSA.90.2	the earth and the world.
PSA.90.3	At your command we die
PSA.90.3	and turn back to dust,
PSA.90.4	mean nothing to you!
PSA.90.4	They are merely a day gone by
PSA.90.4	or a few hours in the night.
PSA.90.5	You bring our lives to an end
PSA.90.5	just like a dream.
PSA.90.5	We are merely tender grass
PSA.90.6	that sprouts and grows
PSA.90.6	in the morning,
PSA.90.6	but dries up by evening.
PSA.90.7	Your furious anger frightens
PSA.90.7	and destroys us,
PSA.90.8	and you know all our sins,
PSA.90.8	even those we do in secret.
PSA.90.9	Your anger is a burden
PSA.90.9	each day we live,
PSA.90.9	then life ends like a sigh.
PSA.90.10	or maybe eighty,
PSA.90.10	if we are healthy,
PSA.90.10	but even our best years
PSA.90.10	bring trouble and sorrow.
PSA.90.10	Suddenly our time is up,
PSA.90.10	and we disappear.
PSA.90.11	No one knows the full power
PSA.90.11	of your furious anger,
PSA.90.11	but it is as great as the fear
PSA.90.11	that we owe to you.
PSA.90.12	Teach us to use wisely
PSA.90.12	all the time we have.
PSA.90.13	Help us, 
PSA.90.13	Pity your servants.
PSA.90.14	When morning comes,
PSA.90.14	let your love satisfy
PSA.90.14	all our needs.
PSA.90.14	Then we can celebrate
PSA.90.14	and be glad for what time
PSA.90.14	we have left.
PSA.90.15	Make us happy for as long
PSA.90.15	as you caused us trouble
PSA.90.15	and sorrow.
PSA.90.16	Do wonderful things for us,
PSA.90.16	your servants,
PSA.90.16	and show your mighty power
PSA.90.16	to our children.
PSA.90.17	Our Lord and our God,
PSA.90.17	treat us with kindness
PSA.90.17	and let all go well for us.
PSA.90.17	Please let all go well!
PSA.91.1	Live under the protection
PSA.91.1	of God Most High
PSA.91.1	and stay in the shadow
PSA.91.1	of God All-Powerful.
PSA.91.2	Then you will say to the 
PSA.91.2	“You are my fortress,
PSA.91.2	my place of safety;
PSA.91.2	you are my God,
PSA.91.2	and I trust you.”
PSA.91.3	The Lord will keep you safe
PSA.91.3	from secret traps
PSA.91.3	and deadly diseases.
PSA.91.4	He will spread his wings
PSA.91.4	over you
PSA.91.4	and keep you secure.
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness is like
PSA.91.4	a shield or a city wall.
PSA.91.5	You won't need to worry
PSA.91.5	about dangers at night
PSA.91.5	or arrows during the day.
PSA.91.6	And you won't fear diseases
PSA.91.6	that strike in the dark
PSA.91.6	or sudden disaster at noon.
PSA.91.7	You will not be harmed,
PSA.91.7	though thousands fall
PSA.91.7	all around you.
PSA.91.8	And with your own eyes
PSA.91.8	you will see the punishment
PSA.91.8	of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	The 
PSA.91.9	is your fortress.
PSA.91.9	Run to him for safety,
PSA.91.10	and no terrible disasters
PSA.91.10	will strike you
PSA.91.10	or your home.
PSA.91.11	to protect you
PSA.91.11	wherever you go.
PSA.91.12	in their arms,
PSA.91.12	and you won't hurt your feet
PSA.91.12	on the stones.
PSA.91.13	the strongest lions
PSA.91.13	and the most deadly snakes.
PSA.91.14	The Lord says, “If you love me
PSA.91.14	and truly know who I am,
PSA.91.14	I will rescue you
PSA.91.14	and keep you safe.
PSA.91.15	When you are in trouble,
PSA.91.15	call out to me.
PSA.91.15	I will answer and be there
PSA.91.15	to protect and honor you.
PSA.91.16	You will live a long life
PSA.91.16	and see my saving power.”
PSA.92.1	It is wonderful to be grateful
PSA.92.1	and to sing your praises,
PSA.92.2	It is wonderful each morning
PSA.92.2	to tell about your love
PSA.92.2	and at night to announce
PSA.92.2	how faithful you are.
PSA.92.3	I enjoy praising your name
PSA.92.3	to the music of harps,
PSA.92.4	because everything you do
PSA.92.4	makes me happy,
PSA.92.4	and I sing joyful songs.
PSA.92.5	You do great things, 
PSA.92.5	Your thoughts are too deep
PSA.92.6	to know or understand.
PSA.92.7	Though the wicked sprout
PSA.92.7	and spread like grass,
PSA.92.7	they will be pulled up
PSA.92.7	by their roots.
PSA.92.8	But you will rule
PSA.92.8	over all of us forever,
PSA.92.9	and your hateful enemies
PSA.92.9	will be scattered
PSA.92.9	and then destroyed.
PSA.92.10	You have given me
PSA.92.10	the strength of a wild ox,
PSA.92.10	and you have chosen me
PSA.92.10	to be your very own.
PSA.92.11	My eyes have seen,
PSA.92.11	and my ears have heard
PSA.92.11	the doom and destruction
PSA.92.11	of my evil enemies.
PSA.92.12	Good people will prosper
PSA.92.12	like palm trees,
PSA.92.12	and they will grow strong
PSA.92.12	like the cedars of Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	They will take root
PSA.92.13	in your house, 
PSA.92.13	and they will do well.
PSA.92.14	They will be like trees
PSA.92.14	that stay healthy and fruitful,
PSA.92.14	even when they are old.
PSA.92.15	And they will say about you,
PSA.92.15	“The 
PSA.92.15	God is our mighty rock.”
PSA.93.1	Our 
PSA.93.1	Majesty and power
PSA.93.1	are your royal robes.
PSA.93.1	You put the world in place,
PSA.93.1	and it will never be moved.
PSA.93.2	You have always ruled,
PSA.93.2	and you are eternal.
PSA.93.3	The ocean is roaring, 
PSA.93.3	The sea is pounding hard.
PSA.93.4	Its mighty waves are majestic,
PSA.93.4	but you are even more majestic,
PSA.93.4	and you rule over all.
PSA.93.5	Your decisions are firm,
PSA.93.5	and your temple will always
PSA.93.5	be beautiful and holy.
PSA.94.1	the guilty.
PSA.94.1	Show what you are like
PSA.94.1	and punish them now.
PSA.94.2	You judge the earth.
PSA.94.2	Come and help us!
PSA.94.2	Pay back those proud people
PSA.94.2	for what they have done.
PSA.94.3	How long will the wicked
PSA.94.3	celebrate and be glad?
PSA.94.4	All of those cruel people
PSA.94.4	strut and boast,
PSA.94.5	and they crush and wound
PSA.94.5	your chosen nation, 
PSA.94.6	They murder widows,
PSA.94.6	foreigners, and orphans.
PSA.94.7	Then they say,
PSA.94.7	“The 
PSA.94.7	doesn't see or know.”
PSA.94.8	Can't you fools see?
PSA.94.8	Won't you ever learn?
PSA.94.9	God gave us ears and eyes!
PSA.94.9	Can't he hear and see?
PSA.94.10	God instructs the nations
PSA.94.10	and gives knowledge to us all.
PSA.94.10	Won't he also correct us?
PSA.94.11	our plans really are.
PSA.94.12	Our 
PSA.94.12	that you instruct and teach
PSA.94.12	by using your Law.
PSA.94.13	You give them rest
PSA.94.13	from their troubles,
PSA.94.13	until a pit can be dug
PSA.94.13	for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	You won't turn your back
PSA.94.14	on your chosen nation.
PSA.94.15	Justice and fairness
PSA.94.15	will go hand in hand,
PSA.94.15	and all who do right
PSA.94.15	will follow along.
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me
PSA.94.16	against those cruel people?
PSA.94.17	If you had not helped me, 
PSA.94.17	I would soon have gone
PSA.94.17	to the land of silence.
PSA.94.18	When I felt my feet slipping,
PSA.94.18	you came with your love
PSA.94.18	and kept me steady.
PSA.94.19	And when I was burdened
PSA.94.19	with worries,
PSA.94.19	you comforted me
PSA.94.19	and made me feel secure.
PSA.94.20	But you are opposed
PSA.94.20	to dishonest lawmakers
PSA.94.21	who gang up to murder
PSA.94.21	innocent victims.
PSA.94.22	You, 
PSA.94.22	that mighty rock
PSA.94.22	where I am safe.
PSA.94.23	You will pay back my enemies,
PSA.94.23	and you will wipe them out
PSA.94.23	for the evil they did.
PSA.95.1	Sing joyful songs to the

PSA.95.3	king over all other gods.
PSA.95.4	He holds the deepest part
PSA.95.4	of the earth in his hands,
PSA.95.4	and the mountain peaks
PSA.95.4	also belong to him.
PSA.95.5	The ocean is the Lord's
PSA.95.5	because he made it,
PSA.95.5	and with his own hands
PSA.95.5	he formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	Bow down and worship
PSA.95.6	the

PSA.95.8	as your ancestors did
PSA.95.8	at Meribah and Massah
PSA.95.8	out in the desert.
PSA.95.9	For forty years
PSA.95.9	they tested God and saw
PSA.95.9	the things he did.
PSA.95.10	Then God got tired of them
PSA.95.10	and said,
PSA.95.10	“You never show good sense,
PSA.95.10	and you don't understand
PSA.95.10	what I want you to do.”
PSA.95.11	“You people will never enter
PSA.95.11	my place of rest.”

PSA.97.4	that the earth sees it
PSA.97.4	and trembles.
PSA.97.5	Mountains melt away like wax
PSA.97.5	in the presence of the 
PSA.97.5	of all the earth.
PSA.97.6	The heavens announce,

PSA.100.4	as you enter his temple.
PSA.100.5	His love and faithfulness
PSA.100.5	will last forever.
PSA.101.1	I will sing to you, 
PSA.101.1	I will celebrate your kindness
PSA.101.1	and your justice.
PSA.101.2	Please help me learn
PSA.101.2	to do the right thing,

PSA.101.6	will serve as an official.
PSA.101.7	No one who cheats or lies
PSA.101.7	will have a position
PSA.101.7	in my royal court.
PSA.101.8	Each morning I will silence
PSA.101.8	any lawbreakers I find
PSA.101.8	in the countryside
PSA.101.8	or in the city of the 
PSA.102.1	I pray to you, 
PSA.102.1	Please listen.
PSA.102.2	Don't hide from me
PSA.102.2	in my time of trouble.
PSA.102.2	Pay attention to my prayer
PSA.102.2	and quickly give an answer.
PSA.102.3	My days disappear like smoke,
PSA.102.3	and my bones are burning
PSA.102.3	as though in a furnace.
PSA.102.4	I am wasting away like grass,
PSA.102.4	and my appetite is gone.
PSA.102.5	My groaning never stops,
PSA.102.5	and my bones can be seen
PSA.102.5	through my skin.
PSA.102.6	I am like a lonely owl
PSA.102.6	in the desert
PSA.102.7	or a restless sparrow
PSA.102.7	alone on a roof.
PSA.102.8	My enemies insult me all day,
PSA.102.8	and they use my name
PSA.102.8	for a curse word.
PSA.102.9	Instead of food,
PSA.102.9	I have ashes to eat
PSA.102.9	and tears to drink,
PSA.102.10	because you are furious
PSA.102.10	and have thrown me aside.
PSA.102.11	My life fades like a shadow
PSA.102.11	at the end of day
PSA.102.11	and withers like grass.
PSA.102.12	Our 
PSA.102.12	and will always be famous.
PSA.102.13	You will show pity to Zion
PSA.102.13	because the time has come.
PSA.102.14	We, your servants,
PSA.102.14	love each stone in the city,
PSA.102.14	and we are sad to see them
PSA.102.14	lying in the dirt.
PSA.102.15	Our 
PSA.102.15	will honor you,
PSA.102.15	and all kings on earth
PSA.102.15	will praise your glory.
PSA.102.16	You will rebuild
PSA.102.16	the city of Zion.
PSA.102.16	Your glory will be seen,
PSA.102.17	and the prayers of the homeless
PSA.102.17	will be answered.
PSA.102.18	Future generations must also
PSA.102.18	praise the 
PSA.102.18	so write this for them:
PSA.102.19	“From his holy temple,
PSA.102.19	the 
PSA.102.19	at the earth.
PSA.102.20	He listened to the groans
PSA.102.20	of prisoners,
PSA.102.20	and he rescued everyone
PSA.102.20	who was doomed to die.”
PSA.102.21	All Jerusalem should praise
PSA.102.21	you, our 
PSA.102.22	when people from every nation
PSA.102.22	meet to worship you.
PSA.102.23	I should still be strong,
PSA.102.23	but you, 
PSA.102.23	an old person of me.
PSA.102.24	You will live forever!
PSA.102.24	Years mean nothing to you.
PSA.102.24	Don't cut my life in half!
PSA.102.25	you laid the earth's foundation
PSA.102.25	and created the heavens.
PSA.102.26	They will all disappear
PSA.102.26	and wear out like clothes.
PSA.102.26	You change them,
PSA.102.26	as you would a coat,
PSA.102.26	but you last forever.
PSA.102.27	You are always the same.
PSA.102.27	You are God for all time.
PSA.102.28	Every generation of those
PSA.102.28	who serve you
PSA.102.28	will live in your presence.
PSA.103.1	With all my heart
PSA.103.1	I praise the 
PSA.103.1	and with all that I am
PSA.103.1	I praise his holy name!
PSA.103.2	With all my heart
PSA.103.2	I praise the 
PSA.103.2	I will never forget
PSA.103.2	how kind he has been.
PSA.103.3	The 
PSA.103.3	heals us when we are sick,
PSA.103.4	and protects us from death.
PSA.103.4	His kindness and love
PSA.103.4	are a crown on our heads.
PSA.103.5	Each day that we live,
PSA.103.5	he provides for our needs
PSA.103.5	and gives us the strength
PSA.103.5	of a young eagle.
PSA.103.6	For all who are mistreated,
PSA.103.6	the 
PSA.103.7	He taught his Law to Moses
PSA.103.7	and showed all Israel
PSA.103.7	what he could do.
PSA.103.8	He is kind and patient,
PSA.103.8	and his love never fails.
PSA.103.9	The 
PSA.103.9	and point out our sins;
PSA.103.10	he doesn't punish us
PSA.103.10	as our sins deserve.
PSA.103.11	How great is God's love for all
PSA.103.11	who worship him?
PSA.103.11	Greater than the distance
PSA.103.11	between heaven and earth!
PSA.103.12	How far has the 
PSA.103.12	our sins from us?
PSA.103.12	Farther than the distance
PSA.103.12	from east to west!
PSA.103.13	Just as parents are kind
PSA.103.13	to their children,
PSA.103.13	the 
PSA.103.13	to all who worship him,
PSA.103.14	because he knows
PSA.103.14	we are made of dust.
PSA.103.15	We humans are like grass
PSA.103.15	or wild flowers
PSA.103.15	that quickly bloom.
PSA.103.16	But a scorching wind blows,
PSA.103.16	and they quickly wither
PSA.103.16	to be forever forgotten.
PSA.103.17	The 
PSA.103.17	to those who worship him,
PSA.103.17	and he keeps his promises
PSA.103.17	to their descendants
PSA.103.18	who faithfully obey him.
PSA.103.19	God has set up his kingdom
PSA.103.19	in heaven, and he rules
PSA.103.19	the whole creation.
PSA.103.20	All of you mighty angels,
PSA.103.20	who obey God's commands,
PSA.103.20	come and praise your 
PSA.103.21	All of you thousands
PSA.103.21	who serve and obey God,
PSA.103.21	come and praise your 
PSA.103.22	All of God's creation
PSA.103.22	and all that he rules,
PSA.103.22	come and praise your 
PSA.103.22	With all my heart
PSA.103.22	I praise the 
PSA.104.1	I praise you, 
PSA.104.1	with all my heart.
PSA.104.1	You are glorious and majestic,
PSA.104.1	dressed in royal robes
PSA.104.2	and surrounded by light.
PSA.104.2	You spread out the sky
PSA.104.2	like a tent,
PSA.104.3	and you built your home
PSA.104.3	over the mighty ocean.
PSA.104.3	The clouds are your chariot
PSA.104.3	with the wind as its wings.
PSA.104.4	and flames of fire
PSA.104.4	are your servants.
PSA.104.5	You built foundations
PSA.104.5	for the earth, and it
PSA.104.5	will never be shaken.
PSA.104.6	You covered the earth
PSA.104.6	with the ocean that rose
PSA.104.6	above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	Then your voice thundered!
PSA.104.7	And the water flowed
PSA.104.8	down the mountains
PSA.104.8	and through the valleys
PSA.104.8	to the place you prepared.
PSA.104.9	Now you have set boundaries,
PSA.104.9	so that the water will never
PSA.104.9	flood the earth again.
PSA.104.10	You provide streams of water
PSA.104.10	in the hills and valleys,
PSA.104.11	so that the donkeys
PSA.104.11	and other wild animals
PSA.104.11	can satisfy their thirst.
PSA.104.12	Birds build their nests nearby
PSA.104.12	and sing in the trees.
PSA.104.13	From your home above
PSA.104.13	you send rain on the hills
PSA.104.13	and water the earth.
PSA.104.14	You let the earth produce
PSA.104.14	grass for cattle,
PSA.104.14	plants for our food,
PSA.104.15	wine to cheer us up,
PSA.104.15	olive oil for our skin,
PSA.104.15	and grain for our health.
PSA.104.16	Our 
PSA.104.16	always have water,
PSA.104.16	and so do the cedars
PSA.104.16	you planted in Lebanon.
PSA.104.17	Birds nest in those trees,
PSA.104.17	and storks make their home
PSA.104.17	in the fir trees.
PSA.104.18	Wild goats find a home
PSA.104.18	in the tall mountains,
PSA.104.18	and small animals can hide
PSA.104.18	between the rocks.
PSA.104.19	You created the moon
PSA.104.19	to tell us the seasons.
PSA.104.19	The sun knows when to set,
PSA.104.20	and you made the darkness,
PSA.104.20	so the animals in the forest
PSA.104.20	could come out at night.
PSA.104.21	Lions roar as they hunt
PSA.104.21	for the food you provide.
PSA.104.22	But when morning comes,
PSA.104.22	they return to their dens,
PSA.104.23	then we go out to work
PSA.104.23	until the end of day.
PSA.104.24	Our 
PSA.104.24	you made so many things;
PSA.104.24	the whole earth is covered
PSA.104.24	with your living creatures.
PSA.104.25	But what about the ocean
PSA.104.25	so big and wide?
PSA.104.25	It is alive with creatures,
PSA.104.25	large and small.
PSA.104.26	as well as Leviathan,
PSA.104.26	the monster you created
PSA.104.26	to splash in the sea.
PSA.104.27	All of these depend on you
PSA.104.27	to provide them with food,
PSA.104.28	and you feed each one
PSA.104.28	with your own hand,
PSA.104.28	until they are full.
PSA.104.29	But when you turn away,
PSA.104.29	they are terrified;
PSA.104.29	when you end their life,
PSA.104.29	they die and rot.
PSA.104.30	You created all of them
PSA.104.30	by your Spirit,
PSA.104.30	and you give new life
PSA.104.30	to the earth.
PSA.104.31	Our 
PSA.104.31	that your glory
PSA.104.31	will last forever
PSA.104.31	and that you will be pleased
PSA.104.31	with what you have done.
PSA.104.32	You look at the earth,
PSA.104.32	and it trembles.
PSA.104.32	You touch the mountains,
PSA.104.32	and smoke goes up.
PSA.104.33	As long as I live,
PSA.104.33	I will sing and praise you,
PSA.104.33	the 
PSA.104.34	I hope my thoughts
PSA.104.34	will please you,
PSA.104.34	because you are the one
PSA.104.34	who makes me glad.
PSA.104.35	Destroy all wicked sinners
PSA.104.35	from the earth
PSA.104.35	once and for all.
PSA.104.35	With all my heart
PSA.104.35	I praise you, 
PSA.104.35	I praise you!
PSA.105.1	and pray in his name!
PSA.105.1	Tell everyone
PSA.105.1	what he has done.
PSA.105.2	Sing praises to the 
PSA.105.2	Tell about his miracles.
PSA.105.3	Celebrate and worship
PSA.105.3	his holy name
PSA.105.3	with all your heart.
PSA.105.4	Trust the 
PSA.105.4	and his mighty power.
PSA.105.5	Remember his miracles
PSA.105.5	and all his wonders
PSA.105.5	and his fair decisions.
PSA.105.6	You belong to the family
PSA.105.6	of Abraham, his servant;
PSA.105.6	you are his chosen ones,
PSA.105.6	the descendants of Jacob.
PSA.105.7	The 
PSA.105.7	bringing justice
PSA.105.7	everywhere on earth.
PSA.105.8	He will never forget
PSA.105.8	his agreement or his promises,
PSA.105.8	not in thousands of years.
PSA.105.8	* 
PSA.105.9	 God made an eternal promise
PSA.105.11	when he said, “I'll give you
PSA.105.11	the land of Canaan.”
PSA.105.12	At the time there were
PSA.105.12	only a few of us,
PSA.105.12	and we were homeless.
PSA.105.13	We wandered from nation
PSA.105.13	to nation, from one country
PSA.105.13	to another.
PSA.105.14	mistreat our people.
PSA.105.14	Instead he protected us
PSA.105.14	by punishing rulers
PSA.105.15	and telling them,
PSA.105.15	“Don't touch my chosen leaders
PSA.105.15	or harm my prophets!”
PSA.105.16	until food was scarce
PSA.105.16	everywhere in the land.
PSA.105.17	sold as a slave into Egypt,
PSA.105.18	around his legs and neck.
PSA.105.19	Joseph remained a slave
PSA.105.19	until his own words
PSA.105.19	had come true,
PSA.105.19	and the 
PSA.105.19	testing him.
PSA.105.20	set Joseph free
PSA.105.21	of everything he owned.
PSA.105.22	Joseph was in command
PSA.105.22	of the officials,
PSA.105.22	and he taught the leaders
PSA.105.22	how to use wisdom.
PSA.105.23	came and settled in Egypt
PSA.105.23	as foreigners.
PSA.105.24	so he let them grow stronger
PSA.105.24	than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	They served the 
PSA.105.25	and he made the Egyptians plan
PSA.105.25	hateful things against them.
PSA.105.26	He also chose and sent Aaron
PSA.105.27	to his people in Egypt,
PSA.105.27	and they worked miracles
PSA.105.27	and wonders there.
PSA.105.28	and he sent darkness
PSA.105.28	to cover Egypt.
PSA.105.29	into streams of blood,
PSA.105.29	and the fish all died.
PSA.105.30	even in the royal palace.
PSA.105.31	flies and gnats
PSA.105.31	swarmed all around.
PSA.105.32	God sent hailstones
PSA.105.32	and flashes of lightning.
PSA.105.33	He destroyed their grapevines
PSA.105.33	and their fig trees,
PSA.105.33	and he made splinters
PSA.105.33	of all the other trees.
PSA.105.34	and more grasshoppers came
PSA.105.34	than could be counted.
PSA.105.35	They ate every green plant
PSA.105.35	and all the crops that grew
PSA.105.35	in the land of Egypt.
PSA.105.36	of every first-born son.
PSA.105.37	they took silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	and no one was left behind.
PSA.105.38	The Egyptians were afraid
PSA.105.38	and gladly let them go.
PSA.105.39	and guided them by fire
PSA.105.39	during the night.
PSA.105.40	he sent more birds
PSA.105.40	than they could eat.
PSA.105.41	and streams of water
PSA.105.41	gushed into the desert.
PSA.105.42	God never forgot
PSA.105.42	his sacred promise
PSA.105.42	to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	When the Lord rescued
PSA.105.43	his chosen people from Egypt,
PSA.105.43	they celebrated with songs.
PSA.105.44	and everything else
PSA.105.44	the nations had worked for.
PSA.105.45	He did this so that his people
PSA.105.45	would obey all his laws.
PSA.105.45	Shout praises to the 
PSA.106.1	and praise you, 
PSA.106.1	You are good to us,
PSA.106.1	and your love never fails.
PSA.106.2	No one can praise you enough
PSA.106.2	for all the mighty things
PSA.106.2	you have done.
PSA.106.3	You bless those people
PSA.106.3	who are honest and fair
PSA.106.3	in everything they do.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	when you show kindness
PSA.106.4	by saving your people.
PSA.106.5	Let me prosper with the rest
PSA.106.5	of your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	as they celebrate with pride
PSA.106.5	because they belong to you.
PSA.106.6	We and our ancestors
PSA.106.6	have sinned terribly.
PSA.106.7	they paid no attention
PSA.106.7	to your marvelous deeds
PSA.106.7	or your wonderful love.
PSA.106.7	And they turned against you
PSA.106.7	at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	But you were true to your name,
PSA.106.8	and you rescued them to prove
PSA.106.8	how mighty you are.
PSA.106.9	“Dry up!”
PSA.106.9	Then you led your people across
PSA.106.9	on land as dry as a desert.
PSA.106.10	You saved all of them
PSA.106.11	and drowned every one
PSA.106.11	of their enemies.
PSA.106.12	and sang your praises.
PSA.106.13	But they soon forgot
PSA.106.13	what you had done
PSA.106.13	and rejected your advice.
PSA.106.14	and tested you there
PSA.106.14	in the desert.
PSA.106.15	So you gave them
PSA.106.15	what they wanted,
PSA.106.15	but later you destroyed them
PSA.106.15	with a horrible disease.
PSA.106.16	of Moses and of Aaron,
PSA.106.16	your chosen priest.
PSA.106.17	Dathan and Abiram rebelled,
PSA.106.17	and the earth opened up
PSA.106.17	and swallowed them.
PSA.106.18	Then fire broke out
PSA.106.18	and destroyed all
PSA.106.18	of their followers.
PSA.106.19	made and worshiped the statue
PSA.106.20	of a bull, instead of you,
PSA.106.20	their glorious God.
PSA.106.21	You worked powerful miracles
PSA.106.21	to save them from Egypt,
PSA.106.21	but they forgot about you
PSA.106.22	and the fearsome things
PSA.106.22	you did at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	You were angry and started
PSA.106.23	to destroy them,
PSA.106.23	but Moses, your chosen leader,
PSA.106.23	begged you not to do it.
PSA.106.24	you, 
PSA.106.24	and they did not like
PSA.106.24	the promised land.
PSA.106.25	They would not obey you,
PSA.106.25	and they grumbled
PSA.106.25	in their tents.
PSA.106.26	So you threatened them
PSA.106.26	by saying, “I'll kill you
PSA.106.26	out here in the desert!
PSA.106.27	everywhere in the world.”
PSA.106.28	of a god named Baal Peor,
PSA.106.28	and they ate sacrifices
PSA.106.28	offered to the dead.
PSA.106.29	They did such terrible things
PSA.106.29	that you punished them
PSA.106.29	with a deadly disease.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas
PSA.106.30	and the sickness stopped.
PSA.106.31	Now he will always
PSA.106.31	be highly honored.
PSA.106.32	they turned against you
PSA.106.32	and made you furious.
PSA.106.33	Then Moses got into trouble
PSA.106.33	for speaking in anger.
PSA.106.34	by refusing to destroy
PSA.106.34	the nations.
PSA.106.35	Instead they were friendly
PSA.106.35	with those foreigners
PSA.106.35	and followed their customs.
PSA.106.36	Then they fell into the trap
PSA.106.36	of worshiping idols.
PSA.106.37	and their daughters to demons
PSA.106.38	Then they poured out the blood
PSA.106.38	of these innocent children
PSA.106.38	and made the land filthy.
PSA.106.39	By doing such gruesome things,
PSA.106.39	they also became filthy.
PSA.106.40	and terribly disgusted
PSA.106.40	with your people.
PSA.106.41	So you put them in the power
PSA.106.41	of nations that hated them.
PSA.106.42	They were mistreated and abused
PSA.106.42	by their enemies,
PSA.106.43	but you saved them
PSA.106.43	time after time.
PSA.106.43	They were determined to rebel,
PSA.106.43	and their sins caused
PSA.106.43	their downfall.
PSA.106.44	You answered their prayers
PSA.106.44	when they were in trouble.
PSA.106.45	You kept your agreement
PSA.106.45	and were so merciful
PSA.106.46	that their enemies
PSA.106.46	had pity on them.
PSA.106.47	Bring us back
PSA.106.47	from among the nations.
PSA.106.47	Let us celebrate and shout

PSA.109.2	Destructive and deceitful lies
PSA.109.2	are told about me,
PSA.109.3	and hateful things are said
PSA.109.3	for no reason.
PSA.109.4	I had pity and prayed
PSA.109.4	for my enemies,
PSA.109.4	but their words to me
PSA.109.4	were harsh and cruel.
PSA.109.5	For being friendly and kind,
PSA.109.5	they paid me back
PSA.109.5	with meanness and hatred.
PSA.109.6	My enemies said,
PSA.109.6	“Find some worthless fools
PSA.109.6	to accuse him of a crime.
PSA.109.7	Try him and find him guilty!

PSA.109.12	or have pity on the children
PSA.109.12	he leaves behind.
PSA.109.13	Bring an end to his family,
PSA.109.13	and from now on let him be
PSA.109.13	a forgotten man.

PSA.109.15	the sins of his family,
PSA.109.15	or let anyone remember
PSA.109.15	his family ever lived.
PSA.109.16	He was so cruel to the poor,
PSA.109.16	homeless, and discouraged
PSA.109.16	that they died young.
PSA.109.17	“He cursed others.
PSA.109.17	Now place a curse on him!
PSA.109.17	He never wished others well.
PSA.109.17	Wish only trouble for him!
PSA.109.18	He cursed others more often
PSA.109.18	than he dressed himself.
PSA.109.18	Let his curses strike him deep,
PSA.109.18	just as water and olive oil
PSA.109.18	soak through to our bones.
PSA.109.19	Let his curses surround him,
PSA.109.19	just like the belt and clothes
PSA.109.19	he wears each day.”
PSA.109.20	Those are the cruel things
PSA.109.20	my enemies wish for me.
PSA.109.20	Let it all happen to them!

PSA.109.21	Show your great kindness
PSA.109.21	and rescue me.
PSA.109.22	I am poor and helpless,
PSA.109.22	and I have lost all hope.
PSA.109.23	I am fading away
PSA.109.23	like an evening shadow;
PSA.109.23	I am tossed aside
PSA.109.23	like a crawling insect.
PSA.109.24	I have gone without eating,
PSA.109.24	until my knees are weak,
PSA.109.24	and my body is bony.
PSA.109.25	they say cruel things
PSA.109.25	and shake their heads.
PSA.109.26	Please help me, 
PSA.109.26	Come and save me
PSA.109.26	because of your love.

PSA.109.28	when they attack,
PSA.109.28	and you will make me glad
PSA.109.28	to be your servant.

PSA.119.156	Please do the right thing
PSA.119.156	and save my life.
PSA.119.157	I have a lot of brutal enemies,
PSA.119.157	but still I never turn
PSA.119.157	from your laws.
PSA.119.158	Those unfaithful people
PSA.119.158	who refuse to obey you
PSA.119.158	are disgusting to me.
PSA.119.159	Remember how I love your laws,
PSA.119.159	and show your love for me
PSA.119.159	by keeping me safe.

PSA.119.161	But with all my heart
PSA.119.161	I respect your words,
PSA.119.162	because they bring happiness
PSA.119.162	like treasures taken in war.

PSA.119.169	that comes from your word.
PSA.119.170	Listen to my concerns
PSA.119.170	and keep me safe,
PSA.119.170	just as you have promised.
PSA.119.171	If you will teach me your laws,
PSA.119.171	I will praise you 
PSA.119.172	and sing
PSA.119.172	about your promise,
PSA.119.172	because all your teachings
PSA.119.172	are what they ought to be.
PSA.119.173	Be ready to protect me

PSA.119.175	so I can praise you,
PSA.119.175	and let me find help
PSA.119.175	in your teachings.
PSA.119.176	I am your servant,
PSA.119.176	but I have wandered away
PSA.119.176	like a lost sheep.
PSA.119.176	Please come after me,
PSA.119.176	because I have not forgotten
PSA.119.176	your teachings.
PSA.120.1	When I am in trouble, I pray,
PSA.120.2	“Come and save me, 
PSA.120.2	from deceitful liars!”
PSA.120.3	What punishment is fitting
PSA.120.3	for you deceitful liars?
PSA.120.4	Your reward should be
PSA.120.4	sharp and flaming arrows!
PSA.120.5	But I must live as a foreigner
PSA.120.5	among the people of Meshech
PSA.120.5	and in the tents of Kedar.
PSA.120.6	I have spent too much time
PSA.120.6	living among people
PSA.120.6	who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am in favor of peace,
PSA.120.7	but when I speak of it,
PSA.120.7	all they want is war.
PSA.121.1	I look to the hills!
PSA.121.1	Where will I find help?
PSA.121.2	It will come from the 
PSA.121.2	who created heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	The 
PSA.121.3	and he won't go to sleep
PSA.121.3	or let you stumble.

PSA.121.4	or ever get drowsy.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	there at your right side
PSA.121.5	to shade you from the sun.

PSA.121.7	from all dangers.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	now and always
PSA.121.8	wherever you go.
PSA.122.1	It made me glad when they said,
PSA.122.1	“Let's go to the house
PSA.122.1	of the 
PSA.122.2	Jerusalem, we are standing
PSA.122.2	inside your gates.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, what a strong
PSA.122.3	and beautiful city you are!
PSA.122.4	Every tribe of the 
PSA.122.4	obeys him and comes to you
PSA.122.4	to praise his name.
PSA.122.5	David's royal throne is here
PSA.122.5	where justice rules.
PSA.122.6	Jerusalem, we pray
PSA.122.6	that you will have peace,
PSA.122.6	and that all will go well
PSA.122.6	for those who love you.
PSA.122.7	May there be peace
PSA.122.7	inside your city walls
PSA.122.7	and in your palaces.
PSA.122.8	Because of my friends
PSA.122.8	and my relatives,
PSA.122.8	I will pray for peace.
PSA.122.9	And because of the house
PSA.122.9	of the 
PSA.122.9	I will work for your good.
PSA.123.1	Our 
PSA.123.1	I turn my eyes to you,
PSA.123.1	on your throne in heaven.
PSA.123.2	Servants look to their master,
PSA.123.2	but we will look to you,
PSA.123.2	until you have mercy on us.
PSA.123.3	Please have mercy, 
PSA.123.3	We have been insulted
PSA.123.3	more than we can stand,
PSA.123.4	and we can't take more abuse
PSA.123.4	from those proud,
PSA.123.4	conceited people.
PSA.124.1	The 
PSA.124.1	Let everyone in Israel say:
PSA.124.2	“The 
PSA.124.2	Otherwise, the enemy attack
PSA.124.3	would have killed us all,
PSA.124.3	because it was furious.
PSA.124.4	We would have been swept away
PSA.124.4	in a violent flood
PSA.124.5	of high and roaring waves.”
PSA.124.6	Let's praise the 
PSA.124.6	He protected us from enemies
PSA.124.6	who were like wild animals,
PSA.124.7	and we escaped like birds
PSA.124.7	from a hunter's torn net.
PSA.124.8	The 
PSA.124.8	and he is the one
PSA.124.8	who sends us help.
PSA.125.1	Everyone who trusts the 
PSA.125.1	is like Mount Zion
PSA.125.1	that cannot be shaken
PSA.125.1	and will stand forever.
PSA.125.2	Just as Jerusalem is protected
PSA.125.2	by mountains on every side,
PSA.125.2	the 
PSA.125.2	by holding them in his arms
PSA.125.2	now and forever.
PSA.125.3	He won't let the wicked
PSA.125.3	rule his people
PSA.125.3	or lead them to do wrong.
PSA.125.4	Let's ask the 
PSA.125.4	to everyone who is good
PSA.125.4	and completely obeys him.
PSA.125.5	When the 
PSA.125.5	the wicked,
PSA.125.5	he will punish everyone else
PSA.125.5	who lives an evil life.

PSA.126.1	when the 
PSA.126.1	to the city of Zion.
PSA.126.2	We celebrated with laughter
PSA.126.2	and joyful songs.
PSA.126.2	In foreign nations it was said,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.2	for his people.”
PSA.126.3	And so we celebrated
PSA.126.3	because the 
PSA.126.3	worked miracles for us.
PSA.126.4	Our 
PSA.126.4	our people again,
PSA.126.4	and let us be like streams
PSA.126.4	in the Southern Desert.
PSA.126.5	We cried as we went out
PSA.126.5	to plant our seeds.
PSA.126.5	Now let us celebrate
PSA.126.5	as we bring in the crops.
PSA.126.6	We cried on the way
PSA.126.6	to plant our seeds,
PSA.126.6	but we will celebrate and shout
PSA.126.6	as we bring in the crops.
PSA.127.1	Without the help of the 
PSA.127.1	it is useless to build a home
PSA.127.1	or to guard a city.
PSA.127.2	It is useless to get up early
PSA.127.2	and stay up late
PSA.127.2	in order to earn a living.
PSA.127.2	God takes care of his own,
PSA.127.2	even while they sleep.
PSA.127.3	Children are a blessing
PSA.127.3	and a gift from the 
PSA.127.4	Having a lot of children
PSA.127.4	to take care of you
PSA.127.4	in your old age
PSA.127.4	is like a warrior
PSA.127.4	with a lot of arrows.

PSA.127.5	the better off you will be,
PSA.127.5	because they will protect you
PSA.127.5	when your enemies
PSA.127.5	attack you in court.

PSA.128.2	and you will be happy—
PSA.128.2	all will go well.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be as fruitful
PSA.128.3	as a grapevine,
PSA.128.3	and just as an olive tree
PSA.128.3	is rich with olives,
PSA.128.3	your home will be rich
PSA.128.3	with healthy children.
PSA.128.4	This is how the 
PSA.128.4	everyone who respects him.
PSA.128.5	I pray that the 
PSA.128.5	will bless you from Zion
PSA.128.5	and let Jerusalem prosper
PSA.128.5	as long as you live.
PSA.128.6	May you live long enough
PSA.128.6	to see your grandchildren.
PSA.128.6	Let's pray for peace in Israel!
PSA.129.1	Since the time I was young,
PSA.129.1	enemies have often attacked!
PSA.129.1	Let everyone in Israel say:
PSA.129.2	“Since the time I was young,
PSA.129.2	enemies have often attacked!

PSA.129.4	and he has set me free
PSA.129.4	from the ropes
PSA.129.4	of those cruel people.
PSA.129.5	I pray that all who hate
PSA.129.5	the city of Zion
PSA.129.5	will be made ashamed
PSA.129.5	and forced to turn and run.
PSA.129.6	May they be like grass
PSA.129.6	on the flat roof of a house,
PSA.129.6	grass that dries up
PSA.129.6	as soon as it sprouts.
PSA.129.7	Don't let them be like wheat
PSA.129.7	gathered in bundles.
PSA.129.8	And don't let anyone
PSA.129.8	who passes by say to them,
PSA.129.8	“The 
PSA.129.8	I give you my blessing
PSA.129.8	in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	From a sea of troubles

PSA.136.25	He gives food to all who live.
PSA.136.25	God's love never fails.
PSA.136.26	Praise God in heaven!
PSA.136.26	God's love never fails.
PSA.137.1	Beside the rivers of Babylon
PSA.137.1	we thought about Jerusalem,
PSA.137.1	and we sat down and cried.
PSA.137.2	We hung our small harps
PSA.137.2	on the willow
PSA.137.3	Our enemies had brought us here
PSA.137.3	as their prisoners;
PSA.137.3	now they wanted us to sing
PSA.137.3	and entertain them.
PSA.137.3	They insulted us and shouted,
PSA.137.3	“Sing about Zion!”
PSA.137.4	Here in a foreign land,
PSA.137.4	how can we sing
PSA.137.4	about the 
PSA.137.5	Jerusalem, if I forget you,
PSA.137.5	let my right hand go limp.
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue stick
PSA.137.6	to the roof of my mouth,
PSA.137.6	if I don't think about you
PSA.137.6	above all else.
PSA.137.7	Our 
PSA.137.7	On the day Jerusalem fell,
PSA.137.7	they shouted,
PSA.137.7	“Completely destroy the city!
PSA.137.7	Tear down every building!”
PSA.137.8	I pray the Lord's blessings
PSA.137.8	on anyone who punishes you
PSA.137.8	for what you did to us.
PSA.137.9	May the Lord bless everyone
PSA.137.9	who beats your children
PSA.137.9	against the rocks!
PSA.138.1	With all my heart
PSA.138.1	I praise you, 
PSA.138.1	In the presence of angels
PSA.138.1	I sing your praises.
PSA.138.2	I worship at your holy temple
PSA.138.2	and praise you for your love
PSA.138.2	and your faithfulness.
PSA.138.2	You were true to your word
PSA.138.2	and made yourself more famous
PSA.138.2	than ever before.
PSA.138.3	When I asked for your help,
PSA.138.3	you answered my prayer
PSA.138.3	and gave me courage.
PSA.138.4	All kings on this earth
PSA.138.4	have heard your promises, 
PSA.138.4	and they will praise you.
PSA.138.5	You are so famous
PSA.138.5	that they will sing about
PSA.138.5	the things you have done.
PSA.138.6	Though you are above us all,
PSA.138.6	you care for humble people,
PSA.138.6	and you keep a close watch
PSA.138.6	on everyone who is proud.
PSA.138.7	I am surrounded by trouble,
PSA.138.7	but you protect me
PSA.138.7	against my angry enemies.
PSA.138.7	With your own powerful arm
PSA.138.7	you keep me safe.
PSA.138.8	You, 
PSA.138.8	treat me with kindness.
PSA.138.8	Your love never fails.
PSA.138.8	You have made us what we are.
PSA.138.8	Don't give up on us now!
PSA.139.1	You have looked deep
PSA.139.1	into my heart, 
PSA.139.1	and you know all about me.
PSA.139.2	You know when I am resting
PSA.139.2	or when I am working,
PSA.139.2	and from heaven
PSA.139.2	you discover my thoughts.
PSA.139.3	You notice everything I do
PSA.139.3	and everywhere I go.
PSA.139.4	Before I even speak a word,
PSA.139.4	you know what I will say,
PSA.139.5	and with your powerful arm
PSA.139.5	you protect me
PSA.139.5	from every side.
PSA.139.6	I can't understand all of this!
PSA.139.6	Such wonderful knowledge
PSA.139.6	is far above me.
PSA.139.7	Where could I go to escape
PSA.139.7	from your Spirit
PSA.139.7	or from your sight?
PSA.139.8	If I were to climb up
PSA.139.8	to the highest heavens,
PSA.139.8	you would be there.
PSA.139.8	If I were to dig down
PSA.139.8	to the world of the dead
PSA.139.8	you would also be there.
PSA.139.9	Suppose I had wings
PSA.139.9	like the dawning day
PSA.139.9	and flew across the ocean.
PSA.139.10	Even then your powerful arm
PSA.139.10	would guide and protect me.
PSA.139.11	Or suppose I said, “I'll hide
PSA.139.11	in the dark until night comes
PSA.139.11	to cover me over.”
PSA.139.12	But you see in the dark
PSA.139.12	because daylight and dark
PSA.139.12	are all the same to you.
PSA.139.13	You are the one
PSA.139.13	who put me together
PSA.139.13	inside my mother's body,
PSA.139.14	and I praise you because of
PSA.139.14	the wonderful way
PSA.139.14	you created me.
PSA.139.14	Everything you do is marvelous!
PSA.139.14	Of this I have no doubt.
PSA.139.15	Nothing about me
PSA.139.15	is hidden from you!
PSA.139.15	I was secretly woven together
PSA.139.15	out of human sight,
PSA.139.16	but with your own eyes you saw
PSA.139.16	my body being formed.
PSA.139.16	Even before I was born,
PSA.139.16	you had written in your book
PSA.139.16	everything about me.
PSA.139.17	my understanding,
PSA.139.17	much more than I
PSA.139.17	could ever imagine.
PSA.139.18	I try to count your thoughts,
PSA.139.18	but they outnumber the grains
PSA.139.18	of sand on the beach.
PSA.139.18	And when I awake,
PSA.139.18	I will find you nearby.
PSA.139.19	How I wish that you would kill
PSA.139.19	all cruel and heartless people
PSA.139.19	and protect me from them!
PSA.139.20	They are always rebelling
PSA.139.20	and speaking evil of you.
PSA.139.21	You know I hate anyone
PSA.139.21	who hates you, 
PSA.139.21	and refuses to obey.
PSA.139.22	They are my enemies too,
PSA.139.22	and I truly hate them.
PSA.139.23	Look deep into my heart, God,
PSA.139.23	and find out everything
PSA.139.23	I am thinking.
PSA.139.24	Don't let me follow evil ways,
PSA.139.24	but lead me in the way
PSA.139.24	that time has proven true.
PSA.140.1	Rescue me from cruel
PSA.140.1	and violent enemies, 
PSA.140.2	They think up evil plans
PSA.140.2	and always cause trouble.
PSA.140.3	like the poisonous fangs
PSA.140.3	of a snake.
PSA.140.4	Protect me, 
PSA.140.4	and brutal enemies,
PSA.140.4	who want to destroy me.
PSA.140.5	Those proud people have hidden
PSA.140.5	traps and nets
PSA.140.5	to catch me as I walk.
PSA.140.6	You, 
PSA.140.6	Please listen to my prayer.
PSA.140.7	You have the power to save me,
PSA.140.7	and you keep me safe
PSA.140.7	in every battle.
PSA.140.8	Don't let the wicked succeed
PSA.140.8	in doing what they want,
PSA.140.8	or else they might never
PSA.140.8	stop planning evil.
PSA.140.9	They have me surrounded,
PSA.140.9	but make them the victims
PSA.140.9	of their own vicious lies.
PSA.140.10	Dump flaming coals on them
PSA.140.10	and throw them into pits
PSA.140.10	where they can't climb out.
PSA.140.11	Chase those cruel liars away!
PSA.140.11	Let trouble hunt them down.
PSA.140.12	Our 
PSA.140.12	defend the homeless
PSA.140.12	and see that the poor
PSA.140.12	are given justice.
PSA.140.13	Your people will praise you
PSA.140.13	and will live with you
PSA.140.13	because they do right.
PSA.141.1	I pray to you, 
PSA.141.1	Please listen when I pray
PSA.141.1	and hurry to help me.
PSA.141.2	as sweet-smelling incense,
PSA.141.2	and think of my lifted hands
PSA.141.2	as an evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Help me to guard my words
PSA.141.3	whenever I say something.
PSA.141.4	Don't let me want to do evil
PSA.141.4	or waste my time doing wrong
PSA.141.4	with wicked people.
PSA.141.4	Don't let me even taste
PSA.141.4	the good things they offer.
PSA.141.5	Let your faithful people
PSA.141.5	correct and punish me.
PSA.141.5	My prayers condemn the deeds
PSA.141.5	of those who do wrong,
PSA.141.5	so don't let me be friends
PSA.141.5	with any of them.
PSA.141.6	Everyone will admit
PSA.141.6	that I was right
PSA.141.6	when their rulers are thrown
PSA.141.6	down a rocky cliff,
PSA.141.7	and their bones lie scattered
PSA.141.7	like crushed rocks
PSA.141.7	on top of a grave.
PSA.141.8	You are my 
PSA.141.8	and I look to you for safety.
PSA.141.8	Don't let me be harmed.
PSA.141.9	Protect me from the traps
PSA.141.9	of those violent people,
PSA.141.10	and make them fall
PSA.141.10	into their own traps
PSA.141.10	while you help me escape.
PSA.142.1	I beg for mercy.
PSA.142.2	I tell you all my worries
PSA.142.2	and my troubles,
PSA.142.3	and whenever I feel low,
PSA.142.3	you are there to guide me.
PSA.142.3	A trap has been hidden
PSA.142.3	along my pathway.
PSA.142.4	Even if you look,
PSA.142.4	you won't see anyone
PSA.142.4	who cares enough
PSA.142.4	to walk beside me.
PSA.142.4	There is no place to hide,
PSA.142.4	and no one who really cares.
PSA.142.5	I pray to you, 
PSA.142.5	You are my place of safety,
PSA.142.5	and you are my choice
PSA.142.5	in the land of the living.
PSA.142.5	Please answer my prayer.
PSA.142.5	I am completely helpless.
PSA.142.6	Help! They are chasing me,
PSA.142.6	and they are too strong.
PSA.142.7	Rescue me from this prison,
PSA.142.7	so I can praise your name.
PSA.142.7	And when your people notice
PSA.142.7	your wonderful kindness to me,
PSA.142.7	they will rush to my side.
PSA.143.1	Listen, 
PSA.143.1	You are faithful and honest
PSA.143.1	and will answer my prayer.
PSA.143.2	Don't try me in your court,
PSA.143.2	because no one is innocent
PSA.143.2	by your standards.
PSA.143.3	My enemies are chasing me,
PSA.143.3	crushing me in the ground.
PSA.143.3	I am in total darkness,
PSA.143.3	like someone long dead.
PSA.143.4	I have given up hope,
PSA.143.4	and I feel numb all over.
PSA.143.5	I remember to think about
PSA.143.5	the many things you did
PSA.143.5	in years gone by.
PSA.143.6	Then I lift my hands in prayer,
PSA.143.6	because my soul is a desert,
PSA.143.6	thirsty for water from you.
PSA.143.7	Please hurry, 
PSA.143.7	and answer my prayer.
PSA.143.7	I feel hopeless.
PSA.143.7	Don't turn away
PSA.143.7	and leave me here to die.
PSA.143.8	Each morning let me learn
PSA.143.8	more about your love
PSA.143.8	because I trust you.
PSA.143.8	I come to you in prayer,
PSA.143.8	asking for your guidance.
PSA.143.9	Please rescue me
PSA.143.9	from my enemies, 
PSA.143.9	I come to you for safety.
PSA.143.10	You are my God. Show me
PSA.143.10	what you want me to do,
PSA.143.10	and let your gentle Spirit
PSA.143.10	lead me in the right path.
PSA.143.11	Be true to your name, 
PSA.143.11	and keep my life safe.
PSA.143.11	Use your saving power
PSA.143.11	to protect me from trouble.
PSA.143.12	I am your servant.
PSA.143.12	Show how much you love me
PSA.143.12	by destroying my enemies.
PSA.144.1	I praise you, 
PSA.144.1	You are my mighty rock,
PSA.144.1	and you teach me
PSA.144.1	how to fight my battles.
PSA.144.2	You are my friend, my fortress,
PSA.144.2	where I am safe.
PSA.144.2	You are my shield,
PSA.144.2	and you made me the ruler
PSA.144.2	of our people.
PSA.144.3	to you, our 
PSA.144.3	Why do you care about us?
PSA.144.4	We disappear like a breath;
PSA.144.4	we last no longer
PSA.144.4	than a faint shadow.
PSA.144.5	Open the heavens like a curtain
PSA.144.5	and come down, 
PSA.144.5	Touch the mountains
PSA.144.5	and make them send up smoke.
PSA.144.6	Use your lightning as arrows
PSA.144.6	to scatter my enemies
PSA.144.6	and make them run away.
PSA.144.7	Reach down from heaven
PSA.144.7	and set me free.
PSA.144.7	Save me from the mighty flood
PSA.144.8	of those lying foreigners
PSA.144.8	who never tell the truth.
PSA.144.9	In praise of you, our God,
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song,
PSA.144.9	while playing my harp.
PSA.144.10	By your power, kings win wars,
PSA.144.10	and your servant David is saved
PSA.144.10	from deadly swords.
PSA.144.11	Won't you keep me safe
PSA.144.11	from those lying foreigners
PSA.144.11	who never tell the truth?
PSA.144.12	Let's pray that our young sons
PSA.144.12	will grow like strong plants
PSA.144.12	and that our daughters
PSA.144.12	will be as lovely as columns
PSA.144.12	in the corner of a palace.
PSA.144.13	May our barns be filled
PSA.144.13	with all kinds of crops.
PSA.144.13	May our fields be covered
PSA.144.13	with sheep by the thousands,
PSA.144.14	and every cow have calves.
PSA.144.14	Don't let our city be captured
PSA.144.14	or any of us be taken away,
PSA.144.14	and don't let cries of sorrow
PSA.144.14	be heard in our streets.
PSA.144.15	Our 
PSA.144.15	you give these blessings
PSA.144.15	to all who worship you.

PSA.145.3	and you deserve all praise,
PSA.145.3	because you are much greater
PSA.145.3	than anyone can understand.
PSA.145.4	Each generation will announce
PSA.145.4	to the next your wonderful
PSA.145.4	and powerful deeds.
PSA.145.5	I will keep thinking about
PSA.145.5	your marvelous glory
PSA.145.5	and your mighty miracles.
PSA.145.6	Everyone will talk about
PSA.145.6	your fearsome deeds,
PSA.145.6	and I will tell all nations
PSA.145.6	how great you are.

PRO.1.2	wisdom and self-control
PRO.1.2	and how to understand
PRO.1.2	sayings with deep meanings.
PRO.1.3	You will learn what is right
PRO.1.3	and honest and fair.
PRO.1.4	From these, an ordinary person
PRO.1.4	can learn to be smart,
PRO.1.4	and young people can gain
PRO.1.4	knowledge and good sense.
PRO.1.5	If you are already wise,
PRO.1.5	you will become even wiser.
PRO.1.5	And if you are smart,
PRO.1.5	you will learn to understand
PRO.1.6	proverbs and sayings,
PRO.1.6	as well as words of wisdom,
PRO.1.6	and all kinds of riddles.
PRO.1.7	This is the beginning
PRO.1.7	of knowledge.
PRO.1.7	Only a fool rejects wisdom
PRO.1.7	and good advice.
PRO.1.8	My child, obey the teachings
PRO.1.8	of your parents,
PRO.1.9	and wear their teachings
PRO.1.9	as you would a pretty hat
PRO.1.9	or a lovely necklace.
PRO.1.10	Don't be tempted by sinners
PRO.1.10	or listen 
PRO.1.11	when they say,
PRO.1.11	“Come on! Let's gang up
PRO.1.11	and kill somebody,
PRO.1.11	just for the fun of it!
PRO.1.12	They're well and healthy now,
PRO.1.12	but we'll finish them off
PRO.1.12	once and for all.
PRO.1.13	We'll take their valuables
PRO.1.13	and fill our homes
PRO.1.13	with stolen goods.
PRO.1.14	If you join our gang,
PRO.1.14	you'll get your share.”
PRO.1.15	Don't follow anyone like that
PRO.1.15	or do what they do.
PRO.1.16	They are in a big hurry
PRO.1.16	to commit some crime,
PRO.1.16	perhaps even murder.
PRO.1.17	They are like a bird
PRO.1.17	that sees the bait,
PRO.1.17	but ignores the trap.
PRO.1.18	They gang up to murder someone,
PRO.1.18	but they are the victims.
PRO.1.19	The wealth you get from crime
PRO.1.19	robs you of your life.
PRO.1.20	wherever crowds gather.
PRO.1.21	She shouts in the marketplaces
PRO.1.21	and near the city gates
PRO.1.21	as she says to the people,
PRO.1.22	“How much longer
PRO.1.22	will you enjoy
PRO.1.22	being stupid fools?
PRO.1.22	Won't you ever stop sneering
PRO.1.22	and laughing at knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Listen as I correct you
PRO.1.23	and tell you what I think.
PRO.1.24	You completely ignored me
PRO.1.24	and refused to listen;
PRO.1.25	you rejected my advice
PRO.1.25	and paid no attention
PRO.1.25	when I warned you.
PRO.1.26	“So when you are struck
PRO.1.26	by some terrible disaster,
PRO.1.27	or when trouble and distress
PRO.1.27	surround you like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	I will laugh and make fun.
PRO.1.28	You will ask for my help,
PRO.1.28	but I won't listen;
PRO.1.28	you will search,
PRO.1.28	but you won't find me.
PRO.1.29	No, you would not learn,
PRO.1.29	and you refused
PRO.1.29	to respect the 
PRO.1.30	You rejected my advice
PRO.1.30	and paid no attention
PRO.1.30	when I warned you.
PRO.1.31	“Now you will eat the fruit
PRO.1.31	of what you have done,
PRO.1.31	until you are stuffed full
PRO.1.31	with your own schemes.
PRO.1.32	Sin and self-satisfaction
PRO.1.32	bring destruction and death
PRO.1.32	to stupid fools.
PRO.1.33	But if you listen to me,
PRO.1.33	you will be safe and secure
PRO.1.33	without fear of disaster.”
PRO.2.1	My child, you must follow
PRO.2.1	and treasure my teachings
PRO.2.1	and my instructions.
PRO.2.2	Keep in tune with wisdom
PRO.2.2	and think what it means
PRO.2.2	to have common sense.
PRO.2.3	Beg as loud as you can
PRO.2.3	for good common sense.
PRO.2.4	Search for wisdom
PRO.2.4	as you would search for silver
PRO.2.4	or hidden treasure.
PRO.2.5	Then you will understand
PRO.2.5	what it means to respect
PRO.2.5	and to know the 
PRO.2.6	and so do common sense
PRO.2.6	and understanding.
PRO.2.7	God gives helpful advice
PRO.2.7	to everyone who obeys him
PRO.2.7	and protects those
PRO.2.7	who live as they should.
PRO.2.8	God sees that justice is done,
PRO.2.8	and he watches over everyone
PRO.2.8	who is faithful to him.
PRO.2.9	With wisdom you will learn
PRO.2.9	what is right
PRO.2.9	and honest and fair.
PRO.2.10	Wisdom will control your mind,
PRO.2.10	and you will be pleased
PRO.2.10	with knowledge.
PRO.2.11	Sound judgment and good sense
PRO.2.11	will watch over you.
PRO.2.12	Wisdom will protect you
PRO.2.12	from evil schemes
PRO.2.12	and from those liars
PRO.2.13	who turned from doing good
PRO.2.13	to live in the darkness.
PRO.2.14	Most of all they enjoy
PRO.2.14	being mean and deceitful.
PRO.2.15	They are dishonest themselves,
PRO.2.15	and so are all their deeds.
PRO.2.16	Wisdom will protect you
PRO.2.16	from the smooth talk
PRO.2.16	of a sinful woman,
PRO.2.17	who breaks her wedding vows
PRO.2.17	and leaves the man she married
PRO.2.17	when she was young.
PRO.2.18	The road to her house leads
PRO.2.18	down
PRO.2.18	to the dark world
PRO.2.18	of the dead.
PRO.2.19	Visit her, and you will never
PRO.2.19	find the road to life again.
PRO.2.20	Follow the example
PRO.2.20	of good people
PRO.2.20	and live an honest life.
PRO.2.21	If you are honest and innocent,
PRO.2.21	you will keep your land;
PRO.2.22	if you do wrong
PRO.2.22	and can never be trusted,
PRO.2.22	you will be rooted out.
PRO.3.1	My child, remember
PRO.3.1	my teachings and instructions
PRO.3.1	and obey them completely.
PRO.3.2	They will help you live
PRO.3.2	a long and prosperous life.
PRO.3.3	Let love and loyalty
PRO.3.3	always show like a necklace,
PRO.3.3	and write them in your mind.
PRO.3.4	and hold you in high esteem.
PRO.3.5	With all your heart
PRO.3.5	you must trust the 
PRO.3.5	and not your own judgment.
PRO.3.6	Always let him lead you,
PRO.3.6	and he will clear the road
PRO.3.6	for you to follow.
PRO.3.7	are wise enough,
PRO.3.7	but respect the 
PRO.3.7	and stay away from evil.
PRO.3.8	This will make you healthy,
PRO.3.8	and you will feel strong.
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	your money and the first part
PRO.3.9	of all your crops.
PRO.3.10	Then you will have
PRO.3.10	more grain and grapes
PRO.3.10	than you will ever need.
PRO.3.11	or become bitter
PRO.3.11	when the 
PRO.3.12	everyone he loves,
PRO.3.12	just as parents correct
PRO.3.12	a child they dearly love.
PRO.3.13	God blesses everyone
PRO.3.13	who has wisdom
PRO.3.13	and common sense.
PRO.3.14	Wisdom is worth more
PRO.3.14	than silver;
PRO.3.14	it makes you much richer
PRO.3.14	than gold.
PRO.3.15	Wisdom is more valuable
PRO.3.15	than precious jewels;
PRO.3.15	nothing you want
PRO.3.15	compares with her.
PRO.3.16	In her right hand
PRO.3.16	Wisdom holds a long life,
PRO.3.16	and in her left hand
PRO.3.16	are wealth and honor.
PRO.3.17	Wisdom makes life pleasant
PRO.3.17	and leads us safely along.
PRO.3.18	Wisdom is a life-giving tree,
PRO.3.18	the source of happiness
PRO.3.18	for all who hold on to her.
PRO.3.19	By his wisdom and knowledge
PRO.3.19	the 
PRO.3.19	heaven and earth.
PRO.3.20	By his understanding
PRO.3.20	he let the ocean break loose
PRO.3.20	and clouds release the rain.
PRO.3.21	My child, use common sense
PRO.3.21	and sound judgment!
PRO.3.21	Always keep them in mind.
PRO.3.22	They will help you to live
PRO.3.22	a long and beautiful life.
PRO.3.23	You will walk safely
PRO.3.23	and never stumble;
PRO.3.24	you will rest without a worry
PRO.3.24	and sleep soundly.
PRO.3.25	So don't be afraid
PRO.3.25	of sudden disasters
PRO.3.25	or storms that strike
PRO.3.25	those who are evil.
PRO.3.26	You can be sure that the 
PRO.3.26	will protect you from harm.
PRO.3.27	who deserves your help.
PRO.3.28	Don't tell your neighbor
PRO.3.28	to come back tomorrow,
PRO.3.28	if you can help today.
PRO.3.29	Don't try to be mean
PRO.3.29	to neighbors who trust you.
PRO.3.30	Don't argue just to be arguing,
PRO.3.30	when you haven't been hurt.
PRO.3.31	Don't be jealous
PRO.3.31	of cruel people
PRO.3.31	or follow their example.
PRO.3.32	The 
PRO.3.32	anyone who is dishonest,
PRO.3.32	but he lets good people
PRO.3.32	be his friends.
PRO.3.33	He places a curse on the home
PRO.3.33	of everyone who is evil,
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the home
PRO.3.33	of every good person.
PRO.3.34	who sneer at him,
PRO.3.34	but he is kind to everyone
PRO.3.34	who is humble.
PRO.3.35	You will be praised
PRO.3.35	if you are wise,
PRO.3.35	but you will be disgraced
PRO.3.35	if you are a stubborn fool.
PRO.4.1	My child, listen closely
PRO.4.1	to my teachings
PRO.4.1	and learn common sense.
PRO.4.2	My advice is useful,
PRO.4.2	so don't turn away.
PRO.4.3	When I was still very young
PRO.4.3	and my mother's favorite child,
PRO.4.3	my father 
PRO.4.4	said to me:
PRO.4.4	“If you follow my teachings
PRO.4.4	and keep them in mind,
PRO.4.4	you will live.
PRO.4.5	Be wise and learn good sense;
PRO.4.5	remember my teachings
PRO.4.5	and do what I say.
PRO.4.6	“If you love Wisdom
PRO.4.6	and don't reject her,
PRO.4.6	she will watch over you.
PRO.4.7	The best thing about Wisdom
PRO.4.7	is Wisdom herself;
PRO.4.7	good sense is more important
PRO.4.7	than anything else.
PRO.4.8	If you value Wisdom
PRO.4.8	and hold tightly to her,
PRO.4.8	great honors will be yours.
PRO.4.9	It will be like wearing
PRO.4.9	a glorious crown
PRO.4.9	of beautiful flowers.”
PRO.4.10	My child, if you listen
PRO.4.10	and obey my teachings,
PRO.4.10	you will live a long time.
PRO.4.11	I have shown you the way
PRO.4.11	that makes sense;
PRO.4.11	I have guided you
PRO.4.11	along the right path.
PRO.4.12	Your road won't be blocked,
PRO.4.12	and you won't stumble
PRO.4.12	when you run.
PRO.4.13	Hold firmly to my teaching
PRO.4.13	and never let go.
PRO.4.13	It will mean life for you.
PRO.4.14	Don't follow the bad example
PRO.4.14	of cruel and evil people.
PRO.4.15	Turn aside and keep going.
PRO.4.15	Stay away from them.
PRO.4.16	They can't sleep or rest
PRO.4.16	until they do wrong or harm
PRO.4.16	some innocent victim.
PRO.4.17	Their food and drink
PRO.4.17	are cruelty and wickedness.
PRO.4.18	The lifestyle of good people
PRO.4.18	is like sunlight at dawn
PRO.4.18	that keeps getting brighter
PRO.4.18	until broad daylight.
PRO.4.19	The lifestyle of the wicked
PRO.4.19	is like total darkness,
PRO.4.19	and they will never know
PRO.4.19	what makes them stumble.
PRO.4.20	My child, listen carefully
PRO.4.20	to everything I say.
PRO.4.21	Don't forget a single word,
PRO.4.21	but think about it all.
PRO.4.22	Knowing these teachings
PRO.4.22	will mean true life
PRO.4.22	and good health for you.
PRO.4.23	Carefully guard your thoughts
PRO.4.23	because they are the source
PRO.4.23	of true life.
PRO.4.24	Never tell lies or be deceitful
PRO.4.24	in what you say.
PRO.4.25	Keep looking straight ahead,
PRO.4.25	without turning aside.
PRO.4.26	and you will stay
PRO.4.26	on solid ground.
PRO.4.27	Don't make a mistake by turning
PRO.4.27	to the right or the left.
PRO.5.1	My son, if you listen closely
PRO.5.1	to my wisdom and good sense,
PRO.5.2	you will have sound judgment,
PRO.5.2	and you will always know
PRO.5.2	the right thing to say.
PRO.5.3	The words of an immoral woman
PRO.5.3	may be as sweet as honey
PRO.5.3	and as smooth as olive oil.
PRO.5.4	But all that you really get
PRO.5.4	from being with her
PRO.5.4	is bitter poison and pain.
PRO.5.5	If you follow her,
PRO.5.5	she will lead you down
PRO.5.5	to the world of the dead.
PRO.5.6	She has missed the path
PRO.5.6	that leads to life
PRO.5.6	and doesn't even know it.
PRO.5.7	My son, listen to me
PRO.5.7	and do everything I say.
PRO.5.8	Stay away from a bad woman!
PRO.5.8	Don't even go near the door
PRO.5.8	of her house.
PRO.5.9	You will lose your self-respect
PRO.5.9	and end up in debt
PRO.5.9	to some cruel person
PRO.5.9	for the rest of your life.
PRO.5.10	Strangers will get your money
PRO.5.10	and everything else
PRO.5.10	you have worked for.
PRO.5.11	When it's all over,
PRO.5.11	your body will waste away,
PRO.5.11	as you groan 
PRO.5.12	and shout,
PRO.5.12	“I hated advice and correction!
PRO.5.13	I paid no attention
PRO.5.13	to my teachers,
PRO.5.14	and now I am disgraced
PRO.5.14	in front of everyone.”
PRO.5.15	You should be faithful
PRO.5.15	to your wife,
PRO.5.15	just as you take water
PRO.5.15	from your own well.
PRO.5.16	And don't be like a stream
PRO.5.16	from which just any woman
PRO.5.16	may take a drink.
PRO.5.17	Save yourself for your wife
PRO.5.17	and don't have sex
PRO.5.17	with other women.
PRO.5.18	Be happy with the wife
PRO.5.18	you married
PRO.5.18	when you were young.
PRO.5.19	She is beautiful and graceful,
PRO.5.19	just like a deer;
PRO.5.19	you should be attracted to her
PRO.5.19	and stay deeply in love.
PRO.5.20	Don't go crazy over a woman
PRO.5.20	who is unfaithful
PRO.5.20	to her own husband!
PRO.5.21	The 
PRO.5.21	and he watches us closely.
PRO.5.22	Sinners are trapped and caught
PRO.5.22	by their own evil deeds.
PRO.5.23	They get lost and die
PRO.5.23	because of their foolishness
PRO.5.23	and lack of self-control.
PRO.6.1	to pay the debt of someone,
PRO.6.1	who cannot repay a loan.
PRO.6.2	Then you are trapped
PRO.6.2	by your own words,
PRO.6.3	and you are now in the power
PRO.6.3	of someone else.
PRO.6.3	Here is what you should do:
PRO.6.3	Go and beg for permission
PRO.6.3	to call off the agreement.
PRO.6.4	Do this before you fall asleep
PRO.6.4	or even get sleepy.
PRO.6.5	Save yourself, just as a deer
PRO.6.5	or a bird tries to escape
PRO.6.5	from a hunter.
PRO.6.6	You lazy people can learn
PRO.6.6	by watching an anthill.
PRO.6.7	Ants don't have leaders,
PRO.6.8	but they store up food
PRO.6.8	during harvest season.
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie there
PRO.6.9	doing nothing at all?
PRO.6.9	When are you going to get up
PRO.6.9	and stop sleeping?
PRO.6.10	Fold your hands
PRO.6.10	and twiddle your thumbs.
PRO.6.11	Suddenly, everything is gone,
PRO.6.11	as though it had been taken
PRO.6.11	by an armed robber.
PRO.6.12	Worthless liars go around
PRO.6.13	to deceive others.
PRO.6.14	They are always thinking up
PRO.6.14	something cruel and evil,
PRO.6.14	and they stir up trouble.
PRO.6.15	But they will be struck
PRO.6.15	by sudden disaster
PRO.6.15	and left without a hope.
PRO.6.16	There are six or seven
PRO.6.16	kinds of people
PRO.6.16	the 
PRO.6.17	Those who are too proud
PRO.6.17	or tell lies or murder,
PRO.6.18	those who make evil plans
PRO.6.18	or are quick to do wrong,
PRO.6.19	those who tell lies in court
PRO.6.19	or stir up trouble
PRO.6.19	in a family.
PRO.6.20	Obey the teaching
PRO.6.20	of your parents—
PRO.6.21	always keep it in mind
PRO.6.21	and never forget it.
PRO.6.22	Their teaching will guide you
PRO.6.22	when you walk,
PRO.6.22	protect you when you sleep,
PRO.6.22	and talk to you
PRO.6.22	when you are awake.
PRO.6.23	The Law of the Lord is a lamp,
PRO.6.23	and its teachings
PRO.6.23	shine brightly.
PRO.6.23	Correction and self-control
PRO.6.23	will lead you through life.
PRO.6.24	They will protect you
PRO.6.24	from the flattering words
PRO.6.24	of someone else's wife.
PRO.6.25	Don't let yourself be attracted
PRO.6.25	by the charm and lovely eyes
PRO.6.25	of someone like that.
PRO.6.26	A woman who sells her love
PRO.6.26	can be bought for as little
PRO.6.26	as the price of a meal.
PRO.6.26	But making love
PRO.6.26	to another man's wife
PRO.6.26	will cost you everything.
PRO.6.27	If you carry burning coals,
PRO.6.27	you burn your clothes;
PRO.6.28	if you step on hot coals,
PRO.6.28	you burn your feet.
PRO.6.29	And if you go to bed
PRO.6.29	with another man's wife,
PRO.6.29	you pay the price.
PRO.6.30	We don't put up with thieves,
PRO.6.30	not even
PRO.6.30	for something to eat.
PRO.6.31	And thieves who get caught
PRO.6.31	must pay back
PRO.6.31	seven times what was stolen
PRO.6.31	and lose everything.
PRO.6.32	But if you go to bed
PRO.6.32	with another man's wife,
PRO.6.32	you will destroy yourself
PRO.6.32	by your own stupidity.
PRO.6.33	You will be beaten
PRO.6.33	and forever disgraced,
PRO.6.34	because a jealous husband
PRO.6.34	can be furious and merciless
PRO.6.34	when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	He won't let you pay him off,
PRO.6.35	no matter what you offer.
PRO.7.1	My son, pay close attention
PRO.7.1	and don't forget
PRO.7.1	what I tell you to do.
PRO.7.2	Obey me, and you will live!
PRO.7.2	Let my instructions be
PRO.7.2	your greatest treasure.
PRO.7.3	Keep them at your fingertips
PRO.7.3	and write them
PRO.7.3	in your mind.
PRO.7.4	Let wisdom be your sister
PRO.7.4	and make common sense
PRO.7.4	your closest friend.
PRO.7.5	They will protect you
PRO.7.5	from the flattering words
PRO.7.5	of someone else's wife.
PRO.7.6	From the window of my house,
PRO.7.6	I once happened to see
PRO.7.7	some foolish young men.
PRO.7.8	It was late in the evening,
PRO.7.8	sometime after dark.
PRO.7.9	One of these young men
PRO.7.9	turned the corner
PRO.7.9	and was walking by the house
PRO.7.9	of an unfaithful wife.
PRO.7.10	She was dressed fancy
PRO.7.10	like a woman of the street
PRO.7.10	with only one thing in mind.
PRO.7.11	She was one of those women
PRO.7.11	who are loud and restless
PRO.7.11	and never stay at home,
PRO.7.12	who walk street after street,
PRO.7.12	waiting to trap a man.
PRO.7.13	She grabbed him and kissed him,
PRO.7.13	and with no sense of shame,
PRO.7.13	she said:
PRO.7.14	“I had to offer a sacrifice,
PRO.7.14	and there is enough meat
PRO.7.14	left over for a feast.
PRO.7.15	So I came looking for you,
PRO.7.15	and here you are!
PRO.7.16	The sheets on my bed
PRO.7.16	are bright-colored cloth
PRO.7.16	from Egypt.
PRO.7.17	And I have covered it
PRO.7.17	with perfume made of myrrh,
PRO.7.17	aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	“Let's go there
PRO.7.18	and make love all night.
PRO.7.19	My husband is traveling,
PRO.7.19	and he's far away.
PRO.7.20	He took a lot of money along,
PRO.7.20	and he won't be back home
PRO.7.20	before the middle
PRO.7.20	of the month.”
PRO.7.21	And so, she tricked him
PRO.7.21	with all of her sweet talk
PRO.7.21	and her flattery.
PRO.7.22	At once he followed her
PRO.7.22	like an ox on the way
PRO.7.22	to be slaughtered,
PRO.7.22	or like a fool on the way
PRO.7.22	to be punished
PRO.7.23	and killed with arrows.
PRO.7.23	He was no more than a bird
PRO.7.23	rushing into a trap,
PRO.7.23	without knowing
PRO.7.23	it would cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	My son, pay close attention
PRO.7.24	to what I have said.
PRO.7.25	Don't even think about
PRO.7.25	that kind of woman
PRO.7.25	or let yourself be misled
PRO.7.25	by someone like her.
PRO.7.26	Such a woman has caused
PRO.7.26	the downfall and destruction
PRO.7.26	of a lot of men.
PRO.7.27	Her house is a one-way street
PRO.7.27	leading straight down
PRO.7.27	to the world of the dead.
PRO.8.1	Wisdom
PRO.8.2	as she stands at the crossroads
PRO.8.2	and on every hill.
PRO.8.3	She stands by the city gate
PRO.8.3	where everyone enters the city,
PRO.8.3	and she shouts:
PRO.8.4	“I am calling out
PRO.8.4	to each one of you!
PRO.8.5	Good sense and sound judgment
PRO.8.5	can be yours.
PRO.8.6	Listen, because what I say
PRO.8.6	is worthwhile and right.
PRO.8.7	I always speak the truth
PRO.8.7	and refuse to tell a lie.
PRO.8.8	Every word I speak is honest,
PRO.8.8	not one is misleading
PRO.8.8	or deceptive.
PRO.8.9	“If you have understanding,
PRO.8.9	you will see that my words
PRO.8.9	are just what you need.
PRO.8.10	Let instruction and knowledge
PRO.8.10	mean more to you than silver
PRO.8.10	or the finest gold.
PRO.8.11	than precious jewels
PRO.8.11	or anything else you desire.”
PRO.8.12	I am Wisdom
PRO.8.12	is my closest friend;
PRO.8.12	I possess knowledge
PRO.8.12	and sound judgment.
PRO.8.13	If you respect the 
PRO.8.13	you will hate evil.
PRO.8.13	I hate pride and conceit
PRO.8.13	and deceitful lies.
PRO.8.14	I am strong, and I offer
PRO.8.14	sensible advice
PRO.8.14	and sound judgment.
PRO.8.15	By my power kings govern,
PRO.8.15	and rulers make laws
PRO.8.15	that are fair.
PRO.8.16	Every honest leader rules
PRO.8.16	with help from me.
PRO.8.17	I love everyone who loves me,
PRO.8.17	and I will be found by all
PRO.8.17	who honestly search.
PRO.8.18	I can make you rich and famous,
PRO.8.18	important and successful.
PRO.8.19	What you receive from me
PRO.8.19	is more valuable
PRO.8.19	than even the finest gold
PRO.8.19	or the purest silver.
PRO.8.20	I always do what is right,
PRO.8.21	and I give great riches
PRO.8.21	to everyone who loves me.
PRO.8.22	I was with the 
PRO.8.22	I was there before he began
PRO.8.23	to create the earth.
PRO.8.23	At the very first,
PRO.8.23	the 
PRO.8.24	When I was born,
PRO.8.24	there were no oceans
PRO.8.24	or springs of water.
PRO.8.25	My birth was before
PRO.8.25	mountains were formed
PRO.8.25	or hills were put in place.
PRO.8.26	It happened long before God
PRO.8.26	had made the earth
PRO.8.26	or any of its fields
PRO.8.26	or even the dust.
PRO.8.27	put the heavens in place
PRO.8.27	and stretched the sky
PRO.8.27	over the surface of the sea.
PRO.8.28	I was with him when he placed
PRO.8.28	the clouds in the sky
PRO.8.28	and created the springs
PRO.8.28	that fill the ocean.
PRO.8.29	I was there when he set
PRO.8.29	boundaries for the sea
PRO.8.29	to make it obey him,
PRO.8.29	and when he laid foundations
PRO.8.29	to support the earth.
PRO.8.30	I was right beside the 
PRO.8.30	helping him plan and build.
PRO.8.30	I made him happy each day,
PRO.8.30	and I was happy at his side.
PRO.8.31	I was pleased with his world
PRO.8.31	and pleased with its people.
PRO.8.32	Follow my advice,
PRO.8.32	and you will be happy.
PRO.8.33	Listen carefully
PRO.8.33	to my instructions,
PRO.8.33	and you will be wise.
PRO.8.34	Come to my home each day
PRO.8.34	and listen to me.
PRO.8.34	You will find happiness.
PRO.8.35	By finding me, you find life,
PRO.8.35	and the 
PRO.8.35	with you.
PRO.8.36	But if you don't find me,
PRO.8.36	you hurt only yourself,
PRO.8.36	and if you hate me,
PRO.8.36	you are in love with death.
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house
PRO.9.1	with its seven columns.
PRO.9.2	She has prepared the meat
PRO.9.2	and set out the wine.
PRO.9.2	Her feast is ready.
PRO.9.3	She has sent her servant women
PRO.9.3	to announce her invitation
PRO.9.3	from the highest hills:
PRO.9.4	“Everyone who is ignorant
PRO.9.4	or foolish is invited!
PRO.9.5	All of you are welcome
PRO.9.5	to my meat and wine.
PRO.9.6	If you want to live,
PRO.9.6	give up your foolishness
PRO.9.6	and let understanding
PRO.9.6	guide your steps.”
PRO.9.7	Correct a worthless bragger,
PRO.9.7	and all you will get
PRO.9.7	are insults and injuries.
PRO.9.8	Any bragger you correct
PRO.9.8	will only hate you.
PRO.9.8	But if you correct someone
PRO.9.8	who has common sense,
PRO.9.8	you will be loved.
PRO.9.9	If you have good sense,
PRO.9.9	instruction will help you
PRO.9.9	to have even better sense.
PRO.9.9	And if you live right,
PRO.9.9	education will help you
PRO.9.9	to know even more.
PRO.9.10	This is the beginning
PRO.9.10	of wisdom.
PRO.9.10	To have understanding,
PRO.9.10	you must know the Holy God.
PRO.9.11	I am Wisdom. If you follow me,
PRO.9.11	you will live a long time.
PRO.9.12	Good sense is good for you,
PRO.9.12	but if you brag,
PRO.9.12	you hurt yourself.
PRO.9.13	Stupidity
PRO.9.13	senseless, and foolish.
PRO.9.14	She sits in front of her house
PRO.9.14	and on the highest hills
PRO.9.14	in the town.
PRO.9.15	She shouts to everyone
PRO.9.15	who passes by,
PRO.9.16	“If you are stupid,
PRO.9.16	come on inside!”
PRO.9.16	And to every fool she says,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water tastes best,
PRO.9.17	and the food you eat in secret
PRO.9.17	tastes best of all.”
PRO.9.18	None who listen to Stupidity
PRO.9.18	understand that her guests
PRO.9.18	are as good as dead.
PRO.10.1	Here are some proverbs
PRO.10.1	of Solomon:
PRO.10.1	Children with good sense
PRO.10.1	make their parents happy,
PRO.10.1	but foolish children
PRO.10.1	make them sad.
PRO.10.2	What you gain by doing evil
PRO.10.2	won't help you at all.
PRO.10.2	Obeying God is the only way
PRO.10.2	to be saved from death.
PRO.10.3	If you obey the 
PRO.10.3	you won't go hungry;
PRO.10.3	if you are wicked,
PRO.10.3	God won't let you have
PRO.10.3	what you want.
PRO.10.4	Laziness leads to poverty;
PRO.10.4	hard work makes you rich.
PRO.10.5	At harvest season
PRO.10.5	it's smart to work hard,
PRO.10.5	but stupid to sleep.
PRO.10.6	Everyone praises good people,
PRO.10.6	but evil hides behind
PRO.10.6	the words of the wicked.
PRO.10.7	Good people are remembered
PRO.10.7	long after they are gone,
PRO.10.7	but the wicked
PRO.10.7	are soon forgotten.
PRO.10.8	If you have good sense,
PRO.10.8	you will listen and obey;
PRO.10.8	if all you do is talk foolishly,
PRO.10.8	you will destroy yourself.
PRO.10.9	You will be safe,
PRO.10.9	if you always do right,
PRO.10.9	but you will get caught,
PRO.10.9	if you are dishonest.
PRO.10.10	Deceit causes trouble,
PRO.10.10	and foolish talk
PRO.10.10	will bring you to ruin.
PRO.10.11	The words of good people
PRO.10.11	are a source of life,
PRO.10.11	but evil hides behind
PRO.10.11	the words of the wicked.
PRO.10.12	love overlooks the wrongs
PRO.10.12	that others do.
PRO.10.13	If you have good sense,
PRO.10.13	it will show when you speak.
PRO.10.13	But if you are stupid,
PRO.10.13	you will be beaten
PRO.10.13	with a stick.
PRO.10.14	If you have good sense,
PRO.10.14	you will learn all you can,
PRO.10.14	but foolish talk
PRO.10.14	will soon destroy you.
PRO.10.15	Great wealth can be a fortress,
PRO.10.15	but poverty
PRO.10.15	is no protection at all.
PRO.10.16	If you live right,
PRO.10.16	the reward is a good life;
PRO.10.16	if you are evil,
PRO.10.16	all you have is sin.
PRO.10.17	Accept correction,
PRO.10.17	and you will find life;
PRO.10.17	reject correction,
PRO.10.17	and you will miss the road.
PRO.10.18	You can hide your hatred
PRO.10.18	by telling lies,
PRO.10.18	but you are a fool
PRO.10.18	to spread lies.
PRO.10.19	You will say the wrong thing
PRO.10.19	if you talk too much—
PRO.10.19	so be sensible and watch
PRO.10.19	what you say.
PRO.10.20	The words of a good person
PRO.10.20	are like pure silver,
PRO.10.20	but the thoughts
PRO.10.20	of an evil person
PRO.10.20	are almost worthless.
PRO.10.21	Many are helped
PRO.10.21	by useful instruction,
PRO.10.21	but fools are killed
PRO.10.21	by their own stupidity.
PRO.10.22	When the 
PRO.10.22	with riches,
PRO.10.22	you have nothing to regret.
PRO.10.23	Fools enjoy doing wrong,
PRO.10.23	but anyone with good sense
PRO.10.23	enjoys acting wisely.
PRO.10.24	What evil people dread most
PRO.10.24	will happen to them,
PRO.10.24	but good people will get
PRO.10.24	what they want most.
PRO.10.25	Those crooks will disappear
PRO.10.25	when a storm strikes,
PRO.10.25	but God will keep safe
PRO.10.25	all who obey him.
PRO.10.26	Having a lazy person on the job
PRO.10.26	is like a mouth full of vinegar
PRO.10.26	or smoke in your eyes.
PRO.10.27	If you respect the 
PRO.10.27	you will live longer;
PRO.10.27	if you keep doing wrong,
PRO.10.27	your life will be cut short.
PRO.10.28	If you obey the Lord,
PRO.10.28	you will be happy,
PRO.10.28	but there is no future
PRO.10.28	for the wicked.
PRO.10.29	The 
PRO.10.29	who lives right,
PRO.10.29	but he destroys anyone
PRO.10.29	who does wrong.
PRO.10.30	Good people will stand firm,
PRO.10.30	but the wicked will disappear
PRO.10.30	from the land.
PRO.10.31	Honest people speak sensibly,
PRO.10.31	but deceitful liars
PRO.10.31	will be silenced.
PRO.10.32	If you obey the Lord,
PRO.10.32	you will always know
PRO.10.32	the right thing to say.
PRO.10.32	But no one will trust you
PRO.10.32	if you tell lies.
PRO.11.1	The 
PRO.11.1	who cheats,
PRO.11.1	but he likes everyone
PRO.11.1	who is honest.
PRO.11.2	Too much pride
PRO.11.2	can put you to shame.
PRO.11.2	It's wiser to be humble.
PRO.11.3	If you do the right thing,
PRO.11.3	honesty will be your guide.
PRO.11.3	But if you are crooked,
PRO.11.3	you will be trapped
PRO.11.3	by your own dishonesty.
PRO.11.4	When God is angry,
PRO.11.4	money won't help you.
PRO.11.4	Obeying God is the only way
PRO.11.4	to be saved from death.
PRO.11.5	If you are truly good,
PRO.11.5	you will do right;
PRO.11.5	if you are wicked,
PRO.11.5	you will be destroyed
PRO.11.5	by your own sin.
PRO.11.6	Honesty can keep you safe,
PRO.11.6	but if you can't be trusted,
PRO.11.6	you trap yourself.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked die,
PRO.11.7	their hopes die with them.
PRO.11.8	Trouble goes right past
PRO.11.8	the 
PRO.11.8	and strikes the wicked.
PRO.11.9	Dishonest people use gossip
PRO.11.9	to destroy their neighbors;
PRO.11.9	good people are protected
PRO.11.9	by their own good sense.
PRO.11.10	When honest people prosper
PRO.11.10	and the wicked disappear,
PRO.11.10	the whole city celebrates.
PRO.11.11	Good people bring prosperity
PRO.11.11	to their city,
PRO.11.11	but deceitful liars
PRO.11.11	can destroy a city.
PRO.11.12	It's stupid to say bad things
PRO.11.12	about your neighbors.
PRO.11.12	If you are sensible,
PRO.11.12	you will keep quiet.
PRO.11.13	A gossip tells everything,
PRO.11.13	but a true friend
PRO.11.13	will keep a secret.
PRO.11.14	will end up in ruin;
PRO.11.14	a city with many wise leaders
PRO.11.14	will be kept safe.
PRO.11.15	It's a dangerous thing
PRO.11.15	to guarantee payment
PRO.11.15	for someone's debts.
PRO.11.15	Don't do it!
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman
PRO.11.16	will be respected,
PRO.11.16	but a ruthless man
PRO.11.16	will only get rich.
PRO.11.17	Kindness is rewarded—
PRO.11.17	but if you are cruel,
PRO.11.17	you hurt yourself.
PRO.11.18	Meanness gets you nowhere,
PRO.11.18	but goodness is rewarded.
PRO.11.19	Always do the right thing,
PRO.11.19	and you will live;
PRO.11.19	keep on doing wrong,
PRO.11.19	and you will die.
PRO.11.20	The 
PRO.11.20	but he likes everyone
PRO.11.20	who lives right.
PRO.11.21	You can be sure of this:
PRO.11.21	All crooks will be punished,
PRO.11.21	but God's people won't.
PRO.11.22	A beautiful woman
PRO.11.22	who acts foolishly
PRO.11.22	is like a gold ring
PRO.11.22	on the snout of a pig.
PRO.11.23	Good people want what is best,
PRO.11.23	but troublemakers
PRO.11.23	hope to stir up trouble.
PRO.11.24	Sometimes you can become rich
PRO.11.24	by being generous
PRO.11.24	or poor by being greedy.
PRO.11.25	Generosity will be rewarded:
PRO.11.25	Give a cup of water,
PRO.11.25	and you will receive
PRO.11.25	a cup of water in return.
PRO.11.26	Charge too much for grain,
PRO.11.26	and you will be cursed;
PRO.11.26	sell it at a fair price,
PRO.11.26	and you will be praised.
PRO.11.27	Try hard to do right,
PRO.11.27	and you will win friends;
PRO.11.27	go looking for trouble,
PRO.11.27	and you will find it.
PRO.11.28	Trust in your wealth,
PRO.11.28	and you will be a failure,
PRO.11.28	but God's people will prosper
PRO.11.28	like healthy plants.
PRO.11.29	Fools who cause trouble
PRO.11.29	in the family
PRO.11.29	won't inherit a thing.
PRO.11.29	They will end up as slaves
PRO.11.29	of someone with good sense.
PRO.11.30	Live right, and you will eat
PRO.11.30	from the life-giving tree.
PRO.11.30	And if you act wisely,
PRO.11.30	others will follow.
PRO.11.31	here on this earth,
PRO.11.31	all who are cruel and mean
PRO.11.31	will surely be punished.
PRO.12.1	to reject it is stupid.
PRO.12.2	The 
PRO.12.2	who lives right,
PRO.12.2	but he punishes everyone
PRO.12.2	who makes evil plans.
PRO.12.3	Sin cannot offer security!
PRO.12.3	But if you live right,
PRO.12.3	you will be as secure
PRO.12.3	as a tree with deep roots.
PRO.12.4	A helpful wife is a jewel
PRO.12.4	for her husband,
PRO.12.4	but a shameless wife
PRO.12.4	will make his bones rot.
PRO.12.5	Good people have kind thoughts,
PRO.12.5	but you should never trust
PRO.12.5	the advice of someone evil.
PRO.12.6	Bad advice is a deadly trap,
PRO.12.6	but good advice
PRO.12.6	is like a shield.
PRO.12.7	Once the wicked are defeated,
PRO.12.7	they are gone forever,
PRO.12.7	but no one who obeys God
PRO.12.7	will ever be thrown down.
PRO.12.8	Good sense is worthy of praise,
PRO.12.8	but stupidity is a curse.
PRO.12.9	It's better to be ordinary
PRO.12.9	and have only one servant
PRO.12.9	than to think you are somebody
PRO.12.9	and starve to death.
PRO.12.10	Good people are kind
PRO.12.10	to their animals,
PRO.12.10	but a mean person is cruel.
PRO.12.11	Hard working farmers have more
PRO.12.11	than enough food;
PRO.12.11	daydreamers are nothing more
PRO.12.11	than stupid fools.
PRO.12.12	An evil person tries to hide
PRO.12.12	behind evil;
PRO.12.12	good people are like trees
PRO.12.12	with deep roots.
PRO.12.13	We trap ourselves
PRO.12.13	by telling lies,
PRO.12.13	but we stay out of trouble
PRO.12.13	by living right.
PRO.12.14	We are rewarded or punished
PRO.12.14	for what we say and do.
PRO.12.15	Fools think they know
PRO.12.15	what is best,
PRO.12.15	but a sensible person
PRO.12.15	listens to advice.
PRO.12.16	Losing your temper is foolish;
PRO.12.16	ignoring an insult is smart.
PRO.12.17	An honest person
PRO.12.17	tells the truth in court,
PRO.12.17	but a dishonest person
PRO.12.17	tells nothing but lies.
PRO.12.18	Sharp words cut like a sword,
PRO.12.18	but words of wisdom heal.
PRO.12.19	Truth will last forever;
PRO.12.19	lies are soon found out.
PRO.12.20	An evil mind is deceitful,
PRO.12.20	but gentle thoughts
PRO.12.20	bring happiness.
PRO.12.21	Good people never have trouble,
PRO.12.21	but troublemakers
PRO.12.21	have more than enough.
PRO.12.22	The 
PRO.12.22	but he is the friend of all
PRO.12.22	who can be trusted.
PRO.12.23	Be sensible and don't tell
PRO.12.23	everything you know—
PRO.12.23	only fools spread
PRO.12.23	foolishness everywhere.
PRO.12.24	Work hard, and you
PRO.12.24	will be a leader;
PRO.12.24	be lazy, and you
PRO.12.24	will end up a slave.
PRO.12.25	Worry is a heavy burden,
PRO.12.25	but a kind word
PRO.12.25	always brings cheer.
PRO.12.26	You are better off to do right,
PRO.12.26	than to lose your way
PRO.12.26	by doing wrong.
PRO.12.27	Anyone too lazy to cook
PRO.12.27	will starve,
PRO.12.27	but a hard worker
PRO.12.27	is a valuable treasure.
PRO.12.28	Living right is a pathway
PRO.12.28	that leads to life
PRO.12.28	and away from death.
PRO.13.1	Children with good sense
PRO.13.1	accept correction
PRO.13.1	from their parents,
PRO.13.1	but stubborn children
PRO.13.1	ignore it completely.
PRO.13.2	You will be well rewarded
PRO.13.2	for saying something kind,
PRO.13.2	but all some people think about
PRO.13.2	is how to be cruel and mean.
PRO.13.3	and you will be safe;
PRO.13.3	talk too much,
PRO.13.3	and you are done for.
PRO.13.4	No matter how much you want,
PRO.13.4	laziness won't help a bit,
PRO.13.4	but hard work will reward you
PRO.13.4	with more than enough.
PRO.13.5	A good person hates deceit,
PRO.13.5	but those who are evil
PRO.13.5	cause shame and disgrace.
PRO.13.6	Live right, and you are safe!
PRO.13.6	But sin will destroy you.
PRO.13.7	Some who have nothing
PRO.13.7	may pretend to be rich,
PRO.13.7	and some who have everything
PRO.13.7	may pretend to be poor.
PRO.13.8	The rich may have
PRO.13.8	to pay a ransom,
PRO.13.8	but the poor don't have
PRO.13.8	that problem.
PRO.13.9	The lamp of a good person
PRO.13.9	keeps on shining;
PRO.13.9	the lamp of an evil person
PRO.13.9	soon goes out.
PRO.13.10	Too much pride causes trouble.
PRO.13.10	Be sensible and take advice.
PRO.13.11	Money wrongly
PRO.13.11	will disappear bit by bit;
PRO.13.11	money earned little by little
PRO.13.11	will grow and grow.
PRO.13.12	Not getting what you want
PRO.13.12	can break your heart,
PRO.13.12	but a wish that comes true
PRO.13.12	is a life-giving tree.
PRO.13.13	If you reject God's teaching,
PRO.13.13	you will pay the price;
PRO.13.13	if you obey his commands,
PRO.13.13	you will be rewarded.
PRO.13.14	Sensible instruction
PRO.13.14	is a life-giving fountain
PRO.13.14	that helps you escape
PRO.13.14	all deadly traps.
PRO.13.15	Sound judgment is praised,
PRO.13.15	but people without good sense
PRO.13.15	are on the way to disaster.
PRO.13.16	If you have good sense,
PRO.13.16	you will act sensibly,
PRO.13.16	but fools act like fools.
PRO.13.17	Whoever delivers your message
PRO.13.17	can make things better
PRO.13.17	or worse for you.
PRO.13.18	All who refuse correction
PRO.13.18	will be poor and disgraced;
PRO.13.18	all who accept correction
PRO.13.18	will be praised.
PRO.13.19	It's a good feeling
PRO.13.19	to get what you want,
PRO.13.19	but only a stupid fool
PRO.13.19	hates to turn from evil.
PRO.13.20	but you hurt yourself
PRO.13.20	by going around with fools.
PRO.13.21	You are in for trouble
PRO.13.21	if you sin,
PRO.13.21	but you will be rewarded
PRO.13.21	if you live right.
PRO.13.22	If you obey God,
PRO.13.22	you will have something
PRO.13.22	to leave your grandchildren.
PRO.13.22	If you don't obey God,
PRO.13.22	those who live right
PRO.13.22	will get what you leave.
PRO.13.23	Even when the land of the poor
PRO.13.23	produces good crops,
PRO.13.23	they get cheated
PRO.13.23	out of what they grow.
PRO.13.24	If you love your children,
PRO.13.24	you will correct them;
PRO.13.24	if you don't love them,
PRO.13.24	you won't correct them.
PRO.13.25	If you live right,
PRO.13.25	you will have plenty to eat;
PRO.13.25	if you don't live right,
PRO.13.25	you will go away empty.
PRO.14.1	A woman's family
PRO.14.1	is held together
PRO.14.1	by her wisdom,
PRO.14.1	but it can be destroyed
PRO.14.1	by her foolishness.
PRO.14.2	By living right, you show
PRO.14.2	that you respect the 
PRO.14.2	by being deceitful, you show
PRO.14.2	that you despise him.
PRO.14.3	Proud fools are punished
PRO.14.3	for their stupid talk,
PRO.14.3	but sensible talk
PRO.14.3	can save your life.
PRO.14.4	Without the help of an ox
PRO.14.4	there can be no crop,
PRO.14.4	but with a strong ox
PRO.14.4	a big crop is possible.
PRO.14.5	An honest witness
PRO.14.5	tells the truth;
PRO.14.5	a dishonest witness
PRO.14.5	tells nothing but lies.
PRO.14.6	Make fun of wisdom,
PRO.14.6	and you will never find it.
PRO.14.6	But if you have understanding,
PRO.14.6	knowledge comes easily.
PRO.14.7	Stay away from fools,
PRO.14.7	or you won't learn a thing.
PRO.14.8	Wise people have enough sense
PRO.14.8	to find their way,
PRO.14.8	but stupid fools get lost.
PRO.14.9	Fools don't care
PRO.14.9	if they are wrong,
PRO.14.9	but God is pleased
PRO.14.9	when people do right.
PRO.14.10	No one else can really know
PRO.14.10	how sad or happy you are.
PRO.14.11	The tent of a good person
PRO.14.11	stands longer than the house
PRO.14.11	of someone evil.
PRO.14.12	on the right road
PRO.14.12	and still end up dead.
PRO.14.13	Sorrow may hide
PRO.14.13	behind laughter,
PRO.14.13	and happiness may end
PRO.14.13	in sorrow.
PRO.14.14	You harvest what you plant,
PRO.14.14	whether good or bad.
PRO.14.15	Don't be stupid
PRO.14.15	and believe all you hear;
PRO.14.15	be smart and know
PRO.14.15	where you are headed.
PRO.14.16	Only a stupid fool
PRO.14.16	is never cautious—
PRO.14.16	so be extra careful
PRO.14.16	and stay out of trouble.
PRO.14.17	Fools have quick tempers,
PRO.14.17	and no one likes you
PRO.14.17	if you can't be trusted.
PRO.14.18	Stupidity leads to foolishness;
PRO.14.18	be smart and learn.
PRO.14.19	The wicked will come crawling
PRO.14.19	to those who obey God.
PRO.14.20	You have no friends
PRO.14.20	if you are poor,
PRO.14.20	but you have lots of friends
PRO.14.20	if you are rich.
PRO.14.21	It's wrong to hate others,
PRO.14.21	but God blesses everyone
PRO.14.21	who is kind to the poor.
PRO.14.22	It's a mistake
PRO.14.22	to make evil plans,
PRO.14.22	but you will have loyal friends
PRO.14.22	if you want to do right.
PRO.14.23	Hard work is worthwhile,
PRO.14.23	but empty talk
PRO.14.23	will make you poor.
PRO.14.24	Wisdom can make you rich,
PRO.14.24	but foolishness leads
PRO.14.24	to more foolishness.
PRO.14.25	An honest witness
PRO.14.25	can save your life,
PRO.14.25	but liars can't be trusted.
PRO.14.26	If you respect the 
PRO.14.26	you and your children
PRO.14.26	have a strong fortress
PRO.14.27	and a life-giving fountain
PRO.14.27	that keeps you safe
PRO.14.27	from deadly traps.
PRO.14.28	Rulers of powerful nations
PRO.14.28	are held in honor;
PRO.14.28	rulers of weak nations
PRO.14.28	are nothing at all.
PRO.14.29	It's smart to be patient,
PRO.14.29	but it's stupid
PRO.14.29	to lose your temper.
PRO.14.30	It's healthy to be content,
PRO.14.30	but envy can eat you up.
PRO.14.31	If you mistreat the poor,
PRO.14.31	you insult your Creator;
PRO.14.31	if you are kind to them,
PRO.14.31	you show him respect.
PRO.14.32	In times of trouble
PRO.14.32	the wicked are destroyed,
PRO.14.32	but even at death
PRO.14.32	the innocent have faith.
PRO.14.33	Wisdom is found in the minds
PRO.14.33	of people with good sense,
PRO.14.33	but fools don't know it.
PRO.14.34	Doing right brings honor
PRO.14.34	to a nation,
PRO.14.34	but sin brings disgrace.
PRO.14.35	Kings reward servants
PRO.14.35	who act wisely,
PRO.14.35	but they punish those
PRO.14.35	who act foolishly.
PRO.15.1	A kind answer
PRO.15.1	soothes angry feelings,
PRO.15.1	but harsh words
PRO.15.1	stir them up.
PRO.15.2	Words of wisdom
PRO.15.2	come from the wise,
PRO.15.2	but fools speak foolishness.
PRO.15.3	The 
PRO.15.3	whether good or bad.
PRO.15.4	Kind words are good medicine,
PRO.15.4	but deceitful words
PRO.15.4	can really hurt.
PRO.15.5	Don't be a fool
PRO.15.5	and disobey your parents.
PRO.15.5	Be smart! Accept correction.
PRO.15.6	Good people become wealthy,
PRO.15.6	but those who are evil
PRO.15.6	will lose what they have.
PRO.15.7	Words of wisdom
PRO.15.7	make good sense;
PRO.15.7	the thoughts of a fool
PRO.15.7	make no sense at all.

PRO.15.9	but he loves everyone
PRO.15.9	who does right.
PRO.15.10	If you turn from the right way,
PRO.15.10	you will be punished;
PRO.15.10	if you refuse correction,
PRO.15.10	you will die.
PRO.15.11	If the 
PRO.15.11	in the world of the dead,
PRO.15.11	he can see in our hearts.
PRO.15.12	Those who sneer at others
PRO.15.12	don't like to be corrected,
PRO.15.12	and they won't ask help
PRO.15.12	from someone with sense.
PRO.15.13	Happiness makes you smile;
PRO.15.13	sorrow can crush you.
PRO.15.14	Anyone with good sense
PRO.15.14	is eager to learn more,
PRO.15.14	but fools are hungry
PRO.15.14	for foolishness.
PRO.15.15	The poor have a hard life,
PRO.15.15	but being content is as good
PRO.15.15	as an endless feast.
PRO.15.16	It's better to obey the 
PRO.15.16	and have only a little,
PRO.15.16	than to be very rich
PRO.15.16	and terribly anxious.
PRO.15.17	A simple meal with love
PRO.15.17	is better than a feast
PRO.15.17	where there is hatred.
PRO.15.18	Losing your temper
PRO.15.18	causes a lot of trouble,
PRO.15.18	but staying calm
PRO.15.18	settles arguments.
PRO.15.19	A lazy person refuses
PRO.15.19	to clear a thorny path,
PRO.15.19	but everyone who does right
PRO.15.19	walks on a smooth road.
PRO.15.20	Children with good sense
PRO.15.20	make their parents happy,
PRO.15.20	but foolish children
PRO.15.20	despise them.
PRO.15.21	Stupidity brings happiness
PRO.15.21	to senseless fools,
PRO.15.21	but everyone with good sense
PRO.15.21	follows the straight path.
PRO.15.22	Without good advice
PRO.15.22	everything goes wrong—
PRO.15.22	it takes careful planning
PRO.15.22	for things to go right.
PRO.15.23	Giving the right answer
PRO.15.23	at the right time
PRO.15.23	makes everyone happy.
PRO.15.24	All who are wise follow a road
PRO.15.24	that leads upward to life
PRO.15.24	and away from death.

PRO.15.25	of those who are proud,
PRO.15.25	but he protects the property
PRO.15.25	of widows.
PRO.15.26	The 
PRO.15.26	but kind words please him.
PRO.15.27	Being greedy causes trouble
PRO.15.27	for your family,
PRO.15.27	but you protect yourself
PRO.15.27	by refusing bribes.
PRO.15.28	Good people think
PRO.15.28	before they answer,
PRO.15.28	but the wicked speak evil
PRO.15.28	without ever thinking.
PRO.15.29	The 
PRO.15.29	the prayers of the wicked,
PRO.15.29	but he answers the prayers
PRO.15.29	of all who obey him.
PRO.15.30	A friendly smile
PRO.15.30	makes you happy,
PRO.15.30	and good news
PRO.15.30	makes you feel strong.
PRO.15.31	Healthy correction is good,
PRO.15.31	and if you accept it,
PRO.15.31	you will be wise.
PRO.15.32	You hurt only yourself
PRO.15.32	by rejecting instruction,
PRO.15.32	but it makes good sense
PRO.15.32	to accept it.
PRO.15.33	Showing respect to the 
PRO.15.33	will make you wise,
PRO.15.33	and being humble
PRO.15.33	will bring honor to you.
PRO.16.1	We humans make plans,
PRO.16.1	but the 
PRO.16.1	has the final word.
PRO.16.2	We may think we know
PRO.16.2	what is right,
PRO.16.2	but the 
PRO.16.2	of our motives.
PRO.16.3	Share your plans with the 
PRO.16.3	and you will succeed.
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.4	for everything he does,
PRO.16.4	and he lets evil people live
PRO.16.4	only to be punished.
PRO.16.5	The 
PRO.16.5	anyone who is conceited—
PRO.16.5	you can be sure
PRO.16.5	they will be punished.
PRO.16.6	our sins will be forgiven;
PRO.16.6	if we show him respect,
PRO.16.6	we will keep away from sin.
PRO.16.7	When we please the 
PRO.16.7	even our enemies
PRO.16.7	make friends with us.
PRO.16.8	and poor
PRO.16.8	than to be dishonest
PRO.16.8	and rich.
PRO.16.9	We make our own plans,
PRO.16.9	but the 
PRO.16.9	where we will go.
PRO.16.10	Rulers speak with authority
PRO.16.10	and are never wrong.
PRO.16.11	The 
PRO.16.11	if we are fair
PRO.16.11	or if we cheat others.
PRO.16.12	Justice makes rulers powerful.
PRO.16.12	They should hate evil
PRO.16.13	and like honesty and truth.
PRO.16.14	An angry ruler
PRO.16.14	can put you to death.
PRO.16.14	So be wise!
PRO.16.14	Don't make one angry.
PRO.16.15	When a ruler is happy
PRO.16.15	and pleased with you,
PRO.16.15	it's like refreshing rain,
PRO.16.15	and you will live.
PRO.16.16	It's much better to be wise
PRO.16.16	and sensible
PRO.16.16	than to be rich.
PRO.16.17	God's people avoid evil ways,
PRO.16.17	and they protect themselves
PRO.16.17	by watching where they go.
PRO.16.18	Too much pride
PRO.16.18	will destroy you.
PRO.16.19	You are better off
PRO.16.19	to be humble and poor
PRO.16.19	than to get rich
PRO.16.19	from what you take by force.
PRO.16.20	If you know what you're doing,
PRO.16.20	you will prosper.
PRO.16.20	God blesses everyone
PRO.16.20	who trusts him.
PRO.16.21	Good judgment proves
PRO.16.21	that you are wise,
PRO.16.21	and if you speak kindly,
PRO.16.21	you can teach others.
PRO.16.22	Good sense is a fountain
PRO.16.22	that gives life,
PRO.16.22	but fools are punished
PRO.16.22	by their foolishness.
PRO.16.23	You can persuade others
PRO.16.23	if you are wise
PRO.16.23	and speak sensibly.
PRO.16.24	Kind words are like honey—
PRO.16.24	they cheer you up
PRO.16.24	and make you feel strong.
PRO.16.25	is really a road to death.
PRO.16.26	The hungrier you are,
PRO.16.26	the harder you work.
PRO.16.27	Worthless people plan trouble.
PRO.16.27	Even their words burn
PRO.16.27	like a flaming fire.
PRO.16.28	It causes hard feelings
PRO.16.28	and comes between friends.
PRO.16.29	Don't trust violent people.
PRO.16.29	They will mislead you
PRO.16.29	to do the wrong thing.
PRO.16.30	When someone winks
PRO.16.30	or grins behind your back,
PRO.16.30	trouble is on the way.
PRO.16.31	Gray hair is a glorious crown
PRO.16.31	worn by those
PRO.16.31	who have lived right.
PRO.16.32	Controlling your temper
PRO.16.32	is better than being a hero
PRO.16.32	who captures a city.
PRO.16.33	We make our own decisions,
PRO.16.33	but the 
PRO.16.33	determines what happens.
PRO.17.1	A dry crust of bread eaten
PRO.17.1	in peace and quiet
PRO.17.1	is better than a feast eaten
PRO.17.1	where everyone argues.
PRO.17.2	A wise slave
PRO.17.2	will be placed in charge
PRO.17.2	of a no-good child,
PRO.17.2	and that slave will be given
PRO.17.2	the same inheritance
PRO.17.2	that each child receives.
PRO.17.3	Silver and gold are tested
PRO.17.3	by flames of fire;
PRO.17.3	our thoughts are tested
PRO.17.3	by the 
PRO.17.4	Troublemakers listen
PRO.17.4	to troublemakers,
PRO.17.4	and liars listen to liars.
PRO.17.5	By insulting the poor,
PRO.17.5	you insult your Creator.
PRO.17.5	You will be punished
PRO.17.5	if you make fun
PRO.17.5	of someone in trouble.
PRO.17.6	Grandparents are proud
PRO.17.6	of their grandchildren,
PRO.17.6	and children should be proud
PRO.17.6	of their parents.
PRO.17.7	It sounds strange for a fool
PRO.17.7	to talk sensibly,
PRO.17.7	but it's even worse
PRO.17.7	for a ruler to tell lies.
PRO.17.8	A bribe works miracles
PRO.17.8	like a magic charm
PRO.17.8	that brings good luck.
PRO.17.9	You will keep your friends
PRO.17.9	if you forgive them,
PRO.17.9	but you will lose your friends
PRO.17.9	if you keep talking about
PRO.17.9	what they did wrong.
PRO.17.10	A sensible person
PRO.17.10	accepts correction,
PRO.17.10	but you can't beat sense
PRO.17.10	into a fool.
PRO.17.11	Cruel people want to rebel,
PRO.17.11	and so vicious attackers
PRO.17.11	will be sent against them.
PRO.17.12	A bear robbed of her cubs
PRO.17.12	is far less dangerous
PRO.17.12	than a stubborn fool.
PRO.17.13	You will always have trouble
PRO.17.13	if you are mean to those
PRO.17.13	who are good to you.
PRO.17.14	The start of an argument
PRO.17.14	is like a water leak—
PRO.17.14	so stop it before
PRO.17.14	real trouble breaks out.
PRO.17.15	The 
PRO.17.15	who defend the guilty
PRO.17.15	or condemn the innocent.
PRO.17.16	Why should fools have money
PRO.17.16	for an education
PRO.17.16	when they refuse to learn?
PRO.17.17	in any situation,
PRO.17.17	and relatives are born
PRO.17.17	to share our troubles.
PRO.17.18	It's stupid to guarantee
PRO.17.18	someone else's loan.
PRO.17.19	The wicked and the proud
PRO.17.19	love trouble and keep begging
PRO.17.19	to be hurt.
PRO.17.20	Dishonesty does you no good,
PRO.17.20	and telling lies
PRO.17.20	will get you in trouble.
PRO.17.21	It's never pleasant
PRO.17.21	to be the parent of a fool
PRO.17.21	and have nothing but pain.
PRO.17.22	If you are cheerful,
PRO.17.22	you feel good;
PRO.17.22	if you are sad,
PRO.17.22	you hurt all over.
PRO.17.23	Crooks accept secret bribes
PRO.17.23	to keep justice
PRO.17.23	from being done.
PRO.17.24	Anyone with wisdom knows
PRO.17.24	what makes good sense,
PRO.17.24	but fools can never
PRO.17.24	make up their minds.
PRO.17.25	Foolish children bring sorrow
PRO.17.25	and pain to their parents.
PRO.17.26	It isn't fair
PRO.17.26	to punish the innocent
PRO.17.26	and those who do right.
PRO.17.27	It makes a lot of sense
PRO.17.27	to be a person of few words
PRO.17.27	and to stay calm.
PRO.17.28	when they are quiet.
PRO.18.1	It's selfish and stupid
PRO.18.1	to think only of yourself
PRO.18.1	and to sneer at people
PRO.18.1	who have sense.
PRO.18.2	Fools have no desire to learn,
PRO.18.2	instead they would rather
PRO.18.2	give their own opinion.
PRO.18.3	Wrongdoing leads to shame
PRO.18.3	and disgrace.
PRO.18.4	Words of wisdom
PRO.18.4	are a stream that flows
PRO.18.4	from a deep fountain.
PRO.18.5	It's wrong to favor the guilty
PRO.18.5	and keep the innocent
PRO.18.5	from getting justice.
PRO.18.6	Foolish talk will get you
PRO.18.6	into a lot of trouble.
PRO.18.7	Saying foolish things
PRO.18.7	is like setting a trap
PRO.18.7	to destroy yourself.
PRO.18.8	There's nothing so delicious
PRO.18.8	as the taste of gossip!
PRO.18.8	It melts in your mouth.
PRO.18.9	Being lazy is no different
PRO.18.9	from being a troublemaker.
PRO.18.10	The 
PRO.18.10	where his people can run
PRO.18.10	for safety—
PRO.18.11	the rich think their money
PRO.18.11	is a wall of protection.
PRO.18.12	Pride leads to destruction;
PRO.18.12	humility leads to honor.
PRO.18.13	to give an answer
PRO.18.13	before you listen.
PRO.18.14	Being cheerful helps
PRO.18.14	when you are sick,
PRO.18.14	but nothing helps
PRO.18.14	when you give up.
PRO.18.15	Everyone with good sense
PRO.18.15	wants to learn.
PRO.18.16	A gift will get you in
PRO.18.16	to see anyone.
PRO.18.17	You may think you have won
PRO.18.17	your case in court,
PRO.18.17	until your opponent speaks.
PRO.18.18	Drawing straws is one way
PRO.18.18	to settle a difficult case.
PRO.18.19	Making up with a friend
PRO.18.19	you have offended
PRO.18.19	is harder than breaking
PRO.18.19	through a city wall.
PRO.18.20	Make your words good—
PRO.18.20	you will be glad you did.
PRO.18.21	Words can bring death or life!
PRO.18.21	Talk too much, and you will eat
PRO.18.21	everything you say.
PRO.18.22	is his wife—
PRO.18.22	she is a gift from the 
PRO.18.23	The poor must beg for help,
PRO.18.23	but the rich can give
PRO.18.23	a harsh reply.
PRO.18.24	Some friends don't help,
PRO.18.24	but a true friend is closer
PRO.18.24	than your own family.
PRO.19.1	It's better to be poor
PRO.19.1	and live right
PRO.19.1	than to be a stupid liar.
PRO.19.2	Willingness and stupidity
PRO.19.2	don't go well together.
PRO.19.2	If you are too eager,
PRO.19.2	you will miss the road.
PRO.19.3	We are ruined
PRO.19.3	by our own stupidity,
PRO.19.3	though we blame the 
PRO.19.4	The rich have many friends;
PRO.19.4	the poor have none.
PRO.19.5	Dishonest witnesses and liars
PRO.19.5	won't escape punishment.
PRO.19.6	Everyone tries to be friends
PRO.19.6	of those who can help them.
PRO.19.7	If you are poor,
PRO.19.7	your own relatives reject you,
PRO.19.7	and your friends are worse.
PRO.19.7	When you really need them,
PRO.19.7	they are not there.
PRO.19.8	Do yourself a favor
PRO.19.8	by having good sense—
PRO.19.8	you will be glad you did.
PRO.19.9	Dishonest witnesses and liars
PRO.19.9	will be destroyed.
PRO.19.10	It isn't right for a fool
PRO.19.10	to live in luxury
PRO.19.10	or for a slave to rule
PRO.19.10	in place of a king.
PRO.19.11	It's wise to be patient
PRO.19.11	and show what you are like
PRO.19.11	by forgiving others.
PRO.19.12	An angry king roars
PRO.19.12	like a lion,
PRO.19.12	but when a king is pleased,
PRO.19.12	it's like dew on the crops.
PRO.19.13	Foolish children bring disgrace
PRO.19.13	to their fathers.
PRO.19.13	A nagging wife goes on and on
PRO.19.13	like the drip, drip, drip
PRO.19.13	of the rain.
PRO.19.14	You may inherit all you own
PRO.19.14	from your parents,
PRO.19.14	but a sensible wife
PRO.19.14	is a gift from the 
PRO.19.15	If you are lazy
PRO.19.15	and sleep your time away,
PRO.19.15	you will starve.
PRO.19.16	Obey the Lord's teachings
PRO.19.16	and you will live—
PRO.19.16	disobey and you will die.
PRO.19.17	Caring for the poor
PRO.19.17	is lending to the 
PRO.19.17	and you will be well repaid.
PRO.19.18	Correct your children
PRO.19.18	before it's too late;
PRO.19.18	if you don't punish them,
PRO.19.18	trouble will come their way.
PRO.19.19	People with bad tempers
PRO.19.19	are always in trouble,
PRO.19.19	and they need help
PRO.19.19	over and over again.
PRO.19.20	Pay attention to advice
PRO.19.20	and accept correction,
PRO.19.20	so you can live sensibly.
PRO.19.21	We may make a lot of plans,
PRO.19.21	but the 
PRO.19.21	what he has decided.
PRO.19.22	What matters most is loyalty.
PRO.19.22	It's better to be poor
PRO.19.22	than to be a liar.
PRO.19.23	Showing respect to the 
PRO.19.23	brings true life—
PRO.19.23	if you do it, you can relax
PRO.19.23	without fear of danger.
PRO.19.24	Some people are too lazy
PRO.19.24	to lift a hand
PRO.19.24	to feed themselves.
PRO.19.25	Stupid fools learn good sense
PRO.19.25	by seeing others punished;
PRO.19.25	a sensible person learns
PRO.19.25	by being corrected.
PRO.19.26	Disgraceful children
PRO.19.26	rob their father
PRO.19.26	and chase their mother away.
PRO.19.27	If you stop learning,
PRO.19.27	you will forget
PRO.19.27	what you already know.
PRO.19.28	A lying witness makes fun
PRO.19.28	of the court system,
PRO.19.28	and criminals think crime
PRO.19.28	is really delicious.
PRO.19.29	A stupid fool should expect
PRO.19.29	to be punished.
PRO.20.1	It isn't smart to get drunk!
PRO.20.1	Drinking makes a fool of you
PRO.20.1	and leads to fights.
PRO.20.2	An angry ruler
PRO.20.2	is like a roaring lion—
PRO.20.2	make either one angry,
PRO.20.2	and you are dead.
PRO.20.3	It makes you look good
PRO.20.3	when you avoid a fight—
PRO.20.3	only fools love to quarrel.
PRO.20.4	If you are too lazy to plow,
PRO.20.4	don't expect a harvest.
PRO.20.5	Someone's thoughts may be
PRO.20.5	as deep as the ocean,
PRO.20.5	but if you are smart,
PRO.20.5	you will discover them.
PRO.20.6	There are many who say,
PRO.20.6	“You can trust me!”
PRO.20.6	But can they be trusted?
PRO.20.7	Good people live right,
PRO.20.7	and God blesses the children
PRO.20.7	who follow their example.
PRO.20.8	When rulers decide cases,
PRO.20.8	they weigh the evidence.
PRO.20.9	Can any of us really say,
PRO.20.9	“My thoughts are pure,
PRO.20.9	and my sins are gone”?
PRO.20.10	Two things the 
PRO.20.10	are dishonest scales
PRO.20.10	and dishonest measures.
PRO.20.11	The good or bad
PRO.20.11	that children do
PRO.20.11	shows what they are like.
PRO.20.12	Hearing and seeing
PRO.20.12	are gifts from the 
PRO.20.13	If you sleep all the time,
PRO.20.13	you will starve;
PRO.20.13	if you get up and work,
PRO.20.13	you will have enough food.
PRO.20.14	Everyone likes to brag
PRO.20.14	about getting a bargain.
PRO.20.15	Sensible words are better
PRO.20.15	than gold or jewels.
PRO.20.16	You deserve to lose your coat
PRO.20.16	if you loan it to someone
PRO.20.16	to guarantee payment
PRO.20.16	for the debt of a stranger.
PRO.20.17	The food you get by cheating
PRO.20.17	may taste delicious,
PRO.20.17	but it turns to gravel.
PRO.20.18	Be sure you have sound advice
PRO.20.18	before making plans
PRO.20.18	or starting a war.
PRO.20.19	Stay away from gossips—
PRO.20.19	they tell everything.
PRO.20.20	Children who curse their parents
PRO.20.20	will go to the land of darkness
PRO.20.20	long before their time.
PRO.20.21	Getting rich quick
PRO.20.21	may turn out to be a curse.
PRO.20.22	Don't try to get even.
PRO.20.22	Trust the 
PRO.20.22	and he will help you.
PRO.20.23	The 
PRO.20.23	and dishonest weights.
PRO.20.23	So don't cheat!
PRO.20.24	How can we know
PRO.20.24	what will happen to us
PRO.20.24	when the 
PRO.20.25	Don't fall into the trap
PRO.20.25	of making promises to God
PRO.20.25	before you think!
PRO.20.26	A wise ruler severely punishes
PRO.20.26	every criminal.
PRO.20.27	Our inner thoughts are a lamp
PRO.20.27	from the 
PRO.20.27	and they search our hearts.
PRO.20.28	Rulers are protected
PRO.20.28	by God's mercy and loyalty,
PRO.20.28	but
PRO.20.28	for their kingdoms to last.
PRO.20.29	Young people take pride
PRO.20.29	in their strength,
PRO.20.29	but the gray hairs of wisdom
PRO.20.29	are even more beautiful.
PRO.20.30	A severe beating can knock all
PRO.20.30	of the evil out of you!
PRO.21.1	just as he determines
PRO.21.1	the course of rivers.
PRO.21.2	We may think we are doing
PRO.21.2	the right thing,
PRO.21.2	but the 
PRO.21.2	what is in our hearts.
PRO.21.3	Doing what is right and fair
PRO.21.3	pleases the 
PRO.21.3	more than an offering.
PRO.21.4	Evil people are proud
PRO.21.4	and arrogant,
PRO.21.4	but sin is the only crop
PRO.21.4	they produce.
PRO.21.5	If you plan and work hard,
PRO.21.5	you will have plenty;
PRO.21.5	if you hurry to get rich,
PRO.21.5	you will end up poor.
PRO.21.6	Cheating to get rich
PRO.21.6	is a foolish dream
PRO.21.6	and no less than suicide.
PRO.21.7	You destroy yourself
PRO.21.7	by being cruel and violent
PRO.21.7	and refusing to live right.
PRO.21.8	All crooks are liars,
PRO.21.8	but anyone who is innocent
PRO.21.8	will do right.
PRO.21.9	on the roof of your house
PRO.21.9	than to live inside
PRO.21.9	with a nagging wife.
PRO.21.10	Evil people want to do wrong,
PRO.21.10	even to their friends.
PRO.21.11	An ignorant fool learns
PRO.21.11	by seeing others punished;
PRO.21.11	a sensible person learns
PRO.21.11	by being instructed.
PRO.21.12	God is always fair!
PRO.21.12	He knows what the wicked do
PRO.21.12	and will punish them.
PRO.21.13	If you won't help the poor,
PRO.21.13	don't expect to be heard
PRO.21.13	when you cry out for help.
PRO.21.14	A secret bribe will save you
PRO.21.14	from someone's fierce anger.
PRO.21.15	When justice is done,
PRO.21.15	good citizens are glad
PRO.21.15	and crooks are terrified.
PRO.21.16	If you stop using good sense,
PRO.21.16	you will find yourself
PRO.21.16	in the grave.
PRO.21.17	Heavy drinkers and others
PRO.21.17	who live only for pleasure
PRO.21.17	will lose all they have.
PRO.21.18	God's people will escape,
PRO.21.18	but all who are wicked
PRO.21.18	will pay the price.
PRO.21.19	It's better out in the desert
PRO.21.19	than at home with a nagging,
PRO.21.19	complaining wife.
PRO.21.20	Be sensible and store up
PRO.21.20	precious treasures—
PRO.21.20	don't waste them
PRO.21.20	like a fool.
PRO.21.21	If you try to be kind and good,
PRO.21.21	you will be blessed with life
PRO.21.21	and goodness and honor.
PRO.21.22	One wise person can defeat
PRO.21.22	a city full of soldiers
PRO.21.22	and capture their fortress.
PRO.21.23	Watching what you say
PRO.21.23	can save you
PRO.21.23	a lot of trouble.
PRO.21.24	If you are proud and conceited,
PRO.21.24	everyone will say,
PRO.21.24	“You're a snob!”
PRO.21.25	If you want too much
PRO.21.25	and are too lazy to work,
PRO.21.25	it could be fatal.
PRO.21.26	But people who obey God
PRO.21.26	are always generous.
PRO.21.27	of wicked people
PRO.21.27	with evil motives.
PRO.21.28	If you tell lies in court,
PRO.21.28	you are done for;
PRO.21.28	only a reliable witness
PRO.21.28	can do the job.
PRO.21.29	Wicked people bluff their way,
PRO.21.29	but God's people think
PRO.21.29	before they take a step.
PRO.21.30	No matter how much you know
PRO.21.30	or what plans you make,
PRO.21.30	you can't defeat the 
PRO.21.31	Even if your army has horses
PRO.21.31	ready for battle,
PRO.21.31	the 
PRO.22.1	A good reputation and respect
PRO.22.1	are worth much more
PRO.22.1	than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and the poor
PRO.22.2	are all created
PRO.22.2	by the 
PRO.22.3	When you see trouble coming,
PRO.22.3	don't be stupid
PRO.22.3	and walk right into it—
PRO.22.3	be smart and hide.
PRO.22.4	Respect and serve the 
PRO.22.4	Your reward will be wealth,
PRO.22.4	a long life, and honor.
PRO.22.5	Crooks walk down a road
PRO.22.5	full of thorny traps.
PRO.22.5	Stay away from there!
PRO.22.6	right from wrong,
PRO.22.6	and when they are grown
PRO.22.6	they will still do right.
PRO.22.7	The poor are ruled by the rich,
PRO.22.7	and those who borrow
PRO.22.7	are slaves of moneylenders.
PRO.22.8	Troublemakers get in trouble,
PRO.22.8	and their terrible anger
PRO.22.8	will get them nowhere.
PRO.22.9	The 
PRO.22.9	who freely gives food
PRO.22.9	to the poor.
PRO.22.10	Arguments and fights
PRO.22.10	will come to an end,
PRO.22.10	if you chase away those
PRO.22.10	who insult others.
PRO.22.11	The king is the friend of all
PRO.22.11	who are sincere
PRO.22.11	and speak with kindness.
PRO.22.12	The 
PRO.22.12	who shows good sense,
PRO.22.12	but he frustrates the plans
PRO.22.12	of deceitful liars.
PRO.22.13	Don't be so lazy that you say,
PRO.22.13	“If I go to work,
PRO.22.13	a lion will eat me!”
PRO.22.14	The words of a bad woman
PRO.22.14	are like a deep pit;
PRO.22.14	if you make the 
PRO.22.14	you will fall right in.
PRO.22.15	All children are foolish,
PRO.22.15	but firm correction
PRO.22.15	will make them change.
PRO.22.16	Cheat the poor to make profit
PRO.22.16	or give gifts to the rich—
PRO.22.16	either way you lose.
PRO.22.17	Here are some sayings
PRO.22.17	of people with wisdom,
PRO.22.17	so listen carefully
PRO.22.17	as I teach.
PRO.22.18	You will be glad
PRO.22.18	that you know these sayings
PRO.22.18	and can recite them.
PRO.22.19	I am teaching them today,
PRO.22.19	so that you
PRO.22.19	may trust the 
PRO.22.20	I have written thirty sayings
PRO.22.20	filled with sound advice.
PRO.22.21	You can trust them completely
PRO.22.21	to give you the right words
PRO.22.21	for those in charge of you.
PRO.22.22	Don't take advantage
PRO.22.22	of the poor
PRO.22.22	or cheat them in court.
PRO.22.23	The 
PRO.22.23	and what you do to them,
PRO.22.23	he will do to you.
PRO.22.24	Don't make friends with anyone
PRO.22.24	who has a bad temper.
PRO.22.25	You might turn out like them
PRO.22.25	and get caught in a trap.
PRO.22.26	Don't guarantee to pay
PRO.22.26	someone else's debt.
PRO.22.27	If you don't have the money,
PRO.22.27	you might lose your bed.
PRO.22.28	Don't move a boundary marker
PRO.22.28	set up by your ancestors.
PRO.22.29	If you do your job well,
PRO.22.29	you will work for a ruler
PRO.22.29	and never be a slave.
PRO.23.1	When you are invited
PRO.23.1	to eat with a king,
PRO.23.1	use your best manners.
PRO.23.2	Don't go and stuff yourself!
PRO.23.2	That would be just the same
PRO.23.2	as cutting your throat.
PRO.23.3	Don't be greedy for all
PRO.23.3	of that fancy food!
PRO.23.3	It may not be so tasty.
PRO.23.4	Give up trying so hard
PRO.23.4	to get rich.
PRO.23.5	Your money flies away
PRO.23.5	before you know it,
PRO.23.5	just like an eagle
PRO.23.5	suddenly taking off.
PRO.23.6	Don't accept an invitation
PRO.23.6	to eat a selfish person's food,
PRO.23.6	no matter how good it is.
PRO.23.7	People like that take note
PRO.23.7	of how much you eat.
PRO.23.7	They say, “Take all you want!”
PRO.23.7	But they don't mean it.
PRO.23.8	Each bite will come back up,
PRO.23.8	and all your kind words
PRO.23.8	will be wasted.
PRO.23.9	Don't talk to fools—
PRO.23.9	they will make fun of you.
PRO.23.10	Don't move a boundary marker
PRO.23.10	or take the land
PRO.23.10	that belongs to orphans.
PRO.23.11	God All-Powerful is there
PRO.23.11	to defend them against you.
PRO.23.12	Listen to instruction
PRO.23.12	and do your best to learn.
PRO.23.13	Don't fail to correct
PRO.23.13	your children.
PRO.23.13	You won't kill them
PRO.23.13	by being firm,
PRO.23.14	and it may even
PRO.23.14	save their lives.
PRO.23.15	My children,
PRO.23.15	if you show good sense,
PRO.23.15	I will be happy,
PRO.23.16	and if you are truthful,
PRO.23.16	I will really be glad.
PRO.23.17	Don't be jealous of sinners,
PRO.23.17	but always honor the 
PRO.23.18	Then you will truly have hope
PRO.23.18	for the future.
PRO.23.19	Listen to me, my children!
PRO.23.19	Be wise and have enough sense
PRO.23.19	to follow the right path.
PRO.23.20	Don't be a heavy drinker
PRO.23.20	or stuff yourself with food.
PRO.23.21	It will make you feel drowsy,
PRO.23.21	and you will end up poor
PRO.23.21	with only rags to wear.
PRO.23.22	Pay attention to your father,
PRO.23.22	and don't neglect your mother
PRO.23.22	when she grows old.
PRO.23.23	Invest in truth and wisdom,
PRO.23.23	discipline and good sense,
PRO.23.23	and don't part with them.
PRO.23.24	Make your father truly happy
PRO.23.24	by living right and showing
PRO.23.24	sound judgment.
PRO.23.25	Make your parents proud,
PRO.23.25	especially your mother.
PRO.23.26	My son, pay close attention,
PRO.23.26	and gladly follow
PRO.23.26	my example.
PRO.23.27	Bad women and unfaithful wives
PRO.23.27	are like a deep pit—
PRO.23.28	they are waiting to attack you
PRO.23.28	like a gang of robbers
PRO.23.28	with victim after victim.
PRO.23.29	Who is always in trouble?
PRO.23.29	Who argues and fights?
PRO.23.29	Who has cuts and bruises?
PRO.23.29	Whose eyes are red?
PRO.23.30	Everyone who stays up late,
PRO.23.30	having just one more drink.
PRO.23.31	Don't even look
PRO.23.31	at that colorful stuff
PRO.23.31	bubbling up in the glass!
PRO.23.31	It goes down so easily,
PRO.23.32	but later it bites
PRO.23.32	like a poisonous snake.
PRO.23.33	You will see weird things,
PRO.23.33	and your mind
PRO.23.33	will play tricks on you.
PRO.23.34	You will feel tossed about
PRO.23.34	like someone trying to sleep
PRO.23.34	on a ship in a storm.
PRO.23.35	You will be bruised all over,
PRO.23.35	without even remembering
PRO.23.35	how it all happened.
PRO.23.35	And you will lie awake asking,
PRO.23.35	“When will morning come,
PRO.23.35	so I can drink some more?”
PRO.24.1	Don't be jealous of crooks
PRO.24.1	or want to be their friends.
PRO.24.2	All they think about
PRO.24.2	and talk about
PRO.24.2	is violence and cruelty.
PRO.24.3	Use wisdom and understanding
PRO.24.3	to establish your home;
PRO.24.4	let good sense fill the rooms
PRO.24.4	with priceless treasures.
PRO.24.5	Wisdom brings strength,
PRO.24.5	and knowledge gives power.
PRO.24.6	Battles are won
PRO.24.6	by listening to advice
PRO.24.6	and making a lot of plans.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too much for fools!
PRO.24.7	Their advice is no good.
PRO.24.8	No one but troublemakers
PRO.24.8	think up trouble.
PRO.24.9	Everyone hates senseless fools
PRO.24.9	who think up ways to sin.
PRO.24.10	Don't give up and be helpless
PRO.24.10	in times of trouble.
PRO.24.11	Don't fail to rescue those
PRO.24.11	who are doomed to die.
PRO.24.12	Don't say, “I didn't know it!”
PRO.24.12	God can read your mind.
PRO.24.12	He watches each of us
PRO.24.12	and knows our thoughts.
PRO.24.12	And God will pay us back
PRO.24.12	for what we do.
PRO.24.13	Honey is good for you,
PRO.24.13	my children,
PRO.24.13	and it tastes sweet.
PRO.24.14	Wisdom is like honey
PRO.24.14	for your life—
PRO.24.14	if you find it,
PRO.24.14	your future is bright.
PRO.24.15	Don't be a cruel person
PRO.24.15	who attacks good people
PRO.24.15	and hurts their families.
PRO.24.16	Even if good people
PRO.24.16	fall seven times,
PRO.24.16	they will get back up.
PRO.24.16	But when trouble strikes
PRO.24.16	the wicked,
PRO.24.16	that's the end of them.
PRO.24.17	Don't be happy
PRO.24.17	to see your enemies trip
PRO.24.17	and fall down.
PRO.24.18	The 
PRO.24.18	and be unhappy.
PRO.24.18	Then he will stop
PRO.24.18	being angry with them.
PRO.24.19	Don't let evil people
PRO.24.19	worry you
PRO.24.19	or make you jealous.
PRO.24.20	They will soon be gone
PRO.24.20	like the flame of a lamp
PRO.24.20	that burns out.
PRO.24.21	My children, you must respect
PRO.24.21	the 
PRO.24.21	and you must not make friends
PRO.24.21	with anyone who rebels
PRO.24.21	against either of them.
PRO.24.22	Who knows what sudden disaster
PRO.24.22	the 
PRO.24.22	might bring?
PRO.24.23	Here are some more sayings
PRO.24.23	that make good sense:
PRO.24.23	When you judge,
PRO.24.23	you must be fair.
PRO.24.24	If you let the guilty
PRO.24.24	go free,
PRO.24.24	people of all nations
PRO.24.24	will hate and curse you.
PRO.24.25	But if you punish the guilty,
PRO.24.25	things will go well for you,
PRO.24.25	and you will prosper.
PRO.24.26	Giving an honest answer
PRO.24.26	is a sign
PRO.24.26	of true friendship.
PRO.24.27	Get your fields ready
PRO.24.27	and plant your crops
PRO.24.27	before starting a home.
PRO.24.28	Don't accuse anyone
PRO.24.28	who isn't guilty.
PRO.24.28	Don't ever tell a lie
PRO.24.29	or say to someone,
PRO.24.29	“I'll get even with you!”
PRO.24.30	I once walked by the field
PRO.24.30	and the vineyard
PRO.24.30	of a lazy fool.
PRO.24.31	Thorns and weeds
PRO.24.31	were everywhere,
PRO.24.31	and the stone wall
PRO.24.31	had fallen down.
PRO.24.32	When I saw this,
PRO.24.32	it taught me a lesson:
PRO.24.33	Fold your hands
PRO.24.33	and twiddle your thumbs.
PRO.24.34	Suddenly poverty hits you
PRO.24.34	and everything is gone!
PRO.25.1	Here are some more
PRO.25.1	of Solomon's proverbs.
PRO.25.1	They were copied by the officials
PRO.25.1	of King Hezekiah of Judah.
PRO.25.2	God is praised
PRO.25.2	for being mysterious;
PRO.25.2	rulers are praised
PRO.25.2	for explaining mysteries.
PRO.25.3	Who can fully understand
PRO.25.3	the thoughts of a ruler?
PRO.25.3	They reach beyond the sky
PRO.25.3	and go deep in the earth.
PRO.25.4	Silver must be purified
PRO.25.4	before it can be used
PRO.25.4	to make something of value.
PRO.25.5	Evil people must be removed
PRO.25.5	before anyone can rule
PRO.25.5	with justice.
PRO.25.6	in the court of a ruler.
PRO.25.7	It's better for the ruler
PRO.25.7	to give you a high position
PRO.25.7	than for you to be embarrassed
PRO.25.7	in front of royal officials.
PRO.25.7	Be sure you are right
PRO.25.8	before you sue someone,
PRO.25.8	or you might lose your case
PRO.25.8	and be embarrassed.
PRO.25.9	When you and someone else
PRO.25.9	can't get along,
PRO.25.9	don't gossip about it.
PRO.25.10	Others will find out,
PRO.25.10	and your reputation
PRO.25.10	will then be ruined.
PRO.25.11	The right word
PRO.25.11	at the right time
PRO.25.11	is like precious gold
PRO.25.11	set in silver.
PRO.25.12	Listening to good advice
PRO.25.12	is worth much more
PRO.25.12	than jewelry made of gold.
PRO.25.13	A messenger you can trust
PRO.25.13	is just as refreshing
PRO.25.13	as cool water in summer.
PRO.25.14	Broken promises
PRO.25.14	are worse than rain clouds
PRO.25.14	that don't bring rain.
PRO.25.15	Patience and gentle talk
PRO.25.15	can convince a ruler
PRO.25.15	and overcome any problem.
PRO.25.16	Eating too much honey
PRO.25.16	can make you sick.
PRO.25.17	Don't visit friends too often,
PRO.25.17	or they will get tired of it
PRO.25.17	and start hating you.
PRO.25.18	Telling lies about friends
PRO.25.18	is like attacking them
PRO.25.18	with clubs and swords
PRO.25.18	and sharp arrows.
PRO.25.19	A friend you can't trust
PRO.25.19	in times of trouble
PRO.25.19	is like having a toothache
PRO.25.19	or a sore foot.
PRO.25.20	Singing to someone
PRO.25.20	in deep sorrow
PRO.25.20	is like pouring vinegar
PRO.25.20	in an open cut.
PRO.25.21	give them something to eat.
PRO.25.21	And if they are thirsty,
PRO.25.21	give them something
PRO.25.21	to drink.
PRO.25.22	This will be the same
PRO.25.22	as piling burning coals
PRO.25.22	on their heads.
PRO.25.22	And the 
PRO.25.22	will reward you.
PRO.25.23	As surely as rain blows in
PRO.25.23	from the north,
PRO.25.23	anger is caused
PRO.25.23	by cruel words.
PRO.25.24	It's better to stay outside
PRO.25.24	on the roof of your house
PRO.25.24	than to live inside
PRO.25.24	with a nagging wife.
PRO.25.25	Good news from far away
PRO.25.25	refreshes like cold water
PRO.25.25	when you are thirsty.
PRO.25.26	When a good person gives in
PRO.25.26	to the wicked,
PRO.25.26	it's like dumping garbage
PRO.25.26	in a stream of clear water.
PRO.25.27	Don't eat too much honey
PRO.25.27	or always want praise.
PRO.25.28	Losing self-control
PRO.25.28	leaves you as helpless
PRO.25.28	as a city without a wall.
PRO.26.1	Expecting snow in summer
PRO.26.1	and rain in the dry season
PRO.26.1	makes more sense
PRO.26.1	than honoring a fool.
PRO.26.2	A curse you don't deserve
PRO.26.2	will take wings and fly away
PRO.26.2	like a sparrow or a swallow.
PRO.26.3	Horses and donkeys
PRO.26.3	must be beaten and bridled—
PRO.26.3	and so must fools.
PRO.26.4	Don't make a fool of yourself
PRO.26.4	by answering a fool.
PRO.26.5	But if you answer any fools,
PRO.26.5	show how foolish they are,
PRO.26.5	so they won't feel smart.
PRO.26.6	Sending a message by a fool
PRO.26.6	is like chopping off your foot
PRO.26.6	just to spite yourself.
PRO.26.7	A fool with words of wisdom
PRO.26.7	is like an athlete
PRO.26.7	with legs that can't move.
PRO.26.8	Are you going to honor a fool?
PRO.26.8	Why not shoot a slingshot
PRO.26.8	with the rock tied tight?
PRO.26.9	A thornbush waved around
PRO.26.9	in the hand of a drunkard
PRO.26.9	is no worse than a proverb
PRO.26.9	in the mouth of a fool.
PRO.26.10	It's no smarter to shoot arrows
PRO.26.10	at every passerby
PRO.26.10	than it is to hire a bunch
PRO.26.10	of worthless nobodies.
PRO.26.11	just as fools repeat
PRO.26.11	their foolishness.
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool
PRO.26.12	than for someone who says,
PRO.26.12	“I'm really smart!”
PRO.26.13	Don't be lazy and keep saying,
PRO.26.13	“There's a lion outside!”
PRO.26.14	A door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	but a lazy person
PRO.26.14	just turns over in bed.
PRO.26.15	Some of us are so lazy
PRO.26.15	that we won't lift a hand
PRO.26.15	to feed ourselves.
PRO.26.16	A lazy person says,
PRO.26.16	“I am smarter
PRO.26.16	than everyone else.”
PRO.26.17	It's better to take hold
PRO.26.17	of a mad dog by the ears
PRO.26.17	than to take part
PRO.26.17	in someone else's argument.
PRO.26.18	It's no crazier to shoot
PRO.26.18	sharp and flaming arrows
PRO.26.19	than to cheat someone and say,
PRO.26.19	“I was only fooling!”
PRO.26.20	Where there is no fuel
PRO.26.20	a fire goes out;
PRO.26.20	where there is no gossip
PRO.26.20	arguments come to an end.
PRO.26.21	Troublemakers start trouble,
PRO.26.21	just as sparks and fuel
PRO.26.21	start a fire.
PRO.26.22	There is nothing so delicious
PRO.26.22	as the taste of gossip!
PRO.26.22	It melts in your mouth.
PRO.26.23	Hiding hateful thoughts
PRO.26.23	behind smooth
PRO.26.23	is like coating a clay pot
PRO.26.23	with a cheap glaze.
PRO.26.24	The pleasant talk
PRO.26.24	of an enemy
PRO.26.24	hides more evil plans
PRO.26.25	than can be counted—
PRO.26.25	so don't believe a word!
PRO.26.26	Everyone will see through
PRO.26.26	those evil plans.
PRO.26.27	you will fall in;
PRO.26.27	if you start a stone rolling,
PRO.26.27	it will roll back on you.
PRO.26.28	Watch out for anyone
PRO.26.28	who tells lies and flatters—
PRO.26.28	they are out to get you.
PRO.27.1	Each day brings
PRO.27.1	its own surprises.
PRO.27.2	Don't brag about yourself—
PRO.27.2	let others praise you.
PRO.27.3	Stones and sand are heavy,
PRO.27.3	but trouble caused by a fool
PRO.27.3	is a much heavier load.
PRO.27.4	An angry person is dangerous,
PRO.27.4	but a jealous person
PRO.27.4	is even worse.
PRO.27.5	A truly good friend
PRO.27.5	will openly correct you.
PRO.27.6	You can trust a friend
PRO.27.6	who corrects you,
PRO.27.6	but kisses from an enemy
PRO.27.6	are nothing but lies.
PRO.27.7	If you have had enough to eat,
PRO.27.7	honey doesn't taste good,
PRO.27.7	but if you are really hungry,
PRO.27.7	you will eat anything.
PRO.27.8	When you are far from home,
PRO.27.8	you feel like a bird
PRO.27.8	without a nest.
PRO.27.9	The sweet smell of incense
PRO.27.9	can make you feel good,
PRO.27.9	but true friendship
PRO.27.9	is better still.
PRO.27.10	Don't desert an old friend
PRO.27.10	of your family
PRO.27.10	or visit your relatives
PRO.27.10	when you are in trouble.
PRO.27.10	A friend nearby is better
PRO.27.10	than relatives far away.
PRO.27.11	My child, show good sense!
PRO.27.11	Then I will be happy
PRO.27.11	and able to answer anyone
PRO.27.11	who criticizes me.
PRO.27.12	Be cautious and hide
PRO.27.12	when you see danger—
PRO.27.12	don't be stupid and walk
PRO.27.12	right into trouble.
PRO.27.13	You deserve to lose your coat
PRO.27.13	if you loan it to someone
PRO.27.13	to guarantee payment
PRO.27.13	for the debt of a stranger.
PRO.27.14	A loud greeting
PRO.27.14	early in the morning
PRO.27.14	is the same as a curse.
PRO.27.15	The steady dripping of rain
PRO.27.15	and the nagging of a wife
PRO.27.15	are one and the same.
PRO.27.16	It's easier to catch the wind
PRO.27.16	or hold olive oil in your hand
PRO.27.16	than to stop a nagging wife.
PRO.27.17	Just as iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	friends sharpen the minds
PRO.27.17	of each other.
PRO.27.18	Take care of a tree,
PRO.27.18	and you will eat its fruit;
PRO.27.18	look after your master,
PRO.27.18	and you will be praised.
PRO.27.19	You see your face in a mirror
PRO.27.19	and your thoughts
PRO.27.19	in the minds of others.
PRO.27.20	Death and the grave
PRO.27.20	are never satisfied,
PRO.27.20	and neither are humans.
PRO.27.21	Gold and silver are tested
PRO.27.21	in a red-hot furnace,
PRO.27.21	but we are tested by praise.
PRO.27.22	No matter how hard
PRO.27.22	you beat a fool,
PRO.27.22	you can't pound out
PRO.27.22	the foolishness.
PRO.27.23	You should take good care
PRO.27.23	of your sheep and goats,
PRO.27.24	because wealth and honor
PRO.27.24	don't last forever.
PRO.27.25	After the hay is cut
PRO.27.25	and the new growth appears
PRO.27.25	and the harvest is over,
PRO.27.26	you can sell lambs and goats
PRO.27.26	to buy clothes and land.
PRO.27.27	From the milk of the goats,
PRO.27.27	you can make enough cheese
PRO.27.27	to feed your family
PRO.27.27	and all your servants.
PRO.28.1	Wicked people run away
PRO.28.1	when no one chases them,
PRO.28.1	but those who live right
PRO.28.1	are as brave as lions.
PRO.28.2	In time of civil war
PRO.28.2	there are many leaders,
PRO.28.2	but a sensible leader
PRO.28.2	restores law and order.
PRO.28.3	When someone poor takes over
PRO.28.3	and mistreats the poor,
PRO.28.3	it's like a heavy rain
PRO.28.3	destroying the crops.
PRO.28.4	Lawbreakers praise criminals,
PRO.28.4	but law-abiding citizens
PRO.28.4	always oppose them.
PRO.28.5	Criminals don't know
PRO.28.5	what justice means,
PRO.28.5	but all who respect the 
PRO.28.5	understand it completely.
PRO.28.6	It's better to be poor
PRO.28.6	and live right,
PRO.28.6	than to be rich
PRO.28.6	and dishonest.
PRO.28.7	It makes good sense
PRO.28.7	to obey the Law of God,
PRO.28.7	but you disgrace your parents
PRO.28.7	if you make friends
PRO.28.7	with worthless nobodies.
PRO.28.8	If you make money by charging
PRO.28.8	high interest rates,
PRO.28.8	you will lose it all to someone
PRO.28.8	who cares for the poor.
PRO.28.9	God cannot stand the prayers
PRO.28.9	of anyone who disobeys
PRO.28.9	his Law.
PRO.28.10	By leading good people to sin,
PRO.28.10	you dig a pit for yourself,
PRO.28.10	but all who live right
PRO.28.10	will have a bright future.
PRO.28.11	The rich think highly
PRO.28.11	of themselves,
PRO.28.11	but anyone poor and sensible
PRO.28.11	sees right through them.
PRO.28.12	When an honest person wins,
PRO.28.12	it's time to celebrate;
PRO.28.12	when crooks are in control,
PRO.28.12	it's best to hide.
PRO.28.13	If you don't confess your sins,
PRO.28.13	you will be a failure.
PRO.28.13	But God will be merciful
PRO.28.13	if you confess your sins
PRO.28.13	and give them up.
PRO.28.14	The 
PRO.28.14	who is afraid to do evil,
PRO.28.14	but if you are cruel,
PRO.28.14	you will end up in trouble.
PRO.28.15	A ruler who mistreats the poor
PRO.28.15	is like a roaring lion
PRO.28.15	or a bear hunting for food.
PRO.28.16	A heartless leader is a fool,
PRO.28.16	but anyone who refuses
PRO.28.16	to get rich by cheating others
PRO.28.16	will live a long time.
PRO.28.17	Don't give help to murderers!
PRO.28.17	Make them stay on the run
PRO.28.17	for as long as they live.
PRO.28.18	Honesty will keep you safe,
PRO.28.18	but everyone who is crooked
PRO.28.18	will suddenly fall.
PRO.28.19	Work hard, and you will have
PRO.28.19	a lot of food;
PRO.28.19	waste time, and you will have
PRO.28.19	a lot of trouble.
PRO.28.20	God blesses his loyal people,
PRO.28.20	but punishes all who want
PRO.28.20	to get rich quick.
PRO.28.21	It isn't right to be unfair,
PRO.28.21	but some people can be bribed
PRO.28.21	with only a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	Don't be selfish
PRO.28.22	and eager to get rich—
PRO.28.22	you will end up worse off
PRO.28.22	than you can imagine.
PRO.28.23	Honest correction
PRO.28.23	is appreciated
PRO.28.23	more than flattery.
PRO.28.24	If you cheat your parents
PRO.28.24	and don't think it's wrong,
PRO.28.24	you are a common thief.
PRO.28.25	Selfish people cause trouble,
PRO.28.25	but you will live a full life
PRO.28.25	if you trust the 
PRO.28.26	Only fools would trust
PRO.28.26	what they alone think,
PRO.28.26	but if you live by wisdom,
PRO.28.26	you will do all right.
PRO.28.27	Giving to the poor
PRO.28.27	will keep you from poverty,
PRO.28.27	but if you close your eyes
PRO.28.27	to their needs,
PRO.28.27	everyone will curse you.
PRO.28.28	When crooks are in control,
PRO.28.28	everyone tries to hide,
PRO.28.28	but when they lose power,
PRO.28.28	good people are everywhere.
PRO.29.1	If you keep being stubborn
PRO.29.1	after many warnings,
PRO.29.1	you will suddenly discover
PRO.29.1	you have gone too far.
PRO.29.2	When justice rules a nation,
PRO.29.2	everyone is glad;
PRO.29.2	when injustice rules,
PRO.29.2	everyone groans.
PRO.29.3	If you love wisdom
PRO.29.3	your parents will be glad,
PRO.29.3	but chasing after bad women
PRO.29.3	will cost you everything.
PRO.29.4	An honest ruler
PRO.29.4	makes the nation strong;
PRO.29.4	a ruler who takes bribes
PRO.29.4	will bring it to ruin.
PRO.29.5	Flattery is nothing less
PRO.29.5	than setting a trap.
PRO.29.6	Your sins will catch you,
PRO.29.6	but everyone who lives right
PRO.29.6	will sing and celebrate.
PRO.29.7	The wicked don't care
PRO.29.7	about the rights of the poor,
PRO.29.7	but good people do.
PRO.29.8	Sneering at others is a spark
PRO.29.8	that sets a city on fire;
PRO.29.8	using good sense can put out
PRO.29.8	the flames of anger.
PRO.29.9	Be wise and don't sue a fool.
PRO.29.9	You won't get satisfaction,
PRO.29.9	because all the fool will do
PRO.29.9	is sneer and shout.
PRO.29.10	A murderer hates everyone
PRO.29.10	who is honest
PRO.29.10	and lives right.
PRO.29.11	Don't be a fool
PRO.29.11	and quickly lose your temper—
PRO.29.11	be sensible and patient.
PRO.29.12	A ruler who listens to lies
PRO.29.12	will have corrupt officials.
PRO.29.13	The poor and all who abuse them
PRO.29.13	must each depend on God
PRO.29.13	for light.
PRO.29.14	Kings who are fair to the poor
PRO.29.14	will rule a long time.
PRO.29.15	Correct your children,
PRO.29.15	and they will be wise;
PRO.29.15	children out of control
PRO.29.15	disgrace their mothers.
PRO.29.16	Crime increases
PRO.29.16	when crooks are in power,
PRO.29.16	but law-abiding citizens
PRO.29.16	will see them fall.
PRO.29.17	If you correct your children,
PRO.29.17	they will bring you peace
PRO.29.17	and happiness.
PRO.29.18	Without guidance from God
PRO.29.18	law and order disappear,
PRO.29.18	but God blesses everyone
PRO.29.18	who obeys his Law.
PRO.29.19	it takes more than words
PRO.29.19	to make them obey.
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool
PRO.29.20	than for someone who speaks
PRO.29.20	without thinking.
PRO.29.21	Slaves that you treat kindly
PRO.29.21	from their childhood
PRO.29.21	will cause you sorrow.
PRO.29.22	A person with a quick temper
PRO.29.22	stirs up arguments
PRO.29.22	and commits a lot of sins.
PRO.29.23	Too much pride brings disgrace;
PRO.29.23	humility leads to honor.
PRO.29.24	If you take part in a crime
PRO.29.24	you are your worst enemy,
PRO.29.24	because even under oath
PRO.29.24	you can't tell the truth.
PRO.29.25	Don't fall into the trap
PRO.29.25	of being a coward—
PRO.29.25	trust the 
PRO.29.25	and you will be safe.
PRO.29.26	Many try to make friends
PRO.29.26	with a ruler,
PRO.29.26	but justice comes
PRO.29.26	from the 
PRO.29.27	Good people and criminals
PRO.29.27	can't stand each other.
PRO.30.1	These are the sayings
PRO.30.1	and the message
PRO.30.1	of Agur son of Jakeh.
PRO.30.1	Someone cries out to God,
PRO.30.1	“I am completely worn out!
PRO.30.1	How can I last?
PRO.30.2	I am far too stupid
PRO.30.2	to be considered human.
PRO.30.3	I never was wise,
PRO.30.3	and I don't understand
PRO.30.3	what God is like.”
PRO.30.4	and come back down?
PRO.30.4	Has anyone grabbed hold
PRO.30.4	of the wind?
PRO.30.4	Has anyone wrapped up the sea
PRO.30.4	or marked out boundaries
PRO.30.4	for the earth?
PRO.30.4	If you know of any
PRO.30.4	who have done such things,
PRO.30.4	then tell me their names
PRO.30.4	and their children's names.
PRO.30.5	Everything God says is true—
PRO.30.5	and it's a shield for all
PRO.30.5	who come to him for safety.
PRO.30.6	Don't change what God has said!
PRO.30.6	He will correct you and show
PRO.30.6	that you are a liar.
PRO.30.7	There are two things, Lord,
PRO.30.7	I want you to do for me
PRO.30.7	before I die:
PRO.30.8	Make me absolutely honest
PRO.30.8	and don't let me be too poor
PRO.30.8	or too rich.
PRO.30.8	Give me just what I need.
PRO.30.9	If I have too much to eat,
PRO.30.9	I might forget about you;
PRO.30.9	if I don't have enough,
PRO.30.9	I might steal
PRO.30.9	and disgrace your name.
PRO.30.10	Don't tell a slave owner
PRO.30.10	something bad about one
PRO.30.10	of the slaves.
PRO.30.10	That slave will curse you,
PRO.30.10	and you will be in trouble.
PRO.30.11	Some people curse their father
PRO.30.11	and even their mother;
PRO.30.12	others think they are perfect,
PRO.30.12	but they are stained by sin.
PRO.30.13	Some people are stuck-up
PRO.30.13	and act like snobs;
PRO.30.14	others are so greedy
PRO.30.14	that they gobble up
PRO.30.14	the poor and homeless.
PRO.30.15	Greed
PRO.30.15	each named “Give me!”
PRO.30.15	There are three or four things
PRO.30.15	that are never satisfied:
PRO.30.16	The world of the dead
PRO.30.16	and a childless wife,
PRO.30.16	the thirsty earth
PRO.30.16	and a flaming fire.
PRO.30.17	Don't make fun of your father
PRO.30.17	or disobey your mother—
PRO.30.17	crows will peck out your eyes,
PRO.30.17	and buzzards will eat
PRO.30.17	the rest of you.
PRO.30.18	There are three or four things
PRO.30.18	I cannot understand:
PRO.30.19	or snakes crawl on rocks,
PRO.30.19	how ships sail the ocean
PRO.30.19	or people fall in love.
PRO.30.20	An unfaithful wife says,
PRO.30.20	“Sleeping with another man
PRO.30.20	is as natural as eating.”
PRO.30.21	There are three or four things
PRO.30.21	that make the earth tremble
PRO.30.21	and are unbearable:
PRO.30.22	A slave who becomes king,
PRO.30.22	a fool who eats too much,
PRO.30.23	a hateful woman
PRO.30.23	who finds a husband,
PRO.30.23	and a slave who takes the place
PRO.30.23	of the woman who owns her.
PRO.30.24	On this earth four things
PRO.30.24	are small but very wise:
PRO.30.25	Ants, who seem to be feeble,
PRO.30.25	but store up food
PRO.30.25	all summer long;
PRO.30.26	badgers, who seem to be weak,
PRO.30.26	but live among the rocks;
PRO.30.27	locusts, who have no king,
PRO.30.27	but march like an army;
PRO.30.28	lizards,
PRO.30.28	in your hand,
PRO.30.28	but sneak into palaces.
PRO.30.29	Three or four creatures
PRO.30.29	really strut around:
PRO.30.30	Those fearless lions
PRO.30.30	who rule the jungle,
PRO.30.31	those proud roosters,
PRO.30.31	those mountain goats,
PRO.30.31	and those rulers
PRO.30.31	who have no enemies.
PRO.30.32	If you are foolishly bragging
PRO.30.32	or planning something evil,
PRO.30.32	then stop it now!
PRO.30.33	If you churn milk
PRO.30.33	you get butter;
PRO.30.33	if you pound on your nose,
PRO.30.33	you get blood—
PRO.30.33	and if you stay angry,
PRO.30.33	you get in trouble.
PRO.31.1	These are the sayings
PRO.31.1	that King Lemuel of Massa
PRO.31.1	was taught by his mother.
PRO.31.2	My son Lemuel, you were born
PRO.31.2	in answer to my prayers,
PRO.31.2	so listen carefully.
PRO.31.3	Don't waste your life
PRO.31.3	chasing after women!
PRO.31.3	This has ruined many kings.
PRO.31.4	Kings and leaders
PRO.31.4	should not get drunk
PRO.31.4	or even want to drink.
PRO.31.5	Drinking makes you forget
PRO.31.5	your responsibilities,
PRO.31.5	and you mistreat the poor.
PRO.31.6	Beer and wine are only
PRO.31.6	for the dying or for those
PRO.31.6	who have lost all hope.
PRO.31.7	Let them drink and forget
PRO.31.7	how poor and miserable
PRO.31.7	they feel.
PRO.31.8	But you must defend
PRO.31.8	those who are helpless
PRO.31.8	and have no hope.
PRO.31.9	Be fair and give justice
PRO.31.9	to the poor and homeless.
PRO.31.10	A truly good wife
PRO.31.10	is the most precious treasure
PRO.31.10	a man can find!
PRO.31.11	Her husband depends on her,
PRO.31.11	and she never
PRO.31.11	lets him down.
PRO.31.12	She is good to him
PRO.31.12	every day of her life,
PRO.31.13	and with her own hands
PRO.31.13	she gladly makes clothes.
PRO.31.14	She is like a sailing ship
PRO.31.14	that brings food
PRO.31.14	from across the sea.
PRO.31.15	She gets up before daylight
PRO.31.15	to prepare food for her family
PRO.31.15	and for her servants.
PRO.31.16	She knows how to buy land
PRO.31.16	and how to plant a vineyard,
PRO.31.17	and she always works hard.
PRO.31.18	She knows when to buy or sell,
PRO.31.18	and she stays busy
PRO.31.18	until late at night.
PRO.31.19	She spins her own cloth,
PRO.31.20	and she helps the poor
PRO.31.20	and the needy.
PRO.31.21	Her family has warm clothing,
PRO.31.21	and so she doesn't worry
PRO.31.21	when it snows.
PRO.31.22	She does her own sewing,
PRO.31.22	and everything she wears
PRO.31.22	is beautiful.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is a well-known
PRO.31.23	and respected leader
PRO.31.23	in the city.
PRO.31.24	She makes clothes to sell
PRO.31.24	to the shop owners.
PRO.31.25	She is strong and graceful,
PRO.31.25	as well as cheerful
PRO.31.25	about the future.
PRO.31.26	Her words are sensible,
PRO.31.26	and her advice
PRO.31.26	is thoughtful.
PRO.31.27	She takes good care
PRO.31.27	of her family
PRO.31.27	and is never lazy.
PRO.31.28	Her children praise her,
PRO.31.28	and with great pride
PRO.31.28	her husband says,
PRO.31.29	“There are many good women,
PRO.31.29	but you are the best!”
PRO.31.30	Charm can be deceiving,
PRO.31.30	and beauty fades away,
PRO.31.30	but a woman
PRO.31.30	who honors the 
PRO.31.30	deserves to be praised.
PRO.31.31	Show her respect—
PRO.31.31	praise her in public
PRO.31.31	for what she has done.
ECC.1.1	When the son of David was king in Jerusalem, he was known to be very wise,
ECC.1.2	Nothing makes sense!
ECC.1.2	Everything is nonsense.
ECC.1.2	I have seen it all—
ECC.1.2	nothing makes sense!
ECC.1.3	What is there to show
ECC.1.3	for all of our hard work
ECC.1.3	here on this earth?
ECC.1.4	but still the world
ECC.1.4	never changes.
ECC.1.5	The sun comes up,
ECC.1.5	the sun goes down;
ECC.1.5	it hurries right back
ECC.1.5	to where it started from.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows south,
ECC.1.6	the wind blows north;
ECC.1.6	round and round it blows
ECC.1.6	over and over again.
ECC.1.7	All rivers empty into the sea,
ECC.1.7	but it never spills over;
ECC.1.7	one by one the rivers return
ECC.1.7	to their source.
ECC.1.8	All of life is far more boring
ECC.1.8	than words could ever say.
ECC.1.8	Our eyes and our ears
ECC.1.8	are never satisfied
ECC.1.8	with what we see and hear.
ECC.1.9	Everything that happens
ECC.1.9	has happened before;
ECC.1.9	nothing is new,
ECC.1.9	nothing under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Someone might say,
ECC.1.10	“Here is something new!”
ECC.1.10	But it happened before,
ECC.1.10	long before we were born.
ECC.1.11	No one who lived in the past
ECC.1.11	is remembered anymore,
ECC.1.11	and everyone yet to be born
ECC.1.11	will be forgotten too.
ECC.1.12	I said these things when I lived in Jerusalem as king of Israel. 
ECC.1.13	With all my wisdom I tried to understand everything that happens here on earth. And God has made this so hard for us humans to do. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen it all, and everything is just as senseless as chasing the wind.
ECC.1.15	If something is crooked,
ECC.1.15	it can't be made straight;
ECC.1.15	if something isn't there,
ECC.1.15	it can't be counted.
ECC.1.17	Then I decided to find out all I could about wisdom and foolishness. Soon I realized that this too was as senseless as chasing the wind.
ECC.1.18	The more you know,
ECC.1.18	the more you hurt;
ECC.1.18	the more you understand,
ECC.1.18	the more you suffer.
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Have fun and enjoy yourself!” But this didn't make sense. 
ECC.2.2	Laughing and having fun is crazy. What good does it do? 
ECC.2.3	I wanted to find out what was best for us during the short time we have on this earth. So I decided to make myself happy with wine and find out what it means to be foolish, without really being foolish myself.
ECC.2.5	I had flower gardens and orchards full of fruit trees. 
ECC.2.6	And I had pools where I could get water for the trees. 
ECC.2.7	 I owned slaves, and their sons and daughters became my slaves. I had more sheep and goats than anyone who had ever lived in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	 Foreign rulers brought me silver, gold, and precious treasures. Men and women sang for me, and I had many wives
ECC.2.10	I got whatever I wanted and did whatever made me happy. But most of all, I enjoyed my work. 
ECC.2.11	Then I thought about everything I had done, including the hard work, and it was simply chasing the wind.
ECC.2.12	I asked myself, “What can the next king do that I haven't done?” Then I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and stupidity. 
ECC.2.13	And I discovered that wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. 
ECC.2.14	Wisdom is like having two good eyes; foolishness leaves you in the dark. But wise or foolish, we all end up the same.
ECC.2.15	Finally, I said to myself, “Being wise got me nowhere! The same thing will happen to me that happens to fools. Nothing makes sense. 
ECC.2.16	Wise or foolish, we all die and are soon forgotten.” 
ECC.2.17	This made me hate life. Everything we do is painful; it's just as senseless as chasing the wind.
ECC.2.18	Suddenly I realized that others would someday get everything I had worked for so hard, then I started hating it all. 
ECC.2.19	Who knows if those people will be sensible or stupid? Either way, they will own everything I have earned by hard work and wisdom. It doesn't make sense.
ECC.2.20	I thought about all my hard work, and I felt depressed. 
ECC.2.21	When we use our wisdom, knowledge, and skill to get what we own, why do we have to leave it to someone who didn't work for it? This is senseless and wrong. 
ECC.2.22	What do we really gain from all of our hard work? 
ECC.2.23	 Our bodies ache during the day, and work is torture. Then at night our thoughts are troubled. It just doesn't make sense.
ECC.2.25	and no one enjoys eating and living more than I do. 
ECC.2.26	 If we please God, he will make us wise, understanding, and happy. But if we sin, God will make us struggle for a living, then he will give all we own to someone who pleases him. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.
ECC.3.1	Everything on earth
ECC.3.1	has its own time
ECC.3.1	and its own season.
ECC.3.2	There is a time
ECC.3.2	for birth and death,
ECC.3.2	planting and reaping,
ECC.3.3	for killing and healing,
ECC.3.3	destroying and building,
ECC.3.4	for crying and laughing,
ECC.3.4	weeping and dancing,
ECC.3.5	for throwing stones
ECC.3.5	and gathering stones,
ECC.3.5	embracing and parting.
ECC.3.6	There is a time
ECC.3.6	for finding and losing,
ECC.3.6	keeping and giving,
ECC.3.7	for tearing and sewing,
ECC.3.7	listening and speaking.
ECC.3.8	There is also a time
ECC.3.8	for love and hate,
ECC.3.8	for war and peace.
ECC.3.9	What do we gain by all our hard work? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen what difficult things God demands of us. 
ECC.3.11	God makes everything happen at the right time. Yet none of us can ever fully understand all he has done, and he puts questions in our minds about the past and the future. 
ECC.3.12	I know the best thing we can do is to always enjoy life, 
ECC.3.13	because God's gift to us is the happiness we get from our food and drink and from the work we do. 
ECC.3.14	Everything God has done will last forever; nothing he does can ever be changed. God has done all this, so that we will worship him.
ECC.3.15	Everything that happens
ECC.3.15	has happened before,
ECC.3.15	and all that will be
ECC.3.15	has already been—
ECC.3.15	God does everything
ECC.3.15	over and over again.
ECC.3.16	Everywhere on earth I saw violence and injustice instead of fairness and justice. 
ECC.3.17	So I told myself that God has set a time and a place for everything. He will judge everyone, both the wicked and the good. 
ECC.3.18	I know God is testing us to show us that we are merely animals. 
ECC.3.19	Like animals we breathe and die, and we are no better off than they are. It just doesn't make sense. 
ECC.3.20	All living creatures go to the same place. We are made from earth, and we return to earth. 
ECC.3.21	Who really knows if our spirits go up and the spirits of animals go down into the earth? 
ECC.3.22	We were meant to enjoy our work, and that's the best thing we can do. We can never know the future.
ECC.4.1	I looked again and saw people being mistreated everywhere on earth. They were crying, but no one was there to offer comfort, and those who mistreated them were powerful. 
ECC.4.2	I said to myself, “The dead are better off than the living. 
ECC.4.3	But those who have never been born are better off than anyone else, because they have never seen the terrible things that happen on this earth.”
ECC.4.4	Then I realized that we work and do wonderful things just because we are jealous of others. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.
ECC.4.5	Fools will fold their hands
ECC.4.5	and starve to death.
ECC.4.6	Yet a very little food
ECC.4.6	eaten in peace
ECC.4.6	is better than twice as much
ECC.4.6	earned from overwork
ECC.4.6	and chasing the wind.
ECC.4.7	Once again I saw that nothing on earth makes sense. 
ECC.4.8	For example, some people don't have friends or family. But they are never satisfied with what they own, and they never stop working to get more. They should ask themselves, “Why am I always working to have more? Who will get what I leave behind?” What a senseless and miserable life!
ECC.4.9	You are better having a friend than to be all alone, because then you will get more enjoyment out of what you earn. 
ECC.4.10	If you fall, your friend can help you up. But if you fall without having a friend nearby, you are really in trouble. 
ECC.4.11	If you sleep alone, you won't have anyone to keep you warm on a cold night. 
ECC.4.12	Someone might be able to beat up one of you, but not both of you. As the saying goes, “A rope made from three strands of cord is hard to break.”
ECC.4.13	You may be poor and young, but if you are wise, you are better off than a foolish old king who won't listen to advice. 
ECC.4.14	Even if you were not born into the royal family and have been a prisoner and poor, you can still be king. 
ECC.4.15	I once saw everyone in the world follow a young leader who came to power after the king was gone. 
ECC.4.16	His followers could not even be counted. But years from now, no one will praise him—this makes no more sense than chasing the wind.
ECC.5.1	Be careful what you do when you enter the house of God. Fools go there to offer sacrifices, because all they do is sin.
ECC.5.2	Don't talk before you think or make promises to God without thinking them through. God is in heaven, and you are on earth, so don't talk too much. 
ECC.5.3	If you keep thinking about something, you will dream about it. If you talk too much, you will say the wrong thing.
ECC.5.5	It's better not to make a promise at all than to make one and not keep it. 
ECC.5.6	Don't let your mouth get you in trouble! And don't say to the worship leader,
ECC.5.7	Respect and obey God! Daydreaming leads to a lot of senseless talk.
ECC.5.8	Don't be surprised if the poor of your country are abused, and injustice takes the place of justice. After all, the lower officials must do what the higher ones order them to do. 
ECC.5.9	And since the king is the highest official, he benefits most from the taxes paid on the land.
ECC.5.10	If you love money and wealth, you will never be satisfied with what you have. This doesn't make a bit of sense. 
ECC.5.11	The more you have, the more everyone expects from you. Your money won't do you any good—others will just spend it for you. 
ECC.5.12	If you have to work hard for a living, you can rest well at night, even if you don't have much to eat. But if you are rich, you can't even sleep.
ECC.5.13	I have seen something terribly unfair. People get rich, but it does them no good. 
ECC.5.14	Suddenly they lose everything in a bad business deal, then have nothing to leave for their children. 
ECC.5.15	 They came into this world naked, and when they die, they will be just as naked. They can't take anything with them, and they won't have anything to show for all their work. 
ECC.5.16	That's terribly unfair. They leave the world just as they came. They gained nothing from running after the wind. 
ECC.5.17	Besides all this, they are always gloomy at mealtime, and they are troubled, sick, and bitter.
ECC.5.18	What is the best thing to do in the short life God has given us? I think we should enjoy eating, drinking, and working hard. This is what God intends for us to do. 
ECC.5.19	Suppose you are very rich and able to enjoy everything you own. Then go ahead and enjoy working hard—this is God's gift to you. 
ECC.5.20	God will keep you so happy that you won't have time to worry about each day.
ECC.6.1	There is something else terribly unfair, and it troubles everyone on earth. 
ECC.6.2	God may give you everything you want—money, property, and wealth. Then God doesn't let you enjoy it, and someone you don't even know gets it all. That's senseless and terribly unfair!
ECC.6.3	You may live a long time and have a hundred children. But a child born dead is better off than you, unless you enjoy life and have a decent burial. 
ECC.6.4+ECC.6.5	That child will never live to see the sun or to have a name, and it will go straight to the world of darkness. But it will still find more rest than you, 
ECC.6.6	even if you live two thousand years and don't enjoy life. As you know, we all end up in the same place.
ECC.6.7	We struggle just to have enough to eat, but we are never satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	We may be sensible, yet we are no better off than a fool. And if we are poor, it still doesn't do us any good to try to live right. 
ECC.6.9	It's better to enjoy what we have than to always want something else, because that makes no more sense than chasing the wind.
ECC.6.10	Everything that happens was decided long ago. We humans know what we are like, and we can't argue with God, because he is
ECC.6.11	The more we talk, the less sense we make, so what good does it do to talk? 
ECC.6.12	Life is short and meaningless, and it fades away like a shadow. Who knows what is best for us? Who knows what will happen after we are gone?
ECC.7.1	at the time of death
ECC.7.1	is better than loving care
ECC.7.1	at the time of birth.
ECC.7.2	It's better to go to a funeral
ECC.7.2	than to attend a feast;
ECC.7.2	funerals remind us
ECC.7.2	that we all must die.
ECC.7.3	Choose sorrow over laughter
ECC.7.3	because a sad face
ECC.7.3	may hide a happy heart.
ECC.7.4	A sensible person mourns,
ECC.7.4	but fools always laugh.
ECC.7.5	Correction from someone wise
ECC.7.5	is better by far
ECC.7.5	than praise from fools.
ECC.7.6	Foolish laughter is stupid.
ECC.7.6	It sounds like thorns
ECC.7.6	crackling in a fire.
ECC.7.7	Corruption
ECC.7.7	of sensible people,
ECC.7.7	and bribes can ruin you.
ECC.7.8	Something completed is better
ECC.7.8	than something just begun;
ECC.7.8	patience is better
ECC.7.8	than too much pride.
ECC.7.9	and hold a grudge.
ECC.7.10	It isn't wise to ask,
ECC.7.10	“Why is everything worse
ECC.7.10	than it used to be?”
ECC.7.11	Having wisdom is better
ECC.7.11	than an inheritance.
ECC.7.12	Wisdom will protect you
ECC.7.12	just like money;
ECC.7.12	knowledge with good sense
ECC.7.12	will lead you to life.
ECC.7.13	Think of what God has done!
ECC.7.13	If God makes something crooked,
ECC.7.13	can you make it straight?
ECC.7.14	When times are good,
ECC.7.14	you should be cheerful;
ECC.7.14	when times are bad,
ECC.7.14	think about what it means.
ECC.7.14	God makes them both
ECC.7.14	to keep us from knowing
ECC.7.14	what will happen next.
ECC.7.15	I have seen everything during this senseless life of mine. I have seen good citizens die for doing the right thing, while criminals live and prosper. 
ECC.7.16	So don't destroy yourself by being too good or acting too smart! 
ECC.7.17	Don't die before your time by being too evil or acting like a fool. 
ECC.7.18	Keep to the middle of the road. You can do this if you truly respect God.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom will make you stronger than the ten most powerful leaders in your city.
ECC.7.20	No one in this world always does right.
ECC.7.21	Don't listen to everything that everyone says, or you might hear your servant cursing you. 
ECC.7.22	Haven't you cursed many others?
ECC.7.23	I told myself that I would be smart and try to understand all this, but it was too much for me. 
ECC.7.24	The truth is beyond us. It's far too deep. 
ECC.7.25	So I decided to learn everything I could and become wise enough to discover what life is all about. At the same time, I wanted to understand why it's stupid and senseless to be an evil fool.
ECC.7.26	Here is what I discovered: A bad woman is worse than death. She is a trap, reaching out with body and soul to catch you. But if you obey God, you can escape. If you don't obey, you are done for. 
ECC.7.27	With all my wisdom I have tried to find out how everything fits together, 
ECC.7.28	but so far I have not been able to. I do know there is one good man in a thousand, but never have I found a good woman. 
ECC.7.29	I did learn one thing: We were completely honest when God created us, but now we have twisted minds.
ECC.8.1	Who is smart enough
ECC.8.1	to explain everything?
ECC.8.1	Wisdom makes you cheerful
ECC.8.1	and gives you a smile.
ECC.8.2	If you promised God that you would be loyal to the king, I advise you to keep that promise. 
ECC.8.3	Don't quickly oppose the king or argue when he has already made up his mind. 
ECC.8.4	The king's word is law. No one can ask him, “Why are you doing this?” 
ECC.8.5	If you obey the king, you will stay out of trouble. So be wise and learn what to do and when to do it. 
ECC.8.6	Life is hard, but there is a time and a place for everything, 
ECC.8.7	though no one can tell the future. 
ECC.8.8	We cannot control the wind
ECC.8.9	I noticed all this and thought seriously about what goes on in the world. Why does one person have the power to hurt another?
ECC.8.10	I saw the wicked buried with honor, but God's people had to leave the holy city and were forgotten.
ECC.8.11	When we see criminals commit crime after crime without being punished, it makes us want to start a life of crime. 
ECC.8.12	They commit hundreds of crimes and live a long time, in spite of the saying:
ECC.8.12	Everyone who lives right
ECC.8.12	and respects God
ECC.8.12	will prosper,
ECC.8.13	but no one who sins
ECC.8.13	and rejects God
ECC.8.13	will prosper or live very long.
ECC.8.14	There is something else that doesn't make sense to me. Good citizens are treated as criminals, while criminals are honored as though they were good citizens. 
ECC.8.15	So I think we should get as much out of life as we possibly can. There is nothing better than to enjoy our food and drink and have a good time. Then we can make it through this troublesome life that God has given us here on earth.
ECC.8.16	Day and night I went without sleep, trying to understand what goes on in this world. 
ECC.8.17	I saw everything God does, and I realized no one can really understand what happens. We may be very wise, but no matter how much we try or how much we claim to know, we cannot understand it all.
ECC.9.1	I thought about these things. Then I understood that God has power over everyone, even those who are wise and live right. Anything can happen to any one of us, and so we never know if life will be good or bad.
ECC.9.2	But exactly
ECC.9.3	It's terribly unfair for the same thing to happen to each of us. We are mean and foolish while we live, and then we die. 
ECC.9.4	As long as we are alive, we still have hope, just as a live dog is better off than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	We know we will die, but the dead don't know a thing. Nothing good will happen to them—they are gone and forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Their loves, their hates, and their jealous feelings have all disappeared with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens on this earth.
ECC.9.7	So be happy and enjoy eating and drinking! God decided long ago that this is what you should do. 
ECC.9.8	Dress up, comb your hair, and look your best. 
ECC.9.9	Life is short, and you love your wife, so enjoy being with her. This is what you are supposed to do as you struggle through life on this earth. 
ECC.9.10	Work hard at whatever you do. You will soon go to the world of the dead, where no one works or thinks or reasons or even knows anything.
ECC.9.11	Here is something else I have learned:
ECC.9.11	The fastest runners
ECC.9.11	and the greatest heroes
ECC.9.11	don't always win races
ECC.9.11	and battles.
ECC.9.11	Wisdom, intelligence, and skill
ECC.9.11	don't always make you healthy,
ECC.9.11	rich, or popular.
ECC.9.11	We each have our own share
ECC.9.11	of misfortune.
ECC.9.12	None of us know when we might fall victim to a sudden disaster and find ourselves like fish in a net or birds in a trap.
ECC.9.13	Once I saw what people really think of wisdom, and it made an impression on me. 
ECC.9.14	It happened when a powerful ruler surrounded and attacked a small city where only a few people lived. The enemy army was getting ready to break through the city walls. 
ECC.9.15	But the city was saved by the wisdom of a poor person who was soon forgotten. 
ECC.9.16	So I decided that wisdom is better than strength. Yet if you are poor, no one pays any attention to you, no matter how smart you are.
ECC.9.17	Words of wisdom spoken softly
ECC.9.17	make much more sense
ECC.9.17	than the shouts of a ruler
ECC.9.17	to a crowd of fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is more powerful
ECC.9.18	than weapons,
ECC.9.18	yet one mistake can destroy
ECC.9.18	all the good you have done.
ECC.10.1	A few dead flies in perfume
ECC.10.1	make all of it stink,
ECC.10.1	and a little foolishness
ECC.10.1	outweighs a lot of wisdom.
ECC.10.2	Sensible thoughts lead you
ECC.10.2	to do right;
ECC.10.2	foolish thoughts lead you
ECC.10.2	to do wrong.
ECC.10.3	Fools show their stupidity
ECC.10.3	by the way they live;
ECC.10.3	it's easy to see
ECC.10.3	they have no sense.
ECC.10.4	Don't give up your job
ECC.10.4	when your boss gets angry.
ECC.10.4	If you stay calm,
ECC.10.4	you'll be forgiven.
ECC.10.5	Rulers do some things that are terribly unfair: 
ECC.10.6	They honor fools, but dishonor the rich; 
ECC.10.7	they let slaves ride on horses, but force slave owners to walk.
ECC.10.8	you might fall in;
ECC.10.8	if you break down a wall,
ECC.10.8	a snake might bite you.
ECC.10.9	You could even get hurt
ECC.10.9	by chiseling a stone
ECC.10.9	or chopping a log.
ECC.10.10	If you don't sharpen your ax,
ECC.10.10	it will be harder to use;
ECC.10.10	if you are wise,
ECC.10.10	you'll know what to do.
ECC.10.11	The power to charm a snake
ECC.10.11	does you no good
ECC.10.11	if it bites you anyway.
ECC.10.12	If you talk sensibly,
ECC.10.12	you will have friends;
ECC.10.12	if you talk foolishly,
ECC.10.12	you will destroy yourself.
ECC.10.13	Fools begin with nonsense,
ECC.10.13	and their stupid chatter
ECC.10.13	ends with disaster.
ECC.10.14	They never tire of talking,
ECC.10.14	but none of us really know
ECC.10.14	what the future will bring.
ECC.10.15	Fools wear themselves out—
ECC.10.15	they don't know enough
ECC.10.15	to find their way home.
ECC.10.16	A country is in for trouble
ECC.10.16	when its ruler is childish,
ECC.10.16	and its leaders
ECC.10.16	party all day long.
ECC.10.17	But a nation will prosper
ECC.10.17	when its ruler is mature,
ECC.10.17	and its leaders
ECC.10.17	don't party too much.
ECC.10.18	Some people are too lazy
ECC.10.18	to fix a leaky roof—
ECC.10.18	then the house collapses.
ECC.10.19	Eating and drinking
ECC.10.19	make you feel happy,
ECC.10.19	and money can buy
ECC.10.19	everything you need.
ECC.10.20	Don't let yourself think about
ECC.10.20	cursing the king;
ECC.10.20	don't curse the rich,
ECC.10.20	not even in secret.
ECC.10.20	A little bird might hear
ECC.10.20	and tell everything.
ECC.11.1	Be generous, and someday
ECC.11.1	you will be rewarded.
ECC.11.2	Share what you have
ECC.11.2	with seven or eight others,
ECC.11.2	because you never know
ECC.11.2	when disaster may strike.
ECC.11.3	Rain clouds always bring rain;
ECC.11.3	trees always stay
ECC.11.3	wherever they fall.
ECC.11.4	If you worry about the weather
ECC.11.4	and don't plant seeds,
ECC.11.4	you won't harvest a crop.
ECC.11.5	No one can explain how a baby breathes before it is born.
ECC.11.6	Plant your seeds early in the morning and keep working in the field until dark. Who knows? Your work might pay off, and your seeds might produce.
ECC.11.7	Nothing on earth is more beautiful than the morning sun. 
ECC.11.8	Even if you have a very long life, you should try to enjoy each day, because darkness will come and will last a long time. Nothing makes sense.
ECC.11.9	Be cheerful and enjoy life while you are young! Do what you want and find pleasure in what you see. But don't forget that God will judge you for everything you do.
ECC.11.10	Rid yourself of all worry and pain, because the wonderful moments of youth quickly disappear.
ECC.12.1	Keep your Creator in mind while you are young! In years to come, you will be burdened down with troubles and say, “I don't enjoy life anymore.”
ECC.12.2	Someday the light of the sun
ECC.12.2	and the moon and the stars
ECC.12.2	will all seem dim to you.
ECC.12.2	Rain clouds will remain
ECC.12.2	over your head.
ECC.12.3	Your body will grow feeble,
ECC.12.3	your teeth will decay,
ECC.12.3	and your eyesight fail.
ECC.12.4	The noisy grinding of grain
ECC.12.4	and the voices of singers
ECC.12.4	will be shut out
ECC.12.4	by your deaf ears,
ECC.12.4	but even the song of a bird
ECC.12.4	will keep you awake.
ECC.12.5	You will be afraid
ECC.12.5	to climb up a hill
ECC.12.5	or walk down a road.
ECC.12.5	Your hair will turn as white
ECC.12.5	as almond blossoms.
ECC.12.5	You will feel lifeless
ECC.12.5	and drag along
ECC.12.5	like an old grasshopper.
ECC.12.5	We each go to our eternal home,
ECC.12.5	and the streets here are filled
ECC.12.5	with those who mourn.
ECC.12.6	The silver cord snaps,
ECC.12.6	the golden bowl breaks;
ECC.12.6	the water pitcher is smashed,
ECC.12.6	and the pulley at the well
ECC.12.6	is shattered.
ECC.12.7	So our bodies return
ECC.12.7	to the earth,
ECC.12.7	and the life-giving breath
ECC.12.7	returns to God.
ECC.12.8	Nothing makes sense.
ECC.12.8	I have seen it all—
ECC.12.8	nothing makes sense.
ECC.12.9	I was a wise teacher with much understanding, and I collected a number of proverbs that I had carefully studied. 
ECC.12.10	Then I tried to explain these things in the best and most accurate way.
ECC.12.11	Words of wisdom are like the stick a farmer uses to make animals move. These sayings come from a shepherd,
ECC.12.12	My child, I warn you to stay away from any teachings except these.
ECC.12.12	There is no end to books,
ECC.12.12	and too much study
ECC.12.12	will wear you out.
ECC.12.13	Everything you were taught can be put into a few words:
ECC.12.13	Respect and obey God!
ECC.12.13	This is what life
ECC.12.13	is all about.
ECC.12.14	God will judge
ECC.12.14	everything we do,
ECC.12.14	even what is done in secret,
ECC.12.14	whether good or bad.
SNG.1.1	most beautiful song.
SNG.1.2	Kiss me tenderly!
SNG.1.2	Your love is better than wine,
SNG.1.3	and you smell so sweet.
SNG.1.3	All the young women adore you;
SNG.1.3	the very mention of your name
SNG.1.3	is like spreading perfume.
SNG.1.3	* 
SNG.1.4	Hurry, my king! Let's hurry.
SNG.1.4	Take me to your home.
SNG.1.4	We are happy for you!
SNG.1.4	And we praise your love
SNG.1.4	even more than wine.
SNG.1.4	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.4	it is only right
SNG.1.4	that you should adore him.
SNG.1.5	My skin is dark and beautiful,
SNG.1.5	like a tent in the desert
SNG.1.5	or like Solomon's curtains.
SNG.1.6	Don't stare at me
SNG.1.6	just because the sun
SNG.1.6	has darkened my skin.
SNG.1.6	My brothers were angry with me;
SNG.1.6	they made me work in the vineyard,
SNG.1.6	and so I neglected
SNG.1.6	my complexion.
SNG.1.7	My darling, I love you!
SNG.1.7	Where do you feed your sheep
SNG.1.7	and let them rest at noon?
SNG.1.7	Don't let the other shepherds
SNG.1.7	think badly of me.
SNG.1.7	I'm not one of those women
SNG.1.7	who shamelessly follow
SNG.1.7	after shepherds.
SNG.1.8	My dearest, if you don't know,
SNG.1.8	just follow the path
SNG.1.8	of the sheep.
SNG.1.8	Then feed your young goats
SNG.1.8	near the shepherds' tents.
SNG.1.9	You move as gracefully
SNG.1.9	as the pony that leads
SNG.1.9	the chariot of the king.
SNG.1.10	Earrings add to your beauty,
SNG.1.10	and you wear a necklace
SNG.1.10	of precious stones.
SNG.1.11	Let's make you some jewelry
SNG.1.11	of gold, woven with silver.
SNG.1.12	My king, while you
SNG.1.12	were on your couch,
SNG.1.12	my aroma was a magic charm.
SNG.1.13	My darling, you are perfume
SNG.1.13	between my breasts;
SNG.1.14	you are flower blossoms
SNG.1.14	from the gardens of En-Gedi.
SNG.1.15	My darling, you are lovely,
SNG.1.15	so very lovely—
SNG.1.15	your eyes are those of a dove.
SNG.1.16	My love, you are handsome,
SNG.1.16	truly handsome—
SNG.1.16	the fresh green grass
SNG.1.16	will be our wedding bed
SNG.1.17	in the shade of cedar
SNG.1.17	and cypress trees.
SNG.2.1	I am merely a rose
SNG.2.1	from the land of Sharon,
SNG.2.1	a lily from the valley.
SNG.2.2	My darling, when compared
SNG.2.2	with other young women,
SNG.2.2	you are a lily among thorns.
SNG.2.3	And you, my love,
SNG.2.3	are an apple tree
SNG.2.3	among trees of the forest.
SNG.2.3	Your shade brought me pleasure;
SNG.2.3	your fruit was sweet.
SNG.2.4	You led me to your banquet room
SNG.2.4	and showered me with love.
SNG.2.5	Refresh and strengthen me
SNG.2.5	with raisins and apples.
SNG.2.5	I am hungry for love!
SNG.2.6	Put your left hand under my head
SNG.2.6	and embrace me
SNG.2.6	with your right arm.
SNG.2.7	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	promise me by the power
SNG.2.7	of deer and gazelles
SNG.2.7	never to awaken love
SNG.2.7	before it is ready.
SNG.2.8	I hear the voice
SNG.2.8	of the one I love,
SNG.2.8	as he comes leaping
SNG.2.8	over mountains and hills
SNG.2.9	like a deer or a gazelle.
SNG.2.9	Now he stands outside our wall,
SNG.2.9	looking through the window
SNG.2.10	and speaking to me.
SNG.2.10	My darling, I love you!
SNG.2.10	Let's go away together.
SNG.2.11	Winter is past,
SNG.2.11	the rain has stopped;
SNG.2.12	flowers cover the earth,
SNG.2.12	it's time to sing.
SNG.2.12	The cooing of doves
SNG.2.12	is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	Fig trees are bearing fruit,
SNG.2.13	while blossoms on grapevines
SNG.2.13	fill the air with perfume.
SNG.2.13	My darling, I love you!
SNG.2.13	Let's go away together.
SNG.2.14	You are my dove
SNG.2.14	hiding among the rocks
SNG.2.14	on the side of a cliff.
SNG.2.14	Let me see how lovely you are!
SNG.2.14	Let me hear the sound
SNG.2.14	of your melodious voice.
SNG.2.15	Our vineyards are in blossom;
SNG.2.15	we must catch the little foxes
SNG.2.15	that destroy the vineyards.
SNG.2.16	My darling, I am yours,
SNG.2.16	and you are mine,
SNG.2.16	as you feed your sheep
SNG.2.16	among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Pretend to be a young deer
SNG.2.17	dancing on mountain slopes
SNG.2.17	until daylight comes
SNG.2.17	and shadows fade away.
SNG.3.1	While in bed at night,
SNG.3.1	I reached for the one I love
SNG.3.1	with heart and soul.
SNG.3.1	I looked for him,
SNG.3.1	but he wasn't there.
SNG.3.2	So I searched through the town
SNG.3.2	for the one I love.
SNG.3.2	I looked on every street,
SNG.3.2	but he wasn't there.
SNG.3.3	I even asked the guards
SNG.3.3	patrolling the town,
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen the one
SNG.3.3	I love so much?”
SNG.3.4	Right after that, I found him.
SNG.3.4	I held him and would not let go
SNG.3.4	until I had taken him
SNG.3.4	to the home of my mother.
SNG.3.5	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	promise me by the power
SNG.3.5	of deer and gazelles,
SNG.3.5	never to awaken love
SNG.3.5	before it is ready.
SNG.3.6	What do we see approaching
SNG.3.6	from the desert
SNG.3.6	like a cloud of smoke?
SNG.3.6	With it comes the sweet smell
SNG.3.6	of spices, including myrrh
SNG.3.6	and frankincense.
SNG.3.7	It is King Solomon
SNG.3.7	carried on a throne,
SNG.3.7	surrounded by sixty
SNG.3.7	of Israel's best soldiers.
SNG.3.8	Each of them wears a sword.
SNG.3.8	They are experts at fighting,
SNG.3.8	even in the dark.
SNG.3.9	The throne is made of trees
SNG.3.9	from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	Its posts are silver,
SNG.3.10	the back is gold,
SNG.3.10	and the seat is covered
SNG.3.10	with purple cloth.
SNG.3.10	You women of Jerusalem
SNG.3.10	have taken great care
SNG.3.10	to furnish the inside.
SNG.3.11	Now come and see the crown
SNG.3.11	given to Solomon by his mother
SNG.3.11	on his happy wedding day.
SNG.4.1	My darling, you are lovely,
SNG.4.1	so very lovely—
SNG.4.1	as you look through your veil,
SNG.4.1	your eyes are those of a dove.
SNG.4.1	Your hair tosses about
SNG.4.1	as gracefully as goats
SNG.4.1	coming down from Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are whiter
SNG.4.2	than sheep freshly washed;
SNG.4.2	they match perfectly,
SNG.4.2	not one is missing.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are crimson cords,
SNG.4.3	your mouth is shapely;
SNG.4.3	behind your veil are hidden
SNG.4.3	beautiful rosy cheeks.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is more graceful
SNG.4.4	than the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	decorated with thousands
SNG.4.4	of warriors' shields.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are perfect;
SNG.4.5	they are twin deer
SNG.4.5	feeding among lilies.
SNG.4.6	I will hasten to those hills
SNG.4.6	sprinkled with sweet perfume
SNG.4.6	and stay there till sunrise.
SNG.4.7	My darling, you are lovely
SNG.4.7	in every way.
SNG.4.8	My bride, together
SNG.4.8	we will leave Lebanon!
SNG.4.8	We will say goodbye
SNG.4.8	to the peaks of Mount Amana,
SNG.4.8	Senir, and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	where lions and leopards
SNG.4.8	live in the caves.
SNG.4.9	My bride, my very own,
SNG.4.9	you have stolen my heart!
SNG.4.9	With one glance from your eyes
SNG.4.9	and the glow of your necklace,
SNG.4.9	you have stolen my heart.
SNG.4.10	Your love is sweeter than wine;
SNG.4.10	the smell of your perfume
SNG.4.10	is more fragrant than spices.
SNG.4.11	Your lips are a honeycomb;
SNG.4.11	milk and honey
SNG.4.11	flow from your tongue.
SNG.4.11	Your dress has the aroma
SNG.4.11	of cedar trees from Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	My bride, my very own,
SNG.4.12	you are a garden, a fountain
SNG.4.12	closed off to all others.
SNG.4.13	Your arms
SNG.4.13	covered with delicious fruits
SNG.4.13	and all sorts of spices—
SNG.4.13	henna, nard, 
SNG.4.14	saffron,
SNG.4.14	calamus, cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	frankincense, myrrh, and aloes
SNG.4.14	—all the finest spices.
SNG.4.15	You are a spring in the garden,
SNG.4.15	a fountain of pure water,
SNG.4.15	and a refreshing stream
SNG.4.15	from Mount Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Let the north wind blow,
SNG.4.16	the south wind too!
SNG.4.16	Let them spread the aroma
SNG.4.16	of my garden,
SNG.4.16	so the one I love
SNG.4.16	may enter and taste
SNG.4.16	its delicious fruits.
SNG.5.1	My bride, my very own,
SNG.5.1	I come to my garden
SNG.5.1	and enjoy its spices.
SNG.5.1	I eat my honeycomb and honey;
SNG.5.1	I drink my wine and milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat and drink until
SNG.5.1	you are drunk with love.
SNG.5.2	I was asleep, but dreaming:
SNG.5.2	The one I love was at the door,
SNG.5.2	knocking and saying,
SNG.5.2	“My darling, my very own,
SNG.5.2	my flawless dove,
SNG.5.2	open the door for me!
SNG.5.2	My head is drenched
SNG.5.2	with evening dew.”
SNG.5.3	But I had already undressed
SNG.5.3	and bathed my feet.
SNG.5.3	Should I dress again
SNG.5.3	and get my feet dirty?
SNG.5.4	Then my darling's hand
SNG.5.4	reached to open the latch,
SNG.5.4	and my heart stood still.
SNG.5.5	When I rose to open the door,
SNG.5.5	my hands and my fingers
SNG.5.5	dripped with perfume.
SNG.5.6	And I yearned for him
SNG.5.6	while he spoke to me,
SNG.5.6	but when I opened the door,
SNG.5.6	my darling had disappeared.
SNG.5.6	I searched and shouted,
SNG.5.6	but I could not find him—
SNG.5.6	there was no answer.
SNG.5.7	Then I was found by the guards
SNG.5.7	patrolling the town
SNG.5.7	and guarding the wall.
SNG.5.7	They beat me up
SNG.5.7	and stripped off my robe.
SNG.5.8	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	if you find the one I love,
SNG.5.8	please say to him,
SNG.5.8	“She is weak with desire.”
SNG.5.9	Most beautiful of women,
SNG.5.9	why is the one you love
SNG.5.9	more special than others?
SNG.5.9	Why do you ask us
SNG.5.9	to tell him how you feel?
SNG.5.10	He is handsome and healthy,
SNG.5.10	the most outstanding
SNG.5.10	among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is purest gold;
SNG.5.11	his hair is wavy,
SNG.5.11	black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are a pair of doves
SNG.5.12	bathing in a stream
SNG.5.12	flowing with milk.
SNG.5.13	His face is a garden
SNG.5.13	of sweet-smelling spices;
SNG.5.13	his lips are lilies
SNG.5.13	dripping with perfume.
SNG.5.14	His arms are branches of gold
SNG.5.14	covered with jewels;
SNG.5.14	his body is ivory
SNG.5.14	decorated with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are columns of marble
SNG.5.15	on feet of gold.
SNG.5.15	He stands there majestic
SNG.5.15	like Mount Lebanon
SNG.5.15	and its choice cedar trees.
SNG.5.16	His kisses are sweet.
SNG.5.16	I desire him so much!
SNG.5.16	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.16	he is my lover and friend.
SNG.6.1	Most beautiful of women,
SNG.6.1	tell us where he has gone.
SNG.6.1	Let us help you find him.
SNG.6.2	My darling has gone down
SNG.6.2	to his garden of spices,
SNG.6.2	where he will feed his sheep
SNG.6.2	and gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am his, and he is mine,
SNG.6.3	as he feeds his sheep
SNG.6.3	among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	My dearest, the cities of Tirzah
SNG.6.4	and Jerusalem
SNG.6.4	are not as lovely as you.
SNG.6.4	Your charms are more powerful
SNG.6.4	than all of the stars
SNG.6.4	in the heavens.
SNG.6.5	Turn away your eyes—
SNG.6.5	they make me melt.
SNG.6.5	Your hair tosses about
SNG.6.5	as gracefully as goats
SNG.6.5	coming down from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are whiter
SNG.6.6	than sheep freshly washed;
SNG.6.6	they match perfectly,
SNG.6.6	not one is missing.
SNG.6.7	Behind your veil are hidden
SNG.6.7	beautiful rosy cheeks.
SNG.6.8	What if I could have
SNG.6.8	sixty queens, eighty wives,
SNG.6.8	and thousands of others!
SNG.6.9	You would be my only choice,
SNG.6.9	my flawless dove,
SNG.6.9	the favorite child
SNG.6.9	of your mother.
SNG.6.9	The young women, the queens,
SNG.6.9	and all the others
SNG.6.9	tell how excited you are
SNG.6.9	as they sing your praises:
SNG.6.10	“You are as majestic
SNG.6.10	as the morning sky—
SNG.6.10	glorious as the moon—
SNG.6.10	blinding as the sun!
SNG.6.10	Your charms are more powerful
SNG.6.10	than all the stars above.”
SNG.6.11	I went down to see if blossoms
SNG.6.11	were on the walnut trees,
SNG.6.11	grapevines, and fruit trees.
SNG.6.12	But in my imagination
SNG.6.12	I was suddenly riding
SNG.6.12	on a glorious chariot.
SNG.6.13	Dance! Dance!
SNG.6.13	Beautiful woman from Shulam,
SNG.6.13	let us see you dance!
SNG.6.13	Why do you want to see
SNG.6.13	this woman from Shulam
SNG.6.13	dancing with the others?
SNG.7.1	You are a princess,
SNG.7.1	and your feet are graceful
SNG.7.1	in their sandals.
SNG.7.1	Your thighs are works of art,
SNG.7.1	each one a jewel;
SNG.7.2	your navel is a wine glass
SNG.7.2	filled to overflowing.
SNG.7.2	Your body is full and slender
SNG.7.2	like a bundle of wheat
SNG.7.2	bound together by lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like twins
SNG.7.3	of a deer.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like ivory,
SNG.7.4	and your eyes sparkle
SNG.7.4	like the pools of Heshbon
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath-Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is beautiful
SNG.7.4	like Mount Lebanon
SNG.7.4	above the city of Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head is held high
SNG.7.5	like Mount Carmel;
SNG.7.5	your hair is so lovely
SNG.7.5	it holds a king prisoner.
SNG.7.6	You are very beautiful,
SNG.7.6	so desirable!
SNG.7.7	You are tall and slender
SNG.7.7	like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are full.
SNG.7.8	I will climb that tree
SNG.7.8	and cling to its branches.
SNG.7.8	I will discover that your breasts
SNG.7.8	are clusters of grapes,
SNG.7.8	and that your breath
SNG.7.8	is the aroma of apples.
SNG.7.9	Kissing you is more delicious
SNG.7.9	than drinking the finest wine.
SNG.7.9	How wonderful and tasty!
SNG.7.10	My darling, I am yours,
SNG.7.10	and you desire me.
SNG.7.11	Let's stroll through the fields
SNG.7.11	and sleep in the villages.
SNG.7.12	At dawn let's slip out and see
SNG.7.12	if grapevines and fruit trees
SNG.7.12	are covered with blossoms.
SNG.7.12	When we are there,
SNG.7.12	I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	Perfume from the magic flower
SNG.7.13	fills the air, my darling.
SNG.7.13	Right at our doorstep
SNG.7.13	I have stored up for you
SNG.7.13	all kinds of tasty fruits.
SNG.8.1	If you were my brother,
SNG.8.1	I could kiss you
SNG.8.1	whenever we happen to meet,
SNG.8.1	and no one would say
SNG.8.1	I did wrong.
SNG.8.2	I could take you to the home
SNG.8.2	of my mother,
SNG.8.2	who taught me all I know.
SNG.8.2	I would give you delicious wine
SNG.8.2	and fruit juice as well.
SNG.8.3	Put your left hand under my head
SNG.8.3	and embrace me
SNG.8.3	with your right arm.
SNG.8.4	Young women of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	promise me never to awaken love
SNG.8.4	before it is ready.
SNG.8.5	Who is this young woman
SNG.8.5	coming in from the desert
SNG.8.5	and leaning on the shoulder
SNG.8.5	of the one she loves?
SNG.8.5	I stirred up your passions
SNG.8.5	under the apple tree
SNG.8.5	where you were born.
SNG.8.6	Always keep me in your heart
SNG.8.6	and wear this bracelet
SNG.8.6	to remember me by.
SNG.8.6	The passion of love
SNG.8.6	bursting into flame
SNG.8.6	is more powerful than death,
SNG.8.6	stronger than the grave.
SNG.8.7	Love cannot be drowned
SNG.8.7	by oceans or floods.
SNG.8.7	It cannot be bought—
SNG.8.7	any offer would be scorned
SNG.8.7	no matter how great.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister
SNG.8.8	whose breasts
SNG.8.8	are not yet formed.
SNG.8.8	If someone asks to marry her,
SNG.8.8	what should we do?
SNG.8.9	She isn't a wall
SNG.8.9	that we can defend
SNG.8.9	behind a silver shield.
SNG.8.9	Neither is she a room
SNG.8.9	that we can protect
SNG.8.9	behind a wooden door.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall around a city,
SNG.8.10	my breasts are towers,
SNG.8.10	and just looking at me
SNG.8.10	brings him great pleasure.
SNG.8.11	Solomon has a vineyard
SNG.8.11	at Baal-Hamon,
SNG.8.11	which he rents to others
SNG.8.11	for a thousand pieces
SNG.8.11	of silver each.
SNG.8.12	My vineyard is mine alone!
SNG.8.12	Solomon can keep his silver
SNG.8.12	and the others can keep
SNG.8.12	their share of the profits.
SNG.8.13	You are in the garden
SNG.8.13	with friends all around.
SNG.8.13	Let me hear your voice!
SNG.8.14	Hurry to me, my darling!
SNG.8.14	Run faster than a deer
SNG.8.14	to mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	And this is the message
ISA.1.2	The 
ISA.1.2	“Listen, heaven and earth!
ISA.1.2	The children I raised
ISA.1.2	have turned against me.
ISA.1.3	Oxen and donkeys know
ISA.1.3	who owns and feeds them,
ISA.1.3	but my people won't ever learn.”
ISA.1.4	Israel, you are a sinful nation
ISA.1.4	loaded down with guilt.
ISA.1.4	You are wicked and corrupt
ISA.1.4	and have turned from the 
ISA.1.4	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.1.5	Why be punished more?
ISA.1.5	Why not give up your sin?
ISA.1.5	Your head is badly bruised,
ISA.1.5	and you are weak all over.
ISA.1.6	From your head to your toes
ISA.1.6	there isn't a healthy spot.
ISA.1.6	Bruises, cuts, and open sores
ISA.1.6	go without care
ISA.1.6	or oil to ease the pain.
ISA.1.7	Your country lies in ruins;
ISA.1.7	your towns are in ashes.
ISA.1.7	Foreigners and strangers
ISA.1.7	take and destroy your land
ISA.1.7	while you watch.
ISA.1.8	Enemies surround Jerusalem,
ISA.1.8	alone like a hut
ISA.1.8	in a vineyard
ISA.1.8	or in a cucumber field.
ISA.1.9	like Sodom and Gomorrah,
ISA.1.9	if the 
ISA.1.9	had not let a few
ISA.1.9	of its people survive.
ISA.1.10	You are no better
ISA.1.10	than the leaders and people
ISA.1.10	of Sodom and Gomorrah!
ISA.1.10	So listen to the 
ISA.1.11	mean nothing to me.
ISA.1.11	I am sick of your offerings
ISA.1.11	of rams and choice cattle;
ISA.1.11	I don't like the blood
ISA.1.11	of bulls or lambs or goats.
ISA.1.12	“Who asked you to bring all this
ISA.1.12	when you come to worship me?
ISA.1.12	Stay out of my temple!
ISA.1.13	Your sacrifices are worthless,
ISA.1.13	and your incense disgusting.
ISA.1.13	I can't stand the evil you do
ISA.1.13	on your New Moon Festivals
ISA.1.13	or on your Sabbaths
ISA.1.13	and other times of worship.
ISA.1.14	I hate your New Moon Festivals
ISA.1.14	and all others as well.
ISA.1.14	They are a heavy burden
ISA.1.14	I am tired of carrying.
ISA.1.15	“No matter how much you pray,
ISA.1.15	I won't listen.
ISA.1.15	You are too violent.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves clean!
ISA.1.16	I hate your filthy deeds.
ISA.1.16	Stop doing wrong
ISA.1.17	and learn to live right.
ISA.1.17	See that justice is done.
ISA.1.17	Defend widows and orphans
ISA.1.17	and help the oppressed.”
ISA.1.18	I, the 
ISA.1.18	to come and talk it over.
ISA.1.18	Your sins are scarlet red,
ISA.1.18	but they will be whiter
ISA.1.18	than snow or wool.
ISA.1.19	If you willingly obey me,
ISA.1.19	the best crops in the land
ISA.1.19	will be yours.
ISA.1.20	But if you turn against me,
ISA.1.20	your enemies will kill you.
ISA.1.20	I, the 
ISA.1.21	Jerusalem, you are like
ISA.1.21	an unfaithful wife.
ISA.1.21	Once your judges were honest
ISA.1.21	and your people lived right;
ISA.1.21	now you are a city
ISA.1.21	full of murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your silver is fake,
ISA.1.22	and your wine
ISA.1.22	is watered down.
ISA.1.23	Your leaders have rejected me
ISA.1.23	to become friends of crooks;
ISA.1.23	your rulers are looking
ISA.1.23	for gifts and bribes.
ISA.1.23	Widows and orphans
ISA.1.23	never get a fair trial.
ISA.1.24	I am the 
ISA.1.24	the mighty ruler of Israel,
ISA.1.24	and I make you a promise:
ISA.1.24	You are now my enemy,
ISA.1.24	and I will show my anger
ISA.1.24	by taking revenge on you.
ISA.1.25	I will punish you terribly
ISA.1.25	and burn away everything
ISA.1.25	that makes you unfit
ISA.1.25	to worship me.
ISA.1.26	Jerusalem, I will choose
ISA.1.26	judges and advisors
ISA.1.26	like those you had before.
ISA.1.26	Your new name will be
ISA.1.26	“Justice and Faithfulness.”
ISA.1.27	Jerusalem, you will be saved
ISA.1.27	by showing justice;
ISA.1.27	Zion's people who turn to me
ISA.1.27	will be saved
ISA.1.27	by doing right.
ISA.1.28	But those rebellious sinners
ISA.1.28	who turn against me, the 
ISA.1.28	will all disappear.
ISA.1.29	You will be made ashamed
ISA.1.29	of those groves of trees
ISA.1.29	where you worshiped idols.
ISA.1.30	You will be like a grove of trees
ISA.1.30	dying in a drought.
ISA.1.31	Your strongest leaders
ISA.1.31	will be like dry wood
ISA.1.31	set on fire by their idols.
ISA.1.31	No one will be able to help,
ISA.1.31	as they all go up in flames.
ISA.2.1	This is the message
ISA.2.2	In the future, the mountain
ISA.2.2	with the 
ISA.2.2	will be the highest of all.
ISA.2.2	It will reach above the hills;
ISA.2.2	every nation will rush to it.
ISA.2.3	Many people will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Let's go to the mountain
ISA.2.3	of the 
ISA.2.3	and worship in his temple.”
ISA.2.3	The 
ISA.2.3	from Jerusalem,
ISA.2.3	and we will obey him.
ISA.2.4	between nations.
ISA.2.4	They will pound their swords
ISA.2.4	and their spears
ISA.2.4	into rakes and shovels;
ISA.2.4	they will never make war
ISA.2.4	or attack one another.
ISA.2.5	People of Israel, let's live
ISA.2.5	by the light of the 
ISA.2.6	Our 
ISA.2.6	your people, Israel,
ISA.2.6	because they follow customs
ISA.2.6	of nations from the east.
ISA.2.6	They worship Philistine gods
ISA.2.6	and are close friends
ISA.2.6	of foreigners.
ISA.2.7	They have endless treasures
ISA.2.7	of silver and gold;
ISA.2.7	they have countless horses
ISA.2.7	and war chariots.
ISA.2.8	Everywhere in the country
ISA.2.8	they worship the idols
ISA.2.8	they have made.
ISA.2.9	And so, all of them
ISA.2.9	will be ashamed and disgraced.
ISA.2.9	Don't forgive them!
ISA.2.10	go hide among the rocks
ISA.2.10	and in the ground,
ISA.2.10	because the 
ISA.2.10	marvelous, and glorious.
ISA.2.11	When the 
ISA.2.11	everyone who is proud
ISA.2.11	will be made humble,
ISA.2.11	and the 
ISA.2.11	will be honored.
ISA.2.12	The 
ISA.2.12	has chosen a day
ISA.2.12	when those who are proud
ISA.2.12	and conceited
ISA.2.12	will be put down.
ISA.2.13	The tall and towering
ISA.2.13	cedars of Lebanon
ISA.2.13	will be destroyed.
ISA.2.13	So will the oak trees of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	all high mountains and hills,
ISA.2.15	every strong fortress,
ISA.2.16	all the seagoing ships,
ISA.2.16	and every beautiful boat.
ISA.2.17	When that day comes,
ISA.2.17	everyone who is proud
ISA.2.17	will be put down.
ISA.2.17	Only the 
ISA.2.18	Idols will be gone for good.
ISA.2.19	You had better hide
ISA.2.19	in caves and holes—
ISA.2.19	the 
ISA.2.19	marvelous, and glorious
ISA.2.19	when he comes to terrify
ISA.2.19	people on earth.
ISA.2.20	On that day everyone will throw
ISA.2.20	to the moles and bats
ISA.2.20	their idols of silver and gold
ISA.2.20	they made to worship.
ISA.2.21	The 
ISA.2.21	marvelous, and glorious
ISA.2.21	when he comes to terrify
ISA.2.21	people on earth—
ISA.2.21	they will hide in caves
ISA.2.21	and in the hills.
ISA.2.22	Stop trusting the power
ISA.2.22	of humans.
ISA.2.22	They are all going to die,
ISA.2.22	so how can they help?
ISA.3.1	The mighty 
ISA.3.1	is going to take away
ISA.3.1	from Jerusalem and Judah
ISA.3.1	everything you need—
ISA.3.1	your bread and water,
ISA.3.1	* 
ISA.3.2	soldiers and heroes,
ISA.3.2	judges and prophets,
ISA.3.2	leaders and army officers,
ISA.3.3	officials and advisors,
ISA.3.3	fortunetellers and others
ISA.3.3	who tell the future.
ISA.3.4	He will let children and babies
ISA.3.4	become your rulers.
ISA.3.5	You will each be cruel
ISA.3.5	to friends and neighbors.
ISA.3.5	Young people will insult
ISA.3.5	their elders;
ISA.3.5	no one will show respect
ISA.3.5	to those who deserve it.
ISA.3.6	Some of you will grab hold
ISA.3.6	of a relative and say,
ISA.3.6	“You still have a coat.
ISA.3.6	Be our leader and rule
ISA.3.6	this pile of ruins.”
ISA.3.7	But the answer will be,
ISA.3.7	“I can't do you any good.
ISA.3.7	Don't make me your leader.
ISA.3.7	There's no food or clothing
ISA.3.7	left in my house.”
ISA.3.8	Jerusalem and Judah,
ISA.3.8	you rebelled against
ISA.3.8	your glorious 
ISA.3.8	your words and your actions,
ISA.3.8	made you stumble and fall.
ISA.3.9	The look on your faces shows
ISA.3.9	that you are sinful as Sodom,
ISA.3.9	and you don't try to hide it.
ISA.3.9	You are in for trouble,
ISA.3.9	and you have brought it all
ISA.3.9	on yourselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell those who obey God,
ISA.3.10	“You're very fortunate—
ISA.3.10	you will be rewarded
ISA.3.10	for what you have done.”
ISA.3.11	Tell those who disobey,
ISA.3.11	“You're in big trouble—
ISA.3.11	what you did to others
ISA.3.11	will come back to you.”
ISA.3.12	Though you are God's people,
ISA.3.12	you are ruled and abused
ISA.3.12	by women and children.
ISA.3.12	You are confused by leaders
ISA.3.12	who guide you
ISA.3.12	down the wrong path.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	and judge all nations.
ISA.3.14	He will even judge
ISA.3.14	you rulers and leaders
ISA.3.14	of his own nation.
ISA.3.14	You destroyed his vineyard
ISA.3.14	and filled your houses
ISA.3.14	by robbing the poor.
ISA.3.15	The 
ISA.3.15	“You have crushed my people
ISA.3.15	and rubbed in the dirt
ISA.3.15	the faces of the poor.”
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.16	The women of Jerusalem
ISA.3.16	are proud and strut around,
ISA.3.16	winking shamelessly.
ISA.3.16	They wear anklets that jingle
ISA.3.16	and call attention
ISA.3.16	to the way they walk.
ISA.3.17	But I, the 
ISA.3.17	their heads with sores,
ISA.3.17	and I will uncover
ISA.3.17	their private parts.
ISA.3.18+ISA.3.19+ISA.3.20+ISA.3.21+ISA.3.22+ISA.3.23	When that day comes, I will take away from those women all the fine jewelry they wear on their ankles, heads, necks, ears, arms, noses, fingers, and on their clothes. I will remove their veils, their belts, their perfume, their magic charms, their royal robes, and all their fancy dresses, hats, and purses.
ISA.3.24	In place of perfume,
ISA.3.24	there will be a stink;
ISA.3.24	in place of belts,
ISA.3.24	there will be ropes;
ISA.3.24	in place of fancy hairdos,
ISA.3.24	they will have bald heads.
ISA.3.24	Instead of expensive clothes,
ISA.3.24	they will wear sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	instead of beauty,
ISA.3.24	they will have ugly scars.
ISA.3.25	The fighting men of Jerusalem
ISA.3.25	will be killed in battle.
ISA.3.26	The city will mourn
ISA.3.26	and sit in the dirt,
ISA.3.26	emptied of its people.
ISA.4.1	When this happens, seven women will grab the same man, and each of them will say, “I'll buy my own food and clothes! Just marry me and take away my disgrace.”
ISA.4.2	The time is coming when the 
ISA.4.3	Everyone who is left alive in Jerusalem will be called special, 
ISA.4.4	after the 
ISA.4.6	It will provide shade from the heat of the sun and a place of shelter and protection from storms and rain.
ISA.5.1	about my friend's vineyard
ISA.5.1	that was on the side
ISA.5.1	of a fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	My friend dug the ground,
ISA.5.2	removed the stones,
ISA.5.2	and planted the best vines.
ISA.5.2	He built a watchtower
ISA.5.2	and dug a pit in rocky ground
ISA.5.2	for pressing the grapes.
ISA.5.2	He hoped they would be sweet,
ISA.5.2	but bitter grapes
ISA.5.2	were all it produced.
ISA.5.3	Listen, people of Jerusalem
ISA.5.3	and of Judah!
ISA.5.3	You be the judge of me
ISA.5.3	and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could I have done
ISA.5.4	for my vineyard?
ISA.5.4	I hoped for sweet grapes,
ISA.5.4	but bitter grapes
ISA.5.4	were all that grew.
ISA.5.5	Now I will let you know
ISA.5.5	what I am going to do.
ISA.5.5	I will cut down the hedge
ISA.5.5	and tear down the wall.
ISA.5.5	My vineyard will be trampled
ISA.5.5	and left in ruins.
ISA.5.6	It will turn into a desert,
ISA.5.6	neither pruned nor hoed;
ISA.5.6	it will be covered
ISA.5.6	with thorns and briars.
ISA.5.6	I will command the clouds
ISA.5.6	not to send rain.
ISA.5.7	I am the 
ISA.5.7	Israel is the vineyard,
ISA.5.7	and Judah is the garden
ISA.5.7	I tended with care.
ISA.5.7	I had hoped for honesty
ISA.5.7	and for justice,
ISA.5.7	but dishonesty
ISA.5.7	and cries for mercy
ISA.5.7	were all I found.
ISA.5.8	You are in for trouble! You take over house after house and field after field, until there is no room left for anyone else in all the land. 
ISA.5.9	But the 
ISA.5.9	Those large and beautiful homes will be left empty, with no one to take care of them. 
ISA.5.10	Four hectares of grapevines will produce only 27 liters of juice, and 180 liters of seed will produce merely 18 liters of grain.
ISA.5.12	At your drinking parties you have the music of stringed instruments, tambourines, and flutes. But you never even think about all the 
ISA.5.13	and so his people know nothing about him. That's why many of you will be dragged off to foreign lands. Your leaders will starve to death, and everyone else will suffer from thirst.
ISA.5.14	The world of the dead has opened its mouth wide and is eagerly waiting for the leaders of Jerusalem and for its noisy crowds, especially for those who take pride in that city. 
ISA.5.15	Its citizens have been put down, and its proud people have been brought to shame. 
ISA.5.16	But the holy 
ISA.5.17	His people will be like sheep grazing in their own pasture, and they will take off what was left by others.
ISA.5.18	You are in for trouble! The lies you tell are like ropes by which you drag along sin and evil. 
ISA.5.19	And you say, “Let the holy God of Israel hurry up and do what he has promised, so we can see it for ourselves.” 
ISA.5.20	You are headed for trouble! You say wrong is right, darkness is light, and bitter is sweet.
ISA.5.21	You think you are clever and smart. 
ISA.5.22	And you are great at drinking and mixing drinks. But you are in for trouble. 
ISA.5.23	You accept bribes to let the guilty go free, and you cheat the innocent out of a fair trial.
ISA.5.24	You will go up in flames like straw and hay! You have rejected the teaching of the holy 
ISA.5.25	You are the 
ISA.5.26	The 
ISA.5.27	None of them are tired. They don't sleep or get drowsy, and they run without stumbling. Their belts don't come loose; their sandal straps don't break. 
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready. The hoofs of their horses are hard as flint; the wheels of their war chariots turn as fast as a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	They roar and growl like fierce young lions as they grab their victims and drag them off where no one can rescue them. 
ISA.5.30	On the day they attack, they will roar like the ocean. And across the land you will see nothing but darkness and trouble, because the light of day will be covered by thick clouds.
ISA.6.2	Flaming creatures with six wings each were flying over him. They covered their faces with two of their wings and their bodies with two more. They used the other two wings for flying, 
ISA.6.3	 as they shouted,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy,
ISA.6.3	The earth is filled
ISA.6.3	with your glory.”
ISA.6.5	Then I cried out, “I'm doomed! Everything I say is sinful, and so are the words of everyone around me. Yet I have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	One of the flaming creatures flew over to me with a burning coal that it had taken from the altar with a pair of metal tongs. 
ISA.6.7	It touched my lips with the hot coal and said, “This has touched your lips. Your sins are forgiven, and you are no longer guilty.”
ISA.6.8	After this, I heard the 
ISA.6.8	“I'll go,” I answered. “Send me!”
ISA.6.9	“You will listen and listen,
ISA.6.9	but never understand.
ISA.6.9	You will look and look,
ISA.6.9	but never see.”
ISA.6.9	The 
ISA.6.10	“Make these people stubborn!
ISA.6.10	Make them stop up
ISA.6.10	their ears,
ISA.6.10	cover their eyes,
ISA.6.10	and fail to understand.
ISA.6.10	Don't let them turn to me
ISA.6.10	and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I asked the 
ISA.6.11	The 
ISA.6.11	Until their towns are destroyed and their houses are deserted, until their fields are empty, 
ISA.6.12	and I have sent them far away, leaving their land in ruins. 
ISA.6.13	If only a tenth of the people are left, even they will be destroyed. But just as stumps remain after trees have been cut down,
ISA.7.2	When news reached the royal palace that Syria had joined forces with Israel, King Ahaz and everyone in Judah were so terrified that they shook like trees in a windstorm.
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.3	Take your son Shearjashub
ISA.7.4	Tell Ahaz to stop worrying. There's no need for him to be afraid of King Rezin and King Pekah. They are very angry, but they are nothing more than a dying fire. Ahaz doesn't need to fear 
ISA.7.5	their evil threats 
ISA.7.6	to invade and defeat Judah and Jerusalem and to let the son of Tabeel be king in his place.
ISA.7.7	I, the 
ISA.7.8+ISA.7.9	Damascus is just the capital of Syria, and King Rezin rules only in Damascus. Samaria is just the capital of Israel, and King Pekah rules only in Samaria. But in less than 65 years, Israel will be destroyed. And if Ahaz and his officials don't trust me, they will be defeated.
ISA.7.10	Once again the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask me for proof that my promise will come true. Ask for something to happen deep in the world of the dead or high in the heavens above.”
ISA.7.12	“No, 
ISA.7.13	Then I said:
ISA.7.13	Listen, every one of you in the royal family of David. You have already tried my patience. Now you are trying God's patience by refusing to ask for proof. 
ISA.7.14	 But the 
ISA.7.15+ISA.7.16	Even before the boy is old enough to know how to choose between right and wrong, he will eat yogurt and honey,
ISA.7.17	But the 
ISA.7.18	When that time comes, the 
ISA.7.19	They will settle everywhere—in the deep valleys and between the rocks, on every thornbush and all over the pastureland.
ISA.7.20	The Lord will pay the king of Assyria to bring a razor from across the Euphrates River and shave your head and every hair on your body, including your beard.
ISA.7.21	Anyone who is able to save only one young cow and two sheep, 
ISA.7.22	will have enough milk to make yogurt. In fact, everyone left in the land will eat yogurt and honey.
ISA.7.23	Vineyards that had 1,000 vines and were worth 1,000 pieces of silver will turn into thorn patches. 
ISA.7.24	You will go there to hunt with your bow and arrows, because the whole country will be covered with thornbushes. 
ISA.7.25	The hills where you once planted crops will be overgrown with thorns and thistles. You will be afraid to go there, and your cattle, sheep, and goats will be turned loose on those hills.
ISA.8.1	The 
ISA.8.2	I will tell Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah to serve as witnesses to this.”
ISA.8.3	Sometime later, my wife and I had a son, and the 
ISA.8.4	Because before he can say ‘Mommy’ or ‘Daddy,’ the king of Assyria will attack and take everything of value from Damascus and Samaria.”
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	These people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah
ISA.8.7	Now I will send the king of Assyria against them with his powerful army, which will attack like the mighty Euphrates River overflowing its banks. 
ISA.8.8	Enemy soldiers will cover Judah like a flood reaching up to your neck.
ISA.8.8	But God is with us.
ISA.8.8	He will spread his wings
ISA.8.8	and protect our land.
ISA.8.9	All of you foreign nations,
ISA.8.9	go ahead and prepare for war,
ISA.8.9	but you will be crushed.
ISA.8.10	Get together and make plans,
ISA.8.10	but you will fail
ISA.8.10	because God is with us.
ISA.8.11	The 
ISA.8.11	I'm warning you! Don't act like these people. 
ISA.8.12	 Don't call something a rebellious plot, just because they do, and don't be afraid of something, just because they are. 
ISA.8.13	I am the one you should fear and respect. I am the holy God, the 
ISA.8.14+ISA.8.15	 Run to me for protection. I am a rock that will make both Judah and Israel stumble and break their bones. I am a trap that will catch the people of Jerusalem—they will be captured and dragged away.
ISA.8.16	My message and my teachings are to be sealed and given to my followers. 
ISA.8.17	 Meanwhile, I patiently trust the 
ISA.8.18	 My children and I are warning signs to Israel from the 
ISA.8.19	Someone may say to you, “Go to the fortunetellers who make soft chirping sounds or ask the spirits of the dead. After all, a nation ought to be able to ask its own gods 
ISA.8.20	what it should do.”
ISA.8.20	None of those who talk like that will live to see the light of day! 
ISA.8.21	They will go around in great pain and will become so hungry that they will angrily curse their king and their gods. And when they try to find help in heaven 
ISA.8.22	and on earth, they will find only trouble and darkness, terrible trouble and deepest darkness.
ISA.9.2	have seen a bright light.
ISA.9.2	And it shines upon everyone
ISA.9.2	who lives in the land
ISA.9.2	of darkest shadows.
ISA.9.3	Our 
ISA.9.3	your nation stronger.
ISA.9.3	Because of you, its people
ISA.9.3	are glad and celebrate
ISA.9.3	like workers at harvest time
ISA.9.3	or like soldiers dividing up
ISA.9.3	what they have taken.
ISA.9.4	You have broken the power
ISA.9.4	of those who abused
ISA.9.4	and enslaved your people.
ISA.9.4	You have rescued them
ISA.9.4	just as you saved your people
ISA.9.4	from Midian.
ISA.9.5	The boots of marching warriors
ISA.9.5	and the blood-stained uniforms
ISA.9.5	have been fed to flames
ISA.9.5	and eaten by fire.
ISA.9.6	A child has been born for us.
ISA.9.6	We have been given a son
ISA.9.6	who will be our ruler.
ISA.9.6	His names will be
ISA.9.6	Wonderful Advisor
ISA.9.6	and Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Eternal Father
ISA.9.6	and Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	peace will last forever.
ISA.9.7	He will rule David's kingdom
ISA.9.7	and make it grow strong.
ISA.9.7	He will always rule
ISA.9.7	with honesty and justice.
ISA.9.7	The 
ISA.9.7	will make certain
ISA.9.7	that all of this is done.
ISA.9.8	The Lord had warned the people of Israel, 
ISA.9.9	and all of them knew it, including everyone in the capital city of Samaria. But they were proud and stubborn and said,
ISA.9.10	“Houses of brick and sycamore
ISA.9.10	have fallen to the ground,
ISA.9.10	but we will build houses
ISA.9.10	with stones and cedar.”
ISA.9.11	The 
ISA.9.12	He sent the Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west, and they swallowed up Israel. But even this did not stop him from being angry, so he kept on punishing them.
ISA.9.13	The people of Israel still did not turn back to the 
ISA.9.14	In one day he cut off their head and tail, their leaves and branches. 
ISA.9.15	Their rulers and leaders were the head, and the lying prophets were the tail. 
ISA.9.16	They had led the nation down the wrong path, and the people were confused. 
ISA.9.17	The Lord was angry with his people and kept punishing them, because they had turned against him.
ISA.9.18	Evil had spread like a raging forest fire sending thornbushes up in smoke. 
ISA.9.19	The 
ISA.9.20	like wild animals attacking and eating everyone around them, even their own relatives.
ISA.9.21	The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh turned against each other, then joined forces to attack Judah. But the 
ISA.10.1	You people are in for trouble! You have made cruel and unfair laws 
ISA.10.2	that let you cheat the poor and needy and rob widows and orphans. 
ISA.10.3	But what will you do when you are fiercely attacked and punished by foreigners? Where will you run for help? Where will you hide your valuables? 
ISA.10.4	How will you escape being captured
ISA.10.5	I am furious! And I will use the king of Assyria
ISA.10.6	to beat down you godless people. I am angry with you, and I will send him to attack you. He will take what he wants and walk on you like mud in the streets. 
ISA.10.7	He has even bigger plans in mind, because he wants to destroy many nations.
ISA.10.8	The king of Assyria says:
ISA.10.8	My army commanders are kings! 
ISA.10.9	They have already captured
ISA.10.10+ISA.10.11	 The gods of Jerusalem and Samaria are weaker than the gods of those powerful nations. And I will destroy Jerusalem, together with its gods and idols, just as I did Samaria.
ISA.10.12	The Lord will do what he has planned against Jerusalem and Mount Zion. Then he will punish the proud and boastful king of Assyria, 
ISA.10.13	who says:
ISA.10.13	I did these things by my own power because I am smart and clever. I attacked kings like a wild bull, and I took the land and the treasures of their nations. 
ISA.10.14	I have conquered the whole world! And it was easier than taking eggs from an unguarded nest. No one even flapped a wing or made a peep.
ISA.10.15	King of Assyria, can an ax or a saw overpower the one who uses it? Can a wooden pole lift whoever holds it? 
ISA.10.16	The mighty 
ISA.10.17	The holy God, who is the light of Israel, will turn into a fire, and in one day you will go up in flames, just like a thornbush. 
ISA.10.18	The Lord will make your beautiful forests and fertile fields slowly rot. 
ISA.10.19	There will be so few trees that even a young child can count them.
ISA.10.20	A time is coming when the survivors from Israel and Judah will completely depend on the holy 
ISA.10.21+ISA.10.22	 There were as many people as there are grains of sand along the seashore, but only a few will survive to come back to Israel's mighty God. This is because he has threatened to destroy their nation, just as they deserve. 
ISA.10.23	The 
ISA.10.24	Now the 
ISA.10.24	The Assyrians will beat you with sticks and abuse you, just as the Egyptians did. But don't be afraid of them. 
ISA.10.25	Soon I will stop being angry with you, and I will punish them for their crimes.
ISA.10.26	I will beat the Assyrians with a whip, as I did the people of Midian near the rock at Oreb. And I will show the same mighty power that I used when I made a path through the sea in Egypt. 
ISA.10.27	Then they will no longer rule your nation. All will go well for you,
ISA.10.28	Enemy troops have reached the town of Aiath.
ISA.10.29	before crossing the valley and spending the night at Geba.
ISA.10.30	Loud crying can be heard in the towns of Gallim, Laishah, and sorrowful Anathoth. 
ISA.10.31	No one is left in Madmenah or Gebim. 
ISA.10.32	Today the enemy will camp at Nob
ISA.10.33	But the 
ISA.10.33	will use his fearsome might
ISA.10.33	to bring down the tallest trees
ISA.10.33	and chop off every branch.
ISA.10.34	With an ax, the glorious Lord
ISA.10.34	will destroy every tree
ISA.10.34	in the forests of Lebanon.
ISA.11.1	from a stump,
ISA.11.1	someone from David's family
ISA.11.1	will someday be king.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	will be with him
ISA.11.2	to give him understanding,
ISA.11.2	wisdom, and insight.
ISA.11.2	He will be powerful,
ISA.11.2	and he will know
ISA.11.2	and honor the 
ISA.11.3	His greatest joy will be
ISA.11.3	to obey the 
ISA.11.3	This king won't judge
ISA.11.3	by appearances
ISA.11.3	or listen to rumors.
ISA.11.4	The poor and the needy
ISA.11.4	will be treated with fairness
ISA.11.4	and with justice.
ISA.11.4	His word will be law
ISA.11.4	everywhere in the land,
ISA.11.4	and criminals
ISA.11.4	will be put to death.
ISA.11.5	will be his royal robes.
ISA.11.6	with young goats,
ISA.11.6	and wolves will rest
ISA.11.6	with lambs.
ISA.11.6	Calves and lions
ISA.11.6	will eat together
ISA.11.6	and be cared for
ISA.11.6	by little children.
ISA.11.7	Cows and bears will share
ISA.11.7	the same pasture;
ISA.11.7	their young will rest
ISA.11.7	side by side.
ISA.11.7	Lions and oxen
ISA.11.7	will both eat straw.
ISA.11.8	Little children will play
ISA.11.8	near snake holes.
ISA.11.8	They will stick their hands
ISA.11.8	into dens of poisonous snakes
ISA.11.8	and never be hurt.
ISA.11.9	on the 
ISA.11.9	Just as water fills the sea,
ISA.11.9	the land will be filled
ISA.11.9	with people who know
ISA.11.9	and honor the 
ISA.11.11	When that day comes, the Lord will again reach out his mighty arm and bring home his people who have survived in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Ethiopia,
ISA.11.12	He will give a signal to the nations, and he will bring together the refugees from Judah and Israel, who have been scattered all over the earth. 
ISA.11.13	Israel will stop being jealous of Judah, and Judah will no longer be the enemy of Israel. 
ISA.11.14	Instead, they will get together and attack the Philistines in the west. Then they will defeat the Edomites, the Moabites, and the Ammonites in the east. They will rule those people and take from them whatever they want.
ISA.11.16	Then for his people who survive, there will be a good road from Assyria, just as there was a good road for their ancestors when they left Egypt.
ISA.12.1	At that time you will say,
ISA.12.1	“I thank you, 
ISA.12.1	You were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	but you stopped being angry
ISA.12.1	and gave me comfort.
ISA.12.2	and I won't be afraid.
ISA.12.2	My power and my strength
ISA.12.2	come from you,
ISA.12.2	and you have saved me.”
ISA.12.3	With great joy, you people
ISA.12.3	will get water
ISA.12.3	from the well of victory.
ISA.12.4	At that time you will say,
ISA.12.4	“Our 
ISA.12.4	and we worship only you.
ISA.12.4	We will tell the nations
ISA.12.4	how glorious you are
ISA.12.4	and what you have done.
ISA.12.5	Because of your wonderful deeds
ISA.12.5	we will sing your praises
ISA.12.5	everywhere on earth.”
ISA.12.6	Sing, people of Zion!
ISA.12.6	Celebrate the greatness
ISA.12.6	of the holy 
ISA.12.6	God is here to help you.
ISA.13.2	From high on a barren hill
ISA.13.2	give a signal, shout the orders,
ISA.13.2	and point the way
ISA.13.2	to enter the gates
ISA.13.2	of Babylon's proud rulers.
ISA.13.3	The 
ISA.13.3	his very best warriors
ISA.13.3	and his proud heroes
ISA.13.3	to show how angry he is.
ISA.13.4	Listen to the noisy crowds
ISA.13.4	on the mountains!
ISA.13.4	Kingdoms and nations
ISA.13.4	are joining forces.
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.4	is bringing together
ISA.13.4	an army for battle.
ISA.13.5	From a distant land
ISA.13.5	the 
ISA.13.5	fierce and furious—
ISA.13.5	he brings his weapons
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole earth.
ISA.13.6	The day is coming
ISA.13.6	when the mighty 
ISA.13.6	will bring destruction.
ISA.13.6	* 
ISA.13.7	All people will be terrified.
ISA.13.7	Hands will grow limp;
ISA.13.7	courage will melt away.
ISA.13.8	Everyone will tremble with pain
ISA.13.8	like a woman giving birth;
ISA.13.8	they will stare at each other
ISA.13.8	with horror on their faces.
ISA.13.9	I, the 
ISA.13.9	will show no mercy or pity
ISA.13.9	when that time comes.
ISA.13.9	In my anger I will destroy
ISA.13.9	the earth and every sinner
ISA.13.9	who lives on it.
ISA.13.10	from the stars in the sky;
ISA.13.10	the dawning sun will turn dark,
ISA.13.10	and the moon
ISA.13.10	will lose its brightness.
ISA.13.11	I will punish this evil world
ISA.13.11	and its people
ISA.13.11	because of their sins.
ISA.13.11	I will crush the horrible pride
ISA.13.11	of those who are cruel.
ISA.13.12	Survivors will be harder to find
ISA.13.12	than the purest gold.
ISA.13.13	I, the 
ISA.13.13	am terribly angry—
ISA.13.13	I will make the sky tremble
ISA.13.13	and the earth shake loose.
ISA.13.14	Everyone will run
ISA.13.14	to their homelands,
ISA.13.14	just as hunted deer run,
ISA.13.14	and sheep scatter
ISA.13.14	when they have no shepherd.
ISA.13.15	Those men who are captured
ISA.13.15	will be killed by a sword.
ISA.13.16	They will see their children
ISA.13.16	beaten against rocks,
ISA.13.16	their homes robbed,
ISA.13.16	and their wives abused.
ISA.13.17	The Medes
ISA.13.17	with silver or gold,
ISA.13.17	and I'm sending them
ISA.13.17	to attack Babylonia.
ISA.13.18	Their arrows will slaughter
ISA.13.18	the young men;
ISA.13.18	no pity will be shown
ISA.13.18	to babies and children.
ISA.13.19	is glorious and powerful,
ISA.13.19	the pride of the nation.
ISA.13.19	But it will be like the cities
ISA.13.19	of Sodom and Gomorrah
ISA.13.19	after I, the Lord,
ISA.13.19	destroyed them.
ISA.13.20	No one will live in Babylon.
ISA.13.20	Even nomads won't camp nearby,
ISA.13.20	and shepherds won't let
ISA.13.20	their sheep rest there.
ISA.13.21	hoot owls, and ostriches
ISA.13.21	will live in its ruins,
ISA.13.21	and goats
ISA.13.22	Hyenas and wolves will howl
ISA.13.22	from Babylon's fortresses
ISA.13.22	and beautiful palaces.
ISA.13.22	Its time is almost up!
ISA.14.1	The 
ISA.14.2	Other nations will lead them home, and Israel will make slaves of them in the land that belongs to the Lord. Israel will rule over those who once governed and mistreated them.
ISA.14.3	The 
ISA.14.4	Then you will make fun of the King of Babylonia by singing this song:
ISA.14.4	That cruel monster is done for!
ISA.14.4	He won't attack us again.
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.5	of those evil kings,
ISA.14.6	who were furious
ISA.14.6	and never stopped abusing
ISA.14.6	the people of other nations.
ISA.14.7	Now all the world is at peace;
ISA.14.7	its people are celebrating
ISA.14.7	with joyful songs.
ISA.14.8	King of Babylonia,
ISA.14.8	even the cypress trees
ISA.14.8	and the cedars of Lebanon
ISA.14.8	celebrate and say,
ISA.14.8	“Since you were put down,
ISA.14.8	no one comes along
ISA.14.8	to chop us down.”
ISA.14.9	The world of the dead
ISA.14.9	eagerly waits for you.
ISA.14.9	With great excitement,
ISA.14.9	the spirits of ancient rulers
ISA.14.9	hear about your coming.
ISA.14.10	Each one of them will say,
ISA.14.10	“Now you are just as weak
ISA.14.10	as any of us!
ISA.14.11	Your pride and your music
ISA.14.11	have ended here
ISA.14.11	in the world of the dead.
ISA.14.11	Worms are your blanket,
ISA.14.11	maggots are your bed.”
ISA.14.12	have fallen from the sky!
ISA.14.12	You brought down other nations;
ISA.14.12	now you are brought down.
ISA.14.13	“I'll climb to heaven
ISA.14.13	and place my throne
ISA.14.13	above the highest stars.
ISA.14.13	I'll sit there with the gods
ISA.14.13	far away in the north.
ISA.14.14	I'll be above the clouds,
ISA.14.14	just like God Most High.”
ISA.14.15	But now you are deep
ISA.14.15	in the world of the dead.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare
ISA.14.16	and wonder, “Is this the man
ISA.14.16	who made the world tremble
ISA.14.16	and shook up kingdoms?
ISA.14.17	Did he capture every city
ISA.14.17	and make earth a desert?
ISA.14.17	Is he the one who refused
ISA.14.17	to let prisoners go home?”
ISA.14.18	When kings die, they are buried
ISA.14.18	in glorious tombs.
ISA.14.19	But you will be left unburied,
ISA.14.19	just another dead body
ISA.14.19	lying underfoot
ISA.14.19	like a broken branch.
ISA.14.19	You will be one of many
ISA.14.19	killed in battle and gone down
ISA.14.19	to the deep rocky pit.
ISA.14.20	You won't be buried with kings;
ISA.14.20	you ruined your country
ISA.14.20	and murdered your people.
ISA.14.20	You evil monster!
ISA.14.20	We hope that your family
ISA.14.20	will be forgotten forever.
ISA.14.21	We will slaughter your sons
ISA.14.21	to make them pay for the crimes
ISA.14.21	of their ancestors.
ISA.14.21	They won't take over the world
ISA.14.21	or build cities
ISA.14.21	anywhere on this earth.
ISA.14.22	The 
ISA.14.23	The 
ISA.14.24	has made this promise:
ISA.14.24	Everything I have planned
ISA.14.24	will happen just as I said.
ISA.14.25	I will wipe out every Assyrian
ISA.14.25	in my country,
ISA.14.25	and I will crush those
ISA.14.25	on my mountains.
ISA.14.25	I will free my people
ISA.14.25	from slavery
ISA.14.25	to the Assyrians.
ISA.14.26	I have planned this
ISA.14.26	for the whole world,
ISA.14.26	and my mighty arm
ISA.14.26	controls every nation.
ISA.14.27	I, the 
ISA.14.27	have made these plans.
ISA.14.27	No one can stop me now!
ISA.14.29	just because the rod
ISA.14.29	that punished you
ISA.14.29	is broken.
ISA.14.29	That rod will become
ISA.14.29	a poisonous snake, and then
ISA.14.29	a flying fiery dragon.
ISA.14.30	The poor and needy will find
ISA.14.30	pastures for their sheep
ISA.14.30	and will live in safety.
ISA.14.30	But I will starve some of you,
ISA.14.30	and others will be killed.
ISA.14.31	Cry and weep in the gates
ISA.14.31	of your towns,
ISA.14.31	you Philistines!
ISA.14.31	Smoke blows in from the north,
ISA.14.31	and every soldier is ready.
ISA.14.32	If a messenger comes
ISA.14.32	from a distant nation,
ISA.14.32	you must say:
ISA.14.32	“The 
ISA.14.32	Even the poorest of his people
ISA.14.32	will find safety there.”
ISA.15.1	The towns of Ar and Kir
ISA.15.1	were destroyed in a night.
ISA.15.1	Moab is left in ruins!
ISA.15.2	Everyone in Dibon has gone up
ISA.15.2	to the temple
ISA.15.2	to cry and weep.
ISA.15.2	All of Moab is crying.
ISA.15.2	Heads and beards are shaved
ISA.15.2	because of what happened
ISA.15.2	at Nebo and Medeba.
ISA.15.3	In the towns and at home,
ISA.15.3	everyone wears sackcloth
ISA.15.3	and cries loud and long.
ISA.15.4	From Heshbon and Elealeh,
ISA.15.4	weeping is heard in Jahaz;
ISA.15.4	Moab's warriors scream
ISA.15.4	while trembling with fear.
ISA.15.5	I pity Moab!
ISA.15.5	Its people are running to Zoar
ISA.15.5	and to Eglath-Shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	They cry on their way up
ISA.15.5	to the town of Luhith;
ISA.15.5	on the road to Horonaim
ISA.15.5	they tell of disasters.
ISA.15.6	The streams of Nimrim
ISA.15.6	and the grasslands
ISA.15.6	have dried up.
ISA.15.6	Every plant is parched.
ISA.15.7	The people of Moab are leaving,
ISA.15.7	crossing over Willow Creek,
ISA.15.7	taking everything they own
ISA.15.7	and have worked for.
ISA.15.8	In the towns of Eglaim
ISA.15.8	and of Beerelim
ISA.15.8	and everywhere else in Moab
ISA.15.8	mournful cries are heard.
ISA.15.9	The streams near Dimon
ISA.15.9	are flowing with blood.
ISA.15.9	But the Lord will bring
ISA.15.9	even worse trouble to Dimon,
ISA.15.9	because all in Moab who escape
ISA.15.9	will be attacked by lions.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs
ISA.16.1	to the ruler of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send them across the desert
ISA.16.1	from Sela
ISA.16.2	The women of Moab
ISA.16.2	crossing the Arnon River
ISA.16.2	are like a flock of birds
ISA.16.2	scattered from their nests.
ISA.16.3	Moab's messengers say
ISA.16.3	to the people of Judah,
ISA.16.3	“Be kind and help us!
ISA.16.3	Shade us from the heat
ISA.16.3	of the noonday sun.
ISA.16.3	Hide our refugees!
ISA.16.3	Don't turn them away.
ISA.16.4	Let our people live
ISA.16.4	in your country
ISA.16.4	and find safety here.”
ISA.16.4	Moab, your cruel enemies
ISA.16.4	will disappear;
ISA.16.4	they will no longer attack
ISA.16.4	and destroy your land.
ISA.16.5	Then a kingdom of love
ISA.16.5	will be set up,
ISA.16.5	and someone from David's family
ISA.16.5	will rule with fairness.
ISA.16.5	He will do what is right
ISA.16.5	and quickly bring justice.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of Moab's pride.
ISA.16.6	Its people strut and boast,
ISA.16.6	but without reason.
ISA.16.7	Tell everyone in Moab
ISA.16.7	to mourn for their nation.
ISA.16.7	Tell them to cry and weep
ISA.16.7	for those fancy raisins
ISA.16.7	of Kir-Hareseth.
ISA.16.8	Vineyards near Heshbon
ISA.16.8	and Sibmah
ISA.16.8	have turned brown.
ISA.16.8	The rulers of nations
ISA.16.8	used to get drunk
ISA.16.8	on wine from those vineyards
ISA.16.8	that spread to Jazer,
ISA.16.8	then across the desert
ISA.16.8	and beyond the sea.
ISA.16.9	Now I mourn like Jazer
ISA.16.9	for the vineyards
ISA.16.9	of Sibmah.
ISA.16.9	I shed tears for Heshbon
ISA.16.9	and for Elealeh.
ISA.16.9	There will be no more
ISA.16.9	harvest celebrations
ISA.16.10	or joyful and happy times,
ISA.16.10	while bringing in the crops.
ISA.16.10	Singing and shouting are gone
ISA.16.10	from the vineyards.
ISA.16.10	There are no joyful shouts
ISA.16.10	where grapes were pressed.
ISA.16.10	God has silenced them all.
ISA.16.11	Deep in my heart I hurt
ISA.16.11	for Moab and Kir-Heres.
ISA.16.12	It's useless for Moab's people
ISA.16.12	to wear themselves out
ISA.16.12	by going to their altars
ISA.16.12	to worship and pray.
ISA.16.13	The 
ISA.16.14	Now he says, “The contract of a hired worker is good for three years, but Moab's glory and greatness won't last any longer than that. Only a few of its people will survive, and they will be left helpless.”
ISA.17.1	Damascus is doomed!
ISA.17.1	It will end up in ruins.
ISA.17.2	The villages around Aroer
ISA.17.2	will be deserted,
ISA.17.2	with only sheep living there
ISA.17.2	and no one to bother them.
ISA.17.3	Israel
ISA.17.3	The kingdom of Damascus
ISA.17.3	will be destroyed;
ISA.17.3	its survivors will suffer
ISA.17.3	the same fate as Israel.
ISA.17.3	The 
ISA.17.3	has promised this.
ISA.17.4	When that time comes,
ISA.17.4	the glorious nation of Israel
ISA.17.4	will be brought down;
ISA.17.4	its prosperous people
ISA.17.4	will be skin and bones.
ISA.17.5	Israel will be like wheat fields
ISA.17.5	in Rephaim Valley
ISA.17.5	picked clean of grain.
ISA.17.6	It will be like an olive tree
ISA.17.6	beaten with a stick,
ISA.17.6	leaving two or three olives
ISA.17.6	or maybe four or five
ISA.17.6	on the highest
ISA.17.6	or most fruitful branches.
ISA.17.6	The 
ISA.17.6	has promised this.
ISA.17.7	At that time the people will turn and trust their Creator, the holy God of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	They have built altars and places for burning incense to their goddess Asherah, and they have set up sacred poles
ISA.17.9	Israel captured powerful cities and chased out the people who lived there. But these cities will lie in ruins, covered over with weeds and underbrush.
ISA.17.10	Israel, you have forgotten
ISA.17.10	the God who saves you,
ISA.17.10	the one who is the mighty rock
ISA.17.10	where you find protection.
ISA.17.10	You plant the finest flowers
ISA.17.10	to honor a foreign god.
ISA.17.11	The plants may sprout
ISA.17.11	and blossom
ISA.17.11	that very same morning,
ISA.17.11	but it will do you no good,
ISA.17.11	because you will suffer
ISA.17.11	endless agony.
ISA.17.12	The nations are a noisy,
ISA.17.12	thunderous sea.
ISA.17.13	But even if they roar
ISA.17.13	like a fearsome flood,
ISA.17.13	God will give the command
ISA.17.13	to turn them back.
ISA.17.13	They will be like dust,
ISA.17.13	or like a tumbleweed
ISA.17.13	blowing across the hills
ISA.17.13	in a windstorm.
ISA.17.14	In the evening
ISA.17.14	their attack is fierce,
ISA.17.14	but by morning
ISA.17.14	they are destroyed.
ISA.17.14	This is what happens to those
ISA.17.14	who raid and rob us.
ISA.18.1	lies the country of Egypt,
ISA.18.1	swarming with insects.
ISA.18.2	Egypt sends messengers
ISA.18.2	up the Nile River
ISA.18.2	on ships made of reeds.
ISA.18.2	Send them fast to Ethiopia,
ISA.18.2	whose people are tall
ISA.18.2	and have smooth skin.
ISA.18.2	Their land is divided by rivers;
ISA.18.2	they are strong and brutal,
ISA.18.2	feared all over the world.
ISA.18.3	Everyone on this earth,
ISA.18.3	listen with care!
ISA.18.3	A signal will be given
ISA.18.3	on the mountains,
ISA.18.3	and you will hear a trumpet.
ISA.18.4	The 
ISA.18.4	“I will calmly look down
ISA.18.4	from my home above—
ISA.18.4	as calmly as the sun at noon
ISA.18.4	or clouds in the heat
ISA.18.4	of harvest season.”
ISA.18.5	Before the blossoms
ISA.18.5	can turn into grapes,
ISA.18.5	God will cut off the sprouts
ISA.18.5	and hack off the branches.
ISA.18.6	Ethiopians will be food
ISA.18.6	for mountain vultures
ISA.18.6	during the summer
ISA.18.6	and for wild animals
ISA.18.6	during the winter.
ISA.18.7	Those Ethiopians are tall and their skin is smooth. They are feared all over the world, because they are strong and brutal. But at that time they will come from their land divided by rivers, and they will bring gifts to the 
ISA.19.1	The 
ISA.19.1	riding swiftly on a cloud.
ISA.19.1	The people are weak from fear.
ISA.19.1	Their idols tremble
ISA.19.1	as he approaches and says,
ISA.19.2	“I will punish Egypt
ISA.19.2	with civil war—
ISA.19.2	neighbors, cities, and kingdoms
ISA.19.2	will fight each other.
ISA.19.3	“Egypt will be discouraged
ISA.19.3	when I confuse their plans.
ISA.19.3	They will try to get advice
ISA.19.3	from their idols,
ISA.19.3	from the spirits of the dead,
ISA.19.3	and from fortunetellers.
ISA.19.4	I will put the Egyptians
ISA.19.4	under the power of a cruel,
ISA.19.4	heartless king.
ISA.19.4	I, the 
ISA.19.4	have promised this.”
ISA.19.5	The Nile River will dry up
ISA.19.5	and become parched land.
ISA.19.6	Its streams will stink,
ISA.19.6	Egypt will have no water,
ISA.19.6	and the reeds and tall grass
ISA.19.6	will dry up.
ISA.19.7	Fields along the Nile
ISA.19.7	will be completely barren;
ISA.19.7	every plant will disappear.
ISA.19.8	Those who fish in the Nile
ISA.19.8	will be discouraged
ISA.19.8	and mourn.
ISA.19.9	None of the cloth makers
ISA.19.9	will know what to do,
ISA.19.9	and they will turn pale.
ISA.19.10	Weavers will be confused;
ISA.19.10	paid workers will cry and mourn.
ISA.19.11	The king's officials in Zoan
ISA.19.11	are foolish themselves
ISA.19.11	and give stupid advice.
ISA.19.11	How can they say to him,
ISA.19.11	“We are very wise,
ISA.19.11	and our families go back
ISA.19.11	to kings of long ago?”
ISA.19.12	Where are those wise men now?
ISA.19.12	If they can, let them say
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.12	intends for Egypt.
ISA.19.13	The royal officials in Zoan
ISA.19.13	and in Memphis
ISA.19.13	are foolish and deceived.
ISA.19.13	The leaders in every state
ISA.19.13	have given bad advice
ISA.19.13	to the nation.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	its leaders have made it stagger
ISA.19.14	and vomit like a drunkard.
ISA.19.15	No one in Egypt can do a thing,
ISA.19.15	no matter who they are.
ISA.19.16	When the 
ISA.19.17	They will be so terrified of Judah that they will be frightened by the very mention of its name. This will happen because of what the 
ISA.19.18	The time is coming when Hebrew will be spoken in five Egyptian cities, and their people will become followers of the 
ISA.19.19	In the heart of Egypt an altar will be set up for the 
ISA.19.20	These will remind the Egyptians that the 
ISA.19.21	The 
ISA.19.22	After the 
ISA.19.23	At that time a good road will run from Egypt to Assyria. The Egyptians and the Assyrians will travel back and forth from Egypt to Assyria, and they will worship together. 
ISA.19.24	Israel will join with these two countries. They will be a blessing to everyone on earth, 
ISA.19.25	then the 
ISA.19.25	“The Egyptians are my people.
ISA.19.25	I created the Assyrians
ISA.19.25	and chose the Israelites.”
ISA.20.1	King Sargon of Assyria gave orders for his army commander to capture the city of Ashdod.
ISA.20.2	About this same time the 
ISA.20.3	for three years.
ISA.20.3	Then the 
ISA.20.3	What Isaiah has done is a warning to Egypt and Ethiopia.
ISA.20.4	Everyone in these two countries will be led away naked and barefoot by the king of Assyria. Young or old, they will be taken prisoner, and Egypt will be disgraced. 
ISA.20.5	They will be confused and frustrated, because they depended on Ethiopia and bragged about Egypt. 
ISA.20.6	When this happens, the people who live along the coast
ISA.21.1	This is a message about a desert beside the sea:
ISA.21.1	Enemies from a hostile nation
ISA.21.1	attack like a whirlwind
ISA.21.1	from the Southern Desert.
ISA.21.2	What a horrible vision
ISA.21.2	was shown to me—
ISA.21.2	a vision of betrayal
ISA.21.2	and destruction.
ISA.21.2	Tell Elam and Media
ISA.21.2	to surround and attack
ISA.21.2	the Babylonians.
ISA.21.2	The 
ISA.21.2	the suffering they caused.
ISA.21.3	I'm in terrible pain
ISA.21.3	like a woman giving birth.
ISA.21.3	I'm shocked and hurt so much
ISA.21.3	that I can't hear or see.
ISA.21.4	My head spins; I'm horrified!
ISA.21.4	Early evening, my favorite time,
ISA.21.4	has become a nightmare.
ISA.21.5	In Babylon the high officials
ISA.21.5	were having a feast.
ISA.21.5	They were eating and drinking,
ISA.21.5	when someone shouted,
ISA.21.5	“Officers, take your places!
ISA.21.5	Grab your shields.”
ISA.21.6	The 
ISA.21.6	“Send guards
ISA.21.6	to find out
ISA.21.6	what's going on.
ISA.21.7	When they see cavalry troops
ISA.21.7	and columns of soldiers
ISA.21.7	on donkeys and camels,
ISA.21.7	tell them to be ready!”
ISA.21.8	Then a guard
ISA.21.8	“I have stood day and night
ISA.21.8	on this watchtower, Lord.
ISA.21.9	of cavalry troops.”
ISA.21.9	At once someone shouted,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon has fallen!
ISA.21.9	Every idol in the city
ISA.21.9	lies broken on the ground.”
ISA.21.10	Then I said, “My people,
ISA.21.10	you have suffered terribly,
ISA.21.10	but I have a message for you
ISA.21.10	from the 
ISA.21.10	the God of Israel.”
ISA.21.11	This is a message about Dumah:
ISA.21.11	From the country of Seir,
ISA.21.11	someone shouts to me,
ISA.21.11	“Guard, how much longer
ISA.21.11	before daylight?”
ISA.21.12	From my guard post, I answered,
ISA.21.12	“Morning will soon be here,
ISA.21.12	but night will return.
ISA.21.12	If you want to know more,
ISA.21.12	come back later.”
ISA.21.13	This is a message for Arabs who live in the barren desert in the region of Dedan:
ISA.21.13	You must order your caravans
ISA.21.14	to bring water for those
ISA.21.14	who are thirsty.
ISA.21.14	You people of Tema
ISA.21.14	must bring food
ISA.21.14	for the hungry refugees.
ISA.21.15	They are worn out and weary
ISA.21.15	from being chased by enemies
ISA.21.15	with swords and arrows.
ISA.21.16	The Lord said to me:
ISA.21.16	A year from now the glory of the people of Kedar
ISA.21.17	Only a few of their warriors will be left with bows and arrows. This is a promise that I, the 
ISA.22.1	This is a message about Vision Valley:
ISA.22.1	Why are you celebrating
ISA.22.1	on the flat roofs
ISA.22.1	of your houses?
ISA.22.2	Your city is filled
ISA.22.2	with noisy shouts.
ISA.22.2	Those who lie drunk
ISA.22.2	in your streets
ISA.22.2	were not killed in battle.
ISA.22.3	Your leaders ran away,
ISA.22.3	but they were captured
ISA.22.3	without a fight.
ISA.22.3	No matter how far they ran,
ISA.22.3	they were found and caught.
ISA.22.4	Then I said, “Leave me alone!
ISA.22.4	Let me cry bitter tears.
ISA.22.4	My people have been destroyed,
ISA.22.4	so don't try to comfort me.”
ISA.22.5	The 
ISA.22.5	had chosen a time
ISA.22.5	for noisy shouts and confusion
ISA.22.5	to fill Vision Valley,
ISA.22.5	and for everyone to beg
ISA.22.5	the mountains for help.
ISA.22.6	The people of Elam and Kir
ISA.22.6	attacked with chariots
ISA.22.6	and carried shields.
ISA.22.7	Your most beautiful valleys
ISA.22.7	were covered with chariots;
ISA.22.7	your cities were surrounded
ISA.22.7	by cavalry troops.
ISA.22.8	Judah was left defenseless.
ISA.22.8	At that time you trusted in the weapons you had stored in Forest Palace.
ISA.22.9	You saw the holes in the outer wall of Jerusalem, and you brought water from the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	You counted the houses in Jerusalem and tore down some of them, so you could get stones to repair the city wall. 
ISA.22.11	Then you built a large tank between the walls
ISA.22.12	When all of this happened,
ISA.22.12	the 
ISA.22.12	to weep and mourn,
ISA.22.12	to shave your heads,
ISA.22.12	and wear sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	by feasting on beef and lamb
ISA.22.13	and by drinking wine,
ISA.22.13	because you said,
ISA.22.13	“Let's eat and drink today!
ISA.22.13	Tomorrow we may die.”
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.14	has spoken to me
ISA.22.14	this solemn promise:
ISA.22.14	“I won't forgive them for this,
ISA.22.14	not as long as they live.”
ISA.22.15	The 
ISA.22.16	Shebna, what gives you the right to have a tomb carved out of rock in this burial place of royalty? None of your relatives are buried here. 
ISA.22.17	You may be powerful, but the 
ISA.22.18	He will roll you into a ball and throw you into a wide open country, where you will die and your chariots will be destroyed. You're a disgrace to those you serve.
ISA.22.19	The 
ISA.22.20+ISA.22.21	He will give your official robes and your authority to his servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
ISA.22.20+ISA.22.21	Eliakim will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and to the royal family of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	 The 
ISA.22.23	The 
ISA.22.24	His children and relatives will be supported by him, like pans hanging from a peg on the wall. 
ISA.22.25	That peg is fastened firmly now, but someday it will be shaken loose and fall down. Then everything that was hanging on it will be destroyed. This is what the 
ISA.23.1	Cry, you seagoing ships!
ISA.23.1	Tyre and its houses
ISA.23.1	lie in ruins.
ISA.23.2	Mourn in silence,
ISA.23.2	you shop owners of Sidon,
ISA.23.2	you people on the coast.
ISA.23.2	Your sailors crossed oceans,
ISA.23.2	making your city rich.
ISA.23.3	Your merchants sailed the seas,
ISA.23.3	making you wealthy by trading
ISA.23.3	with nation after nation.
ISA.23.3	They brought back grain
ISA.23.3	that grew along the Nile.
ISA.23.4	Sidon, you are a mighty fortress
ISA.23.4	built along the sea.
ISA.23.4	But you will be disgraced
ISA.23.4	like a married woman
ISA.23.4	who never had children.
ISA.23.5	When Egypt hears about Tyre,
ISA.23.5	it will tremble.
ISA.23.6	All of you along the coast
ISA.23.6	had better cry and sail
ISA.23.6	far across the ocean.
ISA.23.7	Can this be the happy city
ISA.23.7	that has stood for centuries?
ISA.23.7	Its people have spread
ISA.23.7	to distant lands;
ISA.23.8	its merchants were kings
ISA.23.8	honored all over the world.
ISA.23.8	Who planned to destroy Tyre?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	to bring shame and disgrace
ISA.23.9	to those who are honored
ISA.23.9	by everyone on earth.
ISA.23.10	People of Tyre,
ISA.23.10	your harbor is destroyed!
ISA.23.10	You will have to become farmers
ISA.23.10	just like the Egyptians.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.11	across the sea,
ISA.23.11	upsetting the nations.
ISA.23.11	He has given a command
ISA.23.11	to destroy fortresses
ISA.23.11	in the land of Canaan.
ISA.23.12	The 
ISA.23.12	to the people of Sidon,
ISA.23.12	“Your celebrating is over—
ISA.23.12	you are crushed.
ISA.23.12	Even if you escape to Cyprus,
ISA.23.12	you won't find peace.”
ISA.23.13	Look what the Assyrians have done to Babylonia! They have attacked, destroying every palace in the land. Now wild animals live among the ruins.
ISA.23.14	Not a fortress will be left standing, so tell all the seagoing ships
ISA.23.15	The city of Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, which is the lifetime of a king. Then Tyre will be like that evil woman in the song:
ISA.23.16	You're gone and forgotten,
ISA.23.16	you evil woman!
ISA.23.16	So strut through the town,
ISA.23.16	singing and playing
ISA.23.16	your favorite tune
ISA.23.16	to be remembered again.
ISA.23.17	At the end of those 70 years, the 
ISA.23.18	but none of what is earned will be kept in the city. That money will belong to the 
ISA.24.1	The 
ISA.24.2	including ordinary people and priests, slaves and slave owners, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, the rich and the poor. 
ISA.24.3	The earth will be stripped bare and left that way. This is what the 
ISA.24.4	The earth wilts away;
ISA.24.4	its mighty leaders melt
ISA.24.4	to nothing.
ISA.24.5	The earth is polluted
ISA.24.5	because its people
ISA.24.5	disobeyed the laws of God,
ISA.24.5	breaking their agreement
ISA.24.5	that was to last forever.
ISA.24.6	The earth is under a curse;
ISA.24.6	its people are dying out
ISA.24.6	because of their sins.
ISA.24.7	Grapevines have dried up:
ISA.24.7	wine is almost gone—
ISA.24.7	mournful sounds are heard
ISA.24.7	instead of joyful shouts.
ISA.24.8	No one plays tambourines
ISA.24.8	or stringed instruments;
ISA.24.8	all noisy celebrating
ISA.24.8	has come to an end.
ISA.24.9	They no longer sing
ISA.24.9	as they drink their wine,
ISA.24.9	and it tastes sour.
ISA.24.10	Towns are crushed and in chaos;
ISA.24.10	houses are locked tight.
ISA.24.11	Happy times have disappeared
ISA.24.11	from the earth,
ISA.24.11	and people shout in the streets,
ISA.24.11	“We're out of wine!”
ISA.24.12	Cities are destroyed;
ISA.24.12	their gates are torn down.
ISA.24.13	Nations will be stripped bare,
ISA.24.13	like olive trees or vineyards
ISA.24.13	after the harvest season.
ISA.24.14	People in the west shout;
ISA.24.14	they joyfully praise
ISA.24.14	the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	And so, everyone in the east
ISA.24.15	and those on the islands
ISA.24.15	should praise the 
ISA.24.15	the God of Israel.
ISA.24.16	From all over the world
ISA.24.16	songs of praise are heard
ISA.24.16	for the God of justice.
ISA.24.16	But I feel awful,
ISA.24.16	terribly miserable.
ISA.24.16	Can anyone be trusted?
ISA.24.16	So many are treacherous!
ISA.24.17	Terror, traps, and pits
ISA.24.17	are waiting for everyone.
ISA.24.18	If you are terrified and run,
ISA.24.18	you will fall into a pit;
ISA.24.18	if you crawl out of the pit,
ISA.24.18	you will get caught in a trap.
ISA.24.18	The sky has split apart
ISA.24.18	like a window thrown open.
ISA.24.18	The foundations of the earth
ISA.24.18	have been shaken;
ISA.24.19	the earth is shattered,
ISA.24.19	ripped to pieces.
ISA.24.20	It staggers and shakes
ISA.24.20	like a drunkard
ISA.24.20	or a hut in a windstorm.
ISA.24.20	It is burdened down with sin;
ISA.24.20	the earth will fall,
ISA.24.20	never again to get up.
ISA.24.21	On that day the 
ISA.24.21	will punish the powers
ISA.24.21	in the heavens
ISA.24.21	and the kings of the earth.
ISA.24.22	He will put them in a pit
ISA.24.22	and keep them prisoner.
ISA.24.22	Then later on,
ISA.24.22	he will punish them.
ISA.24.23	Both the moon and sun will
ISA.24.23	be embarrassed and ashamed.
ISA.24.23	The 
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion in Jerusalem,
ISA.24.23	where he will show its rulers
ISA.24.23	his wonderful glory.
ISA.25.1	You, 
ISA.25.1	I will praise you
ISA.25.1	for doing the wonderful things
ISA.25.1	you had planned and promised
ISA.25.1	since ancient times.
ISA.25.2	You have destroyed the fortress
ISA.25.2	of our enemies,
ISA.25.2	leaving their city in ruins.
ISA.25.2	Nothing in that foreign city
ISA.25.2	will ever be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Now strong and cruel nations
ISA.25.3	will fear and honor you.
ISA.25.4	You have been a place of safety
ISA.25.4	for the poor and needy
ISA.25.4	in times of trouble.
ISA.25.4	Brutal enemies pounded us
ISA.25.4	like a heavy rain
ISA.25.4	or the heat of the sun at noon,
ISA.25.4	but you were our shelter.
ISA.25.5	Those wild foreigners struck
ISA.25.5	like scorching desert heat.
ISA.25.5	But you were like a cloud,
ISA.25.5	protecting us from the sun.
ISA.25.5	You kept our enemies from singing
ISA.25.5	songs of victory.
ISA.25.6	On this mountain
ISA.25.6	the 
ISA.25.6	will prepare for all nations
ISA.25.6	a feast of the finest foods.
ISA.25.6	Choice wines and the best meats
ISA.25.6	will be served.
ISA.25.7	Here the 
ISA.25.7	the burial clothes
ISA.25.7	that cover the nations.
ISA.25.8	will destroy the power of death
ISA.25.8	and wipe away all tears.
ISA.25.8	No longer will his people
ISA.25.8	be insulted everywhere.
ISA.25.8	The 
ISA.25.9	At that time, people will say,
ISA.25.9	“The 
ISA.25.9	Let's celebrate.
ISA.25.9	We waited and hoped—
ISA.25.9	now our God is here.”
ISA.25.10	will protect this mountain.
ISA.25.10	The Moabites will be put down
ISA.25.10	and trampled on like straw
ISA.25.10	in a pit of manure.
ISA.25.11	They will struggle to get out,
ISA.25.11	but God will humiliate them
ISA.25.11	no matter how hard they try.
ISA.25.12	The walls of their fortresses
ISA.25.12	will be knocked down
ISA.25.12	and scattered in the dirt.
ISA.26.1	The time is coming when the people of Judah will sing this song:
ISA.26.1	“Our city
ISA.26.1	The 
ISA.26.1	and he gives us victory.
ISA.26.2	Open the city gates
ISA.26.2	for a law-abiding nation
ISA.26.2	that is faithful to God.
ISA.26.3	The 
ISA.26.3	to those whose faith is firm.
ISA.26.4	So always trust the 
ISA.26.4	because he is forever
ISA.26.4	our mighty rock.
ISA.26.5	God has put down our enemies
ISA.26.5	in their mountain city
ISA.26.5	and rubbed it in the dirt.
ISA.26.6	Now the poor and abused
ISA.26.6	trample all over that city.”
ISA.26.7	Our 
ISA.26.7	and you make the path smooth
ISA.26.7	for those who obey you.
ISA.26.8	You are the one we trust
ISA.26.8	to bring about justice;
ISA.26.8	above all else we want
ISA.26.8	your name to be honored.
ISA.26.9	Throughout the night,
ISA.26.9	my heart searches for you,
ISA.26.9	because your decisions
ISA.26.9	show everyone on this earth
ISA.26.9	how to live right.
ISA.26.10	Even when the wicked
ISA.26.10	are treated with mercy
ISA.26.10	in this land of justice,
ISA.26.10	they do wrong and are blind
ISA.26.10	to your glory, our 
ISA.26.11	to punish them,
ISA.26.11	but they don't see it.
ISA.26.11	Put them to shame!
ISA.26.11	Show how much you care for us
ISA.26.11	and throw them into the fire
ISA.26.11	intended for your enemies.
ISA.26.12	You will give us peace, 
ISA.26.12	because everything we have done
ISA.26.12	was by your power.
ISA.26.13	Others have ruled over us
ISA.26.13	besides you, our 
ISA.26.13	but we obey only you.
ISA.26.14	Those enemies are now dead
ISA.26.14	and can never live again.
ISA.26.14	You have punished them—
ISA.26.14	they are destroyed,
ISA.26.14	completely forgotten.
ISA.26.15	Our nation has grown
ISA.26.15	because of you, our 
ISA.26.15	We have more land than before,
ISA.26.15	and you are honored.
ISA.26.16	When you punished our people,
ISA.26.16	they turned and prayed
ISA.26.16	to you, our 
ISA.26.17	Because of what you did to us,
ISA.26.17	we suffered like a woman
ISA.26.17	about to give birth.
ISA.26.18	But instead of having a child,
ISA.26.18	our terrible pain
ISA.26.18	produced only wind.
ISA.26.18	We have won no victories,
ISA.26.18	and we have no descendants
ISA.26.18	to take over the earth.
ISA.26.19	Your people will rise to life!
ISA.26.19	Tell them to leave their graves
ISA.26.19	and celebrate with shouts.
ISA.26.19	You refresh the earth
ISA.26.19	like morning dew;
ISA.26.19	you give life to the dead.
ISA.26.20	Go inside and lock the doors,
ISA.26.20	my people.
ISA.26.20	Hide there for a little while,
ISA.26.20	until the 
ISA.26.20	is no longer angry.
ISA.26.21	The 
ISA.26.21	to punish everyone on earth
ISA.26.21	for their sins.
ISA.26.21	And when he does,
ISA.26.21	those who did violent crimes
ISA.26.21	will be known and punished.
ISA.27.1	the sea monster,
ISA.27.1	will squirm and try to escape,
ISA.27.1	but the 
ISA.27.1	with a cruel, sharp sword.
ISA.27.2	At that time you must sing
ISA.27.2	about a fruitful
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.3	and always keep it watered.
ISA.27.3	I will guard it day and night
ISA.27.3	to keep it from harm.
ISA.27.4	I am no longer angry.
ISA.27.4	But if it produces thorns,
ISA.27.4	I will go to war against it
ISA.27.4	and burn it to the ground.
ISA.27.5	Yet if the vineyard depends
ISA.27.5	on me for protection,
ISA.27.5	it will become my friend
ISA.27.5	and be at peace with me.
ISA.27.6	Someday Israel will take root
ISA.27.6	like a vine.
ISA.27.6	It will blossom and bear fruit
ISA.27.6	that covers the earth.
ISA.27.7	I, the 
ISA.27.7	the people of Israel
ISA.27.7	as fiercely as I punished
ISA.27.7	and killed their enemies.
ISA.27.8	I carefully measured out
ISA.27.8	Israel's punishment
ISA.27.8	and sent the scorching heat
ISA.27.8	to chase them far away.
ISA.27.9	There's only one way
ISA.27.9	that Israel's sin and guilt
ISA.27.9	can be completely forgiven:
ISA.27.9	They must crush the stones
ISA.27.9	of every pagan altar
ISA.27.9	and place of worship.
ISA.27.10	Fortress cities are left
ISA.27.10	like a desert
ISA.27.10	where no one lives.
ISA.27.10	Cattle walk through the ruins,
ISA.27.10	stripping the trees bare.
ISA.27.11	When broken branches
ISA.27.11	fall to the ground,
ISA.27.11	women pick them up
ISA.27.11	to feed the fire.
ISA.27.11	But these people are so stupid
ISA.27.11	that the God who created them
ISA.27.11	will show them no mercy.
ISA.27.12	The time is coming when the 
ISA.27.13	A loud trumpet will be heard. Then the people of Israel who were dragged away to Assyria and Egypt will return to worship the 
ISA.28.1	The city of Samaria
ISA.28.1	above a fertile valley
ISA.28.1	is in for trouble!
ISA.28.1	Its leaders are drunkards,
ISA.28.1	who stuff themselves
ISA.28.1	with food and wine.
ISA.28.1	But they will be like flowers
ISA.28.1	that dry up and wilt.
ISA.28.2	Only the Lord is strong
ISA.28.2	and powerful!
ISA.28.2	His mighty hand
ISA.28.2	will strike them down
ISA.28.2	with the force of a hailstorm
ISA.28.2	or a mighty whirlwind
ISA.28.2	or an overwhelming flood.
ISA.28.3	Every drunkard in Ephraim
ISA.28.3	takes pride in Samaria,
ISA.28.3	but it will be crushed.
ISA.28.4	Samaria above a fertile valley
ISA.28.4	will quickly lose its glory.
ISA.28.4	It will be gobbled up
ISA.28.4	like the first ripe fig
ISA.28.4	at harvest season.
ISA.28.5	When this time comes,
ISA.28.5	the 
ISA.28.5	will be a glorious crown
ISA.28.5	for his people who survive.
ISA.28.6	He will see that justice rules
ISA.28.6	and that his people are able
ISA.28.6	to defend their cities.
ISA.28.7	Priests and prophets stumble
ISA.28.7	because they are drunk.
ISA.28.7	Their minds are too confused
ISA.28.7	to receive God's messages
ISA.28.7	or give honest decisions.
ISA.28.8	Their tables are covered,
ISA.28.8	completely covered,
ISA.28.8	with their stinking vomit.
ISA.28.9	You drunken leaders
ISA.28.9	are like babies!
ISA.28.9	How can you possibly understand
ISA.28.9	or teach the 
ISA.28.10	You don't even listen—
ISA.28.10	all you hear is senseless sound
ISA.28.10	after senseless sound.
ISA.28.11	to his people
ISA.28.11	in strange sounds
ISA.28.11	and foreign languages.
ISA.28.12	He promised you
ISA.28.12	perfect peace and rest,
ISA.28.12	but you refused to listen.
ISA.28.13	Now his message to you
ISA.28.13	will be senseless sound
ISA.28.13	after senseless sound.
ISA.28.13	Then you will fall backwards,
ISA.28.13	injured and trapped.
ISA.28.14	You rulers of Jerusalem
ISA.28.14	do nothing but sneer;
ISA.28.14	now you must listen
ISA.28.14	to what the 
ISA.28.15	an agreement with death
ISA.28.15	and the world of the dead?
ISA.28.15	Why do you trust in your lies
ISA.28.15	to keep you safe from danger
ISA.28.15	and the mighty flood?
ISA.28.16	“I'm laying a firm foundation
ISA.28.16	for the city of Zion.
ISA.28.16	It's a valuable cornerstone
ISA.28.16	proven to be trustworthy;
ISA.28.16	no one who trusts it
ISA.28.16	will ever be disappointed.
ISA.28.17	Justice and fairness
ISA.28.17	will be the measuring lines
ISA.28.17	that help me build.”
ISA.28.17	Hailstones and floods
ISA.28.17	will destroy and wash away
ISA.28.17	your shelter of lies.
ISA.28.18	Your agreement with death
ISA.28.18	and the world of the dead
ISA.28.18	will be broken.
ISA.28.18	Then angry, roaring waves
ISA.28.18	will sweep over you.
ISA.28.19	Morning, noon, and night
ISA.28.19	an overwhelming flood
ISA.28.19	will wash you away.
ISA.28.19	The terrible things that happen
ISA.28.19	will teach you this lesson:
ISA.28.20	Your bed is too short,
ISA.28.20	your blanket too skimpy.
ISA.28.21	as he did at Mount Perazim
ISA.28.21	and in Gibeon Valley.
ISA.28.21	But this time the 
ISA.28.21	will do something surprising,
ISA.28.21	not what you expect.
ISA.28.22	So you had better stop sneering
ISA.28.22	or you will be in worse shape
ISA.28.22	than ever before.
ISA.28.22	I heard the 
ISA.28.22	threaten the whole country
ISA.28.22	with destruction.
ISA.28.23	Pay close attention
ISA.28.23	to what I am saying.
ISA.28.24	Farmers don't just plow
ISA.28.24	and break up the ground.
ISA.28.25	When a field is ready,
ISA.28.25	they scatter the seeds
ISA.28.25	of dill and cumin;
ISA.28.25	they plant the seeds
ISA.28.25	of wheat and barley
ISA.28.25	in the proper places
ISA.28.25	and sow other grains
ISA.28.25	around the edges.
ISA.28.26	They learn this from their God.
ISA.28.27	After dill and cumin
ISA.28.27	have been harvested,
ISA.28.27	the stalks are pounded,
ISA.28.27	not run over with a wagon.
ISA.28.28	Wheat and barley are pounded,
ISA.28.28	but not beaten to pulp;
ISA.28.28	they are run over with a wagon,
ISA.28.28	but not ground to dust.
ISA.28.29	This wonderful knowledge comes
ISA.28.29	from the 
ISA.28.29	who has such great wisdom.
ISA.29.1	Jerusalem, city of David,
ISA.29.1	the place of my altar,
ISA.29.1	you are in for trouble!
ISA.29.1	Celebrate your festivals
ISA.29.1	year after year.
ISA.29.2	I will still make you suffer,
ISA.29.2	and your people will cry
ISA.29.2	when I make an altar of you.
ISA.29.3	I will surround you and prepare
ISA.29.3	to attack from all sides.
ISA.29.4	From deep in the earth,
ISA.29.4	you will call out for help
ISA.29.4	with only a faint whisper.
ISA.29.5	Then your cruel enemies
ISA.29.5	will suddenly be swept away
ISA.29.5	like dust in a windstorm.
ISA.29.6	I, the 
ISA.29.6	will come to your rescue
ISA.29.6	with a thundering earthquake
ISA.29.6	and a fiery whirlwind.
ISA.29.7	Every brutal nation
ISA.29.7	that attacks Jerusalem
ISA.29.7	and makes it suffer
ISA.29.7	will disappear like a dream
ISA.29.7	when night is over.
ISA.29.8	Those nations that attack
ISA.29.8	Mount Zion
ISA.29.8	will suffer from hunger
ISA.29.8	and thirst.
ISA.29.8	They will dream of food and drink
ISA.29.8	but wake up weary and hungry
ISA.29.8	and thirsty as ever.
ISA.29.9	Be shocked and stunned,
ISA.29.9	you prophets!
ISA.29.9	Refuse to see.
ISA.29.9	Get drunk and stagger,
ISA.29.9	but not from wine.
ISA.29.10	he put you into a deep sleep
ISA.29.10	and covered your head.
ISA.29.11	Now his message is like a sealed letter to you. Some of you say, “We can't read it, because it's sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Others say, “We can't read it, because we don't know how to read.”
ISA.29.13	“These people praise me
ISA.29.13	with their words,
ISA.29.13	but they never really
ISA.29.13	think about me.
ISA.29.13	They worship me by repeating
ISA.29.13	rules made up by humans.
ISA.29.14	that shock and amaze them,
ISA.29.14	and I will destroy the wisdom
ISA.29.14	of those who claim to know
ISA.29.14	and understand.”
ISA.29.15	You are in for trouble,
ISA.29.15	if you try to hide your plans
ISA.29.15	from the 
ISA.29.15	Or if you think what you do
ISA.29.15	in the dark can't be seen.
ISA.29.16	A clay dish doesn't say
ISA.29.16	to the potter,
ISA.29.16	“You didn't make me.
ISA.29.16	You don't even know how.”
ISA.29.17	Soon the forest of Lebanon
ISA.29.17	will become a field with crops,
ISA.29.17	thick as a forest.
ISA.29.18	The deaf will be able to hear
ISA.29.18	whatever is read to them;
ISA.29.18	the blind will be freed
ISA.29.18	from a life of darkness.
ISA.29.19	The poor and the needy
ISA.29.19	will celebrate and shout
ISA.29.19	because of the 
ISA.29.19	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.29.20	All who are cruel and arrogant
ISA.29.20	will be gone forever.
ISA.29.20	Those who live by crime
ISA.29.20	will disappear,
ISA.29.21	together with everyone
ISA.29.21	who tells lies in court
ISA.29.21	and keeps innocent people
ISA.29.21	from getting a fair trial.
ISA.29.22	The 
ISA.29.22	has this to say
ISA.29.22	about Jacob's descendants:
ISA.29.22	“They will no longer
ISA.29.22	be ashamed and disgraced.
ISA.29.23	When they see how great
ISA.29.23	I have made their nation,
ISA.29.23	they will praise and honor me,
ISA.29.23	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	Everyone who is confused
ISA.29.24	will understand,
ISA.29.24	and all who have complained
ISA.29.24	will obey my teaching.”
ISA.30.1	This is the 
ISA.30.1	“You follow your own plans
ISA.30.1	instead of mine;
ISA.30.1	you make treaties
ISA.30.1	without asking me,
ISA.30.1	and you keep on sinning.
ISA.30.2	You trust Egypt for protection.
ISA.30.2	So you refuse my advice
ISA.30.2	and send messengers to Egypt
ISA.30.2	to beg their king for help.
ISA.30.3	“You will be disappointed,
ISA.30.3	completely disgraced
ISA.30.3	for trusting Egypt.
ISA.30.4	The king's power reaches
ISA.30.4	from the city of Zoan
ISA.30.4	as far south as Hanes.
ISA.30.5	But Egypt can't protect you,
ISA.30.5	and to trust that nation
ISA.30.5	is useless and foolish.”
ISA.30.6	This is a message
ISA.30.6	about the animals
ISA.30.6	of the Southern Desert:
ISA.30.6	“You people carry treasures
ISA.30.6	on donkeys and camels.
ISA.30.6	You travel to a feeble nation
ISA.30.6	through a troublesome desert
ISA.30.6	filled with lions
ISA.30.6	and flying fiery dragons.
ISA.30.7	Egypt can't help you!
ISA.30.7	That's why I call that nation
ISA.30.7	a helpless monster.”
ISA.30.8	The 
ISA.30.9	They have turned against the 
ISA.30.10	and have said to his messengers and prophets:
ISA.30.10	Don't tell us what God has shown you and don't preach the truth. Just say what we want to hear, even if it's false. 
ISA.30.11	Stop telling us what God has said! We don't want to hear any more about the holy One of Israel.
ISA.30.12	Now this is the answer
ISA.30.12	of the holy One of Israel:
ISA.30.12	“You rejected my message,
ISA.30.12	and you trust in violence
ISA.30.12	and lies.
ISA.30.13	This sin is like a crack
ISA.30.13	that makes a high wall
ISA.30.13	quickly crumble 
ISA.30.14	and shatter
ISA.30.14	like a crushed bowl.
ISA.30.14	There's not a piece left
ISA.30.14	big enough to carry hot coals
ISA.30.14	or to dip out water.”
ISA.30.15	The holy 
ISA.30.15	had told all of you,
ISA.30.15	“I will keep you safe
ISA.30.15	if you turn back to me
ISA.30.15	and calm down.
ISA.30.15	I will make you strong
ISA.30.15	if you quietly trust me.”
ISA.30.15	Then you stubbornly 
ISA.30.16	said,
ISA.30.16	“No! We will safely escape
ISA.30.16	on speedy horses.”
ISA.30.16	But those who chase you
ISA.30.16	will be even faster.
ISA.30.17	As few as five of them,
ISA.30.17	or even one, will be enough
ISA.30.17	to chase a thousand of you.
ISA.30.17	Finally, all that will be left
ISA.30.17	will be a few survivors
ISA.30.17	as lonely as a flag pole
ISA.30.17	on a barren hill.
ISA.30.18	The 
ISA.30.18	to show how kind he is
ISA.30.18	and to have pity on you.
ISA.30.18	The 
ISA.30.18	he blesses those who trust him.
ISA.30.19	People of Jerusalem, you don't need to cry anymore. The Lord is kind, and as soon as he hears your cries for help, he will come. 
ISA.30.20	The Lord has given you trouble and sorrow as your food and drink. But now you will again see the Lord, your teacher, and he will guide you. 
ISA.30.21	Whether you turn to the right or to the left, you will hear a voice saying, “This is the road! Now follow it.” 
ISA.30.22	Then you will treat your idols of silver and gold like garbage; you will throw them away like filthy rags.
ISA.30.23	The Lord will send rain to water the seeds you have planted—your fields will produce more crops than you need, and your cattle will graze in open pastures. 
ISA.30.24	Even the oxen and donkeys that plow your fields will be fed the finest grain.
ISA.30.25	On that day people will be slaughtered and towers destroyed, but streams of water will flow from high hills and towering mountains. 
ISA.30.26	Then the 
ISA.30.27	The 
ISA.30.27	from far away
ISA.30.27	with his fiery anger
ISA.30.27	and thick clouds of smoke.
ISA.30.27	His angry words flame up
ISA.30.27	like a destructive fire;
ISA.30.28	he breathes out a flood
ISA.30.28	that comes up to the neck.
ISA.30.28	He sifts the nations
ISA.30.28	and destroys them.
ISA.30.28	Then he puts a bridle
ISA.30.28	in every foreigner's mouth
ISA.30.28	and leads them to doom.
ISA.30.29	The 
ISA.30.30	The 
ISA.30.31	When the Assyrians hear the 
ISA.30.32	He will attack them in battle, and each time he strikes them, it will be to the music of tambourines and harps.
ISA.30.33	Long ago the 
ISA.31.1	You are in for trouble
ISA.31.1	if you go to Egypt for help,
ISA.31.1	or if you depend on
ISA.31.1	an army of chariots
ISA.31.1	or a powerful cavalry.
ISA.31.1	Instead you should depend on
ISA.31.1	and trust the holy 
ISA.31.1	of Israel.
ISA.31.2	The 
ISA.31.2	He does what he promises,
ISA.31.2	and he can bring doom.
ISA.31.2	If you are cruel yourself,
ISA.31.2	or help those who are evil,
ISA.31.2	you will be destroyed.
ISA.31.3	The Egyptians are mere humans.
ISA.31.3	They aren't God.
ISA.31.3	Their horses are made of flesh;
ISA.31.3	they can't live forever.
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	he will destroy the Egyptians
ISA.31.3	and all who depend on them.
ISA.31.3	Together they will fall.
ISA.31.4	The 
ISA.31.4	said to me,
ISA.31.4	“I will roar and attack
ISA.31.4	like a fearless lion
ISA.31.4	not frightened by the shouts
ISA.31.4	of shepherds trying to protect
ISA.31.4	their sheep.
ISA.31.4	That's how I will come down
ISA.31.4	and fight on Mount Zion.
ISA.31.5	I, the 
ISA.31.5	will protect Jerusalem
ISA.31.5	like a mother bird circling
ISA.31.5	over her nest.”
ISA.31.6	People of Israel, come back!
ISA.31.6	You have completely turned
ISA.31.6	from the 
ISA.31.7	The time is coming
ISA.31.7	when you will throw away
ISA.31.7	your idols of silver and gold,
ISA.31.7	made by your sinful hands.
ISA.31.8	The Assyrians will be killed,
ISA.31.8	but not by the swords
ISA.31.8	of humans.
ISA.31.8	Their young men will try
ISA.31.8	to escape,
ISA.31.8	but they will be captured
ISA.31.8	and forced into slavery.
ISA.31.9	Their fortress
ISA.31.9	when terror strikes;
ISA.31.9	their army officers
ISA.31.9	will be frightened
ISA.31.9	and run from the battle.
ISA.31.9	This is what the 
ISA.31.9	the 
ISA.31.9	is built on Mount Zion.
ISA.32.1	A king and his leaders
ISA.32.1	will rule with justice.
ISA.32.2	They will be a place of safety
ISA.32.2	from stormy winds,
ISA.32.2	a stream in the desert,
ISA.32.2	and a rock that gives shade
ISA.32.2	from the heat of the sun.
ISA.32.3	Then everyone who has eyes
ISA.32.3	will open them and see,
ISA.32.3	and those who have ears
ISA.32.3	will pay attention.
ISA.32.4	All who are impatient
ISA.32.4	will take time to think;
ISA.32.4	everyone who stutters
ISA.32.4	will talk clearly.
ISA.32.5	Fools will no longer
ISA.32.5	be highly respected,
ISA.32.5	and crooks won't be given
ISA.32.5	positions of honor.
ISA.32.6	Fools talk foolishness.
ISA.32.6	They always make plans
ISA.32.6	to do sinful things,
ISA.32.6	to lie about the 
ISA.32.6	to let the hungry starve,
ISA.32.6	and to keep water from those
ISA.32.6	who are thirsty.
ISA.32.7	Cruel people tell lies—
ISA.32.7	they do evil things,
ISA.32.7	and make cruel plans
ISA.32.7	to destroy the poor and needy,
ISA.32.7	even when they beg
ISA.32.7	for justice.
ISA.32.8	But helpful people
ISA.32.8	can always be trusted
ISA.32.8	to make helpful plans.
ISA.32.9	Listen to what I say,
ISA.32.9	you women who are carefree
ISA.32.9	and careless!
ISA.32.10	You may not have worries now,
ISA.32.10	but in about a year,
ISA.32.10	the grape harvest will fail,
ISA.32.10	and you will tremble.
ISA.32.11	Shake and shudder,
ISA.32.11	you women without a care!
ISA.32.11	Strip off your clothes—
ISA.32.11	put on sackcloth.
ISA.32.12	Slap your breasts in sorrow
ISA.32.12	because of what happened
ISA.32.12	to the fruitful fields
ISA.32.12	and vineyards,
ISA.32.13	and to the happy homes
ISA.32.13	in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.13	The land of my people
ISA.32.13	is covered with thorns.
ISA.32.14	The palace will be deserted,
ISA.32.14	the crowded city empty.
ISA.32.14	Fortresses and towers
ISA.32.14	will forever become
ISA.32.14	playgrounds for wild donkeys
ISA.32.14	and pastures for sheep.
ISA.32.15	When the Spirit is given to us
ISA.32.15	from heaven,
ISA.32.15	deserts will become orchards
ISA.32.15	thick as fertile forests.
ISA.32.16	Honesty and justice
ISA.32.16	will prosper there,
ISA.32.17	and justice will produce
ISA.32.17	lasting peace and security.
ISA.32.18	You, the 
ISA.32.18	will live in peace,
ISA.32.18	calm and secure,
ISA.32.19	even if hailstones flatten
ISA.32.19	forests and cities.
ISA.32.20	You will have God's blessing,
ISA.32.20	as you plant your crops
ISA.32.20	beside streams,
ISA.32.20	while your donkeys and cattle
ISA.32.20	roam freely about.
ISA.33.1	You defeated my people.
ISA.33.1	Now you're in for trouble!
ISA.33.1	You've never been destroyed,
ISA.33.1	but you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	you've never been betrayed,
ISA.33.1	but you will be betrayed.
ISA.33.1	When you have finished
ISA.33.1	destroying and betraying,
ISA.33.1	you will be destroyed
ISA.33.1	and betrayed in return.
ISA.33.2	Please, 
ISA.33.2	We depend on you.
ISA.33.2	Make us strong each morning,
ISA.33.2	and come to save us
ISA.33.2	when we are in trouble.
ISA.33.3	Nations scatter when you roar
ISA.33.3	and show your greatness.
ISA.33.4	We attack our enemies
ISA.33.4	like swarms of locusts;
ISA.33.4	we take everything
ISA.33.4	that belongs to them.
ISA.33.5	You, 
ISA.33.5	and you live in the heavens.
ISA.33.5	You have brought justice
ISA.33.5	and fairness to Jerusalem;
ISA.33.6	you are the foundation
ISA.33.6	on which we stand today.
ISA.33.6	You always save us and give
ISA.33.6	true wisdom and knowledge.
ISA.33.6	Nothing means more to us
ISA.33.6	than obeying you.
ISA.33.7	Listen! Our bravest soldiers
ISA.33.7	are running through the streets,
ISA.33.7	screaming for help.
ISA.33.7	Our messengers hoped for peace,
ISA.33.7	but came home crying.
ISA.33.8	No one travels anymore;
ISA.33.8	every road is empty.
ISA.33.8	Treaties are broken,
ISA.33.8	and no respect is shown
ISA.33.8	to any who keep promises.
ISA.33.9	Fields are dry and barren;
ISA.33.9	Mount Lebanon wilts
ISA.33.9	with shame.
ISA.33.9	Sharon Valley is a desert;
ISA.33.9	the forests of Bashan and Carmel
ISA.33.9	have lost their leaves.
ISA.33.10	But the 
ISA.33.10	“Now I will do something
ISA.33.10	and be greatly praised.
ISA.33.11	Your deeds are straw
ISA.33.11	that will be set on fire
ISA.33.11	by your very own breath.
ISA.33.12	You will be burned to ashes
ISA.33.12	like thorns in a fire.
ISA.33.13	Everyone, both far and near,
ISA.33.13	come look at what I have done.
ISA.33.13	See my mighty power!”
ISA.33.14	Those terrible sinners
ISA.33.14	on Mount Zion tremble
ISA.33.14	as they ask in fear,
ISA.33.14	“How can we possibly live
ISA.33.14	where a raging fire
ISA.33.14	never stops burning?”
ISA.33.15	But there will be rewards
ISA.33.15	for those who live right
ISA.33.15	and tell the truth,
ISA.33.15	for those who refuse
ISA.33.15	to take money by force
ISA.33.15	or accept bribes,
ISA.33.15	for all who hate murder
ISA.33.15	and violent crimes.
ISA.33.16	They will live in a fortress
ISA.33.16	high on a rocky cliff,
ISA.33.16	where they will have food
ISA.33.16	and plenty of water.
ISA.33.17	With your own eyes
ISA.33.17	you will see the glorious King;
ISA.33.17	you will see his kingdom
ISA.33.17	reaching far and wide.
ISA.33.18	Then you will ask yourself,
ISA.33.18	“Where are those officials
ISA.33.18	who terrified us and forced us
ISA.33.18	to pay such heavy taxes?”
ISA.33.19	You will never again have to see
ISA.33.19	the proud people who spoke
ISA.33.19	a strange and foreign language
ISA.33.19	you could not understand.
ISA.33.20	Look to Mount Zion
ISA.33.20	where we celebrate
ISA.33.20	our religious festivals.
ISA.33.20	You will see Jerusalem,
ISA.33.20	secure as a tent with pegs
ISA.33.20	that cannot be pulled up
ISA.33.20	and fastened with ropes
ISA.33.20	that can never be broken.
ISA.33.21	Our wonderful 
ISA.33.21	will be with us!
ISA.33.21	There will be deep rivers
ISA.33.21	and wide streams
ISA.33.21	safe from enemy ships.
ISA.33.22	The 
ISA.33.22	and our ruler;
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.22	and will keep us safe.
ISA.33.23	But your nation
ISA.33.23	with its rigging loose,
ISA.33.23	its mast shaky,
ISA.33.23	and its sail not spread.
ISA.33.23	Someday even you that are lame
ISA.33.23	will take everything you want
ISA.33.23	from your enemies.
ISA.33.24	The 
ISA.33.24	and none of you will say,
ISA.33.24	“I feel sick.”
ISA.34.1	Everyone of every nation,
ISA.34.1	the entire earth,
ISA.34.1	and all its creatures,
ISA.34.1	come here and listen!
ISA.34.2	The 
ISA.34.2	with the nations;
ISA.34.2	he has condemned them
ISA.34.2	to be slaughtered.
ISA.34.3	Their dead bodies will be left
ISA.34.3	to rot and stink;
ISA.34.3	their blood will flow
ISA.34.3	down the mountains.
ISA.34.4	the sky will roll up
ISA.34.4	like a scroll.
ISA.34.4	Everything in the sky
ISA.34.4	will dry up and wilt
ISA.34.4	like leaves on a vine
ISA.34.4	or fruit on a tree.
ISA.34.5	has done what it wants
ISA.34.5	to the skies above,
ISA.34.5	it will come down on Edom,
ISA.34.5	the nation that the 
ISA.34.5	has doomed for destruction.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.6	is covered with blood
ISA.34.6	from lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	together with fat
ISA.34.6	from kidneys of rams.
ISA.34.6	This is because the 
ISA.34.6	will slaughter many people
ISA.34.6	and make a sacrifice of them
ISA.34.6	in the city of Bozrah
ISA.34.6	and everywhere else
ISA.34.6	in Edom.
ISA.34.7	Edom's leaders are wild oxen.
ISA.34.7	They are powerful bulls,
ISA.34.7	but they will die
ISA.34.7	with the others.
ISA.34.7	Their country will be soaked
ISA.34.7	with their own blood,
ISA.34.7	and its soil made fertile
ISA.34.7	with their own fat.
ISA.34.8	The 
ISA.34.8	the year and the day,
ISA.34.8	when he will take revenge
ISA.34.8	and come to Zion's defense.
ISA.34.9	Edom's streams will turn into tar
ISA.34.9	and its soil into sulfur—
ISA.34.9	then the whole country
ISA.34.9	will go up in flames.
ISA.34.10	and never stop smoking.
ISA.34.10	Edom will be a desert,
ISA.34.10	generation after generation;
ISA.34.10	no one will ever travel
ISA.34.10	through that land.
ISA.34.11	Owls, hawks, and wild animals
ISA.34.11	will make it their home.
ISA.34.11	God will leave it in ruins,
ISA.34.11	merely a pile of rocks.
ISA.34.12	Edom will be called
ISA.34.12	“Kingdom of Nothing.”
ISA.34.12	Its rulers will also be nothing.
ISA.34.13	Its palaces and fortresses
ISA.34.13	will be covered with thorns;
ISA.34.13	only wolves and ostriches
ISA.34.13	will make their home there.
ISA.34.14	Wildcats and hyenas
ISA.34.14	will hunt together,
ISA.34.14	demons will scream to demons,
ISA.34.14	and creatures of the night
ISA.34.14	will live among the ruins.
ISA.34.15	Owls will nest there
ISA.34.15	to raise their young
ISA.34.15	among its shadows,
ISA.34.15	while families of vultures
ISA.34.15	circle around.
ISA.34.16	In 
ISA.34.16	you can search and find
ISA.34.16	where it is written,
ISA.34.16	“The 
ISA.34.16	all of his creatures
ISA.34.16	by the power of his Spirit.
ISA.34.16	Not one is missing.”
ISA.34.17	The 
ISA.34.17	where they each should live;
ISA.34.17	they will be there forever,
ISA.34.17	generation after generation.
ISA.35.1	Thirsty deserts will be glad;
ISA.35.1	barren lands will celebrate
ISA.35.1	and blossom with flowers.
ISA.35.2	Deserts will bloom everywhere
ISA.35.2	and sing joyful songs.
ISA.35.2	They will be as majestic
ISA.35.2	as Mount Lebanon,
ISA.35.2	as glorious as Mount Carmel
ISA.35.2	or Sharon Valley.
ISA.35.2	Everyone will see
ISA.35.2	the wonderful splendor
ISA.35.2	of the 
ISA.35.2	* 
ISA.35.3	 Here is a message for all
ISA.35.3	who are weak, trembling,
ISA.35.3	and worried:
ISA.35.4	“Cheer up! Don't be afraid.
ISA.35.4	Your God is coming
ISA.35.4	to punish your enemies.
ISA.35.4	God will take revenge on them
ISA.35.4	and rescue you.”
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf
ISA.35.5	will be healed.
ISA.35.6	will leap around like deer;
ISA.35.6	tongues once silent
ISA.35.6	will shout for joy.
ISA.35.6	Water will rush
ISA.35.6	through the desert.
ISA.35.7	Scorching sand
ISA.35.7	will turn into a lake,
ISA.35.7	and thirsty ground
ISA.35.7	will flow with fountains.
ISA.35.7	Grass will grow in deserts,
ISA.35.7	where packs of wild dogs
ISA.35.7	once made their home.
ISA.35.8	A good road will be there,
ISA.35.8	and it will be named
ISA.35.8	“God's Sacred Highway.”
ISA.35.8	It will be for God's people;
ISA.35.8	no one unfit to worship God
ISA.35.8	will walk on that road.
ISA.35.8	And no fools can travel
ISA.35.8	on that highway.
ISA.35.9	No lions or other wild animals
ISA.35.9	will come near that road;
ISA.35.9	only those the 
ISA.35.9	will travel there.
ISA.35.10	The people the 
ISA.35.10	will come back singing
ISA.35.10	as they enter Zion.
ISA.35.10	Happiness will be a crown
ISA.35.10	everyone will always wear.
ISA.35.10	They will celebrate and shout
ISA.35.10	because all sorrows and worries
ISA.35.10	will be gone far away.
ISA.36.1	Hezekiah had been king of Judah for 14 years when King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city 
ISA.36.2	except Jerusalem. The Assyrian king ordered his army commander to leave the city of Lachish and to take a large army to Jerusalem.
ISA.36.2	The commander went there and stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool. 
ISA.36.3	Three of the king's highest officials came out of Jerusalem to meet him. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records.
ISA.36.4	The Assyrian commander told them:
ISA.36.4	I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself. 
ISA.36.5	Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria? 
ISA.36.6	 Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand.
ISA.36.7	Is Hezekiah now depending on the 
ISA.36.8	The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people! He will give you 2,000 horses, if you have enough troops to ride them. 
ISA.36.9	How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry? 
ISA.36.10	Don't forget that it was the 
ISA.36.11	Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, “Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.”
ISA.36.12	The Assyrian army commander answered, “My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you!”
ISA.36.13	Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted out in Hebrew:
ISA.36.13	Listen to what the great king of Assyria says! 
ISA.36.14	Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you. 
ISA.36.15	Don't trust him when he tells you that the 
ISA.36.16	Stop listening to Hezekiah. Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns 
ISA.36.17	for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards and raise your own grain.
ISA.36.18	Hezekiah claims the 
ISA.36.19	What happened to the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces? 
ISA.36.20	None of those gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the 
ISA.36.21+ISA.36.22	Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah had been warned by King Hezekiah not to answer the Assyrian commander. So they tore their clothes in sorrow and reported to Hezekiah everything the commander had said.
ISA.37.1	As soon as Hezekiah heard the news, he tore off his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he went into the temple of the 
ISA.37.2	He told Prime Minister Eliakim, Assistant Prime Minister Shebna, and the senior priests to dress in sackcloth and tell me:
ISA.37.3	Isaiah, these are difficult and disgraceful times. Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth, when it's time for her baby to be born. 
ISA.37.4	Please pray for those of us who are left alive. The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God. Perhaps the 
ISA.37.5	When these leaders came to me, 
ISA.37.6	I told them that the 
ISA.37.6	I am the 
ISA.37.7	I will upset him with rumors about what's happening in his own country. He will go back, and there I will make him die a violent death.
ISA.37.8	Meanwhile the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah. So he went there.
ISA.37.9	About this same time, the king of Assyria learned that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia
ISA.37.10	Don't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me. 
ISA.37.11	You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations. What makes you feel so safe? 
ISA.37.12	The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar. What good did their gods do them? 
ISA.37.13	The kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah have all disappeared.
ISA.37.14	After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the 
ISA.37.15	Then he prayed:
ISA.37.17	Just look and see how Sennacherib has insulted you, the living God.
ISA.37.18	It is true, our 
ISA.37.19	They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshiped. 
ISA.37.20	But you are our 
ISA.37.21+ISA.37.22	I went to Hezekiah and told him that the 
ISA.37.21+ISA.37.22	Hezekiah, you prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria.
ISA.37.21+ISA.37.22	The people of Jerusalem
ISA.37.21+ISA.37.22	hate and make fun of you;
ISA.37.21+ISA.37.22	they laugh behind your back.
ISA.37.23	Sennacherib, you cursed,
ISA.37.23	shouted and sneered at me,
ISA.37.23	the holy One of Israel.
ISA.37.24	You let your officials
ISA.37.24	insult me, the Lord.
ISA.37.24	And here is what you
ISA.37.24	have said about yourself,
ISA.37.24	“I led my chariots
ISA.37.24	to the highest heights
ISA.37.24	of Lebanon's mountains.
ISA.37.24	I went deep into its forest,
ISA.37.24	cutting down the best cedar
ISA.37.24	and cypress trees.
ISA.37.25	I dried up every stream
ISA.37.25	in the land of Egypt,
ISA.37.25	and I drank water
ISA.37.25	from wells I had dug.”
ISA.37.26	Sennacherib, now listen
ISA.37.26	to me, the 
ISA.37.26	I planned all of this long ago.
ISA.37.26	And you don't even know
ISA.37.26	that I alone am the one
ISA.37.26	who decided that you
ISA.37.26	would do these things.
ISA.37.26	I let you make ruins
ISA.37.26	of fortified cities.
ISA.37.27	Their people became weak,
ISA.37.27	terribly confused.
ISA.37.27	They were like wild flowers
ISA.37.27	or like tender young grass
ISA.37.27	growing on a flat roof
ISA.37.27	or like a field of grain
ISA.37.27	before it matures.
ISA.37.28	I know all about you,
ISA.37.28	even how fiercely angry
ISA.37.28	you are with me.
ISA.37.29	I have seen your pride
ISA.37.29	and the tremendous hatred
ISA.37.29	you have for me.
ISA.37.29	Now I will put a hook
ISA.37.29	in your nose,
ISA.37.29	a bit in your mouth,
ISA.37.29	then I will send you back
ISA.37.29	to where you came from.
ISA.37.30	Hezekiah, I will tell you what's going to happen. This year you will eat crops that grow on their own, and the next year you will eat whatever springs up where those crops grew. But the third year, you will plant grain and vineyards, and you will eat what you harvest. 
ISA.37.31	Those who survive in Judah will be like a vine that puts down deep roots and bears fruit. 
ISA.37.32	I, the 
ISA.37.33	I promise that the king of Assyria won't get into Jerusalem, or shoot an arrow into the city, or even surround it and prepare to attack. 
ISA.37.34	As surely as I am the 
ISA.37.35	I will protect it for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.
ISA.37.36	The 
ISA.37.37	After this, King Sennacherib went back to Assyria and lived in the city of Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	One day he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, when his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords. They escaped to the land of Ararat, and his son Esarhaddon became king.
ISA.38.1	About this time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. So I went in and told him, “The 
ISA.38.2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed, 
ISA.38.3	“Don't forget that I have been faithful to you, 
ISA.38.4	Then the 
ISA.38.5	with this message for Hezekiah:
ISA.38.5	I am the 
ISA.38.6	while I protect you and your city from the king of Assyria.
ISA.38.7	Now I will prove to you that I will keep my promise. 
ISA.38.8	Do you see the shadow made by the setting sun on the stairway built for King Ahaz? I will make the shadow go back ten steps.
ISA.38.8	Then the shadow went back ten steps.
ISA.38.9	This is what Hezekiah wrote after he got well:
ISA.38.10	I thought I would die
ISA.38.10	during my best years
ISA.38.10	and stay as a prisoner forever
ISA.38.10	in the world of the dead.
ISA.38.11	I thought I would never again
ISA.38.11	see you, my 
ISA.38.11	or any of the people
ISA.38.11	who live on this earth.
ISA.38.12	My life was taken from me
ISA.38.12	like the tent that a shepherd
ISA.38.12	pulls up and moves.
ISA.38.12	You cut me off like thread
ISA.38.12	from a weaver's loom;
ISA.38.12	you make a wreck of me
ISA.38.12	day and night.
ISA.38.13	Until morning came, I thought
ISA.38.13	you would crush my bones
ISA.38.13	just like a hungry lion;
ISA.38.13	both night and day
ISA.38.13	you make a wreck of me.
ISA.38.14	I cry like a swallow;
ISA.38.14	I mourn like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes are red
ISA.38.14	from looking to you, 
ISA.38.14	I am in terrible trouble.
ISA.38.14	Please come and help me.
ISA.38.15	There's nothing I can say
ISA.38.15	in answer to you,
ISA.38.15	since you are the one
ISA.38.15	who has done this to me.
ISA.38.15	My life has turned sour;
ISA.38.15	I will limp until I die.
ISA.38.16	Your words and your deeds
ISA.38.16	bring life to everyone,
ISA.38.16	including me.
ISA.38.16	Please make me healthy
ISA.38.16	and strong again.
ISA.38.17	It was for my own good
ISA.38.17	that I had such hard times.
ISA.38.17	But your love protected me
ISA.38.17	from doom in the deep pit,
ISA.38.17	and you turned your eyes
ISA.38.17	away from my sins.
ISA.38.18	can thank you or praise you;
ISA.38.18	none of those in the deep pit
ISA.38.18	can hope for you
ISA.38.18	to show them
ISA.38.18	how faithful you are.
ISA.38.19	Only the living can thank you,
ISA.38.19	as I am doing today.
ISA.38.19	Each generation tells the next
ISA.38.19	about your faithfulness.
ISA.38.20	You, 
ISA.38.20	and every day that we live
ISA.38.20	we will sing in your temple
ISA.38.20	to the music
ISA.38.20	of stringed instruments.
ISA.38.21	I had told King Hezekiah's servants to put some mashed figs on the king's open sore, and he would get well. 
ISA.38.22	Then Hezekiah asked for proof that he would again worship in the 
ISA.39.1	Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, was now king of Babylonia. And when he learned that Hezekiah was well, he sent messengers with letters and a gift for him. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them all the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oils that were in his storehouse. He even showed them where he kept his weapons. Nothing in his palace or in his entire kingdom was kept hidden from them.
ISA.39.3	I asked Hezekiah, “Where did these men come from? What did they want?”
ISA.39.3	“They came all the way from Babylonia,” Hezekiah answered.
ISA.39.4	“What did you show them?” I asked.
ISA.39.4	Hezekiah answered, “I showed them everything in my kingdom.”
ISA.39.5	Then I told Hezekiah:
ISA.39.5	I have a message for you from the 
ISA.39.6	One day everything you and your ancestors have stored up will be taken to Babylonia. The 
ISA.39.7	 Some of your own sons will be taken to Babylonia, where they will be disgraced and made to serve in the king's palace.
ISA.39.8	Hezekiah thought, “At least our nation will be at peace for a while.” So he told me, “The message you brought from the 
ISA.40.1	Our God has said:
ISA.40.1	“Encourage my people!
ISA.40.1	Give them comfort.
ISA.40.2	Speak kindly to Jerusalem
ISA.40.2	and announce:
ISA.40.2	Your slavery is past;
ISA.40.2	your punishment is over.
ISA.40.2	I, the 
ISA.40.2	double for your sins.”
ISA.40.3	“Clear a path in the desert!
ISA.40.3	Make a straight road
ISA.40.3	for the 
ISA.40.4	Fill in the valleys;
ISA.40.4	flatten every hill
ISA.40.4	and mountain.
ISA.40.4	Level the rough
ISA.40.4	and rugged ground.
ISA.40.5	Then the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	will appear for all to see.
ISA.40.5	The 
ISA.40.6	and I asked,
ISA.40.6	“What should I shout?”
ISA.40.6	We humans are merely grass,
ISA.40.6	and we last no longer
ISA.40.6	than wild flowers.
ISA.40.7	At the 
ISA.40.7	flowers and grass disappear,
ISA.40.7	and so do we.
ISA.40.8	Flowers and grass fade away,
ISA.40.8	but what our God has said
ISA.40.8	will never change.
ISA.40.9	There is good news
ISA.40.9	for the city of Zion.
ISA.40.9	Shout it as loud as you can
ISA.40.9	from the highest mountain.
ISA.40.9	Don't be afraid to shout
ISA.40.9	to the towns of Judah:
ISA.40.9	“Your God is here!”
ISA.40.10	is coming to rule
ISA.40.10	with his mighty arm.
ISA.40.10	He brings with him
ISA.40.10	what he has taken in war,
ISA.40.10	and he rewards his people.
ISA.40.11	just as shepherds care
ISA.40.11	for their flocks.
ISA.40.11	He carries the lambs
ISA.40.11	in his arms,
ISA.40.11	while gently leading
ISA.40.11	the mother sheep.
ISA.40.12	Did any of you measure
ISA.40.12	the ocean by yourself
ISA.40.12	or stretch out the sky
ISA.40.12	with your own hands?
ISA.40.12	Did you put the soil
ISA.40.12	of the earth in a bucket
ISA.40.12	or weigh the hills and mountains
ISA.40.12	on balance scales?
ISA.40.13	what he must do
ISA.40.13	or given him advice?
ISA.40.14	Did the 
ISA.40.14	to teach him wisdom
ISA.40.14	and justice?
ISA.40.14	Who gave him knowledge
ISA.40.14	and understanding?
ISA.40.15	are merely a drop in a bucket
ISA.40.15	or dust on balance scales;
ISA.40.15	all of the islands
ISA.40.15	are but a handful of sand.
ISA.40.16	The cattle on the mountains
ISA.40.16	of Lebanon
ISA.40.16	would not be enough to offer
ISA.40.16	as a sacrifice to God,
ISA.40.16	and the trees would not
ISA.40.16	be enough for the fire.
ISA.40.17	God thinks of the nations
ISA.40.17	as far less than nothing.
ISA.40.18	Is anything like him?
ISA.40.19	Is an idol at all like God?
ISA.40.19	It is made of bronze
ISA.40.19	with a thin layer of gold,
ISA.40.19	and decorated with silver.
ISA.40.20	because it doesn't rot—
ISA.40.20	then skilled hands
ISA.40.20	take care to make an idol
ISA.40.20	that won't fall on its face.
ISA.40.21	Don't you know?
ISA.40.21	Haven't you heard?
ISA.40.21	Hasn't it been clear
ISA.40.21	since the time of creation?
ISA.40.22	God is the one who rules
ISA.40.22	the whole earth,
ISA.40.22	and we that live here
ISA.40.22	are merely insects.
ISA.40.22	He spread out the heavens
ISA.40.22	like a curtain or an open tent.
ISA.40.23	God brings down rulers
ISA.40.23	and turns them into nothing.
ISA.40.24	They are like flowers
ISA.40.24	freshly sprung up
ISA.40.24	and starting to grow.
ISA.40.24	But when God blows on them,
ISA.40.24	they wilt and are carried off
ISA.40.24	like straw in a storm.
ISA.40.25	The holy God asks,
ISA.40.25	“Who compares with me?
ISA.40.25	Is anyone my equal?”
ISA.40.26	Who created the stars?
ISA.40.26	Who gave them each a name?
ISA.40.26	Who leads them like an army?
ISA.40.26	The 
ISA.40.26	that none of the stars
ISA.40.26	are ever missing.
ISA.40.27	You people of Israel say,
ISA.40.27	“God pays no attention to us!
ISA.40.27	He doesn't care if we
ISA.40.27	are treated unjustly.”
ISA.40.27	But how can you say that?
ISA.40.28	Don't you know?
ISA.40.28	Haven't you heard?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	Creator of the earth.
ISA.40.28	He never gets weary or tired;
ISA.40.28	his wisdom cannot be measured.
ISA.40.29	The 
ISA.40.29	to those who are weary.
ISA.40.30	Even young people get tired,
ISA.40.30	then stumble and fall.
ISA.40.31	But those who trust the 
ISA.40.31	will find new strength.
ISA.40.31	They will be strong like eagles
ISA.40.31	soaring upward on wings;
ISA.40.31	they will walk and run
ISA.40.31	without getting tired.
ISA.41.1	Be silent and listen,
ISA.41.1	every island in the sea.
ISA.41.1	Have courage and come near,
ISA.41.1	every one of you nations.
ISA.41.1	Let's settle this matter!
ISA.41.2	Who appointed this ruler
ISA.41.2	from the east?
ISA.41.2	Who puts nations and kings
ISA.41.2	in his power?
ISA.41.2	His sword and his arrows
ISA.41.2	turn them to dust
ISA.41.2	blown by the wind.
ISA.41.3	He goes after them so quickly
ISA.41.3	that his feet
ISA.41.3	barely touch the ground—
ISA.41.3	he doesn't even get hurt.
ISA.41.4	Who makes these things happen?
ISA.41.4	Who controls human events?
ISA.41.4	I do! I am the 
ISA.41.4	I was there at the beginning;
ISA.41.4	I will be there at the end.
ISA.41.5	Islands and foreign nations
ISA.41.5	saw what I did and trembled
ISA.41.5	as they came near.
ISA.41.6	Worshipers of idols
ISA.41.6	comfort each other,
ISA.41.6	saying, “Don't worry!”
ISA.41.7	Woodcarvers, goldsmiths,
ISA.41.7	and other workers
ISA.41.7	encourage one another and say,
ISA.41.7	“We've done a great job!”
ISA.41.7	Then they nail the idol down,
ISA.41.7	so it won't fall over.
ISA.41.8	I chose you, the family
ISA.41.8	of my friend Abraham.
ISA.41.9	From far across the earth
ISA.41.9	I brought you here and said,
ISA.41.9	“You are my chosen servant.
ISA.41.9	I haven't forgotten you.”
ISA.41.10	Don't be afraid. I am with you.
ISA.41.10	Don't tremble with fear.
ISA.41.10	I am your God.
ISA.41.10	I will make you strong,
ISA.41.10	as I protect you with my arm
ISA.41.10	and give you victories.
ISA.41.11	Everyone who hates you
ISA.41.11	will be terribly disgraced;
ISA.41.11	those who attack
ISA.41.11	will vanish into thin air.
ISA.41.12	You will look around
ISA.41.12	for those brutal enemies,
ISA.41.12	but you won't find them—
ISA.41.12	they will be gone.
ISA.41.13	I am the 
ISA.41.13	I am holding your hand,
ISA.41.13	so don't be afraid.
ISA.41.13	I am here to help you.
ISA.41.14	People of Israel, don't worry,
ISA.41.14	though others may say,
ISA.41.14	“Israel is only a worm!”
ISA.41.14	I am the holy God of Israel,
ISA.41.14	who saves and protects you.
ISA.41.15	I will let you be like a log
ISA.41.15	covered with sharp spikes.
ISA.41.15	You will grind and crush
ISA.41.15	every mountain and hill
ISA.41.15	until they turn to dust.
ISA.41.16	A strong wind will scatter them
ISA.41.16	in all directions.
ISA.41.16	Then you will celebrate
ISA.41.16	and praise me, your 
ISA.41.16	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.41.17	When the poor and needy
ISA.41.17	are dying of thirst
ISA.41.17	and cannot find water,
ISA.41.17	I, the 
ISA.41.17	will come to their rescue.
ISA.41.17	I won't forget them.
ISA.41.18	I will make rivers flow
ISA.41.18	on mountain peaks.
ISA.41.18	I will send streams
ISA.41.18	to fill the valleys.
ISA.41.18	Dry and barren land
ISA.41.18	will flow with springs
ISA.41.18	and become a lake.
ISA.41.19	I will fill the desert
ISA.41.19	with all kinds of trees—
ISA.41.19	cedars, acacias, and myrtles;
ISA.41.19	olive and cypress trees;
ISA.41.19	fir trees and pines.
ISA.41.20	Everyone will see this
ISA.41.20	and know that I,
ISA.41.20	the holy 
ISA.41.20	created it all.
ISA.41.21	I am the 
ISA.41.21	the King of Israel!
ISA.41.21	Come argue your case with me.
ISA.41.21	Present your evidence.
ISA.41.22	Come near me, you idols.
ISA.41.22	Tell us about the past,
ISA.41.22	and we will think about it.
ISA.41.22	Tell us about the future,
ISA.41.22	so we will know
ISA.41.22	what is going to happen.
ISA.41.23	Prove that you are gods
ISA.41.23	by making your predictions
ISA.41.23	come true.
ISA.41.23	Do something good or evil,
ISA.41.23	so we can be amazed
ISA.41.23	and terrified.
ISA.41.24	You idols are nothing,
ISA.41.24	and you are powerless.
ISA.41.24	To worship you
ISA.41.24	would be disgusting.
ISA.41.25	I, the 
ISA.41.25	in the north;
ISA.41.25	now he comes from the east
ISA.41.25	to honor my name.
ISA.41.25	He tramples
ISA.41.25	as potters trample clay.
ISA.41.26	Did any of you idols predict
ISA.41.26	what would happen?
ISA.41.26	Did any of you get it right?
ISA.41.26	None of you told about this
ISA.41.26	or even spoke a word.
ISA.41.27	I was the first to tell
ISA.41.27	the people of Jerusalem,
ISA.41.27	“Look, it's happening!”
ISA.41.27	I was the one who announced
ISA.41.27	this good news to Zion.
ISA.41.28	None of these idols
ISA.41.28	are able to give advice
ISA.41.28	or answer questions.
ISA.41.29	They are nothing,
ISA.41.29	and they can do nothing—
ISA.41.29	they are merely
ISA.41.29	a passing breeze.
ISA.42.1	I have made him strong.
ISA.42.1	He is my chosen one;
ISA.42.1	I am pleased with him.
ISA.42.1	I have given him my Spirit,
ISA.42.1	and he will bring justice
ISA.42.1	to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He won't shout or yell
ISA.42.2	or call out in the streets.
ISA.42.3	He won't break off a bent reed
ISA.42.3	or put out a dying flame,
ISA.42.3	but he will make sure
ISA.42.3	that justice is done.
ISA.42.4	He won't quit or give up
ISA.42.4	until he brings justice
ISA.42.4	everywhere on earth,
ISA.42.4	and people in foreign nations
ISA.42.4	long for his teaching.
ISA.42.5	I created the heavens
ISA.42.5	like an open tent above.
ISA.42.5	I made the earth and everything
ISA.42.5	that grows on it.
ISA.42.5	I am the source of life
ISA.42.5	for all who live on this earth,
ISA.42.5	so listen to what I say.
ISA.42.6	and I am here at your side.
ISA.42.6	I selected you and sent you
ISA.42.6	to bring light
ISA.42.6	and my promise of hope
ISA.42.6	to the nations.
ISA.42.7	You will give sight
ISA.42.7	to the blind;
ISA.42.7	you will set prisoners free
ISA.42.7	from dark dungeons.
ISA.42.8	My name is the 
ISA.42.8	I won't let idols or humans
ISA.42.8	share my glory and praise.
ISA.42.9	Everything has happened
ISA.42.9	just as I said it would;
ISA.42.9	now I will announce
ISA.42.9	what will happen next.
ISA.42.10	Tell the whole world to sing
ISA.42.10	a new song to the 
ISA.42.10	Tell those who sail the ocean
ISA.42.10	and those who live far away
ISA.42.10	to join in the praise.
ISA.42.11	Tell the tribes of the desert
ISA.42.11	and everyone in the mountains
ISA.42.11	to celebrate and sing.
ISA.42.12	Let them announce
ISA.42.12	his praises everywhere.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	like an angry soldier,
ISA.42.13	shouting with all his might
ISA.42.13	while attacking his enemies.
ISA.42.14	For a long time, I, the 
ISA.42.14	have held my temper;
ISA.42.14	now I will cry out and groan
ISA.42.14	like a woman giving birth.
ISA.42.15	I will destroy the mountains
ISA.42.15	and what grows on them;
ISA.42.15	I will dry up rivers and ponds.
ISA.42.16	I will lead the blind on roads
ISA.42.16	they have never known;
ISA.42.16	I will guide them on paths
ISA.42.16	they have never traveled.
ISA.42.16	Their road is dark and rough,
ISA.42.16	but I will give light
ISA.42.16	to keep them from stumbling.
ISA.42.16	This is my solemn promise.
ISA.42.17	Everyone who worships idols
ISA.42.17	as though they were gods
ISA.42.17	will be terribly ashamed.
ISA.42.18	You people are deaf and blind,
ISA.42.18	but the 
ISA.42.18	to listen and to see.
ISA.42.19	No one is as blind or deaf
ISA.42.19	as his messenger,
ISA.42.19	his chosen servant,
ISA.42.20	who sees and hears so much,
ISA.42.20	but pays no attention.
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.21	and so he wanted his Law
ISA.42.21	to be greatly praised.
ISA.42.22	But his people were trapped
ISA.42.22	and imprisoned in holes
ISA.42.22	with no one to rescue them.
ISA.42.22	All they owned had been taken,
ISA.42.22	and no one was willing
ISA.42.22	to give it back.
ISA.42.23	Why won't his people
ISA.42.23	ever learn to listen?
ISA.42.24	Israel sinned and refused
ISA.42.24	to obey the 
ISA.42.24	or follow his instructions.
ISA.42.24	So the 
ISA.42.24	of everything we owned.
ISA.42.25	He was furious with us
ISA.42.25	and punished our nation
ISA.42.25	with the fires of war.
ISA.42.25	Still we paid no attention.
ISA.42.25	We didn't even care
ISA.42.25	when we were surrounded
ISA.42.25	and scorched by flames.
ISA.43.1	Descendants of Jacob,
ISA.43.1	I, the 
ISA.43.1	and formed your nation.
ISA.43.1	Israel, don't be afraid.
ISA.43.1	I have rescued you.
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name;
ISA.43.1	now you belong to me.
ISA.43.2	When you cross deep rivers,
ISA.43.2	I will be with you,
ISA.43.2	and you won't drown.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through fire,
ISA.43.2	you won't be burned
ISA.43.2	or scorched by the flames.
ISA.43.3	I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.43.3	the God who saves you.
ISA.43.3	I gave up Egypt, Ethiopia,
ISA.43.3	and the region of Seba
ISA.43.3	in exchange for you.
ISA.43.4	To me, you are very dear,
ISA.43.4	and I love you.
ISA.43.4	That's why I gave up nations
ISA.43.4	and people to rescue you.
ISA.43.5	Don't be afraid! I am with you.
ISA.43.5	From both east and west
ISA.43.5	I will bring you together.
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north
ISA.43.6	and to the south,
ISA.43.6	“Free my sons and daughters!
ISA.43.6	Let them return
ISA.43.6	from distant lands.
ISA.43.7	They are my people—
ISA.43.7	I created each of them
ISA.43.7	to bring honor to me.”
ISA.43.8	Bring my people together.
ISA.43.8	They have eyes and ears,
ISA.43.8	but they can't see or hear.
ISA.43.9	Tell everyone of every nation
ISA.43.9	to gather around.
ISA.43.9	None of them can honestly say,
ISA.43.9	“We told you so!”
ISA.43.9	If someone heard them say this,
ISA.43.9	then tell us about it now.
ISA.43.10	My people, you are my witnesses
ISA.43.10	and my chosen servant.
ISA.43.10	I want you to know me,
ISA.43.10	to trust me, and understand
ISA.43.10	that I alone am God.
ISA.43.10	I have always been God;
ISA.43.10	there can be no others.
ISA.43.11	I alone am the 
ISA.43.11	only I can rescue you.
ISA.43.12	I promised to save you,
ISA.43.12	and I kept my promise.
ISA.43.12	You are my witnesses
ISA.43.12	that no other god did this.
ISA.43.12	I, the 
ISA.43.13	I am God now and forever.
ISA.43.13	No one can snatch you from me
ISA.43.13	or stand in my way.
ISA.43.14	I, the 
ISA.43.14	I am Israel's holy God,
ISA.43.14	and this is my promise:
ISA.43.14	For your sake, I will send
ISA.43.14	an army against Babylon
ISA.43.14	to drag its people away,
ISA.43.14	crying as they go.
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.15	Israel's Creator and King.
ISA.43.16	I am the one who cut a path
ISA.43.16	through the mighty ocean.
ISA.43.17	I sent an army to chase you
ISA.43.17	with chariots and horses;
ISA.43.17	now they lie dead,
ISA.43.17	unable to move.
ISA.43.17	They are like an oil lamp
ISA.43.17	with the flame snuffed out.
ISA.43.18	Forget what happened long ago!
ISA.43.18	Don't think about the past.
ISA.43.19	I am creating something new.
ISA.43.19	There it is! Do you see it?
ISA.43.19	I have put roads in deserts,
ISA.43.19	streams
ISA.43.20	Every wild animal honors me,
ISA.43.20	even jackals
ISA.43.20	I provide water in deserts—
ISA.43.20	streams in thirsty lands
ISA.43.20	for my chosen people.
ISA.43.21	I made them my own nation,
ISA.43.21	so they would praise me.
ISA.43.22	I, the 
ISA.43.22	You have become weary of me,
ISA.43.22	but not from worshiping me.
ISA.43.23	You have not honored me
ISA.43.23	by sacrificing sheep
ISA.43.23	or other animals.
ISA.43.23	And I have not burdened you
ISA.43.23	with demands for sacrifices
ISA.43.23	or sweet-smelling incense.
ISA.43.24	You have not brought
ISA.43.24	delicious spices for me
ISA.43.24	or given me the best part
ISA.43.24	of your sacrificed animals.
ISA.43.24	Instead, you burden me down
ISA.43.24	with your terrible sins.
ISA.43.25	But I wipe away your sins
ISA.43.25	because of who I am.
ISA.43.25	And so, I will forget
ISA.43.25	the wrongs you have done.
ISA.43.26	Meet me in court!
ISA.43.26	State your case and prove
ISA.43.26	that you are right.
ISA.43.27	Your earliest ancestor
ISA.43.27	and all your leaders
ISA.43.27	rebelled against me.
ISA.43.28	That's why I don't allow
ISA.43.28	your priests to serve me;
ISA.43.28	I let Israel be destroyed
ISA.43.28	and your people disgraced.
ISA.44.1	People of Israel,
ISA.44.1	I have chosen you
ISA.44.1	as my servant.
ISA.44.2	I am your Creator.
ISA.44.2	You were in my care
ISA.44.2	even before you were born.
ISA.44.2	Israel, don't be terrified!
ISA.44.2	You are my chosen servant,
ISA.44.2	my very favorite.
ISA.44.3	I will bless the thirsty land
ISA.44.3	by sending streams of water;
ISA.44.3	I will bless your descendants
ISA.44.3	by giving them my Spirit.
ISA.44.4	They will spring up like grass
ISA.44.4	or like willow trees
ISA.44.4	near flowing streams.
ISA.44.5	They will worship me
ISA.44.5	and become my people.
ISA.44.5	They will write my name
ISA.44.5	on the back of their hands.
ISA.44.6	the first and the last,
ISA.44.6	the one and only God.
ISA.44.6	Israel, I have rescued you!
ISA.44.6	I am your King.
ISA.44.7	Can anyone compare with me?
ISA.44.7	If so, let them speak up
ISA.44.7	and tell me now.
ISA.44.7	Let them say what has happened
ISA.44.7	since I made my nation
ISA.44.7	long ago,
ISA.44.7	and let them tell
ISA.44.7	what is going to happen.
ISA.44.8	Don't tremble with fear!
ISA.44.8	Didn't I tell you long ago?
ISA.44.8	Didn't you hear me?
ISA.44.8	I alone am God—
ISA.44.8	no one else is a mighty rock.
ISA.44.9	Those people who make idols
ISA.44.9	are nothing themselves,
ISA.44.9	and the idols they treasure
ISA.44.9	are just as worthless.
ISA.44.9	Worshipers of idols are blind,
ISA.44.9	stupid, and foolish.
ISA.44.10	Why make an idol or an image
ISA.44.10	that can't do a thing?
ISA.44.11	Everyone who makes idols
ISA.44.11	and all who worship them
ISA.44.11	are mere humans,
ISA.44.11	who will end up
ISA.44.11	sadly disappointed.
ISA.44.11	Let them face me in court
ISA.44.11	and be terrified.
ISA.44.12	A metalworker shapes an idol
ISA.44.12	by using a hammer
ISA.44.12	and heat from the fire.
ISA.44.12	In his powerful hand
ISA.44.12	he holds a hammer,
ISA.44.12	as he pounds the metal
ISA.44.12	into the proper shape.
ISA.44.12	But he gets hungry and thirsty
ISA.44.12	and loses his strength.
ISA.44.13	Some woodcarver measures
ISA.44.13	a piece of wood,
ISA.44.13	then draws an outline.
ISA.44.13	The idol is carefully carved
ISA.44.13	with each detail exact.
ISA.44.13	At last it looks like a person
ISA.44.13	and is placed in a temple.
ISA.44.14	Either cedar, cypress, oak,
ISA.44.14	or any tree from the forest
ISA.44.14	may be chosen.
ISA.44.14	Or even a pine tree planted
ISA.44.14	by the woodcarver
ISA.44.14	and watered by the rain.
ISA.44.15	to make a fire for heating
ISA.44.15	or for cooking.
ISA.44.15	One piece is made into an idol,
ISA.44.15	then the woodcarver bows down
ISA.44.15	and worships it.
ISA.44.16	He enjoys the warm fire
ISA.44.16	and the meat that was roasted
ISA.44.16	over the burning coals.
ISA.44.17	Afterwards, he bows down
ISA.44.17	to worship the wooden idol.
ISA.44.17	“Protect me!” he says.
ISA.44.17	“You are my god.”
ISA.44.18	Those who worship idols are stupid and blind! 
ISA.44.19	They don't have enough sense to say to themselves, “I made a fire with half of the wood and cooked my bread and meat on it. Then I made something worthless with the other half. Why worship a block of wood?”
ISA.44.20	How can anyone be stupid enough to trust something that can be burned to ashes?
ISA.44.21	People of Israel,
ISA.44.21	you are my servant,
ISA.44.21	so remember all of this.
ISA.44.21	Israel, I created you,
ISA.44.21	and you are my servant.
ISA.44.21	I won't forget you.
ISA.44.22	Turn back to me!
ISA.44.22	I have rescued you
ISA.44.22	and swept away your sins
ISA.44.22	as though they were clouds.
ISA.44.23	Tell the heavens and the earth
ISA.44.23	to start singing!
ISA.44.23	Tell the mountains
ISA.44.23	and every tree in the forest
ISA.44.23	to join in the song!
ISA.44.23	The 
ISA.44.23	now they will worship him.
ISA.44.24	Israel, I am your 
ISA.44.24	the source of your life,
ISA.44.24	and I have rescued you.
ISA.44.24	I created everything
ISA.44.24	from the sky above
ISA.44.24	to the earth below.
ISA.44.25	and fools of fortunetellers.
ISA.44.25	I take human wisdom
ISA.44.25	and turn it into nonsense.
ISA.44.26	I will make the message
ISA.44.26	of my prophets come true.
ISA.44.26	They are saying, “Jerusalem
ISA.44.26	will be filled with people,
ISA.44.26	and the 
ISA.44.26	the towns of Judah.”
ISA.44.27	I am the one who commands
ISA.44.27	the sea and its streams
ISA.44.27	to run dry.
ISA.44.28	“Cyrus will lead my people
ISA.44.28	and obey my orders.
ISA.44.28	Jerusalem and the temple
ISA.44.28	will be rebuilt.”
ISA.45.1	The 
ISA.45.1	I have taken hold
ISA.45.1	of your right hand
ISA.45.1	to help you capture nations
ISA.45.1	and remove kings from power.
ISA.45.1	City gates will open for you;
ISA.45.1	not one will stay closed.
ISA.45.2	As I lead you,
ISA.45.2	I will level mountains
ISA.45.2	and break the iron bars
ISA.45.2	on bronze gates of cities.
ISA.45.3	I will give you treasures
ISA.45.3	hidden in dark
ISA.45.3	and secret places.
ISA.45.3	Then you will know that I,
ISA.45.3	the 
ISA.45.3	have called you by name.
ISA.45.4	Cyrus, you don't even know me!
ISA.45.4	But I have called you by name
ISA.45.4	and highly honored you
ISA.45.4	because of Israel,
ISA.45.4	my chosen servant.
ISA.45.5	Only I am the 
ISA.45.5	There are no other gods.
ISA.45.5	I have made you strong,
ISA.45.5	though you don't know me.
ISA.45.6	Now everyone from east to west
ISA.45.6	will learn that I am the 
ISA.45.6	No other gods are real.
ISA.45.7	I create light and darkness,
ISA.45.7	happiness and sorrow.
ISA.45.7	I, the 
ISA.45.8	Tell the heavens
ISA.45.8	to send down justice
ISA.45.8	like showers of rain.
ISA.45.8	Prepare the earth
ISA.45.8	for my saving power
ISA.45.8	to sprout and produce justice
ISA.45.8	that I, the 
ISA.45.9	to argue with your Creator.
ISA.45.9	You are merely a clay pot
ISA.45.9	shaped by a potter.
ISA.45.9	The clay doesn't ask,
ISA.45.9	“Why did you make me this way?
ISA.45.9	Where are the handles?”
ISA.45.10	Children don't have the right
ISA.45.10	to demand of their parents,
ISA.45.10	“What have you done
ISA.45.10	to make us what we are?”
ISA.45.11	I am the 
ISA.45.11	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.45.11	Do you dare question me
ISA.45.11	about my own nation
ISA.45.11	or about what I have done?
ISA.45.12	I created the world
ISA.45.12	and covered it with people;
ISA.45.12	I stretched out the sky
ISA.45.12	and filled it with stars.
ISA.45.13	I have done the right thing
ISA.45.13	by placing Cyrus in power,
ISA.45.13	and I will make the roads easy
ISA.45.13	for him to follow.
ISA.45.13	I am the 
ISA.45.13	Cyrus will rebuild my city
ISA.45.13	and set my people free
ISA.45.13	without being paid a thing.
ISA.45.13	I, the 
ISA.45.14	My people, I, the 
ISA.45.14	that the riches of Egypt
ISA.45.14	and the treasures of Ethiopia
ISA.45.14	will belong to you.
ISA.45.14	You will force into slavery
ISA.45.14	those tall people of Seba.
ISA.45.14	They will bow down and say,
ISA.45.14	“The only true God is with you;
ISA.45.14	there are no other gods.”
ISA.45.15	People of Israel,
ISA.45.15	your God is a mystery,
ISA.45.15	though he alone can save.
ISA.45.16	Anyone who makes idols
ISA.45.16	will be confused
ISA.45.16	and terribly disgraced.
ISA.45.17	But Israel, I, the 
ISA.45.17	will always keep you safe
ISA.45.17	and free from shame.
ISA.45.18	The 
ISA.45.18	He created the heavens
ISA.45.18	and made a world
ISA.45.18	where people can live,
ISA.45.18	instead of creating
ISA.45.18	an empty desert.
ISA.45.18	The 
ISA.45.18	there are no others.
ISA.45.19	The 
ISA.45.19	in a dark secret place
ISA.45.19	or command Jacob's descendants
ISA.45.19	to search for him in vain.
ISA.45.19	The 
ISA.45.19	and this is what he says
ISA.45.20	to every survivor
ISA.45.20	from every nation:
ISA.45.20	“Gather around me!
ISA.45.20	Learn how senseless it is
ISA.45.20	to worship wooden idols
ISA.45.20	or pray to helpless gods.
ISA.45.21	“Why don't you get together
ISA.45.21	and meet me in court?
ISA.45.21	Didn't I tell you long ago
ISA.45.21	what would happen?
ISA.45.21	I am the only God!
ISA.45.21	There are no others.
ISA.45.21	I bring about justice,
ISA.45.21	and have the power to save.
ISA.45.22	“I invite the whole world
ISA.45.22	to turn to me and be saved.
ISA.45.22	I alone am God!
ISA.45.22	No others are real.
ISA.45.23	one that won't be broken:
ISA.45.23	Everyone will bow down
ISA.45.23	and worship me.
ISA.45.24	They will admit that I alone
ISA.45.24	can bring about justice.
ISA.45.24	Everyone who is angry with me
ISA.45.24	will be terribly ashamed
ISA.45.24	and will turn to me.
ISA.45.25	I, the 
ISA.45.25	victory and great honor
ISA.45.25	to the people of Israel.”
ISA.46.1	The gods Bel and Nebo
ISA.46.1	are down on their knees,
ISA.46.1	as wooden images of them
ISA.46.1	are carried away
ISA.46.1	on weary animals.
ISA.46.2	They are down on their knees
ISA.46.2	to rescue the heavy load,
ISA.46.2	but the images are still taken
ISA.46.2	to a foreign country.
ISA.46.3	You survivors in Israel,
ISA.46.3	listen to me, the 
ISA.46.3	Since the day you were born,
ISA.46.3	I have carried you along.
ISA.46.4	I will still be the same
ISA.46.4	when you are old and gray,
ISA.46.4	and I will take care of you.
ISA.46.4	I created you. I will carry you
ISA.46.4	and always keep you safe.
ISA.46.5	Can anyone compare with me?
ISA.46.5	Is anyone my equal?
ISA.46.6	Some people hire a goldsmith
ISA.46.6	and give silver and gold
ISA.46.6	to be formed into an idol
ISA.46.6	for them to worship.
ISA.46.7	They carry the idol
ISA.46.7	on their shoulders,
ISA.46.7	then put it on a stand,
ISA.46.7	but it cannot move.
ISA.46.7	They call out to the idol
ISA.46.7	when they are in trouble,
ISA.46.7	but it doesn't answer,
ISA.46.7	and it cannot help.
ISA.46.8	Now keep this in mind,
ISA.46.8	you sinful people.
ISA.46.8	And don't ever forget it.
ISA.46.9	I alone am God!
ISA.46.9	There are no other gods;
ISA.46.9	no one is like me.
ISA.46.9	Think about what happened
ISA.46.9	many years ago.
ISA.46.10	From the very beginning,
ISA.46.10	I told what would happen
ISA.46.10	long before it took place.
ISA.46.10	I kept my word 
ISA.46.11	and brought
ISA.46.11	someone from a distant land
ISA.46.11	to do what I wanted.
ISA.46.11	He attacked from the east,
ISA.46.11	like a hawk swooping down.
ISA.46.11	Now I will keep my promise
ISA.46.11	and do what I planned.
ISA.46.12	You people are stubborn
ISA.46.12	and far from being safe,
ISA.46.12	so listen to me.
ISA.46.13	I will soon come to save you.
ISA.46.13	I am not far away
ISA.46.13	and will waste no time;
ISA.46.13	I take pride in Israel
ISA.46.13	and will save Jerusalem.
ISA.47.1	You are delicate
ISA.47.1	and untouched,
ISA.47.1	but that will change.
ISA.47.1	Surrender your royal power
ISA.47.1	and sit in the dirt.
ISA.47.2	Start grinding grain!
ISA.47.2	Take off your veil.
ISA.47.2	Strip off your fancy clothes
ISA.47.2	and wade across rivers.
ISA.47.3	You will suffer the shame
ISA.47.3	of going naked,
ISA.47.3	because I will take revenge,
ISA.47.3	and no one can escape.
ISA.47.4	I am the 
ISA.47.4	the holy God of Israel.
ISA.47.4	I am their Savior.
ISA.47.5	Babylon, be silent!
ISA.47.5	Sit in the dark.
ISA.47.5	No longer will nations
ISA.47.5	accept you as their queen.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people.
ISA.47.6	So I let you take their land
ISA.47.6	and bring disgrace on them.
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy,
ISA.47.6	but were especially cruel
ISA.47.6	to those who were old.
ISA.47.7	You thought that you
ISA.47.7	would be queen forever.
ISA.47.7	You didn't care what you did;
ISA.47.7	it never entered your mind
ISA.47.7	that you might get caught.
ISA.47.8	are all-powerful,
ISA.47.8	that you won't be a widow
ISA.47.8	or lose your children.
ISA.47.8	All you care about is pleasure,
ISA.47.8	but listen to what I say.
ISA.47.9	Your magic powers and charms
ISA.47.9	will suddenly fail,
ISA.47.9	then you will be a widow
ISA.47.9	and lose your children.
ISA.47.10	You hid behind evil
ISA.47.10	like a shield and said,
ISA.47.10	“No one can see me!”
ISA.47.10	You were fooled by your wisdom
ISA.47.10	and your knowledge;
ISA.47.10	you felt sure that you alone
ISA.47.10	were in full control.
ISA.47.11	But without warning,
ISA.47.11	disaster will strike—
ISA.47.11	and your magic charms
ISA.47.11	won't help at all.
ISA.47.12	Keep using your magic powers
ISA.47.12	and your charms
ISA.47.12	as you have always done.
ISA.47.12	Maybe—just maybe—
ISA.47.12	you will frighten somebody!
ISA.47.13	You have worn yourself out,
ISA.47.13	asking for advice
ISA.47.13	from those who study the stars
ISA.47.13	and tell the future
ISA.47.13	month after month.
ISA.47.13	Go ask them how to be saved
ISA.47.13	from what will happen.
ISA.47.14	People who trust the stars
ISA.47.14	are as helpless as straw
ISA.47.14	in a flaming fire.
ISA.47.14	No one can even keep warm,
ISA.47.14	sitting by a fire
ISA.47.14	that feeds only on straw.
ISA.47.15	These are the fortunetellers
ISA.47.15	you have done business with
ISA.47.15	all of your life.
ISA.47.15	But they don't know
ISA.47.15	where they are going,
ISA.47.15	and they can't save you.
ISA.48.1	People of Israel,
ISA.48.1	you come from Jacob's family
ISA.48.1	and the tribe
ISA.48.1	You claim to worship me,
ISA.48.1	the 
ISA.48.1	but you are lying.
ISA.48.2	You call Jerusalem your home
ISA.48.2	and say you depend on me,
ISA.48.2	the 
ISA.48.2	the God of Israel.
ISA.48.3	Long ago I announced
ISA.48.3	what was going to be,
ISA.48.3	then without warning,
ISA.48.3	I made it happen.
ISA.48.4	I knew you were stubborn
ISA.48.4	and hardheaded.
ISA.48.5	And I told you these things,
ISA.48.5	so that when they happened
ISA.48.5	you would not say,
ISA.48.5	“The idols we worship did this.”
ISA.48.6	You heard what I said,
ISA.48.6	and you have seen it happen.
ISA.48.6	Now admit it's true!
ISA.48.6	I will show you secrets
ISA.48.6	you have never known.
ISA.48.7	Today I am doing something new,
ISA.48.7	something you cannot say
ISA.48.7	you have heard before.
ISA.48.8	You have never been willing
ISA.48.8	to listen to what I say;
ISA.48.8	from the moment of your birth,
ISA.48.8	I knew you would rebel.
ISA.48.9	I, the 
ISA.48.9	I will be praised for not punishing
ISA.48.9	and destroying you.
ISA.48.10	I tested you in hard times
ISA.48.10	just as silver is refined
ISA.48.10	in a heated furnace.
ISA.48.11	I did this because of who I am.
ISA.48.11	I refuse to be dishonored
ISA.48.11	or share my praise
ISA.48.11	with any other god.
ISA.48.12	listen to me.
ISA.48.12	I alone am the 
ISA.48.12	the first and the last.
ISA.48.13	With my own hand
ISA.48.13	I created the earth
ISA.48.13	and stretched out the sky.
ISA.48.13	They obey my every command.
ISA.48.14	Gather around me, all of you!
ISA.48.14	Listen to what I say.
ISA.48.14	Did any of your idols
ISA.48.14	predict this would happen?
ISA.48.14	Did they say that my friend
ISA.48.14	would do what I want done
ISA.48.14	to Babylonia?
ISA.48.15	I was the one who chose him.
ISA.48.15	I have brought him this far,
ISA.48.15	and he will be successful.
ISA.48.16	Come closer and listen!
ISA.48.16	I have never kept secret
ISA.48.16	the things I have said,
ISA.48.16	and I was here
ISA.48.16	before time began.
ISA.48.16	By the power of his Spirit
ISA.48.16	the 
ISA.48.17	with this message:
ISA.48.17	People of Israel,
ISA.48.17	I am the holy 
ISA.48.17	the one who rescues you.
ISA.48.17	For your own good,
ISA.48.17	I teach you, and I lead you
ISA.48.17	along the right path.
ISA.48.18	How I wish that you
ISA.48.18	had obeyed my commands!
ISA.48.18	Your success and good fortune
ISA.48.18	would then have overflowed
ISA.48.18	like a flooding river.
ISA.48.19	Your nation would be blessed
ISA.48.19	with more people
ISA.48.19	than there are grains of sand
ISA.48.19	along the seashore.
ISA.48.19	And I would never have let
ISA.48.19	your country be destroyed.
ISA.48.20	Celebrate as you go.
ISA.48.20	Be happy and shout
ISA.48.20	for everyone to hear,
ISA.48.20	“The 
ISA.48.20	his servant Israel!
ISA.48.21	He led us through the desert
ISA.48.21	and made water flow from a rock
ISA.48.21	to satisfy our thirst.
ISA.48.22	that none who are evil
ISA.48.22	will live in peace.”
ISA.49.1	even you foreign nations
ISA.49.1	across the sea.
ISA.49.1	The 
ISA.49.1	and gave me a name
ISA.49.1	before I was born.
ISA.49.2	like a sharp sword
ISA.49.2	or a pointed arrow;
ISA.49.2	he kept me safely hidden
ISA.49.2	in the palm of his hand.
ISA.49.3	The 
ISA.49.3	“Israel, you are my servant;
ISA.49.3	and because of you
ISA.49.3	I will be highly honored.”
ISA.49.4	I said to myself,
ISA.49.4	“I'm completely worn out;
ISA.49.4	my time has been wasted.
ISA.49.4	But I did it for the 
ISA.49.4	and he will reward me.”
ISA.49.5	Even before I was born,
ISA.49.5	the 
ISA.49.5	to serve him and to lead back
ISA.49.5	the people of Israel.
ISA.49.5	So the 
ISA.49.5	and made me strong.
ISA.49.6	“It isn't enough for you
ISA.49.6	to be merely my servant.
ISA.49.6	You must do more than lead back
ISA.49.6	survivors from the tribes
ISA.49.6	of Israel.
ISA.49.6	I have placed you here as a light
ISA.49.6	for other nations;
ISA.49.6	you must take my saving power
ISA.49.6	to everyone on earth.”
ISA.49.7	Israel, I am the holy 
ISA.49.7	the one who rescues you.
ISA.49.7	You are slaves of rulers
ISA.49.7	and of a nation
ISA.49.7	who despises you.
ISA.49.7	Now this is what I promise:
ISA.49.7	Kings and rulers will honor you
ISA.49.7	by kneeling at your feet.
ISA.49.7	You can trust me! I am your 
ISA.49.7	the holy God of Israel,
ISA.49.7	and you are my chosen ones.
ISA.49.8	I will answer your prayers
ISA.49.8	because I have set a time
ISA.49.8	when I will help
ISA.49.8	by coming to save you.
ISA.49.8	I have chosen you
ISA.49.8	to take my promise of hope
ISA.49.8	to other nations.
ISA.49.8	You will rebuild the country
ISA.49.8	from its ruins,
ISA.49.8	then people will come
ISA.49.8	and settle there.
ISA.49.9	You will set prisoners free
ISA.49.9	from dark dungeons
ISA.49.9	to see the light of day.
ISA.49.9	On their way home,
ISA.49.9	they will find plenty to eat,
ISA.49.9	even on barren hills.
ISA.49.10	or get thirsty;
ISA.49.10	they won't be bothered
ISA.49.10	by the scorching sun
ISA.49.10	or hot desert winds.
ISA.49.10	I will be merciful
ISA.49.10	while leading them along
ISA.49.10	to streams of water.
ISA.49.11	I will level the mountains
ISA.49.11	and make roads.
ISA.49.12	Then my people will return
ISA.49.12	from distant lands
ISA.49.12	in the north and the west
ISA.49.12	and from the city of Syene.
ISA.49.13	Tell the heavens and the earth
ISA.49.13	to celebrate and sing;
ISA.49.13	command every mountain
ISA.49.13	to join in the song.
ISA.49.13	The 
ISA.49.13	but he has shown mercy
ISA.49.13	and given them comfort.
ISA.49.14	The people of Zion said,
ISA.49.14	“The 
ISA.49.14	and forgotten us.”
ISA.49.15	The 
ISA.49.15	“Could a mother forget a child
ISA.49.15	who nurses at her breast?
ISA.49.15	Could she fail to love an infant
ISA.49.15	who came from her own body?
ISA.49.15	Even if a mother could forget,
ISA.49.15	I will never forget you.
ISA.49.16	A picture of your city
ISA.49.16	is drawn on my hand.
ISA.49.16	You are always in my thoughts!
ISA.49.17	“Your city will be built faster
ISA.49.17	than it was destroyed
ISA.49.17	those who attacked it
ISA.49.17	will retreat and leave.
ISA.49.18	Look around! You will see
ISA.49.18	your people coming home.
ISA.49.18	As surely as I live,
ISA.49.18	I, the 
ISA.49.18	that your city with its people
ISA.49.18	will be as lovely as a bride
ISA.49.18	wearing her jewelry.”
ISA.49.19	Jerusalem is now in ruins!
ISA.49.19	Nothing is left of the city.
ISA.49.19	But it will be rebuilt
ISA.49.19	and soon overcrowded;
ISA.49.19	its cruel enemies
ISA.49.19	will be gone far away.
ISA.49.20	Jerusalem is a woman
ISA.49.20	whose children were born
ISA.49.20	while she was in deep sorrow
ISA.49.20	over the loss of her husband.
ISA.49.20	Now those children
ISA.49.20	will come and seek room
ISA.49.20	in the crowded city,
ISA.49.21	and Jerusalem will ask,
ISA.49.21	“Am I really their mother?
ISA.49.21	How could I have given birth
ISA.49.21	when I was still mourning
ISA.49.21	in a foreign land?
ISA.49.21	Who raised these children?
ISA.49.21	Where have they come from?”
ISA.49.22	“I will soon give a signal
ISA.49.22	for the nations
ISA.49.22	to return your sons
ISA.49.22	and your daughters
ISA.49.22	to the arms of Jerusalem.
ISA.49.23	The kings and queens
ISA.49.23	of those nations
ISA.49.23	where they were raised
ISA.49.23	will come and bow down.
ISA.49.23	They will take care of you
ISA.49.23	just like a slave
ISA.49.23	taking care of a child.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know
ISA.49.23	that I am the 
ISA.49.23	You won't be disappointed
ISA.49.23	if you trust me.”
ISA.49.24	Is it possible to rescue victims
ISA.49.24	from someone strong
ISA.49.24	and cruel?
ISA.49.25	But the 
ISA.49.25	to fight on our side
ISA.49.25	and to rescue our children
ISA.49.25	from those strong
ISA.49.25	and violent enemies.
ISA.49.26	He will make those cruel people
ISA.49.26	dine on their own flesh
ISA.49.26	and get drunk from drinking
ISA.49.26	their own blood.
ISA.49.26	Then everyone will know
ISA.49.26	that the 
ISA.49.26	the powerful God of Israel
ISA.49.26	has rescued his people.
ISA.50.1	I didn't divorce your mother
ISA.50.1	or sell you to pay debts;
ISA.50.1	I divorced her and sold you
ISA.50.1	because of your sins.
ISA.50.2	I came and called out,
ISA.50.2	but you didn't answer.
ISA.50.2	Have I lost my power
ISA.50.2	to rescue and save?
ISA.50.2	At my command oceans and rivers
ISA.50.2	turn into deserts;
ISA.50.2	fish rot and stink
ISA.50.2	for lack of water.
ISA.50.3	I make the sky turn dark
ISA.50.3	like the sackcloth
ISA.50.3	you wear at funerals.”
ISA.50.4	The 
ISA.50.4	the right words
ISA.50.4	to encourage the weary.
ISA.50.4	Each morning he awakens me
ISA.50.4	eager to learn his teaching;
ISA.50.5	he made me willing to listen
ISA.50.5	and not rebel or run away.
ISA.50.6	and pull out my beard.
ISA.50.6	I didn't turn aside
ISA.50.6	when they insulted me
ISA.50.6	and spit in my face.
ISA.50.7	But the 
ISA.50.7	from being disgraced.
ISA.50.7	So I refuse to give up,
ISA.50.7	because I know
ISA.50.7	God will never let me down.
ISA.50.8	no one can stand here
ISA.50.8	to accuse me of wrong.
ISA.50.9	The 
ISA.50.9	and prove I am innocent.
ISA.50.9	My accusers will wear out
ISA.50.9	like moth-eaten clothes.
ISA.50.10	None of you respect the 
ISA.50.10	or obey his servant.
ISA.50.10	You walk in the dark
ISA.50.10	instead of the light;
ISA.50.10	you don't trust the name
ISA.50.10	of the 
ISA.50.11	Go ahead and walk in the light
ISA.50.11	of the fires you have set.
ISA.50.11	But with his own hand,
ISA.50.11	the 
ISA.50.11	and make you suffer.
ISA.51.1	and obey the 
ISA.51.1	follow Abraham's example.
ISA.51.1	He was the rock from which
ISA.51.1	you were chipped.
ISA.51.2	God chose Abraham and Sarah
ISA.51.2	to be your ancestors.
ISA.51.2	The 
ISA.51.2	and from that one man
ISA.51.2	came many descendants.
ISA.51.3	Though Zion is in ruins,
ISA.51.3	the 
ISA.51.3	and the city will be as lovely
ISA.51.3	as the garden of Eden
ISA.51.3	that he provided.
ISA.51.3	Then Zion will celebrate;
ISA.51.3	it will be thankful
ISA.51.3	and sing joyful songs.
ISA.51.4	The 
ISA.51.4	You are my people and nation!
ISA.51.4	So pay attention to me.
ISA.51.4	My teaching will cause justice
ISA.51.4	to shine like a light
ISA.51.4	for every nation.
ISA.51.5	Those who live across the sea
ISA.51.5	are eagerly waiting
ISA.51.5	for me to rescue them.
ISA.51.5	I am strong and ready;
ISA.51.5	soon I will come to save
ISA.51.5	and to rule all nations.
ISA.51.6	Look closely at the sky!
ISA.51.6	Stare at the earth.
ISA.51.6	The sky will vanish like smoke;
ISA.51.6	the earth will wear out
ISA.51.6	like clothes.
ISA.51.6	Everyone on this earth
ISA.51.6	will die like flies.
ISA.51.6	But my victory will last;
ISA.51.6	my saving power never ends.
ISA.51.7	If you want to do right
ISA.51.7	and obey my teaching
ISA.51.7	with all your heart,
ISA.51.7	then pay close attention.
ISA.51.7	Don't be discouraged
ISA.51.7	when others insult you
ISA.51.7	and say hurtful things.
ISA.51.8	They will be eaten away
ISA.51.8	like a moth-eaten coat.
ISA.51.8	But my victory will last;
ISA.51.8	my saving power
ISA.51.8	will never end.
ISA.51.9	Wake up! Do something, 
ISA.51.9	Be strong and ready.
ISA.51.9	Wake up! Do what you did
ISA.51.9	for our people long ago.
ISA.51.9	Didn't you chop up
ISA.51.9	Rahab
ISA.51.10	Didn't you dry up the deep sea
ISA.51.10	and make a road for your people
ISA.51.10	to follow safely across?
ISA.51.11	Now those you have rescued
ISA.51.11	will return to Jerusalem,
ISA.51.11	singing on their way.
ISA.51.11	They will be crowned
ISA.51.11	with great happiness,
ISA.51.11	never again to be burdened
ISA.51.11	with sadness and sorrow.
ISA.51.12	I am the 
ISA.51.12	who encourages you.
ISA.51.12	Why are you afraid
ISA.51.12	of mere humans?
ISA.51.12	They dry up and die like grass.
ISA.51.13	I spread out the heavens
ISA.51.13	and laid foundations
ISA.51.13	for the earth.
ISA.51.13	But you have forgotten me,
ISA.51.13	your 
ISA.51.13	All day long you were afraid
ISA.51.13	of those who were angry
ISA.51.13	and hoped to oppress you.
ISA.51.13	Where are they now?
ISA.51.14	Everyone crying out in pain
ISA.51.14	will be quickly set free;
ISA.51.14	they will be rescued
ISA.51.14	from the power of death
ISA.51.14	and never go hungry.
ISA.51.15	I will help them
ISA.51.15	because I am your God,
ISA.51.15	the 
ISA.51.15	who makes the ocean roar.
ISA.51.16	I have told you what to say,
ISA.51.16	and I will keep you safe
ISA.51.16	in the palm of my hand.
ISA.51.16	I spread out the heavens
ISA.51.16	and laid foundations
ISA.51.16	for the earth.
ISA.51.16	Now I say, “Jerusalem,
ISA.51.16	your people are mine.”
ISA.51.17	You've drunk too much
ISA.51.17	from the cup filled
ISA.51.17	with the 
ISA.51.17	You have swallowed every drop,
ISA.51.17	and you can't walk straight.
ISA.51.18	Not one of your many children
ISA.51.18	is there to guide you
ISA.51.18	or to offer a helping hand.
ISA.51.19	You have been destroyed
ISA.51.19	by war and by famine;
ISA.51.19	I cannot comfort you.
ISA.51.20	The 
ISA.51.20	and on every street corner
ISA.51.20	your children lie helpless,
ISA.51.20	like deer trapped in nets.
ISA.51.21	You are in trouble and drunk,
ISA.51.21	but not from wine.
ISA.51.21	So pay close attention
ISA.51.22	to the 
ISA.51.22	who defends you and says,
ISA.51.22	“I have taken from your hands
ISA.51.22	the cup filled with my anger
ISA.51.22	that made you drunk.
ISA.51.22	You will never be forced
ISA.51.22	to drink it again.
ISA.51.23	Instead I will give it
ISA.51.23	to your brutal enemies,
ISA.51.23	who treated you like dirt
ISA.51.23	and walked all over you.”
ISA.52.1	Stand up and be strong.
ISA.52.1	Holy city of Zion,
ISA.52.1	dress in your best clothes.
ISA.52.1	Those foreigners who ruined
ISA.52.1	your sacred city
ISA.52.1	won't bother you again.
ISA.52.2	Zion, rise from the dirt!
ISA.52.2	Free yourself from the rope
ISA.52.2	around your neck.
ISA.52.3	The 
ISA.52.3	My people, you were sold,
ISA.52.3	but not for money;
ISA.52.3	now you will be set free,
ISA.52.3	but not for a payment.
ISA.52.4	Long ago you went to Egypt
ISA.52.4	where you lived
ISA.52.4	as foreigners.
ISA.52.4	Then Assyria was cruel to you,
ISA.52.5	has taken you prisoner
ISA.52.5	for no reason at all.
ISA.52.5	Your leaders groan with pain,
ISA.52.5	and day after day
ISA.52.5	my own name is cursed.
ISA.52.6	My people, you will learn
ISA.52.6	who I am and who is speaking
ISA.52.6	because I am here.
ISA.52.7	On the mountains a messenger
ISA.52.7	announces to Jerusalem,
ISA.52.7	“Good news! You're saved.
ISA.52.7	There will be peace.
ISA.52.7	Your God is now King.”
ISA.52.8	Everyone on guard duty,
ISA.52.8	sing and celebrate!
ISA.52.8	Look! You can see the 
ISA.52.8	returning to Zion.
ISA.52.9	Jerusalem, rise from the ruins!
ISA.52.9	Join in the singing.
ISA.52.9	The 
ISA.52.9	to his people;
ISA.52.9	he comes to your rescue.
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.10	his mighty strength;
ISA.52.10	now everyone will see
ISA.52.10	the saving power of our God.
ISA.52.11	Don't touch anything filthy.
ISA.52.11	Wash yourselves. Be ready
ISA.52.11	to carry back everything sacred
ISA.52.11	that belongs to the 
ISA.52.12	You won't need to run.
ISA.52.12	No one is chasing you.
ISA.52.12	The 
ISA.52.12	will lead and protect you
ISA.52.12	from enemy attacks.
ISA.52.13	The 
ISA.52.13	My servant will succeed!
ISA.52.13	He will be given great praise
ISA.52.13	and the highest honors.
ISA.52.14	Many were horrified
ISA.52.14	at what happened to him.
ISA.52.14	But everyone who saw him
ISA.52.14	was even more horrified
ISA.52.14	because he suffered until
ISA.52.14	he no longer looked human.
ISA.52.15	nations worthy to worship me;
ISA.52.15	kings will be silent
ISA.52.15	as they bow in wonder.
ISA.52.15	They will see and think about
ISA.52.15	things they have never seen
ISA.52.15	or thought about before.
ISA.53.1	or seen the mighty power
ISA.53.1	of the 
ISA.53.2	Like a young plant or a root
ISA.53.2	that sprouts in dry ground,
ISA.53.2	the servant grew up
ISA.53.2	obeying the 
ISA.53.2	He wasn't some handsome king.
ISA.53.2	Nothing about the way he looked
ISA.53.2	made him attractive to us.
ISA.53.3	He was hated and rejected;
ISA.53.3	his life was filled with sorrow
ISA.53.3	and terrible suffering.
ISA.53.3	No one wanted to look at him.
ISA.53.3	We despised him and said,
ISA.53.3	“He is a nobody!”
ISA.53.4	He suffered and endured
ISA.53.4	great pain for us,
ISA.53.4	but we thought his suffering
ISA.53.4	was punishment from God.
ISA.53.5	because of our sins;
ISA.53.5	by taking our punishment,
ISA.53.5	he made us completely well.
ISA.53.6	that had wandered off.
ISA.53.6	We had each gone our own way,
ISA.53.6	but the 
ISA.53.6	the punishment we deserved.
ISA.53.7	but he did not complain.
ISA.53.7	He was silent like a lamb
ISA.53.7	being led to the butcher,
ISA.53.7	as quiet as a sheep
ISA.53.7	having its wool cut off.
ISA.53.8	He was condemned to death
ISA.53.8	without a fair trial.
ISA.53.8	Who could have imagined
ISA.53.8	what would happen to him?
ISA.53.8	His life was taken away
ISA.53.8	because of the sinful things
ISA.53.8	my people
ISA.53.9	but he was buried in a tomb
ISA.53.9	among cruel, rich people.
ISA.53.10	The 
ISA.53.10	would suffer as a sacrifice
ISA.53.10	to take away the sin
ISA.53.10	and guilt of others.
ISA.53.10	Now the servant will live
ISA.53.10	to see his own descendants.
ISA.53.10	He did everything
ISA.53.10	the 
ISA.53.11	By suffering, the servant
ISA.53.11	will learn the true meaning
ISA.53.11	of obeying the 
ISA.53.11	Although he is innocent,
ISA.53.11	he will take the punishment
ISA.53.11	for the sins of others,
ISA.53.11	so that many of them
ISA.53.11	will no longer be guilty.
ISA.53.12	with honor and power
ISA.53.12	for sacrificing his life.
ISA.53.12	Others thought he was a sinner,
ISA.53.12	but he suffered for our sins
ISA.53.12	and asked God to forgive us.
ISA.54.1	even though you have never
ISA.54.1	had children!
ISA.54.1	The 
ISA.54.1	will have more children
ISA.54.1	than someone married
ISA.54.1	for a long time.
ISA.54.2	Make your tents larger!
ISA.54.2	Spread out the tent pegs;
ISA.54.2	fasten them firmly.
ISA.54.3	You and your descendants
ISA.54.3	will take over the land
ISA.54.3	of other nations.
ISA.54.3	You will settle in towns
ISA.54.3	that are now in ruins.
ISA.54.4	Don't be afraid or ashamed
ISA.54.4	and don't be discouraged.
ISA.54.4	You won't be disappointed.
ISA.54.4	Forget how sinful you were
ISA.54.4	when you were young;
ISA.54.4	stop feeling ashamed
ISA.54.4	for being left a widow.
ISA.54.5	The 
ISA.54.5	the Holy God of Israel,
ISA.54.5	rules all the earth.
ISA.54.5	He is your Creator and husband,
ISA.54.5	and he will rescue you.
ISA.54.6	You were like a young wife,
ISA.54.6	brokenhearted and crying
ISA.54.6	because her husband
ISA.54.6	had divorced her.
ISA.54.6	But the 
ISA.54.6	“I am taking you back!
ISA.54.7	I rejected you for a while,
ISA.54.7	but with love and tenderness
ISA.54.7	I will embrace you again.
ISA.54.8	For a while, I turned away
ISA.54.8	in furious anger.
ISA.54.8	Now I will have mercy
ISA.54.8	and love you forever!
ISA.54.8	I, your protector and 
ISA.54.8	make this promise.”
ISA.54.9	would never again destroy
ISA.54.9	the earth by a flood.
ISA.54.9	Now I have promised that I
ISA.54.9	will never again get angry
ISA.54.9	and punish you.
ISA.54.10	may disappear.
ISA.54.10	But I will always be kind
ISA.54.10	and merciful to you;
ISA.54.10	I won't break my agreement
ISA.54.10	to give your nation peace.
ISA.54.11	and discouraged,
ISA.54.11	tossed around in a storm.
ISA.54.11	But I, the 
ISA.54.11	will rebuild your city
ISA.54.11	with precious stones;
ISA.54.11	for your foundation
ISA.54.11	I will use blue sapphires.
ISA.54.12	Your fortresses
ISA.54.12	will be built of rubies,
ISA.54.12	your gates of jewels,
ISA.54.12	and your walls of gems.
ISA.54.13	and make them successful.
ISA.54.14	You will be built on fairness
ISA.54.14	with no fears of injustice;
ISA.54.14	every one of your worries
ISA.54.14	will be taken far from you.
ISA.54.15	I will never send anyone
ISA.54.15	to attack your city,
ISA.54.15	and you will make prisoners
ISA.54.15	of those who do attack.
ISA.54.16	Don't forget that I created
ISA.54.16	metalworkers who make weapons
ISA.54.16	over burning coals.
ISA.54.16	I also created armies
ISA.54.16	that can bring destruction.
ISA.54.17	Weapons made to attack you
ISA.54.17	won't be successful;
ISA.54.17	words spoken against you
ISA.54.17	won't hurt at all.
ISA.54.17	My servants, Jerusalem is yours!
ISA.54.17	I, the 
ISA.54.17	to bless you with victory.
ISA.55.1	come and drink water!
ISA.55.1	If you don't have any money,
ISA.55.1	come, eat what you want!
ISA.55.1	Drink wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without paying a cent.
ISA.55.2	on what really isn't food?
ISA.55.2	Why work hard for something
ISA.55.2	that doesn't satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen carefully to me,
ISA.55.2	and you will enjoy
ISA.55.2	the very best foods.
ISA.55.3	Come to me and live.
ISA.55.3	I will promise you
ISA.55.3	the eternal love and loyalty
ISA.55.3	that I promised David.
ISA.55.4	I made him the leader and ruler
ISA.55.4	of the nations;
ISA.55.4	he was my witness to them.
ISA.55.5	You will call out to nations
ISA.55.5	you have never known.
ISA.55.5	And they have never known you,
ISA.55.5	but they will come running
ISA.55.5	because I am the 
ISA.55.5	the holy God of Israel,
ISA.55.5	and I have honored you.
ISA.55.6	Turn to the 
ISA.55.6	He can still be found.
ISA.55.6	Call out to God! He is near.
ISA.55.7	Give up your evil ways
ISA.55.7	and your evil thoughts.
ISA.55.7	Return to the 
ISA.55.7	He will be merciful
ISA.55.7	and forgive your sins.
ISA.55.8	The 
ISA.55.8	“My thoughts and my ways
ISA.55.8	are not like yours.
ISA.55.9	Just as the heavens
ISA.55.9	are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	my thoughts and my ways
ISA.55.9	are higher than yours.
ISA.55.10	But they don't return
ISA.55.10	without watering the earth
ISA.55.10	that produces seeds to plant
ISA.55.10	and grain to eat.
ISA.55.11	That's how it is with my words.
ISA.55.11	They don't return to me
ISA.55.11	without doing everything
ISA.55.11	I send them to do.”
ISA.55.12	When you are set free,
ISA.55.12	you will celebrate
ISA.55.12	and travel home in peace.
ISA.55.12	Mountains and hills will sing
ISA.55.12	as you pass by,
ISA.55.12	and trees will clap.
ISA.55.13	Cypress and myrtle trees
ISA.55.13	will grow in fields
ISA.55.13	once covered by thorns.
ISA.55.13	And then those trees will stand
ISA.55.13	as a lasting witness
ISA.55.13	to the glory of the 
ISA.56.1	The 
ISA.56.1	Be honest and fair!
ISA.56.1	Soon I will come to save you;
ISA.56.1	my saving power will be seen
ISA.56.1	everywhere on earth.
ISA.56.2	I will bless everyone
ISA.56.2	who respects the Sabbath
ISA.56.2	and refuses to do wrong.
ISA.56.3	Foreigners who worship me
ISA.56.3	must not say,
ISA.56.3	“The 
ISA.56.3	be part of his people.”
ISA.56.3	Men who are unable
ISA.56.3	to become fathers
ISA.56.3	must no longer say,
ISA.56.3	“We are dried-up trees.”
ISA.56.4	Respect the Sabbath,
ISA.56.4	obey me completely,
ISA.56.4	and keep our agreement.
ISA.56.5	Then you will be like monuments
ISA.56.5	in my temple with your names
ISA.56.5	written on them.
ISA.56.5	This will be much better
ISA.56.5	than having children,
ISA.56.5	because these monuments
ISA.56.5	will stand there forever.
ISA.56.6	Foreigners will follow me.
ISA.56.6	They will love me and worship
ISA.56.6	in my name;
ISA.56.6	they will respect the Sabbath
ISA.56.6	and keep our agreement.
ISA.56.7	to my holy mountain,
ISA.56.7	where they will celebrate
ISA.56.7	in my house of worship.
ISA.56.7	Their sacrifices and offerings
ISA.56.7	will always be welcome
ISA.56.7	on my altar.
ISA.56.7	Then my house will be known
ISA.56.7	as a house of worship
ISA.56.7	for all nations.
ISA.56.8	I, the 
ISA.56.8	to bring together my people
ISA.56.8	who were taken away,
ISA.56.8	and let them join the others.
ISA.56.9	Come from the forest,
ISA.56.9	you wild animals!
ISA.56.9	Attack and gobble up
ISA.56.9	your victims.
ISA.56.10	You leaders of Israel
ISA.56.10	should be watchdogs,
ISA.56.10	protecting my people.
ISA.56.10	But you can't see a thing,
ISA.56.10	and you never warn them.
ISA.56.10	Dozing and daydreaming
ISA.56.10	are all you ever do.
ISA.56.11	You stupid leaders are a pack
ISA.56.11	of hungry and greedy dogs
ISA.56.11	that never get enough.
ISA.56.11	You are shepherds
ISA.56.11	who mistreat your own sheep
ISA.56.11	for selfish gain.
ISA.56.12	You say to each other,
ISA.56.12	“Let's drink till we're drunk!
ISA.56.12	Tomorrow we'll do it again.
ISA.56.12	We'll really enjoy ourselves.”
ISA.57.1	God's faithful people
ISA.57.1	are dragged off and killed,
ISA.57.1	and no one even cares.
ISA.57.1	Evil sweeps them away,
ISA.57.2	but in death they find peace
ISA.57.2	for obeying God.
ISA.57.3	You people are unfaithful!
ISA.57.3	You go to fortunetellers,
ISA.57.3	and you worship idols.
ISA.57.3	Now pay close attention!
ISA.57.4	Who are you making fun of?
ISA.57.4	Who are you sneering at?
ISA.57.4	Look how your sins
ISA.57.4	have made fools of you.
ISA.57.5	All you think about is sex
ISA.57.5	under those green trees
ISA.57.5	where idols are worshiped.
ISA.57.5	You sacrifice your children
ISA.57.5	on altars built in valleys
ISA.57.5	under rocky slopes.
ISA.57.6	You have chosen to worship
ISA.57.6	idols made of stone;
ISA.57.6	you have given them offerings
ISA.57.6	of wine and grain.
ISA.57.6	Should I be pleased?
ISA.57.7	You have spread out your beds
ISA.57.7	on the tops of high mountains,
ISA.57.7	where you sacrifice to idols.
ISA.57.8	Even in your homes
ISA.57.8	you have placed pagan symbols
ISA.57.8	all around your huge beds.
ISA.57.8	Yes, you have rejected me,
ISA.57.8	sold yourselves to your lovers,
ISA.57.8	and gone to bed with them.
ISA.57.9	You smear on olive oil
ISA.57.9	and all kinds of perfume
ISA.57.9	to worship the god Molech.
ISA.57.9	You even seek advice
ISA.57.9	from spirits of the dead.
ISA.57.10	Though you tired yourself out
ISA.57.10	by running after idols,
ISA.57.10	you refused to stop.
ISA.57.10	Your desires were so strong
ISA.57.10	that they kept you going.
ISA.57.11	Did you forget about me
ISA.57.11	and become unfaithful
ISA.57.11	because you were more afraid
ISA.57.11	of someone else?
ISA.57.11	Have I been silent so long
ISA.57.11	that you no longer fear me?
ISA.57.12	You think you're so good,
ISA.57.12	but I'll point out the truth.
ISA.57.13	Ask your idols to save you
ISA.57.13	when you are in trouble.
ISA.57.13	Be careful though—
ISA.57.13	it takes only a faint breath
ISA.57.13	to blow them over.
ISA.57.13	But if you come to me
ISA.57.13	for protection,
ISA.57.13	this land and my holy mountain
ISA.57.13	will always belong to you.
ISA.57.14	The 
ISA.57.14	“Clear the road!
ISA.57.14	Get it ready for my people.”
ISA.57.15	in the highest heavens,
ISA.57.15	and this is what he says:
ISA.57.15	Though I live high above
ISA.57.15	in the holy place,
ISA.57.15	I am here to help those
ISA.57.15	who are humble
ISA.57.15	and depend only on me.
ISA.57.16	My people, I won't stay angry
ISA.57.16	and keep on accusing you.
ISA.57.16	After all, I am your Creator.
ISA.57.16	I don't want you to give up
ISA.57.16	in complete despair.
ISA.57.17	Your greed made me furious.
ISA.57.17	That's why I punished you
ISA.57.17	and refused to be found,
ISA.57.17	while you kept returning
ISA.57.17	to your old sinful ways.
ISA.57.18	I know what you are like!
ISA.57.18	But I will heal you, lead you,
ISA.57.18	and give you comfort,
ISA.57.18	until those who are mourning
ISA.57.19	No matter where you are,
ISA.57.19	I, the 
ISA.57.19	and give you peace.
ISA.57.20	The wicked are a restless sea
ISA.57.20	tossing up mud.
ISA.57.21	that none who are evil
ISA.57.21	will live in peace.
ISA.58.1	Shout the message!
ISA.58.1	Don't hold back.
ISA.58.1	Say to my people Israel:
ISA.58.1	You've sinned! You've turned
ISA.58.1	against the 
ISA.58.2	Day after day, you worship him
ISA.58.2	and seem eager to learn
ISA.58.2	his teachings.
ISA.58.2	You act like a nation
ISA.58.2	that wants to do right
ISA.58.2	by obeying his laws.
ISA.58.2	You ask him about justice,
ISA.58.2	and say you enjoy
ISA.58.2	worshiping the 
ISA.58.3	You wonder why the 
ISA.58.3	pays no attention
ISA.58.3	when you go without eating
ISA.58.3	and act humble.
ISA.58.3	But on those same days
ISA.58.3	that you give up eating,
ISA.58.3	you think only of yourselves
ISA.58.3	and abuse your workers.
ISA.58.4	You even get angry
ISA.58.4	and ready to fight.
ISA.58.4	No wonder God won't listen
ISA.58.4	to your prayers!
ISA.58.5	Do you think the 
ISA.58.5	wants you to give up eating
ISA.58.5	and to act as humble
ISA.58.5	as a bent-over bush?
ISA.58.5	Or to dress in sackcloth
ISA.58.5	and sit in ashes?
ISA.58.5	Is this really what he wants
ISA.58.5	on a day of worship?
ISA.58.6	I'll tell you
ISA.58.6	what it really means
ISA.58.6	to worship the 
ISA.58.6	Remove the chains of prisoners
ISA.58.6	who are bound unjustly.
ISA.58.6	Free those who are abused!
ISA.58.7	who is hungry;
ISA.58.7	share your home
ISA.58.7	with the poor and homeless.
ISA.58.7	Give clothes to those in need;
ISA.58.7	don't turn away your relatives.
ISA.58.8	Then your light will shine
ISA.58.8	like the dawning sun, and you
ISA.58.8	will quickly be healed.
ISA.58.8	Your honesty
ISA.58.8	as you advance,
ISA.58.8	and the glory of the 
ISA.58.8	will defend you from behind.
ISA.58.9	When you beg the 
ISA.58.9	he will answer, “Here I am!”
ISA.58.9	Don't mistreat others
ISA.58.9	or falsely accuse them
ISA.58.9	or say something cruel.
ISA.58.10	Give your food to the hungry
ISA.58.10	and care for the homeless.
ISA.58.10	Then your light will shine
ISA.58.10	in the dark;
ISA.58.10	your darkest hour will be
ISA.58.10	like the noonday sun.
ISA.58.11	The 
ISA.58.11	and provide good things to eat
ISA.58.11	when you are in the desert.
ISA.58.11	He will make you healthy.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a garden
ISA.58.11	that has plenty of water
ISA.58.11	or like a stream
ISA.58.11	that never runs dry.
ISA.58.12	You will rebuild those houses
ISA.58.12	left in ruins for years;
ISA.58.12	you will be known
ISA.58.12	as a builder and repairer
ISA.58.12	of city walls and streets.
ISA.58.13	But first, you must start
ISA.58.13	respecting the Sabbath
ISA.58.13	as a joyful day of worship.
ISA.58.13	You must stop doing and saying
ISA.58.13	whatever you please
ISA.58.13	on this special day.
ISA.58.14	Then you will truly enjoy
ISA.58.14	knowing the 
ISA.58.14	He will let you rule
ISA.58.14	from the highest mountains
ISA.58.14	and bless you with the land
ISA.58.14	of your ancestor Jacob.
ISA.58.14	The 
ISA.59.1	The 
ISA.59.1	his powerful strength;
ISA.59.1	he can still hear
ISA.59.1	and answer prayers.
ISA.59.2	Your sins are the roadblock
ISA.59.2	between you and your God.
ISA.59.2	That's why he doesn't answer
ISA.59.2	your prayers
ISA.59.2	or let you see his face.
ISA.59.3	Your talk is filled with lies
ISA.59.3	and plans for violence;
ISA.59.3	every finger on your hands
ISA.59.3	is covered with blood.
ISA.59.4	You falsely accuse others
ISA.59.4	and tell lies in court;
ISA.59.4	sin and trouble are the names
ISA.59.4	of your children.
ISA.59.5	You eat the deadly eggs
ISA.59.5	of poisonous snakes,
ISA.59.5	and more snakes crawl out
ISA.59.5	from the eggs left to hatch.
ISA.59.5	You weave spider webs,
ISA.59.6	but you can't make clothes
ISA.59.6	with those webs
ISA.59.6	or hide behind them.
ISA.59.6	You're sinful and brutal.
ISA.59.7	or murder innocent victims.
ISA.59.7	All you think about is sin;
ISA.59.7	you leave ruin and destruction
ISA.59.7	wherever you go.
ISA.59.8	You don't know how
ISA.59.8	to live in peace
ISA.59.8	or to be fair with others.
ISA.59.8	The roads you make are crooked;
ISA.59.8	your followers cannot find peace.
ISA.59.9	No one has come to defend us
ISA.59.9	or to bring about justice.
ISA.59.9	We hoped for a day of sunshine,
ISA.59.9	but all we found
ISA.59.9	was a dark, gloomy night.
ISA.59.10	We feel our way along,
ISA.59.10	as if we were blind;
ISA.59.10	we stumble at noon,
ISA.59.10	as if it were night.
ISA.59.10	We can see no better
ISA.59.10	than someone dead.
ISA.59.11	We growl like bears
ISA.59.11	and mourn like doves.
ISA.59.11	We hope for justice and victory,
ISA.59.11	but they escape us.
ISA.59.12	How often have we sinned
ISA.59.12	and turned against you,
ISA.59.12	the 
ISA.59.12	Our sins condemn us!
ISA.59.12	We have done wrong.
ISA.59.13	We have rebelled and refused
ISA.59.13	to follow you.
ISA.59.13	Our hearts were deceitful,
ISA.59.13	and so we lied;
ISA.59.13	we planned to abuse others
ISA.59.13	and turn our backs on you.
ISA.59.14	Injustice is everywhere;
ISA.59.14	justice seems far away.
ISA.59.14	Truth is chased out of court;
ISA.59.14	honesty is shoved aside.
ISA.59.15	Everyone tells lies;
ISA.59.15	those who turn from crime
ISA.59.15	end up ruined.
ISA.59.15	When the 
ISA.59.15	that justice had disappeared,
ISA.59.15	he became very displeased.
ISA.59.16	to learn that no one
ISA.59.16	would do a thing about it.
ISA.59.16	So with his own powerful arm,
ISA.59.16	he won victories for truth.
ISA.59.17	saving power was his helmet;
ISA.59.17	anger and revenge
ISA.59.17	were his clothes.
ISA.59.18	Now the 
ISA.59.18	and do to his enemies,
ISA.59.18	both near and far,
ISA.59.18	what they did to his people.
ISA.59.19	He will attack like a flood
ISA.59.19	in a mighty windstorm.
ISA.59.19	Nations in the west and the east
ISA.59.19	will then honor and praise
ISA.59.19	his wonderful name.
ISA.59.20	the city of Zion
ISA.59.20	and Jacob's descendants
ISA.59.20	who turn from sin.
ISA.59.21	The 
ISA.59.21	I promise to give you my Spirit
ISA.59.21	and my message.
ISA.59.21	These will be my gifts to you
ISA.59.21	and your families forever.
ISA.59.21	I, the 
ISA.60.1	Jerusalem, stand up! Shine!
ISA.60.1	Your new day is dawning.
ISA.60.1	The glory of the 
ISA.60.1	shines brightly on you.
ISA.60.2	The earth and its people
ISA.60.2	are covered with darkness,
ISA.60.2	but the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	is shining upon you.
ISA.60.3	Nations and kings
ISA.60.3	will come to the light
ISA.60.3	of your dawning day.
ISA.60.4	Crowds are coming.
ISA.60.4	Your sons are on their way
ISA.60.4	from distant lands;
ISA.60.4	your daughters are being carried
ISA.60.4	like little children.
ISA.60.5	When you see this,
ISA.60.5	your faces will glow;
ISA.60.5	your hearts will pound
ISA.60.5	and swell with pride.
ISA.60.5	Treasures from across the sea
ISA.60.5	and the wealth of nations
ISA.60.5	will be brought to you.
ISA.60.6	Your country will be covered
ISA.60.6	with caravans of young camels
ISA.60.6	from Midian and Ephah.
ISA.60.6	The people of Sheba
ISA.60.6	will bring gold and spices
ISA.60.6	in praise of me, the 
ISA.60.7	Every sheep of Kedar
ISA.60.7	will come to you;
ISA.60.7	rams from Nebaioth
ISA.60.7	will be yours as well.
ISA.60.7	I will accept them as offerings
ISA.60.7	and bring honor to my temple.
ISA.60.8	What is that sailing by
ISA.60.8	like clouds
ISA.60.8	or like doves flying home?
ISA.60.9	On those distant islands
ISA.60.9	your people are waiting
ISA.60.9	for me, the 
ISA.60.9	Seagoing ships
ISA.60.9	to bring them home
ISA.60.9	with their silver and gold.
ISA.60.9	I, the holy 
ISA.60.9	do this to honor your people,
ISA.60.9	so they will honor me.
ISA.60.10	Jerusalem, your city walls
ISA.60.10	will be rebuilt by foreigners;
ISA.60.10	their rulers will become
ISA.60.10	your slaves.
ISA.60.10	I punished you in my anger;
ISA.60.10	now I will be kind
ISA.60.10	and treat you with mercy.
ISA.60.11	day and night
ISA.60.11	to let the rulers of nations
ISA.60.11	lead their people to you
ISA.60.11	with all their treasures.
ISA.60.12	Any nation or kingdom
ISA.60.12	that refuses to serve you
ISA.60.12	will be wiped out.
ISA.60.13	Wood from Lebanon's best trees
ISA.60.13	will be brought to you—
ISA.60.13	the pines, the firs,
ISA.60.13	and the cypress trees.
ISA.60.13	It will be used in my temple
ISA.60.13	to make beautiful the place
ISA.60.13	where I rest my feet.
ISA.60.14	who hated and mistreated you
ISA.60.14	will kneel at your feet.
ISA.60.14	They will say, “You are Zion,
ISA.60.14	the city of the 
ISA.60.14	the holy One of Israel.”
ISA.60.15	You were hated and deserted,
ISA.60.15	rejected by everyone.
ISA.60.15	But I will make you beautiful,
ISA.60.15	a city to be proud of
ISA.60.15	for all time to come.
ISA.60.16	You will drain the wealth
ISA.60.16	of kings and foreign nations.
ISA.60.16	You will know that I,
ISA.60.16	the mighty 
ISA.60.16	have saved and rescued you.
ISA.60.17	I will bring bronze and iron
ISA.60.17	in place of wood and stone;
ISA.60.17	in place of bronze and iron,
ISA.60.17	I will bring gold and silver.
ISA.60.17	I will appoint peace and justice
ISA.60.17	as your rulers and leaders.
ISA.60.18	Violence, destruction, and ruin
ISA.60.18	will never again be heard of
ISA.60.18	within your borders.
ISA.60.18	“Victory” will be the name
ISA.60.18	you give to your walls;
ISA.60.18	“Praise” will be the name
ISA.60.18	you give to your gates.
ISA.60.19	of the sun or the moon.
ISA.60.19	I, the 
ISA.60.19	will be your eternal light
ISA.60.19	and bring you honor.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will never set
ISA.60.20	or your moon go down.
ISA.60.20	I, the 
ISA.60.20	your everlasting light,
ISA.60.20	and your days of sorrow
ISA.60.20	will come to an end.
ISA.60.21	Your people will live right
ISA.60.21	and always own the land;
ISA.60.21	they are the trees I planted
ISA.60.21	to bring praise to me.
ISA.60.22	Even the smallest family
ISA.60.22	will be a powerful nation.
ISA.60.22	I am the 
ISA.60.22	and when the time comes,
ISA.60.22	I will quickly do all this.
ISA.61.1	has taken control of me!
ISA.61.1	The 
ISA.61.1	to tell the oppressed
ISA.61.1	the good news,
ISA.61.1	to heal the brokenhearted,
ISA.61.1	and to announce freedom
ISA.61.1	for prisoners and captives.
ISA.61.2	when the 
ISA.61.2	will show kindness to us
ISA.61.2	and punish our enemies.
ISA.61.2	The 
ISA.61.2	to comfort those who mourn,
ISA.61.3	especially in Jerusalem.
ISA.61.3	He sent me to give them flowers
ISA.61.3	in place of their sorrow,
ISA.61.3	olive oil in place of tears,
ISA.61.3	and joyous praise
ISA.61.3	in place of broken hearts.
ISA.61.3	They will be called
ISA.61.3	“Trees of Justice,”
ISA.61.3	planted by the 
ISA.61.3	to honor his name.
ISA.61.4	Then they will rebuild cities
ISA.61.4	that have been in ruins
ISA.61.4	for many generations.
ISA.61.5	They will hire foreigners
ISA.61.5	to take care of their sheep
ISA.61.5	and their vineyards.
ISA.61.6	But they themselves will be
ISA.61.6	priests and servants
ISA.61.6	of the 
ISA.61.6	The treasures of the nations
ISA.61.6	will belong to them,
ISA.61.6	and they will be famous.
ISA.61.7	They were terribly insulted
ISA.61.7	and horribly mistreated;
ISA.61.7	now they will be greatly blessed
ISA.61.7	and joyful forever.
ISA.61.8	I, the 
ISA.61.8	But I hate robbery
ISA.61.8	and injustice.
ISA.61.8	My people, I solemnly promise
ISA.61.8	to reward you
ISA.61.8	with an eternal agreement.
ISA.61.9	Your descendants will be known
ISA.61.9	in every nation.
ISA.61.9	All who see them will realize
ISA.61.9	that they have been blessed,
ISA.61.9	by me, the 
ISA.61.10	because of my 
ISA.61.10	His saving power and justice
ISA.61.10	are the very clothes I wear.
ISA.61.10	They are more beautiful
ISA.61.10	than the jewelry worn
ISA.61.10	by a bride or groom.
ISA.61.11	The 
ISA.61.11	justice and praise
ISA.61.11	in every nation on earth,
ISA.61.11	like flowers blooming
ISA.61.11	in a garden.
ISA.62.1	Jerusalem, I will speak up
ISA.62.1	for your good.
ISA.62.1	I will never be silent
ISA.62.1	till you are safe and secure,
ISA.62.1	sparkling like a flame.
ISA.62.2	Your great victory will be seen
ISA.62.2	by every nation and king;
ISA.62.2	the 
ISA.62.2	a new name.
ISA.62.3	You will be a glorious crown,
ISA.62.3	a royal headband
ISA.62.3	for the 
ISA.62.4	Your name will no longer be
ISA.62.4	“Deserted and Childless,”
ISA.62.4	but “Happily Married.”
ISA.62.4	You will please the 
ISA.62.4	your country
ISA.62.4	will be his bride.
ISA.62.5	Your people will take the land,
ISA.62.5	just as a young man
ISA.62.5	takes a bride.
ISA.62.5	The 
ISA.62.5	because of you,
ISA.62.5	just as a husband is pleased
ISA.62.5	with his bride.
ISA.62.6	Jerusalem, on your walls
ISA.62.6	I have stationed guards,
ISA.62.6	whose duty it is
ISA.62.6	to speak out day and night,
ISA.62.6	without resting.
ISA.62.6	They must remind the 
ISA.62.7	and not let him rest
ISA.62.7	till he makes Jerusalem strong
ISA.62.7	and famous everywhere.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	and made this promise:
ISA.62.8	“Never again will I give
ISA.62.8	to your enemies
ISA.62.8	the grain and grapes
ISA.62.8	for which you struggled.
ISA.62.9	As surely as you harvest
ISA.62.9	your grain and grapes,
ISA.62.9	you will eat your bread
ISA.62.9	with thankful hearts,
ISA.62.9	and you will drink your wine
ISA.62.9	in my temple.”
ISA.62.10	People of Jerusalem,
ISA.62.10	open your gates!
ISA.62.10	Repair the road to the city
ISA.62.10	and clear it of stones;
ISA.62.10	raise a banner to help
ISA.62.10	the nations find their way.
ISA.62.11	for all the earth to hear:
ISA.62.11	“Soon I will come to save
ISA.62.11	the city of Zion
ISA.62.11	and to reward you.
ISA.62.12	Then you will be called,
ISA.62.12	‘The 
ISA.62.12	The Ones He Rescued!’
ISA.62.12	Your city will be known
ISA.62.12	as a good place to live
ISA.62.12	and a city full of people.”
ISA.63.1	from Bozrah
ISA.63.1	with clothes stained red?
ISA.63.1	Who is this hero marching
ISA.63.1	in his glorious uniform?
ISA.63.1	“It's me, the 
ISA.63.1	I have won the battle,
ISA.63.1	and I can save you!”
ISA.63.2	What are those red spots?
ISA.63.2	Your clothes look stained
ISA.63.2	from trampling on grapes.
ISA.63.3	None of the nations helped.
ISA.63.3	I trampled nations in my anger
ISA.63.3	and stained my clothes
ISA.63.3	with their blood.
ISA.63.4	I did this because I wanted
ISA.63.4	to take revenge—
ISA.63.4	the time had come
ISA.63.4	to rescue my people.
ISA.63.5	or to give support;
ISA.63.5	my mighty arm won the battle,
ISA.63.5	strengthened by my anger.
ISA.63.6	In my fury I trampled on nations
ISA.63.6	and made them drunk;
ISA.63.6	their blood poured out
ISA.63.6	everywhere on earth.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell about the kind deeds
ISA.63.7	the 
ISA.63.7	They deserve praise!
ISA.63.7	The 
ISA.63.7	to the people of Israel;
ISA.63.7	he has been kind and good.
ISA.63.8	The 
ISA.63.8	and said, “They are mine.
ISA.63.8	They won't betray me.”
ISA.63.9	It troubled the 
ISA.63.9	to see them in trouble,
ISA.63.9	and his angel saved them.
ISA.63.9	The 
ISA.63.9	so he rescued his people.
ISA.63.9	He took them in his arms
ISA.63.9	and carried them all those years.
ISA.63.10	Then the 
ISA.63.10	turned against him and made
ISA.63.10	his Holy Spirit sad.
ISA.63.10	So he became their enemy
ISA.63.10	and attacked them.
ISA.63.11	But his people remembered
ISA.63.11	what had happened
ISA.63.11	during the time of Moses.
ISA.63.11	Didn't the 
ISA.63.11	and their leaders
ISA.63.11	safely through the sea?
ISA.63.11	Didn't he
ISA.63.11	his Holy Spirit?
ISA.63.12	marched beside Moses.
ISA.63.12	The 
ISA.63.12	for dividing the sea.
ISA.63.13	He led his people across
ISA.63.13	like horses running wild
ISA.63.13	without stumbling.
ISA.63.14	His Spirit gave them rest,
ISA.63.14	just as cattle find rest
ISA.63.14	when led into a valley.
ISA.63.14	The name of the 
ISA.63.14	for doing these things.
ISA.63.15	Please, 
ISA.63.15	from your holy and glorious
ISA.63.15	home in the heavens
ISA.63.15	and see what's going on.
ISA.63.15	Have you lost interest?
ISA.63.15	Where is your power?
ISA.63.15	Show that you care about us
ISA.63.15	and have mercy!
ISA.63.16	have both rejected us.
ISA.63.16	But you are still our Father;
ISA.63.16	you have been our protector
ISA.63.16	since ancient times.
ISA.63.17	Why did you make us turn away
ISA.63.17	from you, our 
ISA.63.17	Why did you make us want
ISA.63.17	to disobey you?
ISA.63.17	Please change your mind!
ISA.63.17	We are your servants,
ISA.63.17	your very own people.
ISA.63.18	For a little while,
ISA.63.18	your temple belonged to us;
ISA.63.18	and now our enemies
ISA.63.18	have torn it down.
ISA.63.19	We act as though you
ISA.63.19	had never ruled us
ISA.63.19	or called us your people.
ISA.64.1	Rip the heavens apart!
ISA.64.1	Come down, 
ISA.64.1	make the mountains tremble.
ISA.64.2	Be a spark that starts a fire
ISA.64.2	causing water to boil.
ISA.64.2	Then your enemies will know
ISA.64.2	who you are;
ISA.64.2	all nations will tremble
ISA.64.2	because you are nearby.
ISA.64.3	Your fearsome deeds
ISA.64.3	have completely amazed us;
ISA.64.3	even the mountains shake
ISA.64.3	when you come down.
ISA.64.4	ever seen or heard of
ISA.64.4	who works miracles
ISA.64.4	for his followers.
ISA.64.5	You help all who gladly obey
ISA.64.5	and do what you want,
ISA.64.5	but sin makes you angry.
ISA.64.5	Only by your help
ISA.64.5	can we ever be saved.
ISA.64.6	We are unfit to worship you;
ISA.64.6	each of our good deeds
ISA.64.6	is merely a filthy rag.
ISA.64.6	We dry up like leaves;
ISA.64.6	our sins are storm winds
ISA.64.6	sweeping us away.
ISA.64.7	No one worships in your name
ISA.64.7	or remains faithful.
ISA.64.7	You have turned your back on us
ISA.64.7	and let our sins melt us away.
ISA.64.8	You, 
ISA.64.8	We are nothing but clay,
ISA.64.8	but you are the potter
ISA.64.8	who molded us.
ISA.64.9	Don't be so furious
ISA.64.9	or keep our sins
ISA.64.9	in your thoughts forever!
ISA.64.9	Remember that all of us
ISA.64.9	are your people.
ISA.64.10	Every one of your towns
ISA.64.10	has turned into a desert,
ISA.64.10	especially Jerusalem.
ISA.64.11	Zion's glorious and holy temple
ISA.64.11	where our ancestors praised you
ISA.64.11	has been destroyed by fire.
ISA.64.11	Our beautiful buildings
ISA.64.11	are now a pile of ruins.
ISA.64.12	When you see these things,
ISA.64.12	how can you just sit there
ISA.64.12	and make us suffer more?
ISA.65.1	to answer even those
ISA.65.1	who were not asking
ISA.65.1	and to be found by those
ISA.65.1	who were not searching.
ISA.65.1	To a nation that refused
ISA.65.1	to worship me,
ISA.65.1	I said, “Here I am!”
ISA.65.2	to stubborn and sinful people
ISA.65.2	going their own way.
ISA.65.3	They keep making me angry
ISA.65.3	by sneering at me,
ISA.65.3	while offering sacrifices
ISA.65.3	to idols in gardens
ISA.65.3	and burning incense
ISA.65.3	to them on bricks.
ISA.65.4	They spend their nights
ISA.65.4	hiding in burial caves;
ISA.65.4	they eat the meat of pigs,
ISA.65.4	cooked in sauces
ISA.65.4	made of stuff unfit to eat.
ISA.65.5	And then they say to others,
ISA.65.5	“Don't come near us!
ISA.65.5	We're dedicated to God.”
ISA.65.5	Such people are like smoke,
ISA.65.5	irritating my nose all day.
ISA.65.6	I have written this down;
ISA.65.6	I won't keep silent.
ISA.65.6	I'll pay them back
ISA.65.6	just as their sins deserve.
ISA.65.7	I, the 
ISA.65.7	for their sins and for those
ISA.65.7	of their ancestors—
ISA.65.7	they have disgraced me
ISA.65.7	by burning incense
ISA.65.7	on mountains.
ISA.65.8	Here is what the 
ISA.65.8	A cluster of grapes
ISA.65.8	that produces wine
ISA.65.8	is worth keeping!
ISA.65.8	So, because of my servants,
ISA.65.8	I won't destroy everyone.
ISA.65.9	I have chosen the people
ISA.65.9	of Israel and Judah,
ISA.65.9	and I will bless them
ISA.65.9	with many descendants.
ISA.65.9	They will settle here
ISA.65.9	in this land of mountains,
ISA.65.9	and it will be theirs.
ISA.65.10	Then the coastlands of Sharon
ISA.65.10	and the land as far
ISA.65.10	as Achor Valley
ISA.65.10	will turn into pastureland
ISA.65.10	where cattle and sheep
ISA.65.10	will feed and rest.
ISA.65.11	What will I, the 
ISA.65.11	if any of you reject me
ISA.65.11	and my holy mountain?
ISA.65.11	What will happen to you
ISA.65.11	for offering food and wine
ISA.65.11	to the gods you call
ISA.65.11	“Good Luck” and “Fate”?
ISA.65.12	Your luck will end!
ISA.65.12	I will see to it that you
ISA.65.12	are slaughtered with swords.
ISA.65.12	You refused to answer
ISA.65.12	when I called out;
ISA.65.12	you paid no attention
ISA.65.12	to my instructions.
ISA.65.12	Instead, you did what I hated,
ISA.65.12	knowing it was wrong.
ISA.65.13	I, the 
ISA.65.13	food and drink to my servants,
ISA.65.13	and they will celebrate.
ISA.65.13	But all of you sinners
ISA.65.13	will go hungry and thirsty,
ISA.65.13	overcome with disgrace.
ISA.65.14	My servants will laugh and sing,
ISA.65.14	but you will be sad
ISA.65.14	and cry out in pain.
ISA.65.15	I, the 
ISA.65.15	to see that you are killed
ISA.65.15	and that my chosen servants use
ISA.65.15	your names as curse words.
ISA.65.15	But I will give new names
ISA.65.15	to my servants.
ISA.65.16	I am God! I can be trusted.
ISA.65.16	Your past troubles are gone;
ISA.65.16	I no longer think of them.
ISA.65.16	When you pray for someone
ISA.65.16	to receive a blessing,
ISA.65.16	or when you make a promise,
ISA.65.16	you must do it in my name.
ISA.65.16	I alone am the God
ISA.65.16	who can be trusted.
ISA.65.17	and a new earth;
ISA.65.17	everything of the past
ISA.65.17	will be forgotten.
ISA.65.18	Celebrate and be glad forever!
ISA.65.18	I am creating a Jerusalem,
ISA.65.18	full of happy people.
ISA.65.19	and all its people;
ISA.65.19	there will be no more crying
ISA.65.19	or sorrow in that city.
ISA.65.20	No child will die in infancy;
ISA.65.20	everyone will live
ISA.65.20	a very long life.
ISA.65.20	Anyone a hundred years old
ISA.65.20	will be considered young,
ISA.65.20	and to die younger than that
ISA.65.20	will be considered a curse.
ISA.65.21	My people will live
ISA.65.21	in the houses they build;
ISA.65.21	they will enjoy grapes
ISA.65.21	from their own vineyards.
ISA.65.22	No one will take away
ISA.65.22	their homes or vineyards.
ISA.65.22	My chosen people will live
ISA.65.22	to be as old as trees,
ISA.65.22	and they will enjoy
ISA.65.22	what they have earned.
ISA.65.23	Their work won't be wasted,
ISA.65.23	and their children won't die
ISA.65.23	of dreadful diseases.
ISA.65.23	I will bless their children
ISA.65.23	and their grandchildren.
ISA.65.24	I will answer their prayers
ISA.65.24	before they finish praying.
ISA.65.25	will graze together;
ISA.65.25	lions and oxen
ISA.65.25	will feed on straw.
ISA.65.25	Snakes will eat only dirt!
ISA.65.25	They won't bite or harm anyone
ISA.65.25	on my holy mountain.
ISA.65.25	I, the 
ISA.66.1	Heaven is my throne;
ISA.66.1	the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	What kind of house
ISA.66.1	could you build for me?
ISA.66.1	In what place will I rest?
ISA.66.2	I have made everything;
ISA.66.2	that's how it all came to be.
ISA.66.2	I, the 
ISA.66.2	The people I treasure most
ISA.66.2	are the humble—
ISA.66.2	they depend only on me
ISA.66.2	and tremble when I speak.
ISA.66.3	You sacrifice oxen to me,
ISA.66.3	and you commit murder;
ISA.66.3	you sacrifice lambs to me
ISA.66.3	and dogs to other gods;
ISA.66.3	you offer grain to me
ISA.66.3	and pigs' blood to idols;
ISA.66.3	you burn incense to me
ISA.66.3	and praise your idols.
ISA.66.3	You have made your own choice
ISA.66.3	to do these disgusting things
ISA.66.3	that you enjoy so much.
ISA.66.4	You refused to answer
ISA.66.4	when I called out;
ISA.66.4	you paid no attention
ISA.66.4	to my instructions.
ISA.66.4	Instead, you did what I hated,
ISA.66.4	knowing it was wrong.
ISA.66.4	Now I will punish
ISA.66.4	in a way you dread the most.
ISA.66.5	If you tremble
ISA.66.5	when the 
ISA.66.5	listen to what he says:
ISA.66.5	“Some of your own people hate
ISA.66.5	and reject you because of me.
ISA.66.5	They make fun and say,
ISA.66.5	‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	Let us see him
ISA.66.5	make you truly happy.’
ISA.66.5	But those who say these things
ISA.66.5	will be terribly ashamed.”
ISA.66.6	Do you hear that noise
ISA.66.6	in the city and those shouts
ISA.66.6	coming from the temple?
ISA.66.6	It is the 
ISA.66.6	as he punishes his enemies.
ISA.66.7	who gave birth to a child
ISA.66.7	before having labor pains?
ISA.66.8	Who ever heard of such a thing
ISA.66.8	or imagined it could happen?
ISA.66.8	Can a nation be born in a day
ISA.66.8	or come to life in a second?
ISA.66.8	Jerusalem is like a mother
ISA.66.8	who gave birth to her children
ISA.66.8	as soon as she was in labor.
ISA.66.9	The 
ISA.66.9	who makes birth possible.
ISA.66.9	And he will see that Zion
ISA.66.9	has many more children.
ISA.66.9	The 
ISA.66.10	If you love Jerusalem,
ISA.66.10	celebrate and shout!
ISA.66.10	If you were in sorrow
ISA.66.10	because of the city,
ISA.66.10	you can now be glad.
ISA.66.11	She will nurse and comfort you,
ISA.66.11	just like your own mother,
ISA.66.11	until you are satisfied.
ISA.66.11	You will fully enjoy
ISA.66.11	her wonderful glory.
ISA.66.12	The 
ISA.66.12	“I will flood Jerusalem
ISA.66.12	with the wealth of nations
ISA.66.12	and make the city prosper.
ISA.66.12	Zion will nurse you at her breast,
ISA.66.12	carry you in her arms,
ISA.66.12	and hold you in her lap.
ISA.66.13	I will comfort you there
ISA.66.13	like a mother
ISA.66.13	comforting her child.”
ISA.66.14	When you see this happen,
ISA.66.14	you will celebrate;
ISA.66.14	your strength will return
ISA.66.14	faster than grass can sprout.
ISA.66.14	Then everyone will know
ISA.66.14	that the 
ISA.66.14	for his servants,
ISA.66.14	but he is angry
ISA.66.14	with his enemies.
ISA.66.15	The 
ISA.66.15	like a whirlwind
ISA.66.15	with his flaming chariots.
ISA.66.15	He will be furiously angry
ISA.66.15	and punish his enemies
ISA.66.15	with fire.
ISA.66.16	The 
ISA.66.16	will bring justice
ISA.66.16	everywhere on this earth
ISA.66.16	and execute many people.
ISA.66.17	Some of you get yourselves ready and go to a garden to worship a foreign goddess.
ISA.66.18	I know everything you do and think! The time has now come
ISA.66.19	by proving what I can do.
ISA.66.20	They will bring your relatives from the nations as an offering to me, the 
ISA.66.21	I promise that some of them will be priests and others will be helpers in my temple. I, the 
ISA.66.23	On the first day of each month and on each Sabbath, everyone will worship me. I, the 
JER.1.1	My name is Jeremiah. I am a priest, and my father Hilkiah and everyone else in my family are from Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. This book contains the things that the 
JER.1.2	 The 
JER.1.3	 and he continued to speak to me during the rule of Josiah's son Jehoiakim.
JER.1.4	The 
JER.1.5	“Jeremiah, I am your Creator,
JER.1.5	and before you were born,
JER.1.5	I chose you to speak for me
JER.1.5	to the nations.”
JER.1.6	I replied, “I'm not a good speaker, 
JER.1.7	“Don't say you're too young,” the 
JER.1.8	I promise to be with you and keep you safe, so don't be afraid.”
JER.1.9	The 
JER.1.10	and I am sending you with authority to speak to the nations for me. You will tell them of doom and destruction, and of rising and rebuilding again.”
JER.1.11	The 
JER.1.11	I answered, “A branch of almonds that ripen early.”
JER.1.12	“That's right,” the 
JER.1.13	Then the 
JER.1.13	I answered, “I see a pot of boiling water in the north, and it's about to spill out toward us.”
JER.1.14	The 
JER.1.14	I will pour out destruction
JER.1.14	all over the land.
JER.1.15	Just watch while I send
JER.1.15	for the kings of the north.
JER.1.15	They will attack and capture
JER.1.15	Jerusalem and other towns,
JER.1.15	then set up their thrones
JER.1.15	at the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.1.16	I will punish my people,
JER.1.16	because they are guilty
JER.1.16	of turning from me
JER.1.16	to worship idols.
JER.1.17	Jeremiah, get ready!
JER.1.17	Go and tell the people
JER.1.17	what I command you to say.
JER.1.17	Don't be frightened by them,
JER.1.17	or I will make you terrified
JER.1.17	while they watch.
JER.1.18	My power will make you strong
JER.1.18	like a fortress
JER.1.18	or a column of iron
JER.1.18	or a wall of bronze.
JER.1.18	You will oppose all of Judah,
JER.1.18	including its kings and leaders,
JER.1.18	its priests and people.
JER.1.19	They will fight back,
JER.1.19	but they won't win.
JER.1.19	I, the 
JER.1.19	I won't let them harm you.
JER.2.1	The 
JER.2.2	to go to Jerusalem and tell everyone that he had said:
JER.2.2	When you were my young bride,
JER.2.2	you loved me and followed me
JER.2.2	through the barren desert.
JER.2.3	You belonged to me alone,
JER.2.3	like the first part of the harvest,
JER.2.3	and I severely punished
JER.2.3	those who mistreated you.
JER.2.4	Listen, people of Israel,
JER.2.5	and I, the 
JER.2.5	I was never unfair
JER.2.5	to your ancestors,
JER.2.5	but they left me
JER.2.5	and became worthless
JER.2.5	by following worthless idols.
JER.2.6	Your ancestors refused
JER.2.6	to ask for my help,
JER.2.6	though I had rescued them
JER.2.6	from Egypt
JER.2.6	and led them through
JER.2.6	a treacherous, barren desert,
JER.2.6	where no one lives
JER.2.6	or dares to travel.
JER.2.7	I brought you here to my land,
JER.2.7	where food is abundant,
JER.2.7	but you made my land filthy
JER.2.7	with your sins.
JER.2.8	The priests who teach my laws
JER.2.8	don't care to know me.
JER.2.8	Your leaders rebel against me;
JER.2.8	your prophets
JER.2.8	give messages from Baal
JER.2.8	and worship false gods.
JER.2.9	I will take you to court
JER.2.9	and accuse you
JER.2.9	and your descendants
JER.2.9	* 
JER.2.10	of a crime that no nation
JER.2.10	has ever committed before.
JER.2.10	Just ask anyone, anywhere,
JER.2.10	from the eastern deserts
JER.2.10	to the islands in the west.
JER.2.11	You will find that no nation
JER.2.11	has ever abandoned its gods
JER.2.11	even though they were false.
JER.2.11	I am the true and glorious God,
JER.2.11	but you have rejected me
JER.2.11	to worship idols.
JER.2.12	Tell the heavens
JER.2.12	to tremble with fear!
JER.2.13	You, my people, have sinned
JER.2.13	in two ways—
JER.2.13	you have rejected me, the source
JER.2.13	of life-giving water,
JER.2.13	and you've tried to collect water
JER.2.13	in cracked and leaking pits
JER.2.13	dug in the ground.
JER.2.14	People of Israel,
JER.2.14	you weren't born slaves;
JER.2.14	you were captured in war.
JER.2.15	Enemies roared like lions
JER.2.15	and destroyed your land;
JER.2.15	towns lie burned and empty.
JER.2.16	Soldiers from the Egyptian towns
JER.2.16	of Memphis and Tahpanhes
JER.2.16	have cracked your skulls.
JER.2.17	It's all your own fault!
JER.2.17	You stopped following me,
JER.2.17	the 
JER.2.18	and you trusted the power
JER.2.18	of Egypt and Assyria.
JER.2.19	Your own sins will punish you,
JER.2.19	because it was a bitter mistake
JER.2.19	for you to reject me
JER.2.19	without fear of punishment.
JER.2.19	I, the 
JER.2.19	have spoken.
JER.2.20	Long ago you left me
JER.2.20	and broke all ties between us,
JER.2.20	refusing to be my servant.
JER.2.20	Now you worship other gods
JER.2.20	by having sex
JER.2.20	on hilltops or in the shade
JER.2.20	of large trees.
JER.2.21	You were a choice grapevine,
JER.2.21	but you have become
JER.2.21	a wild, useless vine.
JER.2.22	The 
JER.2.22	People of Israel,
JER.2.22	you are stained with guilt,
JER.2.22	and no soap or bleach
JER.2.22	can wash it away.
JER.2.23	You deny your sins
JER.2.23	and say, “We aren't unclean.
JER.2.23	We haven't worshiped Baal.”
JER.2.23	But think about what you do
JER.2.23	in Hinnom Valley.
JER.2.23	You run back and forth
JER.2.23	like young camels,
JER.2.23	as you rush to worship one idol
JER.2.23	after another.
JER.2.24	You are a female donkey
JER.2.24	sniffing the desert air,
JER.2.24	wanting to mate
JER.2.24	with just anyone.
JER.2.24	You are an easy catch!
JER.2.25	Your shoes are worn out,
JER.2.25	and your throat is parched
JER.2.25	from running here and there
JER.2.25	to worship foreign gods.
JER.2.25	“Stop!” I shouted,
JER.2.25	but you replied, “No!
JER.2.25	I love those gods too much.”
JER.2.26	You and your leaders
JER.2.26	are more disgraceful
JER.2.26	than thieves—
JER.2.26	you and your kings,
JER.2.26	your priests and prophets
JER.2.27	worship stone idols
JER.2.27	and sacred poles
JER.2.27	as if they had created you
JER.2.27	and had given you life.
JER.2.27	You have rejected me,
JER.2.27	but when you're in trouble,
JER.2.27	you cry to me for help.
JER.2.28	Go cry to the gods you made!
JER.2.28	There should be enough of them
JER.2.28	to save you,
JER.2.28	because Judah has as many gods
JER.2.28	as it has towns.
JER.2.29	The 
JER.2.29	You accuse me of not saving you,
JER.2.29	but I say you have rebelled.
JER.2.30	I tried punishing you,
JER.2.30	but you refused
JER.2.30	to come back to me,
JER.2.30	and like fierce lions
JER.2.30	you killed my prophets.
JER.2.31	Now listen to what I say!
JER.2.31	Did I abandon you in the desert
JER.2.31	or surround you with darkness?
JER.2.31	You are my people,
JER.2.31	yet you have told me,
JER.2.31	“We'll do what we want,
JER.2.31	and we refuse
JER.2.31	to worship you!”
JER.2.32	A bride could not forget
JER.2.32	to wear her jewelry
JER.2.32	to her wedding,
JER.2.32	but you have forgotten me
JER.2.32	day after day.
JER.2.33	You are so clever
JER.2.33	at finding lovers
JER.2.33	that you could give lessons
JER.2.33	to a prostitute.
JER.2.34	You killed innocent people
JER.2.34	for no reason at all.
JER.2.34	And even though their blood
JER.2.34	can be seen on your clothes,
JER.2.35	you claim to be innocent,
JER.2.35	and you want me to stop
JER.2.35	being angry with you.
JER.2.35	So I'll take you to court,
JER.2.35	and we'll see who is right.
JER.2.36	When Assyria let you down,
JER.2.36	you quickly ran to Egypt,
JER.2.36	but you'll find no help there,
JER.2.37	and you will leave
JER.2.37	in great sadness.
JER.2.37	I won't let you find help
JER.2.37	from those you trust.
JER.3.1	The 
JER.3.1	If a divorced woman marries,
JER.3.1	can her first husband
JER.3.1	ever marry her again?
JER.3.1	No, because this
JER.3.1	would pollute the land.
JER.3.1	But you have more gods
JER.3.1	than a prostitute has lovers.
JER.3.1	Why should I take you back?
JER.3.2	Just try to find one hilltop
JER.3.2	where you haven't gone
JER.3.2	to worship other gods
JER.3.2	by having sex.
JER.3.2	You sat beside the road
JER.3.2	like a robber in ambush,
JER.3.2	except you offered yourself
JER.3.2	to every passerby.
JER.3.2	Your sins of unfaithfulness
JER.3.2	have polluted the land.
JER.3.3	So I, the 
JER.3.3	to let the spring rains fall.
JER.3.3	But just like a prostitute,
JER.3.3	you still have no shame
JER.3.3	for what you have done.
JER.3.4	You call me your father
JER.3.4	or your long-lost friend;
JER.3.5	you beg me to stop being angry,
JER.3.5	but you won't stop sinning.
JER.3.6	Jeremiah, the kingdom of Israel
JER.3.7+JER.3.8	I knew that the kingdom of Israel had been unfaithful and committed many sins, yet I still hoped she might come back to me. But she didn't, so I divorced her and sent her away.
JER.3.7+JER.3.8	Her sister, the kingdom of Judah, saw what happened, but she wasn't worried in the least, and I watched her become unfaithful like her sister. 
JER.3.9	The kingdom of Judah wasn't sorry for being a prostitute, and she didn't care that she had made both herself and the land unclean by worshiping idols of stone and wood. 
JER.3.10	And worst of all, the people of Judah pretended to come back to me. 
JER.3.11	Even the people of Israel were honest enough not to pretend.
JER.3.12	Jeremiah, shout toward the north:
JER.3.12	Israel, I am your 
JER.3.12	come back to me!
JER.3.12	You were unfaithful
JER.3.12	and made me furious,
JER.3.12	but I am merciful,
JER.3.12	and so I will forgive you.
JER.3.13	Just admit that you rebelled
JER.3.13	and worshiped foreign gods
JER.3.13	under large trees everywhere.
JER.3.14	You are unfaithful children,
JER.3.14	but you belong to me.
JER.3.14	Come home!
JER.3.14	I'll take one or two of you
JER.3.14	from each town and clan
JER.3.14	and bring you to Zion.
JER.3.15	Then I'll appoint wise rulers
JER.3.15	who will obey me,
JER.3.15	and they will care for you
JER.3.15	like shepherds.
JER.3.16	You will increase in numbers,
JER.3.16	and there will be no need
JER.3.16	to remember the sacred chest
JER.3.16	or to make a new one.
JER.3.17	The whole city of Jerusalem
JER.3.17	will be my throne.
JER.3.17	All nations will come here
JER.3.17	to worship me,
JER.3.17	and they will no longer follow
JER.3.17	their stubborn, evil hearts.
JER.3.18	Then, in countries to the north,
JER.3.18	you people of Judah and Israel
JER.3.18	will be reunited,
JER.3.18	and you will return to the land
JER.3.18	I gave your ancestors.
JER.3.19	I have always wanted
JER.3.19	to treat you as my children
JER.3.19	and give you the best land,
JER.3.19	the most beautiful on earth.
JER.3.19	I wanted you to call me “Father”
JER.3.19	and not turn from me.
JER.3.20	But instead, you are like a wife
JER.3.20	who broke her wedding vows.
JER.3.20	You have been unfaithful to me.
JER.3.20	I, the 
JER.3.21	Listen to the noise
JER.3.21	on the hilltops!
JER.3.21	It's the people of Israel,
JER.3.21	weeping and begging me
JER.3.21	to answer their prayers.
JER.3.21	They forgot about me
JER.3.21	and chose the wrong path.
JER.3.22	I will tell them, “Come back,
JER.3.22	and I will cure you
JER.3.22	of your unfaithfulness.”
JER.3.22	They will answer,
JER.3.22	“We will come back, because you
JER.3.22	are the 
JER.3.23	On hilltops, we worshiped idols
JER.3.23	and made loud noises,
JER.3.23	but it was all for nothing—
JER.3.23	only you can save us.
JER.3.24	Since the days of our ancestors
JER.3.24	when our nation was young,
JER.3.24	that shameful god Baal
JER.3.24	our crops and livestock,
JER.3.24	our sons and daughters.
JER.3.25	We have rebelled against you
JER.3.25	just like our ancestors,
JER.3.25	and we are ashamed of our sins.”
JER.4.1	The 
JER.4.1	Israel, if you really want
JER.4.1	to come back to me, get rid
JER.4.1	of those disgusting idols.
JER.4.2	Make promises only in my name,
JER.4.2	and do what you promise!
JER.4.2	Then all nations will praise me,
JER.4.2	and I will bless them.
JER.4.3	don't be so stubborn!
JER.4.3	Your hearts have become hard,
JER.4.3	like unplowed ground
JER.4.3	where thornbushes grow.
JER.4.4	With all your hearts,
JER.4.4	keep the agreement
JER.4.4	I made with you.
JER.4.4	But if you are stubborn
JER.4.4	and keep on sinning,
JER.4.4	my anger will burn like a fire
JER.4.4	that cannot be put out.
JER.4.4	* 
JER.4.5	“Sound the trumpets, my people.
JER.4.5	Warn the people of Judah,
JER.4.5	‘Run for your lives!
JER.4.6	Head for Jerusalem
JER.4.6	or another walled town!’
JER.4.6	“Jeremiah, tell them I'm sending
JER.4.6	disaster from the north.
JER.4.7	An army will come out,
JER.4.7	like a lion from its den.
JER.4.7	It will destroy nations
JER.4.7	and leave your towns empty
JER.4.7	and in ruins.”
JER.4.8	Then I told the people
JER.4.8	of Israel,
JER.4.8	“Put on sackcloth!
JER.4.8	Mourn and cry out,
JER.4.8	‘The 
JER.4.8	with us.’ ”
JER.4.9	The 
JER.4.9	“When all this happens,
JER.4.9	the king and his officials,
JER.4.9	the prophets and the priests
JER.4.9	will be shocked and terrified.”
JER.4.10	I said, “You are the 
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	When disaster comes, the 
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	“I am sending a windstorm
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	from the desert—
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	not a welcome breeze.
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	And it will sweep you away
JER.4.11+JER.4.12	as punishment for your sins.
JER.4.13	Look! The enemy army
JER.4.13	swoops down like an eagle;
JER.4.13	their cavalry and chariots
JER.4.13	race faster than storm clouds
JER.4.13	blown by the wind.”
JER.4.13	Then you will answer,
JER.4.13	“We are doomed!”
JER.4.14	But Jerusalem, there is still time
JER.4.14	for you to be saved.
JER.4.14	Wash the evil from your hearts
JER.4.14	and stop making sinful plans,
JER.4.15	before a message of disaster
JER.4.15	arrives from the hills of Ephraim
JER.4.15	and the town of Dan.
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	The 
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	“Tell the nations that my people
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	have rebelled against me.
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	And so an army will come
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	from far away
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	to surround Jerusalem
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	and the towns of Judah.
JER.4.16+JER.4.17	I, the 
JER.4.18	“People of Judah,
JER.4.18	your hearts will be in pain,
JER.4.18	but it's your own fault
JER.4.18	that you will be punished.”
JER.4.19	I can't stand the pain!
JER.4.19	My heart pounds,
JER.4.19	as I twist and turn in agony.
JER.4.19	I hear the signal trumpet
JER.4.19	and the battle cry of the enemy,
JER.4.19	and I cannot be silent.
JER.4.20	I see the enemy defeating us
JER.4.20	time after time,
JER.4.20	leaving everything in ruins.
JER.4.20	Even my own home
JER.4.20	is destroyed in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long will I see enemy flags
JER.4.21	and hear their trumpets?
JER.4.22	I heard the 
JER.4.22	“My people ignore me.
JER.4.22	They are foolish children
JER.4.22	who do not understand
JER.4.22	that they will be punished.
JER.4.22	All they know is how to sin.”
JER.4.23	After this, I looked around.
JER.4.23	The earth was barren,
JER.4.23	with no form of life.
JER.4.23	The sun, moon, and stars
JER.4.23	had disappeared.
JER.4.24	The mountains were shaking;
JER.4.25	no people could be seen,
JER.4.25	and all the birds
JER.4.25	had flown away.
JER.4.26	Farmland had become a desert,
JER.4.26	and towns were in ruins.
JER.4.26	The 
JER.4.26	had done all of this.
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	The 
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	I have made my decision,
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	and I won't change my mind.
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	This land will be destroyed,
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	although not completely.
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	The sky will turn dark,
JER.4.27+JER.4.28	and the earth will mourn.
JER.4.29	Enemy cavalry and archers
JER.4.29	shout their battle cry.
JER.4.29	People run for their lives
JER.4.29	and try to find safety
JER.4.29	among trees and rocks.
JER.4.29	Every town is empty.
JER.4.30	Jerusalem, your land
JER.4.30	has been wiped out.
JER.4.30	But you act like a prostitute
JER.4.30	and try to win back your lovers,
JER.4.30	who now hate you.
JER.4.30	You can put on a red dress,
JER.4.30	gold jewelry, and eye shadow,
JER.4.30	but it's no use—
JER.4.30	your lovers are out to kill you!
JER.4.31	I heard groaning and crying.
JER.4.31	Was it a woman giving birth
JER.4.31	to her first child?
JER.4.31	No, it was Jerusalem,
JER.4.31	gasping for breath
JER.4.31	and begging for help.
JER.4.31	“I'm dying!” she said.
JER.4.31	“They have murdered me.”
JER.5.1	“Search Jerusalem
JER.5.1	for honest people
JER.5.1	who try to be faithful.
JER.5.1	If you can find even one,
JER.5.1	I'll forgive the whole city.
JER.5.2	Everyone breaks promises
JER.5.2	made in my name.”
JER.5.3	I answered, “I know
JER.5.3	that you look for truth.
JER.5.3	You punished your people
JER.5.3	for their lies,
JER.5.3	but in spite of the pain,
JER.5.3	they became more stubborn
JER.5.3	and refused to turn back
JER.5.3	to you.”
JER.5.4	Then I thought to myself,
JER.5.4	“These common people
JER.5.4	act like fools,
JER.5.4	and they have never learned
JER.5.4	what the 
JER.5.4	demands of them.
JER.5.5	So I'll go and talk to the leaders.
JER.5.5	They know what God demands.”
JER.5.5	But even they had decided
JER.5.5	not to obey the 
JER.5.6	The people have rebelled
JER.5.6	and rejected the 
JER.5.6	too many times.
JER.5.6	So enemies will attack
JER.5.6	like lions from the forest
JER.5.6	or wolves from the desert.
JER.5.6	Those enemies will watch
JER.5.6	the towns of Judah,
JER.5.6	and like leopards
JER.5.6	they will tear to pieces
JER.5.6	whoever goes outside.
JER.5.7	People of Judah,
JER.5.7	how can I forgive you?
JER.5.7	I gave you everything,
JER.5.7	but you abandoned me
JER.5.7	and worshiped idols.
JER.5.7	You men go to prostitutes
JER.5.7	and are unfaithful
JER.5.7	to your wives.
JER.5.8	You are no better than animals,
JER.5.8	and you always want sex
JER.5.8	with someone else's wife.
JER.5.9	Why shouldn't I punish
JER.5.9	the people of Judah?
JER.5.10	I will tell their enemies,
JER.5.10	“Go through my vineyard.
JER.5.10	Don't destroy the vines,
JER.5.10	but cut off the branches,
JER.5.10	because they are the people
JER.5.10	who don't belong to me.”
JER.5.11	In every way, Judah and Israel
JER.5.11	have been unfaithful to me.
JER.5.11	* 
JER.5.12	Their prophets lie and say,
JER.5.12	“The 
JER.5.12	We will have peace
JER.5.12	and plenty of food.”
JER.5.13	They tell these lies in my name,
JER.5.13	so now they will be killed in war
JER.5.13	or starve to death.
JER.5.14	I am the 
JER.5.14	Jeremiah, I will tell you
JER.5.14	exactly what to say.
JER.5.14	Your words will be a fire;
JER.5.14	Israel and Judah
JER.5.14	will be the fuel.
JER.5.15	People of Israel,
JER.5.15	I have made my decision.
JER.5.15	An army from a distant country
JER.5.15	will attack you.
JER.5.15	I've chosen an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	and you won't understand
JER.5.15	their language.
JER.5.16	All of them are warriors,
JER.5.16	and their arrows bring death.
JER.5.17	This nation will eat your crops
JER.5.17	and livestock;
JER.5.17	they will leave no fruit
JER.5.17	on your vines or fig trees.
JER.5.17	And although you feel safe
JER.5.17	behind thick walls,
JER.5.17	your towns will be destroyed
JER.5.17	and your children killed.
JER.5.18	The 
JER.5.18	Jeremiah, the enemy army won't kill everyone in Judah. 
JER.5.19	And the people who survive will ask, “Why did the 
JER.5.19	I am the 
JER.5.19	but you abandoned me
JER.5.19	and worshiped other gods
JER.5.19	in your own land.
JER.5.19	Now you will be slaves
JER.5.19	in a foreign country.
JER.5.20	Tell these things to each other,
JER.5.20	you people of Judah,
JER.5.20	you descendants of Jacob.
JER.5.21	when I speak?
JER.5.21	Why can't you understand
JER.5.22	with fear and trembling?
JER.5.22	I'm the one who made the shore
JER.5.22	to hold back the ocean.
JER.5.22	Waves may crash on the beach,
JER.5.22	but they can come no farther.
JER.5.23	You stubborn people have rebelled
JER.5.23	and turned your backs on me.
JER.5.24	You refuse to say,
JER.5.24	“Let's worship the 
JER.5.24	He's the one who sends rain
JER.5.24	in spring and autumn
JER.5.24	and gives us a good harvest.”
JER.5.25	That's why I cannot bless you!
JER.5.25	* 
JER.5.26	A hunter traps birds
JER.5.26	and puts them in a cage,
JER.5.26	but some of you trap humans
JER.5.26	and make them your slaves.
JER.5.27	You are evil, and you lie and cheat
JER.5.27	to make yourselves rich.
JER.5.27	You are powerful
JER.5.28	and prosperous,
JER.5.28	but you refuse to help
JER.5.28	get the justice they deserve.
JER.5.29	You need to be punished,
JER.5.29	and so I will take revenge.
JER.5.30	Look at the terrible things
JER.5.30	going on in this country.
JER.5.30	I am shocked!
JER.5.31	Prophets give their messages
JER.5.31	in the name of a false god,
JER.5.31	my priests don't want
JER.5.31	to serve me,
JER.5.31	and you—my own people—
JER.5.31	like it this way!
JER.5.31	But on the day of disaster,
JER.5.31	where will you turn for help?
JER.6.1	Run for your lives,
JER.6.1	people of Benjamin.
JER.6.1	Get out of Jerusalem.
JER.6.1	Sound a trumpet in Tekoa
JER.6.1	and light a signal fire
JER.6.1	in Beth-Haccherem.
JER.6.1	Soon you will be struck
JER.6.1	by disaster from the north.
JER.6.2	Jerusalem is a lovely pasture,
JER.6.3	but shepherds will surround it
JER.6.3	and divided up,
JER.6.3	then let their flocks
JER.6.3	eat all the grass.
JER.6.4	Kings will tell their troops,
JER.6.4	“If we reach Jerusalem
JER.6.4	in the morning,
JER.6.4	we'll attack at noon.
JER.6.4	But if we arrive later,
JER.6.5	we'll attack after dark
JER.6.5	and destroy its fortresses.”
JER.6.6	I am the 
JER.6.6	and I will command these armies
JER.6.6	to chop down trees
JER.6.6	and build a ramp up to the walls
JER.6.6	of Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	People of Jerusalem,
JER.6.6	I must punish you
JER.6.6	for your injustice.
JER.6.7	Evil pours from your city
JER.6.7	like water from a spring.
JER.6.7	Sounds of injustice and violence
JER.6.7	echo within your walls;
JER.6.7	victims are everywhere,
JER.6.7	wounded and dying.
JER.6.8	Listen to me,
JER.6.8	you people of Jerusalem
JER.6.8	and Judah.
JER.6.8	I will abandon you,
JER.6.8	and your land will become
JER.6.8	an empty desert.
JER.6.9	I will tell your enemies
JER.6.9	to leave your nation bare
JER.6.9	like a vine stripped of grapes.
JER.6.9	I, the 
JER.6.9	have spoken.
JER.6.10	I have told the people
JER.6.10	that you, 
JER.6.10	will punish them,
JER.6.10	but they just laugh
JER.6.10	and refuse to listen.
JER.6.11	Your anger against Judah
JER.6.11	flames up inside me,
JER.6.11	and I can't hold it in
JER.6.11	much longer.
JER.6.11	Don't hold back my anger!
JER.6.11	Let it sweep away everyone—
JER.6.11	the children at play
JER.6.11	and all adults,
JER.6.11	young and old alike.
JER.6.12	and give to others
JER.6.12	their houses and fields,
JER.6.12	as well as their wives.
JER.6.12	I, the 
JER.6.13	Everyone is greedy and dishonest,
JER.6.13	whether poor or rich.
JER.6.13	Even the prophets and priests
JER.6.13	cannot be trusted.
JER.6.14	to my deeply wounded people
JER.6.14	are empty hopes for peace.
JER.6.15	They should be ashamed
JER.6.15	of their disgusting sins,
JER.6.15	but they don't even blush.
JER.6.15	And so, when I punish Judah,
JER.6.15	they will end up on the ground,
JER.6.15	dead like everyone else.
JER.6.15	I, the 
JER.6.16	The 
JER.6.16	My people, when you stood
JER.6.16	at the crossroads,
JER.6.16	I told you, “Follow the road
JER.6.16	your ancestors took,
JER.6.16	and you will find peace.”
JER.6.16	But you refused.
JER.6.17	I also sent prophets
JER.6.17	to warn you of danger,
JER.6.17	but when they sounded the alarm,
JER.6.17	you paid no attention.
JER.6.18	So I tell all nations on earth,
JER.6.18	“Watch what I will do!
JER.6.19	My people ignored me
JER.6.19	and rejected my laws.
JER.6.19	They planned to do evil,
JER.6.19	and now the evil they planned
JER.6.19	will happen to them.”
JER.6.20	People of Judah,
JER.6.20	you bring me incense from Sheba
JER.6.20	and spices from distant lands.
JER.6.20	You offer sacrifices of all kinds.
JER.6.20	But why bother?
JER.6.20	I hate these gifts of yours!
JER.6.21	So I will put stumbling blocks
JER.6.21	in your path,
JER.6.21	and everyone will die,
JER.6.21	including parents and children,
JER.6.21	neighbors and friends.
JER.6.22	The 
JER.6.22	“Look toward the north,
JER.6.22	where a powerful nation
JER.6.22	has prepared for war.
JER.6.23	Its well-armed troops are cruel
JER.6.23	and never show mercy.
JER.6.23	Their galloping horses sound
JER.6.23	like ocean waves
JER.6.23	pounding on the shore.
JER.6.23	This army will attack you,
JER.6.23	lovely Jerusalem.”
JER.6.24	Then the people said,
JER.6.24	“Just hearing about them
JER.6.24	makes us tremble with fear,
JER.6.24	and we twist and turn in pain
JER.6.24	like a woman giving birth.”
JER.6.25	The 
JER.6.25	“Don't work in your fields
JER.6.25	or walk along the roads.
JER.6.25	It's too dangerous.
JER.6.25	The enemy is well armed
JER.6.26	and attacks without warning.
JER.6.26	So mourn, my people, as though
JER.6.26	your only child had died.
JER.6.26	Wear clothes made of sackcloth
JER.6.26	and roll in the ash pile.”
JER.6.27	Jeremiah, test my people
JER.6.27	as though they were metal.
JER.6.28	And you'll find they are hard
JER.6.28	like bronze and iron.
JER.6.28	They are stubborn rebels,
JER.6.28	always spreading lies.
JER.6.28	* 
JER.6.29+JER.6.30	Silver can be purified
JER.6.29+JER.6.30	in a fiery furnace,
JER.6.29+JER.6.30	but my people are too wicked
JER.6.29+JER.6.30	to be made pure,
JER.6.29+JER.6.30	and so I have rejected them.
JER.7.1+JER.7.2+JER.7.3	The 
JER.7.1+JER.7.2+JER.7.3	Pay attention, people of Judah! Change your ways and start living right, then I will let you keep on living in your own country.
JER.7.4	Don't fool yourselves! My temple is here in Jerusalem, but that doesn't mean I will protect you. 
JER.7.5	I will keep you safe only if you change your ways and are fair and honest with each other. 
JER.7.6	Stop taking advantage of foreigners, orphans, and widows. Don't kill innocent people. And stop worshiping other gods. 
JER.7.7	Then I will let you enjoy a long life in this land I gave your ancestors.
JER.7.8	But just look at what is happening! You put your trust in worthless lies. 
JER.7.9	You steal and murder; you lie in court and are unfaithful in marriage. You worship idols and offer incense to Baal, when these gods have never done anything for you. 
JER.7.10	And then you come into my temple and worship me! Do you think I will protect you so that you can go on sinning? 
JER.7.11	 You are thieves, and you have made my temple your hideout. But I've seen everything you have done.
JER.7.13	While you have been sinning, I have been trying to talk to you, but you refuse to listen. 
JER.7.14	Don't think this temple will protect you. Long ago I told your ancestors to build it and worship me here, but now I have decided to tear it down, just as I destroyed Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	And as for you, people of Judah, I'm going to send you away from my land, just as I sent away the people of Ephraim and the other northern tribes.
JER.7.16	Jeremiah, don't pray for these people! I, the 
JER.7.17	Do you see what the people of Judah are doing in their towns and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	 Children gather firewood, their fathers build fires, and their mothers mix dough to bake bread for the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven.
JER.7.19	But they are not only insulting me; they are also harming themselves by doing these shameful things.
JER.7.20	And now, I, the 
JER.7.21	The 
JER.7.21	I am the 
JER.7.22	At the time I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn't command them to offer sacrifices to me. 
JER.7.23	Instead, I told them, “If you listen to me and do what I tell you, I will be your God, you will be my people, and all will go well for you.” 
JER.7.24	But your ancestors refused to listen. They were stubborn, and whenever I wanted them to go one way, they always went the other. 
JER.7.25	Ever since your ancestors left Egypt, I have been sending my servants the prophets to speak for me. 
JER.7.26	But you have ignored me and become even more stubborn and sinful than your ancestors ever were!
JER.7.27	Jeremiah, no matter what you do, the people won't listen. 
JER.7.28	So you must say to them:
JER.7.28	People of Judah, I am the 
JER.7.29	Shave your head bald
JER.7.29	and throw away the hair.
JER.7.29	Sing a funeral song
JER.7.29	on top of a barren hill.
JER.7.29	You people have made me angry,
JER.7.29	and I have abandoned you.
JER.7.30	You have disobeyed me by putting your disgusting idols in my temple, and now the temple itself is disgusting to me. 
JER.7.31	 At Topheth in Hinnom Valley you have built altars where you kill your children and burn them as sacrifices to other gods. I would never think of telling you to do this. 
JER.7.32	So watch out! Someday that place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley. It will be called Slaughter Valley, because you will bury your dead there until you run out of room, 
JER.7.33	and then bodies will lie scattered on the ground. Birds and wild animals will come and eat, and no one will be around to scare them off. 
JER.7.34	 When I am finished with your land, there will be deathly silence in the empty ruins of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah—no happy voices, no sounds of parties or wedding celebrations.
JER.8.1	Then the bones of the dead kings of Judah and their officials will be dug up, along with the bones of the priests, the prophets, and everyone else in Jerusalem 
JER.8.2	who loved and worshiped the sun, moon, and stars. These bones will be scattered and left lying on the ground like trash, where the sun and moon and stars can shine on them.
JER.8.3	Some of you people of Judah will be left alive, but I will force you to go to foreign countries, and you will wish you were dead. I, the 
JER.8.4	The 
JER.8.4	People of Jerusalem,
JER.8.4	when you stumble and fall,
JER.8.4	you get back up,
JER.8.4	and if you take a wrong road,
JER.8.4	you turn around and go back.
JER.8.5	So why do you refuse
JER.8.5	to come back to me?
JER.8.5	Why do you hold so tightly
JER.8.5	to your false gods?
JER.8.6	I listen carefully,
JER.8.6	but none of you admit
JER.8.6	that you've done wrong.
JER.8.6	Without a second thought,
JER.8.6	you run down the wrong road
JER.8.6	like horses running blindly
JER.8.6	into battle.
JER.8.7	Storks, doves, swallows,
JER.8.7	and thrushes
JER.8.7	all know when it's time
JER.8.7	to fly away for the winter
JER.8.7	and when to come back.
JER.8.7	But you, my people,
JER.8.7	don't know what I demand.
JER.8.8	You say, “We are wise
JER.8.8	because we have the teachings
JER.8.8	and laws of the 
JER.8.8	But I say that your teachers
JER.8.8	have turned my words
JER.8.8	into lies!
JER.8.9	Your wise men
JER.8.9	have rejected what I say,
JER.8.9	and so they have no wisdom.
JER.8.9	Now they will be trapped
JER.8.9	and put to shame;
JER.8.9	they won't know what to do.
JER.8.10	to strangers.
JER.8.10	Everyone is greedy and dishonest,
JER.8.10	whether poor or rich.
JER.8.10	Even the prophets and priests
JER.8.10	cannot be trusted.
JER.8.11	to my deeply wounded people
JER.8.11	are empty hopes for peace.
JER.8.12	They should be ashamed
JER.8.12	of the way they live,
JER.8.12	but they don't even blush.
JER.8.12	And so, when I punish Judah,
JER.8.12	they will end up on the ground,
JER.8.12	dead like everyone else.
JER.8.13	I will wipe them out.
JER.8.13	They are vines without grapes;
JER.8.13	fig trees without figs or leaves.
JER.8.13	They have not done a thing
JER.8.13	that I told them!
JER.8.13	I, the 
JER.8.14	The people of Judah
JER.8.14	say to each other,
JER.8.14	“What are we waiting for?
JER.8.14	Let's run to a town with walls
JER.8.14	and die there.
JER.8.14	We rebelled against the 
JER.8.14	and we were sentenced to die
JER.8.14	by drinking poison.
JER.8.15	We had hoped for peace
JER.8.15	and a time of healing,
JER.8.15	but all we got was terror.
JER.8.16	Our enemies have reached
JER.8.16	the town of Dan in the north,
JER.8.16	and the snorting of their horses
JER.8.16	makes us tremble with fear.
JER.8.16	The enemy will destroy Jerusalem
JER.8.16	and our entire nation.
JER.8.16	No one will survive.”
JER.8.17	“Watch out!” the 
JER.8.17	“I'm sending poisonous snakes
JER.8.17	to attack you,
JER.8.17	and no one can stop them.”
JER.8.18	I'm burdened with sorrow
JER.8.18	and feel like giving up.
JER.8.19	In a foreign land
JER.8.19	my people are crying.
JER.8.19	Listen! You'll hear them say,
JER.8.19	“Has the 
JER.8.19	Is he no longer its king?”
JER.8.19	I hear the 
JER.8.19	“Why did you make me angry
JER.8.19	by worshiping useless idols?”
JER.8.20	The people complain,
JER.8.20	“Spring and summer
JER.8.20	have come and gone,
JER.8.20	but still the 
JER.8.20	hasn't rescued us.”
JER.8.21	My people are crushed,
JER.8.21	and so is my heart.
JER.8.21	I am horrified and mourn.
JER.8.22	If medicine and doctors
JER.8.22	may be found in Gilead,
JER.8.22	why aren't my people healed?
JER.9.1	I wish that my eyes
JER.9.1	were fountains of tears,
JER.9.1	so I could cry day and night
JER.9.1	for my people
JER.9.1	who were killed.
JER.9.2	I wish I could go into the desert
JER.9.2	and find a hiding place
JER.9.2	from all who are treacherous
JER.9.2	and unfaithful to God.
JER.9.3	The 
JER.9.3	Lies come from the mouths
JER.9.3	of my people,
JER.9.3	like arrows from a bow.
JER.9.3	With each dishonest deed
JER.9.3	their power increases,
JER.9.3	and not one of them will admit
JER.9.3	that I am God.
JER.9.4	Jeremiah, all your friends
JER.9.4	and relatives
JER.9.4	tell lies about you,
JER.9.4	so don't trust them.
JER.9.5	They wear themselves out,
JER.9.5	always looking for a new way
JER.9.5	to cheat their friends.
JER.9.6	Everyone takes advantage
JER.9.6	of everyone else,
JER.9.6	and no one will admit
JER.9.6	that I am God.
JER.9.7	And so I will purify
JER.9.7	the hearts of my people
JER.9.7	just as gold is purified
JER.9.7	in a furnace.
JER.9.7	I have no other choice.
JER.9.8	They say they want peace,
JER.9.8	but this lie is deadly,
JER.9.8	like an arrow that strikes
JER.9.8	when you least expect it.
JER.9.9	Give me one good reason
JER.9.9	not to punish them
JER.9.9	as they deserve.
JER.9.9	I, the 
JER.9.9	have spoken.
JER.9.10	I weep for the pastureland
JER.9.10	in the hill country.
JER.9.10	It's so barren and scorched
JER.9.10	that no one travels there.
JER.9.10	No cattle can be found there,
JER.9.10	and birds and wild animals
JER.9.10	have all disappeared.
JER.9.11	I heard the 
JER.9.11	“When I am finished,
JER.9.11	Jerusalem and the towns of Judah
JER.9.11	will be piles of ruins
JER.9.11	where only jackals
JER.9.12	I said to the 
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.13	I destroyed the land because the people disobeyed me and rejected my laws and teachings. 
JER.9.14	They were stubborn and worshiped Baal,
JER.9.15	So I, the 
JER.9.16	I'll scatter them in foreign countries that they and their ancestors have never even heard of. Finally, I will send enemy soldiers to kill every last one of them.
JER.9.17	The 
JER.9.17	“Make arrangements now
JER.9.17	for the women who are paid
JER.9.17	to weep at funerals,
JER.9.17	especially the women
JER.9.17	who can cry the loudest.”
JER.9.18	The people answered,
JER.9.18	“Let them come quickly
JER.9.18	and cry for us,
JER.9.18	until our own eyes
JER.9.18	are flooded with tears.
JER.9.19	Now those of us on Zion cry,
JER.9.19	‘We are ruined!
JER.9.19	We can't stand the shame.
JER.9.19	Our homes have been destroyed,
JER.9.19	and we must leave our land.’
JER.9.20	“We ask you women
JER.9.20	to pay attention
JER.9.20	to what the 
JER.9.20	We will teach you a funeral song
JER.9.20	that you can teach
JER.9.20	your daughters and friends:
JER.9.21	‘We were in our fortress,
JER.9.21	but death sneaked in
JER.9.21	through our windows.
JER.9.21	It even struck down
JER.9.21	children at play
JER.9.21	and our strongest young men.’
JER.9.22	“The 
JER.9.22	the ground will be covered
JER.9.22	with dead bodies,
JER.9.22	like ungathered stalks of grain
JER.9.22	or manure in a field.”
JER.9.23	The 
JER.9.23	Don't brag about your wisdom
JER.9.23	or strength or wealth.
JER.9.24	then have enough sense
JER.9.24	to brag about worshiping me,
JER.9.24	the 
JER.9.24	What I like best
JER.9.24	is showing kindness,
JER.9.24	justice, and mercy
JER.9.24	to everyone on earth.
JER.9.25+JER.9.26	Someday I will punish the nations of Egypt, Edom, Ammon, and Moab, and the tribes of the desert.
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	The 
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	Listen to me,
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	you people of Israel.
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	Don't follow the customs
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	of those nations
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	who become frightened
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	when they see something strange
JER.10.1+JER.10.2	happen in the sky.
JER.10.3	Their religion is worthless!
JER.10.3	They chop down a tree,
JER.10.3	carve the wood into an idol,
JER.10.4	cover it with silver and gold,
JER.10.4	and then nail it down
JER.10.4	so it won't fall over.
JER.10.5	An idol is no better
JER.10.5	than a scarecrow.
JER.10.5	It can't speak,
JER.10.5	and it has to be carried,
JER.10.5	because it can't walk.
JER.10.5	Why worship an idol
JER.10.5	that can't help or harm you?
JER.10.6	Our 
JER.10.6	you alone are God.
JER.10.7	Everyone should worship you.
JER.10.7	No human anywhere on earth
JER.10.7	is wiser than you.
JER.10.8	Idols are worthless,
JER.10.8	and anyone who worships them
JER.10.8	is a fool!
JER.10.9	Idols are made by humans.
JER.10.9	A carver shapes the wood.
JER.10.9	A metalworker hammers out
JER.10.9	a covering of gold from Uphaz
JER.10.9	or of silver from Tarshish.
JER.10.9	Then the idol is dressed
JER.10.9	in blue and purple clothes.
JER.10.10	You, 
JER.10.10	and living God.
JER.10.10	You will rule for all time.
JER.10.10	When you are angry
JER.10.10	the earth shakes,
JER.10.10	and nations are destroyed.
JER.10.11	You told me to say
JER.10.11	that idols did not create
JER.10.11	the heavens and the earth,
JER.10.11	and that you, the 
JER.10.11	will destroy every idol.
JER.10.12	With your wisdom and power
JER.10.12	you created the earth
JER.10.12	and spread out the heavens.
JER.10.13	The waters in the heavens roar
JER.10.13	at your command.
JER.10.13	You make clouds appear—
JER.10.13	you send the winds
JER.10.13	from your storehouse
JER.10.13	and make lightning flash
JER.10.13	in the rain.
JER.10.14	People who make idols
JER.10.14	are so stupid!
JER.10.14	They will be disappointed,
JER.10.14	because their false gods
JER.10.14	are not alive.
JER.10.15	Idols are merely a joke,
JER.10.15	and when the time is right,
JER.10.15	they will be destroyed.
JER.10.16	But you, Israel's God,
JER.10.16	created all things,
JER.10.16	and you chose Israel
JER.10.16	to be your very own.
JER.10.16	Your name is the 
JER.10.16	All-Powerful.
JER.10.17	I said to the people of Judah,
JER.10.17	“Gather your things;
JER.10.17	you are surrounded.
JER.10.18	The 
JER.10.18	will lead to your capture,
JER.10.18	and he will throw you
JER.10.18	from this land
JER.10.18	like a rock from a sling.”
JER.10.19	The people answered,
JER.10.19	“We are wounded
JER.10.19	and doomed to die.
JER.10.19	Why did we say
JER.10.19	we could stand the pain?
JER.10.20	Our homes are destroyed;
JER.10.20	our children are dead.
JER.10.20	No one is left
JER.10.20	to help us find shelter.”
JER.10.21	But I told them,
JER.10.21	“Our leaders were stupid failures,
JER.10.21	because they refused
JER.10.21	to listen to the 
JER.10.21	And so we've been scattered
JER.10.21	like sheep.
JER.10.22	“Sounds of destruction
JER.10.22	rumble from the north
JER.10.22	like distant thunder.
JER.10.22	Soon our towns will be ruins
JER.10.22	where only jackals
JER.10.23	I know, 
JER.10.23	are not in control
JER.10.23	of our own lives.
JER.10.24	Correct me, as I deserve,
JER.10.24	but not in your anger,
JER.10.24	or I will be dead.
JER.10.25	Our enemies refuse
JER.10.25	to admit that you are God
JER.10.25	or to worship you.
JER.10.25	They have wiped out our people
JER.10.25	and left our nation
JER.10.25	lying in ruins.
JER.10.25	So get angry
JER.10.25	and sweep them away!
JER.11.1+JER.11.2+JER.11.3	The 
JER.11.1+JER.11.2+JER.11.3	I, the 
JER.11.4	My commands haven't changed since I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, a nation that seemed like a blazing furnace where iron ore is melted. I told your ancestors that if they obeyed my commands, I would be their God, and they would be my people. 
JER.11.5	Then I did what I had promised and gave them this wonderful land, where you now live.
JER.11.5	“Yes, 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.6	Pay attention to the commands in my agreement with you. 
JER.11.7	Ever since I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I have been telling your people to obey me. But you and your ancestors 
JER.11.8	have always been stubborn. You have refused to listen, and instead you have done whatever your sinful hearts have desired.
JER.11.8	You have not kept the agreement we made, so I will make you suffer every curse that goes with it.
JER.11.9	The 
JER.11.9	Jeremiah, the people of Judah and Jerusalem are plotting against me. 
JER.11.10	They have sinned in the same way their ancestors did, by turning from me and worshiping other gods. The northern kingdom of Israel broke the agreement I made with your ancestors, and now the southern kingdom of Judah
JER.11.11	Here is what I've decided to do. I will bring suffering on the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and no one will escape. They will beg me to help, but I won't listen to their prayers. 
JER.11.12+JER.11.13	Then they will offer sacrifices to their other gods and ask them for help. After all, the people of Judah have more gods than towns, and more shameful altars for Baal than there are streets in Jerusalem. But those gods won't be able to rescue the people of Judah from disaster.
JER.11.14	Jeremiah, don't pray for these people or beg me to rescue them. If you do, I won't listen, and I certainly won't listen if they pray!
JER.11.15	Then the 
JER.11.15	You are my chosen people,
JER.11.15	but you have no right
JER.11.15	to be here in my temple,
JER.11.15	doing such evil things.
JER.11.15	The sacrifices you offer me
JER.11.15	won't protect you from disaster,
JER.11.15	so stop celebrating.
JER.11.16	Once you were like an olive tree
JER.11.16	covered with fruit.
JER.11.16	But soon I will send a noisy mob
JER.11.16	to break off your branches
JER.11.16	and set you on fire.
JER.11.17	I am the 
JER.11.17	* 
JER.11.18	Some people plotted to kill me.
JER.11.18	And like a lamb
JER.11.18	being led to the butcher,
JER.11.18	I knew nothing
JER.11.18	about their plans.
JER.11.19	But then the 
JER.11.19	that they had planned
JER.11.19	to chop me down like a tree—
JER.11.19	fruit and all—
JER.11.19	so that no one would ever
JER.11.19	remember me again.
JER.11.20	you always do what is right,
JER.11.20	and you know every thought.
JER.11.20	So I trust you to help me
JER.11.20	and to take revenge.”
JER.11.21	Then the 
JER.11.21	Jeremiah, some men from Anathoth
JER.11.22	But I will punish them. Their young men will die in battle, and their children will starve to death. 
JER.11.23	And when I am finished, no one from their families will be left alive.
JER.12.1	Whenever I complain
JER.12.1	to you, 
JER.12.1	you are always fair.
JER.12.1	But now I have questions
JER.12.1	about your justice.
JER.12.1	Why is life easy for sinners?
JER.12.1	Why are they successful?
JER.12.2	You plant them like trees;
JER.12.2	you let them prosper
JER.12.2	and produce fruit.
JER.12.2	Yet even when they praise you,
JER.12.2	they don't mean it.
JER.12.3	But you know, 
JER.12.3	how faithful I've always been,
JER.12.3	even in my thoughts.
JER.12.3	So drag my enemies away
JER.12.3	and butcher them like sheep!
JER.12.4	How long will the ground be dry
JER.12.4	and the pasturelands parched?
JER.12.4	The birds and animals
JER.12.4	are dead and gone.
JER.12.4	And all of this happened because
JER.12.4	the people are so sinful.
JER.12.4	They even brag, “God can't see
JER.12.4	the sins we commit.”
JER.12.5	Jeremiah, if you get tired
JER.12.5	in a race against people,
JER.12.5	how can you possibly run
JER.12.5	against horses?
JER.12.5	If you fall in open fields,
JER.12.5	what will happen in the forest
JER.12.5	along the Jordan River?
JER.12.6	Even your own family
JER.12.6	has turned against you.
JER.12.6	They act friendly,
JER.12.6	but don't trust them.
JER.12.6	They're out to get you,
JER.12.6	and so is everyone else.
JER.12.7	I loved my people and chose them
JER.12.7	as my very own.
JER.12.7	But now I will reject them
JER.12.7	and hand them over
JER.12.7	to their enemies.
JER.12.8	My people have turned against me
JER.12.8	and roar at me like lions.
JER.12.8	That's why I hate them.
JER.12.9	My people are like a hawk
JER.12.9	surrounded and attacked
JER.12.9	by other hawks.
JER.12.9	Tell the wild animals
JER.12.9	to come and eat their fill.
JER.12.10	My beautiful land is ruined
JER.12.10	like a field or a vineyard
JER.12.10	trampled by shepherds
JER.12.10	and stripped bare
JER.12.10	by their flocks.
JER.12.11	Every field I see lies barren,
JER.12.11	and no one cares.
JER.12.12	A destroying army
JER.12.12	marches along desert roads
JER.12.12	and attacks everywhere.
JER.12.12	They are my deadly sword;
JER.12.12	no one is safe from them.
JER.12.13	My people, you planted wheat,
JER.12.13	but because I was furious,
JER.12.13	I let only weeds grow.
JER.12.13	You wore yourselves out
JER.12.13	and gained only shame!
JER.12.14	The 
JER.12.14	I gave this land to my people Israel, but enemies around it have attacked and robbed it. So I will uproot them from their own countries just as I will uproot Judah from its land. 
JER.12.15	But later, I will have pity on these nations and bring them back to their own lands. 
JER.12.16	They once taught my people to worship Baal. But if they admit I am the only true God, and if they let my people teach them how to worship me, these nations will also become my people. 
JER.12.17	However, if they don't listen to me, I will uproot them from their lands and completely destroy them. I, the 
JER.13.1	The 
JER.13.2	So I bought a pair of shorts and put them on.
JER.13.3	Then the 
JER.13.4	“Take off the shorts. Go to Parah
JER.13.5	And that's what I did.
JER.13.6	Some time later the 
JER.13.7	I went back and dug the shorts out of their hiding place, but the cloth had rotted, and the shorts were ruined.
JER.13.8	Then the 
JER.13.9	Jeremiah, I will use Babylonia to
JER.13.10	The people of Judah are evil and stubborn. So instead of listening to me, they do whatever they want and even worship other gods. When I am finished with these people, they will be good for nothing, just like this pair of shorts. 
JER.13.11	These shorts were tight around your waist, and that's how tightly I held onto the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. I wanted them to be my people. I wanted to make them famous, so that other nations would praise and honor me, but they refused to obey me.
JER.13.12	Jeremiah, tell the people of Judah, “The 
JER.13.12	They will answer, “Of course we fill our wine jars with wine! Why are you telling us something we already know?”
JER.13.13	Then say to them:
JER.13.13	I am the 
JER.13.14	Then I will smash them against each other like jars. I will have no pity on the young or the old, and they will all be destroyed. I, the 
JER.13.15	People of Judah,
JER.13.15	don't be too proud to listen
JER.13.15	to what the 
JER.13.16	You hope for light,
JER.13.16	but God is sending darkness.
JER.13.16	Evening shadows already deepen
JER.13.16	in the hills.
JER.13.16	So return to God
JER.13.16	and confess your sins to him
JER.13.16	before you trip and fall.
JER.13.17	If you are too proud to listen,
JER.13.17	I will weep alone.
JER.13.17	Tears will stream from my eyes
JER.13.17	when the 
JER.13.17	are taken away as prisoners.
JER.13.18	The 
JER.13.18	that your king and his mother
JER.13.18	must surrender their thrones
JER.13.18	and remove their crowns.
JER.13.19	The cities in the Southern Desert
JER.13.19	are surrounded;
JER.13.19	no one can get in or out.
JER.13.19	Everyone in Judah
JER.13.19	will be taken away.
JER.13.20	Jerusalem, you were so proud
JER.13.20	of ruling the people of Judah.
JER.13.20	But where are they now?
JER.13.20	Look north, and you will see
JER.13.20	your enemies approaching.
JER.13.21	You once trusted them to help,
JER.13.21	but now I'll let them rule you.
JER.13.21	What do you say about that?
JER.13.21	You will be in pain
JER.13.21	like a woman giving birth.
JER.13.22	Do you know why
JER.13.22	your clothes were torn off
JER.13.22	and you were abused?
JER.13.22	It was because
JER.13.22	of your terrible sins.
JER.13.23	Can you ever change
JER.13.23	and do what's right?
JER.13.23	Can people change the color
JER.13.23	of their skin,
JER.13.23	or can a leopard
JER.13.23	remove its spots?
JER.13.23	If so, then maybe you can change
JER.13.23	and learn to do right.
JER.13.24	I will scatter you,
JER.13.24	just as the desert wind
JER.13.24	blows husks from grain
JER.13.24	tossed in the air.
JER.13.25	I won't change my mind.
JER.13.25	I, the 
JER.13.25	You rejected me
JER.13.25	and worshiped false gods.
JER.13.25	* 
JER.13.26	You were married to me,
JER.13.26	but you were unfaithful.
JER.13.26	You even became a prostitute
JER.13.26	by worshiping disgusting gods
JER.13.26	on hilltops and in fields.
JER.13.27	So I'll rip off your clothes
JER.13.27	and leave you naked and ashamed
JER.13.27	for everyone to see.
JER.13.27	You are doomed!
JER.13.27	Will you ever be worthy
JER.13.27	to worship me again?
JER.14.1	When there had been no rain for a long time, the 
JER.14.2	Judah and Jerusalem weep
JER.14.2	as the land dries up.
JER.14.3	Rulers send their servants
JER.14.3	to the storage pits for water.
JER.14.3	But there's none to be found;
JER.14.3	they return in despair
JER.14.3	with their jars still empty.
JER.14.4	There has been no rain,
JER.14.4	and farmers feel sick
JER.14.4	as they watch cracks appear
JER.14.4	in the dry ground.
JER.14.5	A deer gives birth in a field,
JER.14.5	then abandons her newborn fawn
JER.14.5	and leaves in search of grass.
JER.14.6	Wild donkeys go blind
JER.14.6	from starvation.
JER.14.6	So they stand on barren hilltops
JER.14.6	and sniff the air,
JER.14.6	hoping to smell green grass.
JER.14.7	We rejected you and did evil,
JER.14.7	so we deserve to be punished.
JER.14.7	But if you rescue us, 
JER.14.7	everyone will see
JER.14.7	how great you are.
JER.14.8	You're our only hope;
JER.14.8	you alone can save us now.
JER.14.8	You help us one day,
JER.14.8	but you're gone the next.
JER.14.9	Did this disaster
JER.14.9	take you by surprise?
JER.14.9	Are you a warrior
JER.14.9	with your hands tied?
JER.14.9	You have chosen us,
JER.14.9	and your temple is here.
JER.14.9	Don't abandon us!
JER.14.10	My people,
JER.14.10	you love to wander away;
JER.14.10	you don't even try
JER.14.10	to stay close to me.
JER.14.10	So now I will reject you
JER.14.10	and punish you for your sins.
JER.14.10	I, the 
JER.14.11	The 
JER.14.12	They may even go without eating
JER.14.13	I replied, “The other prophets keep telling everyone that you won't send starvation or war, and that you're going to give us peace.”
JER.14.14	The 
JER.14.14	They claim to speak for me, but they're lying! I didn't even speak to them, much less choose them to be my prophets. Their messages come from worthless dreams, useless fortunetelling, and their own imaginations.
JER.14.15	Those lying prophets say there will be peace and plenty of food. But I say that those same prophets will die from war and hunger. 
JER.14.16	And everyone who listens to them will be killed, just as they deserve. Their dead bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, because their families will also be dead, and no one will be left to bury them.
JER.14.17	Jeremiah, go and tell the people how you feel about all this.
JER.14.17	So I told them:
JER.14.17	“Tears will flood my eyes
JER.14.17	both day and night,
JER.14.17	because my nation suffers
JER.14.17	from a deadly wound.
JER.14.18	In the fields I see the bodies
JER.14.18	of those killed in battle.
JER.14.18	And in the towns I see crowds
JER.14.18	dying of hunger.
JER.14.18	But the prophets and priests
JER.14.18	go about their business,
JER.14.18	without understanding
JER.14.18	what has happened.”
JER.14.19	Have you rejected Judah, 
JER.14.19	Do you hate Jerusalem?
JER.14.19	Why did you strike down Judah
JER.14.19	with a fatal wound?
JER.14.19	We had hoped for peace
JER.14.19	and a time of healing,
JER.14.19	but all we got was terror.
JER.14.20	We and our ancestors are guilty
JER.14.20	of rebelling against you.
JER.14.21	If you save us, it will show
JER.14.21	how great you are.
JER.14.21	Don't let our enemies
JER.14.21	disgrace your temple,
JER.14.21	your beautiful throne.
JER.14.21	Don't forget that you promised
JER.14.21	to rescue us.
JER.14.22	Idols can't send rain,
JER.14.22	and showers don't fall
JER.14.22	by themselves.
JER.14.22	Only you control the rain,
JER.14.22	so we put our trust in you,
JER.14.22	the 
JER.15.1	Even if Moses and Samuel were here, praying with you, I wouldn't change my mind. So send the people of Judah away. 
JER.15.2	 And when they ask where they are going, tell them that I, the 
JER.15.2	Some of you are going to die
JER.15.2	of horrible diseases.
JER.15.2	Others are going to die in war
JER.15.2	or from starvation.
JER.15.2	The rest will be led away
JER.15.2	to a foreign country.
JER.15.3	I will punish you
JER.15.3	in four different ways:
JER.15.3	You will be killed in war
JER.15.3	and your bodies dragged off
JER.15.3	by dogs,
JER.15.3	your flesh will be eaten by birds,
JER.15.3	and your bones will be chewed on
JER.15.3	by wild animals.
JER.15.4	because of the horrible things
JER.15.4	your King Manasseh
JER.15.4	And you will be disgusting
JER.15.4	to all nations on earth.
JER.15.5	People of Jerusalem,
JER.15.5	who will feel sorry for you?
JER.15.5	Will anyone bother
JER.15.5	to ask if you are well?
JER.15.6	My people, you abandoned me
JER.15.6	and walked away.
JER.15.6	I am tired of showing mercy;
JER.15.6	that's why I'll destroy you
JER.15.7	by scattering you like straw
JER.15.7	blown by the wind.
JER.15.7	I will punish you with sorrow
JER.15.7	and death,
JER.15.7	because you refuse
JER.15.7	to change your ways.
JER.15.8	There will be more widows
JER.15.8	in Judah
JER.15.8	than grains of sand on a beach.
JER.15.8	A surprise attack at noon!
JER.15.8	And the mothers in Jerusalem
JER.15.8	mourn for their children.
JER.15.9	A mother is in deep despair
JER.15.9	and struggles for breath.
JER.15.9	Her daylight has turned
JER.15.9	to darkness—
JER.15.9	she has suffered the loss
JER.15.9	of her seven sons.
JER.15.9	I will kill anyone who survives.
JER.15.9	I, the 
JER.15.10	I wish I had never been born!
JER.15.10	I'm always in trouble
JER.15.10	with everyone in Judah.
JER.15.10	I never lend or borrow money,
JER.15.10	but everyone curses me
JER.15.10	just the same.
JER.15.11	Then the 
JER.15.11	“I promise to protect you,
JER.15.11	and when disaster comes,
JER.15.11	even your enemies
JER.15.11	will beg you for help.”
JER.15.12	People of Judah,
JER.15.12	just as you can't break iron
JER.15.12	mixed with bronze,
JER.15.12	you can't defeat the enemies
JER.15.12	that will attack
JER.15.12	from the north.
JER.15.13	I will give them
JER.15.13	everything you own,
JER.15.13	because you have sinned
JER.15.13	everywhere in your country.
JER.15.14	My anger is a fire
JER.15.14	that cannot be put out,
JER.15.14	so I will make you slaves
JER.15.14	of your enemies
JER.15.14	in a foreign land.
JER.15.15	You can see how I suffer
JER.15.15	insult after insult,
JER.15.15	all because of you, 
JER.15.15	Don't be so patient
JER.15.15	with my enemies;
JER.15.15	take revenge on them
JER.15.15	before they kill me.
JER.15.16	When you spoke to me,
JER.15.16	I was glad to obey,
JER.15.16	because I belong to you,
JER.15.16	the 
JER.15.17	I don't go to parties
JER.15.17	and have a good time.
JER.15.17	Instead, I keep to myself,
JER.15.17	because you have filled me
JER.15.17	with your anger.
JER.15.18	I am badly injured
JER.15.18	and in constant pain.
JER.15.18	Are you going to disappoint me,
JER.15.18	like a stream that goes dry
JER.15.18	in the heat of summer?
JER.15.19	Then the 
JER.15.19	Stop talking like a fool!
JER.15.19	If you turn back to me
JER.15.19	and speak my message,
JER.15.19	I will let you be my prophet
JER.15.19	once again.
JER.15.19	I hope the people of Judah
JER.15.19	will accept what you say.
JER.15.19	But you can ignore their threats,
JER.15.19	* 
JER.15.20	because I am making you strong,
JER.15.20	like a bronze wall.
JER.15.20	They are evil and violent,
JER.15.20	but when they attack,
JER.15.21	I will be there to rescue you.
JER.15.21	I, the 
JER.16.1	The 
JER.16.2	Jeremiah, don't get married and have children—Judah is no place to raise a family. 
JER.16.3	I'll tell you what's going to happen to children and their parents here. 
JER.16.4	They will die of horrible diseases and of war and starvation. No one will give them a funeral or bury them, and their bodies will be food for the birds and wild animals. And what's left will lie on the ground like manure.
JER.16.5	When someone dies, don't visit the family or show any sorrow. I will no longer love or bless or have any pity on the people of Judah. 
JER.16.6	Rich and poor alike will die and be left unburied. No one will mourn and show their sorrow by cutting themselves or shaving their heads.
JER.16.7	No one will bring food and wine to help comfort those who are mourning the death of their father or mother.
JER.16.8	Don't even set foot in a house where there is eating and drinking and celebrating. 
JER.16.9	 Warn the people of Judah that I, the 
JER.16.10	They will ask, “Why has the 
JER.16.11	Then tell them I have said:
JER.16.11	People of Judah, your ancestors turned away from me; they rejected my laws and teachings and started worshiping other gods. 
JER.16.12	And you have done even worse! You are stubborn, and instead of obeying me, you do whatever evil comes to your mind. 
JER.16.13	So I will throw you into a land that you and your ancestors know nothing about, a place where you will have to worship other gods both day and night. And I won't feel the least bit sorry for you.
JER.16.14	A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living 
JER.16.15	Instead, you will call me the Living 
JER.16.15	Someday I will bring you back to this land that I gave your ancestors. 
JER.16.16	But for now, I am sending enemies who will catch you like fish and hunt you down like wild animals in the hills and the caves.
JER.16.17	I can see everything you are doing, even if you try to hide your sins from me. 
JER.16.18	I will punish you double for your sins, because you have polluted my own land. You have filled it with lifeless idols that remind me of dead bodies.
JER.16.19	Our 
JER.16.19	who gives me strength
JER.16.19	and protects me like a fortress
JER.16.19	when I am in trouble.
JER.16.19	People will come to you
JER.16.19	from distant nations and say,
JER.16.19	“Our ancestors worshiped
JER.16.19	false and useless gods,
JER.16.20	worthless idols
JER.16.20	made by human hands.”
JER.16.21	Then the 
JER.16.21	“That's why I will teach them
JER.16.21	about my power,
JER.16.21	and they will know that I
JER.16.21	truly am the 
JER.17.1	People of Judah,
JER.17.1	your sins cannot be erased.
JER.17.1	They are written on your hearts
JER.17.1	like words chiseled in stone
JER.17.1	or carved on the corners
JER.17.1	of your altars.
JER.17.1	* 
JER.17.2	One generation after another
JER.17.2	has set up pagan altars
JER.17.2	and worshiped the goddess Asherah
JER.17.2	everywhere in your country—
JER.17.2	on hills and mountains,
JER.17.2	and under large trees.
JER.17.3	So I'll take everything you own,
JER.17.3	including your altars,
JER.17.3	and give it all
JER.17.3	to your enemies.
JER.17.4	You will lose
JER.17.4	that I gave you,
JER.17.4	and I will make you slaves
JER.17.4	in a foreign country,
JER.17.4	because you have made my anger
JER.17.4	blaze up like a fire
JER.17.4	that won't stop burning.
JER.17.5	I, the 
JER.17.5	on those who turn from me
JER.17.5	and trust in human strength.
JER.17.6	They will dry up like a bush
JER.17.6	in salty desert soil,
JER.17.6	where nothing can grow.
JER.17.7	But I will bless those
JER.17.7	who trust me, the 
JER.17.8	growing beside a stream—
JER.17.8	trees with roots that reach
JER.17.8	down to the water,
JER.17.8	and with leaves
JER.17.8	that are always green.
JER.17.8	They bear fruit every year
JER.17.8	and are never worried
JER.17.8	by a lack of rain.
JER.17.9	You people of Judah
JER.17.9	are so deceitful
JER.17.9	that you even fool yourselves,
JER.17.9	and you can't change.
JER.17.10	and your thoughts,
JER.17.10	and I will make sure
JER.17.10	you get what you deserve.
JER.17.11	You cheated others,
JER.17.11	but everything you gained
JER.17.11	will fly away, like birds
JER.17.11	hatched from stolen eggs.
JER.17.11	Then you will discover
JER.17.11	what fools you are.
JER.17.12	Our 
JER.17.12	is a glorious throne
JER.17.12	that has stood on a mountain
JER.17.12	from the beginning.
JER.17.13	You are a spring of water
JER.17.13	giving Israel life and hope.
JER.17.13	But if the people reject
JER.17.13	what you have told me,
JER.17.13	they will be swept away
JER.17.13	like words written in dust.
JER.17.14	You, 
JER.17.14	So heal me and rescue me!
JER.17.14	Then I will be completely well
JER.17.14	and perfectly safe.
JER.17.15	The people of Judah say to me,
JER.17.15	“Jeremiah, you claimed to tell us
JER.17.15	what the 
JER.17.15	So why hasn't it come true?”
JER.17.16	Our 
JER.17.16	to care for your people,
JER.17.16	and that's what I have done.
JER.17.16	You know everything I have said,
JER.17.16	and I have never once
JER.17.16	asked you to punish them.
JER.17.17	I trust you for protection
JER.17.17	in times of trouble,
JER.17.17	so don't frighten me.
JER.17.18	Keep me from failure
JER.17.18	and disgrace,
JER.17.18	but make my enemies fail
JER.17.18	and be disgraced.
JER.17.18	Send destruction to make
JER.17.18	their worst fears come true.
JER.17.19+JER.17.20	The 
JER.17.19+JER.17.20	Jeremiah, stand at each city gate in Jerusalem, including the one the king uses, and speak to him and everyone else. Tell them I have said:
JER.17.19+JER.17.20	I am the 
JER.17.21+JER.17.22+JER.17.23+JER.17.24	 If you value your lives, don't do any work on the Sabbath. Don't carry anything through the city gates or through the door of your house, or anywhere else. Keep the Sabbath day sacred!
JER.17.21+JER.17.22+JER.17.23+JER.17.24	I gave this command to your ancestors, but they were stubborn and refused to obey or to be corrected. But if you obey, 
JER.17.25	then Judah and Jerusalem will always be ruled by kings from David's family. The king and his officials will ride through these gates on horses or in chariots, and the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be with them. There will always be people living in Jerusalem, 
JER.17.26	and others will come here from the nearby villages, from the towns of Judah and Benjamin,
JER.17.27	But if you keep on carrying things through the city gates on the Sabbath and keep treating it as any other day, I will set fire to these gates and burn down the whole city, including the fortresses.
JER.18.1	The 
JER.18.2	“Jeremiah, go to the pottery shop, and when you get there, I will tell you what to say to the people.”
JER.18.3	I went there and saw the potter making clay pots on his pottery wheel. 
JER.18.4	And whenever the clay would not take the shape he wanted, he would change his mind and form it into some other shape.
JER.18.5	Then the 
JER.18.6	People of Israel, I, the 
JER.18.7	If I threaten to uproot and shatter an evil nation, 
JER.18.8	and that nation turns from its evil, I will change my mind.
JER.18.9	If I promise to make a nation strong, 
JER.18.10	but its people start disobeying me and doing evil, then I will change my mind and not help them at all.
JER.18.11	So listen to me, people of Judah and Jerusalem! I have decided to strike you with disaster, and I won't change my mind unless you stop sinning and start living right.
JER.18.12	But I know you won't listen. You might as well answer, “We don't care what you say. We have made plans to sin, and we are going to be stubborn and do as we please!”
JER.18.13	So I, the 
JER.18.14	The snow
JER.18.14	on Lebanon's mountains
JER.18.14	never melts away,
JER.18.14	and the streams there
JER.18.14	never run dry.
JER.18.15	But you, my people,
JER.18.15	have turned from me
JER.18.15	to burn incense
JER.18.15	to worthless idols.
JER.18.15	You have left the ancient road
JER.18.15	to follow an unknown path
JER.18.15	where you stumble over idols.
JER.18.16	Your land will be ruined,
JER.18.16	and every passerby
JER.18.16	will look at it with horror
JER.18.16	and make insulting remarks.
JER.18.17	When your enemies attack,
JER.18.17	I will scatter you like dust
JER.18.17	blown by an eastern wind.
JER.18.17	Then, on that day of disaster,
JER.18.17	I will turn my back on you.
JER.18.18	Some of the people said, “Let's get rid of Jeremiah! We will always have priests to teach us God's laws, as well as wise people to give us advice, and prophets to speak the 
JER.18.19	Please, 
JER.18.19	Make my enemies stop
JER.18.19	accusing me of evil.
JER.18.20	I tried to help them,
JER.18.20	but they are paying me back
JER.18.20	by digging a pit to trap me.
JER.18.20	I even begged you
JER.18.20	not to punish them.
JER.18.21	But now I am asking you
JER.18.21	to let their children starve
JER.18.21	or be killed in war.
JER.18.21	Let women lose
JER.18.21	their husbands and sons
JER.18.21	to disease and violence.
JER.18.22	These people have dug pits
JER.18.22	and set traps for me, 
JER.18.22	Make them scream in fear
JER.18.22	when you send enemy troops
JER.18.22	to attack their homes.
JER.18.23	You know they plan to kill me.
JER.18.23	So get angry and punish them!
JER.18.23	Don't ever forgive
JER.18.23	their terrible crimes.
JER.19.1	The 
JER.19.1	Jeremiah, go to the pottery shop and buy a clay jar. Then take along some of the city officials and leading priests 
JER.19.2	 and go to Hinnom Valley, just outside Potsherd
JER.19.3	I am the 
JER.19.4+JER.19.5	 The people of Judah stopped worshiping me and made this valley into a place of worship for Baal and other gods that have never helped them or their ancestors or their kings. And they have committed murder here, burning their young, innocent children as sacrifices to Baal. I have never even thought of telling you to do that. 
JER.19.6	So watch out! Someday this place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley. It will be called Slaughter Valley!
JER.19.7	You people of Judah and Jerusalem may have big plans, but here in this valley I'll ruin
JER.19.8	I will turn Jerusalem into a pile of rubble, and every passerby will be shocked and horrified and will make insulting remarks. 
JER.19.9	And while your enemies are trying to break through your city walls to kill you, the food supply will run out. You will become so hungry that you will eat the flesh of your friends and even of your own children.
JER.19.10	Jeremiah, as soon as you have said this, smash the jar while the people are watching. 
JER.19.11	Then tell them that I have also said:
JER.19.11	I am the 
JER.19.12+JER.19.13	I will make Jerusalem as unclean as Topheth, by filling the city with your dead bodies. I will do this because you and your kings have gone up to the roofs of your houses and burned incense to the stars in the sky, as though they were gods. And you have given sacrifices of wine to foreign gods.
JER.19.14	I went to Topheth, where I told the people what the 
JER.19.15	“Listen, everyone! Some time ago, the 
JER.20.1	Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the chief of temple security. He heard what I had said, 
JER.20.2	and so he hit me.
JER.20.3	The next day, when Pashhur let me go free, I told him that the 
JER.20.3	No longer will I call you Pashhur. Instead, I will call you Afraid-of-Everything.
JER.20.4	You will be afraid, and you will bring fear to your friends as well. You will see enemies kill them in battle. Then I will let the king of Babylonia take everyone in Judah prisoner, killing some and dragging the rest away to Babylonia. 
JER.20.5	He will clean out the royal treasury and take everything else of value from Jerusalem.
JER.20.6	Pashhur, you are guilty of telling lies and claiming they were messages from me. That's why I will let the Babylonians take you, your family, and your friends as prisoners to Babylonia, where you will all die and be buried.
JER.20.7	You tricked me, 
JER.20.7	and I was really fooled.
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I am,
JER.20.7	and you have defeated me.
JER.20.7	People never stop sneering
JER.20.7	and insulting me.
JER.20.8	You have let me announce
JER.20.8	only injustice and death.
JER.20.8	Your message has brought me
JER.20.8	nothing but insults
JER.20.8	and trouble.
JER.20.9	Sometimes I tell myself
JER.20.9	not to think about you, 
JER.20.9	or even mention your name.
JER.20.9	But your message burns
JER.20.9	in my heart and bones,
JER.20.9	and I cannot keep silent.
JER.20.10	I heard the crowds whisper,
JER.20.10	“Everyone is afraid.
JER.20.10	Now's our chance
JER.20.10	to accuse Jeremiah!”
JER.20.10	All of my so-called friends
JER.20.10	are just waiting
JER.20.10	for me to make a mistake.
JER.20.10	They say, “Maybe Jeremiah
JER.20.10	can be tricked.
JER.20.10	Then we can overpower him
JER.20.10	and get even at last.”
JER.20.11	But you, 
JER.20.11	are a mighty soldier,
JER.20.11	standing at my side.
JER.20.11	Those troublemakers
JER.20.11	will fall down and fail—
JER.20.11	terribly embarrassed,
JER.20.11	forever ashamed.
JER.20.12	you test those who do right,
JER.20.12	and you know every heart
JER.20.12	and mind.
JER.20.12	I have told you my complaints,
JER.20.12	so let me watch you
JER.20.12	take revenge on my enemies.
JER.20.13	I sing praises to you, 
JER.20.13	You rescue the oppressed
JER.20.13	from the wicked.
JER.20.14	Don't bless that day.
JER.20.15	Put a curse on the man
JER.20.15	who told my father, “Good news!
JER.20.15	You have a son.”
JER.20.16	May that man be like the towns
JER.20.16	you destroyed without pity.
JER.20.16	Let him hear shouts of alarm
JER.20.16	in the morning
JER.20.16	and battle cries at noon.
JER.20.17	He deserves to die
JER.20.17	for not killing me
JER.20.17	before I was born.
JER.20.17	Then my mother's body
JER.20.17	would have been my grave.
JER.20.18	Why did I have to be born?
JER.20.18	Was it just to suffer
JER.20.18	and die in shame?
JER.21.1	King Zedekiah
JER.21.1	So they came to me and said, 
JER.21.2	 “King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.21.3+JER.21.4+JER.21.5+JER.21.6+JER.21.7	I told them that the 
JER.21.3+JER.21.4+JER.21.5+JER.21.6+JER.21.7	The Babylonians have surrounded Jerusalem and want to kill you and your people. You are asking me to save you, but you have made me furious. So I will stretch out my mighty arm and fight against you myself. Your army is using spears and swords to fight the Babylonians, but I will make your own weapons turn and attack you. I will send a horrible disease to kill many of the people and animals in Jerusalem, and there will be nothing left to eat. Finally, I will let King Nebuchadnezzar and his army fight their way to the center of Jerusalem and capture everyone who is left alive, including you and your officials. But Nebuchadnezzar won't be kind or show any mercy—he will have you killed! I, the 
JER.21.8	People of Jerusalem, I, the 
JER.21.9	The Babylonian army has surrounded Jerusalem, so if you want to live, you must go out and surrender to them. But if you want to die because of hunger, disease, or war, then stay here in the city. 
JER.21.10	I have decided not to rescue Jerusalem. Instead, I am going to let the king of Babylonia burn it to the ground. I, the 
JER.21.10	* 
JER.21.11	Pay attention, you that belong
JER.21.11	to the royal family.
JER.21.12	Each new day, make sure
JER.21.12	that justice is done,
JER.21.12	and rescue those
JER.21.12	who are being robbed.
JER.21.12	Or else my anger will flame up
JER.21.12	like a fire that never goes out.
JER.21.13	Jerusalem,
JER.21.13	from your mountaintop
JER.21.13	you look out over the valleys
JER.21.13	and think you are safe.
JER.21.13	But I, the 
JER.21.14	and I will punish you
JER.21.14	as you deserve.
JER.21.14	I'll set your palace
JER.21.14	and everything around you
JER.21.14	will go up in smoke.
JER.22.1+JER.22.2+JER.22.3	The 
JER.22.1+JER.22.2+JER.22.3	I am the 
JER.22.4	If you obey me, the kings from David's family will continue to rule Judah from this palace. They and their officials will ride in and out on their horses or in their chariots. 
JER.22.5	 But if you ignore me, I promise in my own name that this palace will lie in ruins. 
JER.22.6	Listen to what I think about it:
JER.22.6	The palace of Judah's king
JER.22.6	is as glorious as Gilead
JER.22.6	or Lebanon's highest peaks.
JER.22.6	But it will be as empty
JER.22.6	as a ghost-town
JER.22.6	when I'm through with it.
JER.22.7	I'll send troops to tear it apart,
JER.22.7	and its beautiful cedar beams
JER.22.7	will be used for firewood.
JER.22.8	People from different nations will pass by and ask, “Why did the 
JER.22.9	Others will answer, “It's because the people worshiped foreign gods and broke the agreement that the 
JER.22.10	King Josiah is dead,
JER.22.10	so don't mourn for him.
JER.22.10	Instead, mourn for his son
JER.22.10	King Jehoahaz,
JER.22.10	dragged off to another country,
JER.22.10	never to return.
JER.22.11+JER.22.12	* 
JER.22.13	King Jehoiakim,
JER.22.13	You built a palace
JER.22.13	with large rooms upstairs.
JER.22.14	You put in big windows
JER.22.14	and used cedar paneling
JER.22.14	and red paint.
JER.22.14	But you were unfair
JER.22.14	and forced the builders to work
JER.22.14	without pay.
JER.22.14	* 
JER.22.15	More cedar in your palace
JER.22.15	doesn't make you a better king
JER.22.15	than your father Josiah.
JER.22.15	He always did right—
JER.22.15	he gave justice to the poor
JER.22.15	and was honest.
JER.22.16	That's what it means
JER.22.16	to truly know me.
JER.22.16	So he lived a comfortable life
JER.22.16	and always had enough
JER.22.16	to eat and drink.
JER.22.17	But all you think about
JER.22.17	is how to cheat
JER.22.17	or abuse or murder
JER.22.17	some innocent victim.
JER.22.18	at your funeral.
JER.22.18	They won't turn to each other
JER.22.18	and ask,
JER.22.18	“Why did our great king
JER.22.18	have to die?”
JER.22.19	You will be given a burial
JER.22.19	fit for a donkey;
JER.22.19	your body will be dragged
JER.22.19	outside the city gates
JER.22.19	and tossed in the dirt.
JER.22.19	I, the 
JER.22.20	People of Jerusalem,
JER.22.20	the nations
JER.22.20	have been crushed.
JER.22.20	Go to Lebanon and weep;
JER.22.20	cry in the land of Bashan
JER.22.20	and in Moab.
JER.22.21	When times were good,
JER.22.21	I warned you.
JER.22.21	But you ignored me,
JER.22.21	just as you have done
JER.22.21	since Israel was young.
JER.22.22	Now you will be disgraced
JER.22.22	because of your sins.
JER.22.22	Your leaders will be swept away
JER.22.22	by the wind,
JER.22.22	and the nations you trusted
JER.22.22	will be captured and dragged
JER.22.22	to a foreign country.
JER.22.23	Those who live in the palace
JER.22.23	paneled with cedar
JER.22.23	will groan with pain
JER.22.23	like women giving birth.
JER.22.25	I would hand you over to the enemy you fear, to King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.22.26	You and your mother
JER.22.27	longing to return home.
JER.22.28	Jehoiachin, you are unwanted
JER.22.28	like a broken clay pot.
JER.22.28	So you and your children
JER.22.28	will be thrown into a country
JER.22.28	you know nothing about.
JER.22.29	Land of Judah, I am the 
JER.22.29	Now listen to what I say!
JER.22.30	Erase the names
JER.22.30	of Jehoiachin's children
JER.22.30	from the royal records.
JER.22.30	He is a complete failure,
JER.22.30	and so none of them
JER.22.30	will ever be king.
JER.22.30	I, the 
JER.23.2	You were supposed to take care of my people, but instead you chased them away. So now I'll punish you severely and make you pay for your crimes!
JER.23.3	I will bring the rest of my people home from the lands where I have scattered them, and they will grow into a mighty nation. 
JER.23.4	I promise to choose leaders who will care for them like real shepherds. All of my people will be there, and they will never again be frightened.
JER.23.5	an honest king
JER.23.5	from the family of David,
JER.23.5	a king who will be wise
JER.23.5	and rule with justice.
JER.23.6	As long as he is king,
JER.23.6	Israel will have peace,
JER.23.6	and Judah will be safe.
JER.23.6	The name of this king will be
JER.23.6	“The 
JER.23.7	A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt. 
JER.23.8	Instead, you will call me the Living God who rescued you from the land in the north and from all the other countries where I had forced you to go. And you will once again live in your own land.
JER.23.9	When I think of the prophets,
JER.23.9	I am shocked, and I tremble
JER.23.9	like someone drunk,
JER.23.9	because of the 
JER.23.9	and his sacred words.
JER.23.10	Those unfaithful prophets
JER.23.10	misuse their power
JER.23.10	all over the country.
JER.23.10	So God turned the pasturelands
JER.23.10	into scorching deserts.
JER.23.11	The 
JER.23.11	You prophets and priests
JER.23.11	think so little of me, the 
JER.23.11	that you even sin
JER.23.11	in my own temple!
JER.23.12	Now I will punish you
JER.23.12	with disaster,
JER.23.12	and you will slip and fall
JER.23.12	in the darkness.
JER.23.12	I, the 
JER.23.13	The prophets in Samaria
JER.23.13	were repulsive to me,
JER.23.13	because they preached
JER.23.13	in the name of Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people astray.
JER.23.14	are even worse.
JER.23.14	You're unfaithful in marriage
JER.23.14	and never tell the truth.
JER.23.14	You even lead others to sin
JER.23.14	instead of helping them
JER.23.14	turn back to me.
JER.23.14	You and the people of Jerusalem
JER.23.14	are evil like Sodom
JER.23.14	and Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	You prophets in Jerusalem
JER.23.15	have spread evil everywhere.
JER.23.15	That's why I, the 
JER.23.15	to give you bitter poison
JER.23.15	to eat and drink.
JER.23.16	Don't listen to the lies
JER.23.16	of these false prophets,
JER.23.16	you people of Judah!
JER.23.16	The message they preach
JER.23.16	is something they imagined;
JER.23.16	it did not come from me,
JER.23.16	the 
JER.23.17	These prophets go to people
JER.23.17	who refuse to respect me
JER.23.17	and who are stubborn
JER.23.17	and do whatever they please.
JER.23.17	The prophets tell them,
JER.23.17	“The 
JER.23.17	everything will be fine.”
JER.23.18	But I, the 
JER.23.18	that these prophets
JER.23.18	have never attended a meeting
JER.23.18	of my council in heaven
JER.23.18	or heard me speak.
JER.23.19	They are evil! So in my anger
JER.23.19	I will strike them
JER.23.19	like a violent storm.
JER.23.20	I won't calm down,
JER.23.20	until I have finished
JER.23.20	what I have decided to do.
JER.23.20	Someday you will understand
JER.23.20	exactly what I mean.
JER.23.21	I did not send these prophets
JER.23.21	or speak to them,
JER.23.21	but they ran to find you
JER.23.21	and to preach their message.
JER.23.22	If they had been in a meeting
JER.23.22	of my council in heaven,
JER.23.22	they would have told
JER.23.22	you people of Judah
JER.23.22	to give up your sins
JER.23.22	and come back to me.
JER.23.23	I am everywhere—
JER.23.23	both near and far,
JER.23.24	There are no secret places
JER.23.24	where you can hide from me.
JER.23.25	These unfaithful prophets claim that I have given them a dream or a vision, and then they tell lies in my name. 
JER.23.26	But everything they say comes from their own twisted minds. How long can this go on? 
JER.23.27	They tell each other their dreams and try to get my people to reject me, just as their ancestors left me and worshiped Baal. 
JER.23.28	Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat. But when prophets speak for me, they must say only what I have told them. 
JER.23.29	My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks.
JER.23.30+JER.23.31+JER.23.32	These unfaithful prophets claim I give them their dreams, but it isn't true. I didn't choose them to be my prophets, and yet they babble on and on, speaking in my name, while stealing words from each other. And when my people hear these liars, they are led astray instead of being helped. So I warn you that I am now the enemy of these prophets. I, the 
JER.23.33	Jeremiah, when a prophet or a priest or anyone else comes to you and asks, “Does the 
JER.23.34	If any of you say, “Here is news from the 
JER.23.35	Instead, you must ask your friends and relatives, “What answer did the 
JER.23.36	It seems that you each have your own news! So if you say, “Here is news from the 
JER.23.37	If you go to a prophet, it's all right to ask, “What answer did the 
JER.23.38	But if you disobey me and say, “Here is news from the 
JER.23.39	I will pick you up
JER.23.40	You will never be free from your shame and disgrace.
JER.24.2	One basket was full of very good figs that ripened early, and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat.
JER.24.3	“Jeremiah,” the 
JER.24.3	“Figs,” I said. “Some are very good, but the others are too rotten to eat.”
JER.24.4	Then the 
JER.24.5	People of Judah, the good figs stand for those of you I sent away as exiles to Babylonia, 
JER.24.6	where I am watching over them. Then someday I will bring them back to this land. I will plant them, instead of uprooting them, and I will build them up, rather than tearing them down. 
JER.24.7	I will give them a desire to know me and to be my people. They will want me to be their God, and they will turn back to me with all their heart.
JER.24.8	The rotten figs stand for King Zedekiah
JER.24.9	I will punish them with a terrible disaster, and everyone on earth will tremble when they hear about it. I will force the people of Judah to go to foreign countries, where they will be cursed and insulted. 
JER.24.10	War and hunger and disease will strike them, until they finally disappear from the land that I gave them and their ancestors.
JER.25.3	For 23 years now, ever since the thirteenth year that Josiah
JER.25.4	The 
JER.25.5	They told you that the 
JER.25.5	Change your ways! If you stop doing evil, I will let you stay forever in this land that I gave your ancestors. 
JER.25.6	I don't want to harm you. So don't make me angry by worshiping idols and other gods.
JER.25.7	But you refused to listen to my prophets. So I, the 
JER.25.8	You refused to listen to me, 
JER.25.9	and now I will let you be attacked by nations from the north, and especially by my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. You and other nearby nations will be destroyed and left in ruins forever. Everyone who sees what has happened will be shocked, but they will still make fun of you. 
JER.25.10	 I will put an end to your parties and wedding celebrations; no one will grind grain or be here to light the lamps at night. 
JER.25.11	 This country will be as empty as a desert, because I will make all of you the slaves of the king of Babylonia for 70 years.
JER.25.12	When that time is up, I will punish the king of Babylonia and his people for everything they have done wrong, and I will turn that country into a wasteland forever. 
JER.25.13	My servant Jeremiah has told you what I said I will do to Babylonia and to the other nations, and he wrote it all down in this book. I will do everything I threatened. 
JER.25.14	I will pay back the Babylonians for every wrong they have done. Great kings from many other nations will conquer the Babylonians and force them to be slaves.
JER.25.15	The 
JER.25.16	They will vomit and act crazy, because of the war this cup of anger will bring to them.”
JER.25.17	I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	I started with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and the king and his officials were removed from power in disgrace. Everyone still makes insulting jokes about them and uses their names as curse words. 
JER.25.19	The second place I went was Egypt, where everyone had to drink from the cup, including the king and his officials, the other government workers, the rest of the Egyptians, 
JER.25.20	and all the foreigners who lived in the country.
JER.25.20	Next I went to the king of Uz, and then to the four kings of Philistia, who ruled from Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what was left of Ashdod.
JER.25.21	Then I went to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, 
JER.25.22	and to the kings of Tyre, Sidon, and their colonies across the sea. 
JER.25.23+JER.25.24	After this, I went to the kings of Dedan, Tema, Buz, the tribes of the Arabian Desert,
JER.25.25	Zimri, Elam, Media, 
JER.25.26	and the countries in the north, both near and far.
JER.25.26	I went to all the countries on earth, one after another, and finally to Babylonia.
JER.25.27	The 
JER.25.28	The 
JER.25.29	Starting with my own city of Jerusalem, everyone on earth will suffer from war. So there is no way I will let you escape unharmed.”
JER.25.30	The 
JER.25.30	From my sacred temple
JER.25.30	I will roar like thunder,
JER.25.30	while I trample my people
JER.25.30	and everyone else
JER.25.30	as though they were grapes.
JER.25.31	My voice will be heard
JER.25.31	everywhere on earth,
JER.25.31	accusing nations of their crimes
JER.25.31	and sentencing the guilty
JER.25.31	to death.
JER.25.32	The 
JER.25.32	You can see disaster spreading
JER.25.32	from far across the earth,
JER.25.32	from nation to nation
JER.25.32	like a horrible storm.
JER.25.33	When it strikes, I will kill so many people that their bodies will cover the ground like manure. No one will be left to bury them or to mourn.
JER.25.34	The 
JER.25.34	and you leaders
JER.25.34	were the shepherds.
JER.25.34	But now it's your turn
JER.25.34	to be butchered like sheep.
JER.25.34	You'll shatter like fine pottery
JER.25.34	dropped on the floor.
JER.25.34	So roll on the ground,
JER.25.34	crying and mourning.
JER.25.35	You have nowhere to run,
JER.25.35	nowhere to hide.
JER.25.35	* 
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	Listen to the cries
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	of the shepherds,
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	as the 
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	turns
JER.25.36+JER.25.37	into barren deserts.
JER.25.38	Like a lion leaving its den,
JER.25.38	the 
JER.25.38	his people
JER.25.38	to the destruction of war.
JER.26.2	Jeremiah, I have a message for everyone who comes from the towns of Judah to worship in my temple. Go to the temple courtyard and speak every word that I tell you. 
JER.26.3	Maybe the people will listen this time. And if they stop doing wrong, I will change my mind and not punish them for their sins. 
JER.26.4	Tell them that I have said:
JER.26.4	You have refused to listen to me and to obey my laws and teachings. 
JER.26.5	Again and again I have sent my servants the prophets to preach to you, but you ignored them as well. Now I am warning you that if you don't start obeying me at once, 
JER.26.6	 I will destroy this temple, just as I destroyed the town of Shiloh.
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets, and everyone else in the temple heard what I said, 
JER.26.8+JER.26.9	and as soon as I finished, they all crowded around me and started shouting, “Why did you preach that the 
JER.26.10	The royal officers heard what had happened, and they came from the palace to the new gate of the temple to be the judges at my trial.
JER.26.11	While they listened, the priests and the prophets said to the crowd, “All of you have heard Jeremiah prophesy that Jerusalem will be destroyed. He deserves the death penalty.”
JER.26.12+JER.26.13	Then I told the judges and everyone else:
JER.26.12+JER.26.13	The 
JER.26.14	You must decide what to do with me. Just do whatever you think is right. 
JER.26.15	But if you put me to death, you and everyone else in Jerusalem will be guilty of murdering an innocent man, because everything I preached came from the 
JER.26.16	The judges and the other people told the priests and prophets, “Since Jeremiah only told us what the 
JER.26.17	Then some of the leaders from other towns stepped forward. They told the crowd that 
JER.26.18	 years ago when Hezekiah
JER.26.18	“I, the 
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will be plowed under
JER.26.18	and left in ruins.
JER.26.18	Thorns will cover the mountain
JER.26.18	where the temple
JER.26.18	now stands.”
JER.26.19	Then the leaders continued:
JER.26.19	No one put Micah to death for saying that. Instead, King Hezekiah prayed to the 
JER.26.19	People of Judah, if Jeremiah is killed, we will bring a terrible disaster on ourselves.
JER.26.20+JER.26.21+JER.26.22+JER.26.23+JER.26.24	After these leaders finished speaking, an important man named Ahikam son of Shaphan spoke up for me as well. And so, I wasn't handed over to the crowd to be killed.
JER.26.20+JER.26.21+JER.26.22+JER.26.23+JER.26.24	While Jehoiakim
JER.27.1+JER.27.2	Jeremiah, make a wooden yoke
JER.27.3	Then send a message
JER.27.4	So have them tell their kings that I have said:
JER.27.4	I am the All-Powerful 
JER.27.5	and with my power I created the earth, its people, and all animals. I decide who will rule the earth, 
JER.27.6+JER.27.7	 and I have chosen my servant King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.27.8	This yoke stands for the power of King Nebuchadnezzar, and I will destroy any nation that refuses to obey him. Nebuchadnezzar will attack, and many will die in battle or from hunger and disease. 
JER.27.9	You might have people in your kingdom who claim they can tell the future by magic or by talking with the dead or by dreams or messages from a god. But don't pay attention if any of them tell you not to obey Nebuchadnezzar. 
JER.27.10	If you listen to such lies, I will have you dragged far from your country and killed. 
JER.27.11	But if you and your nation are willing to obey Nebuchadnezzar, I will let you stay in your country, and your people will continue to live and work on their farms.
JER.27.12	After I had spoken to the officials from the nearby kingdoms, I went to King Zedekiah and told him the same thing. Then I said:
JER.27.12	Zedekiah, if you and the people of Judah want to stay alive, you must obey Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. 
JER.27.13	But if you refuse, then you and your people will die from war, hunger, and disease, just as the 
JER.27.14	Your prophets have told you that you don't need to obey Nebuchadnezzar, but don't listen to their lies. 
JER.27.15	Those prophets claim to be speaking for the 
JER.27.16	When I finished talking to the king, I told the priests and everyone else that the 
JER.27.16	Don't listen to the prophets when they say that very soon the Babylonians will return the things they took from my temple. Those prophets are lying! 
JER.27.17	If you choose to obey the king of Babylonia, you will live. But if you listen to those prophets, this whole city will be nothing but a pile of rubble.
JER.27.18	If I really had spoken to those prophets, they would know what I am going to do. Then they would be begging me not to let everything else be taken from the temple and the king's palace and the rest of Jerusalem. 
JER.27.19+JER.27.20+JER.27.21	After all, when Nebuchadnezzar took King Jehoiachin
JER.27.19+JER.27.20+JER.27.21	But now I, the 
JER.27.22	will be taken to Babylonia, where they will remain until I decide to bring them back to Jerusalem. I, the 
JER.28.2	he told me that the 
JER.28.2	I am the 
JER.28.3	And within two years, I will bring back to Jerusalem everything that he took from my temple and carried off to Babylonia. 
JER.28.4	King Jehoiachin
JER.28.5	The priests and the others were still standing there, so I said:
JER.28.6	Hananiah, I hope the 
JER.28.7	But let me remind you and everyone else 
JER.28.8	that long before we were born, prophets were saying powerful kingdoms would be struck by war, disaster, and disease. 
JER.28.9	Now you are saying we will have peace. We will just have to wait and see if that is really what the 
JER.28.10	Hananiah grabbed the wooden yoke from my neck and smashed it. 
JER.28.11	Then he said, “The 
JER.28.11	I left the temple, 
JER.28.12	and a little while later, the 
JER.28.13+JER.28.14	to go back and say to Hananiah:
JER.28.13+JER.28.14	I am the 
JER.28.15+JER.28.16	Hananiah, I have never sent you to speak for me. And yet you have talked my people into believing your lies and rebelling against me. So now I will send you—I'll send you right off the face of the earth! You will die before this year is over.
JER.28.17	Two months later, Hananiah died.
JER.29.3	I gave the letter to Elasah and Gemariah,
JER.29.4	that the 
JER.29.4	I had you taken from Jerusalem to Babylonia. Now I tell you 
JER.29.5	to settle there and build houses. Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them. 
JER.29.6	Get married and have children, then help your sons find wives and help your daughters find husbands, so they can have children as well. I want your numbers to grow, not to get smaller.
JER.29.7	Pray for peace in Babylonia and work hard to make it prosperous. The more successful that nation is, the better off you will be.
JER.29.8+JER.29.9	Some of your people there in Babylonia are fortunetellers, and you have asked them to tell you what will happen in the future. But they will only lead you astray with their dreams.
JER.29.11	I will bless you with a future filled with hope—a future of success, not of suffering. 
JER.29.12	You will turn back to me and ask for help, and I will answer your prayers. 
JER.29.13	 You will worship me with all your heart, and I will be with you 
JER.29.14	and accept your worship. Then I will gather you from all the nations where I scattered you, and you will return to Jerusalem.
JER.29.15	You feel secure, because you think I have sent prophets to speak for me in Babylonia.
JER.29.16+JER.29.17+JER.29.18+JER.29.19	But I have been sending prophets to the people of Judah for a long time, and the king from David's family and the people who are left in Jerusalem and Judah still don't obey me. So I, the 
JER.29.16+JER.29.17+JER.29.18+JER.29.19	And you have not obeyed me, even though 
JER.29.20	I had you taken from Jerusalem to Babylonia. But you had better listen to me now. 
JER.29.21+JER.29.22+JER.29.23	You think Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah are prophets because they claim to speak for me. But they are lying! I haven't told them anything. They are also committing other horrible sins in your community, such as sleeping with the wives of their friends. So I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will put them to death while the rest of you watch. And in the future, when you want to put a curse on someone, you will say, “I pray that the 
JER.29.24+JER.29.25	The 
JER.29.26	After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the 
JER.29.27	Jeremiah from the town of Anathoth is pretending to be a prophet there in Jerusalem, so why haven't you punished him? 
JER.29.28	He even wrote a letter to the people here in Babylonia, saying we would be here a long time. He told us to build homes and to plant gardens and grow our own food.
JER.29.29	When Zephaniah received Shemaiah's letter, he read it to me. 
JER.29.30	Then the 
JER.29.31	to the people of Judah who had been taken to Babylonia. In this letter, I wrote that the 
JER.29.31	I, the 
JER.29.32	He has even talked you into disobeying me. So I will punish Shemaiah. He and his descendants won't live to see the good things I will do for my people. I, the 
JER.30.1+JER.30.2	The 
JER.30.3	Someday I will let my people from both Israel
JER.30.4+JER.30.5	Then the 
JER.30.4+JER.30.5	Screams of terror are heard,
JER.30.4+JER.30.5	with no word of peace.
JER.30.6	Can men give birth?
JER.30.6	Then why do I see them
JER.30.6	looking so pale
JER.30.6	and clutching their stomachs
JER.30.6	like women in labor?
JER.30.7	My people, soon you will suffer
JER.30.7	worse than ever before,
JER.30.7	but I will save you.
JER.30.8	Now you are slaves
JER.30.8	of other nations,
JER.30.8	but I will break the chains
JER.30.8	and smash the yokes
JER.30.8	that keep you in slavery.
JER.30.9	Then you will be my servants,
JER.30.9	and I will choose a king for you
JER.30.9	from the family of David.
JER.30.9	* 
JER.30.10	 Israel,
JER.30.10	so don't be afraid.
JER.30.10	You deserved to be punished;
JER.30.10	that's why I scattered you
JER.30.10	in distant nations.
JER.30.10	But I am with you,
JER.30.10	and someday I will destroy
JER.30.10	those nations.
JER.30.11	Then I will bring you
JER.30.11	and your descendants
JER.30.11	back to your land,
JER.30.11	where I will protect you
JER.30.11	and give you peace.
JER.30.11	Then your fears will be gone.
JER.30.11	I, the 
JER.30.12	The 
JER.30.12	My people, you are wounded
JER.30.12	and near death.
JER.30.13	You are accused of a crime
JER.30.13	with no one to defend you,
JER.30.13	and you are covered with sores
JER.30.13	that no medicine can cure.
JER.30.13	* 
JER.30.14	Your friends have forgotten you;
JER.30.14	they don't care anymore.
JER.30.14	Even I have acted like an enemy.
JER.30.14	And because your sins
JER.30.14	are horrible and countless,
JER.30.14	I will be cruel
JER.30.14	as I punish you.
JER.30.15	So don't bother to cry out
JER.30.15	for relief from your pain.
JER.30.16	But if your enemies try to rob
JER.30.16	or destroy you,
JER.30.16	I will rob and destroy them,
JER.30.16	and they will be led as captives
JER.30.16	to foreign lands.
JER.30.17	No one wants you as a friend
JER.30.17	or cares what happens to you.
JER.30.17	But I will heal your injuries,
JER.30.17	and you will get well.
JER.30.18	The 
JER.30.18	Israel, I will be kind to you
JER.30.18	and let you come home.
JER.30.18	Jerusalem now lies in ruins,
JER.30.18	but you will rebuild it,
JER.30.18	complete with a new palace.
JER.30.19	Other nations will respect
JER.30.19	and honor you.
JER.30.19	Your homes will be filled
JER.30.19	with children,
JER.30.19	and you will celebrate,
JER.30.19	singing praises to me.
JER.30.20	It will be just like old times.
JER.30.20	Your nation will worship me,
JER.30.20	and I will punish anyone
JER.30.20	who abuses you.
JER.30.21	One of your own people
JER.30.21	will become your ruler.
JER.30.21	And when I invite him
JER.30.21	to come near me
JER.30.21	at the place of worship,
JER.30.21	he will do so.
JER.30.21	No one would dare to come near
JER.30.21	without being invited.
JER.30.22	You will be my people,
JER.30.22	and I will be your God.
JER.30.22	I, the 
JER.30.23	I am furious!
JER.30.23	And like a violent storm
JER.30.23	I will strike those
JER.30.23	who do wrong.
JER.30.24	I won't calm down
JER.30.24	until I have finished
JER.30.24	what I have decided to do.
JER.30.24	Someday, you will understand
JER.30.24	what I mean.
JER.31.1	The 
JER.31.1	Israel, I promise
JER.31.1	that someday all your tribes
JER.31.1	will again be my people,
JER.31.1	and I will be your God.
JER.31.2	In the desert I was kind
JER.31.2	to those who escaped death.
JER.31.2	I gave them peace,
JER.31.2	and when the time is right,
JER.31.2	I'll do the same for you.
JER.31.2	I, the 
JER.31.3	Some time ago, the 
JER.31.3	Israel, I will always love you;
JER.31.3	that's why I've been so patient
JER.31.3	and kind.
JER.31.4	You are precious to me,
JER.31.4	and so I will rebuild
JER.31.4	your nation.
JER.31.4	Once again you will dance for joy
JER.31.4	and play your tambourines.
JER.31.5	You will plant vineyards
JER.31.5	on the hills of Samaria
JER.31.5	and enjoy the grapes.
JER.31.6	Someday those who guard
JER.31.6	the hill country of Ephraim
JER.31.6	will shout, “Let's go to Zion
JER.31.6	and worship the 
JER.31.7	The 
JER.31.7	Celebrate and sing for Israel,
JER.31.7	the greatest of nations.
JER.31.7	Offer praises and shout,
JER.31.7	“Come and rescue
JER.31.7	your people, 
JER.31.7	Save what's left of Israel.”
JER.31.8	I, the 
JER.31.8	my people back from Babylonia
JER.31.8	and everywhere else on earth.
JER.31.8	The blind and the lame
JER.31.8	will be there.
JER.31.8	Expectant mothers
JER.31.8	and women about to give birth
JER.31.8	will come and be part
JER.31.8	of that great crowd.
JER.31.9	They will weep and pray
JER.31.9	as I bring them home.
JER.31.9	I will lead them
JER.31.9	to streams of water.
JER.31.9	They will walk on a level
JER.31.9	and not stumble.
JER.31.9	I am a father to Israel,
JER.31.9	my favorite children.
JER.31.10	Listen to me, you nations
JER.31.10	nearby or across the sea.
JER.31.10	I scattered the people of Israel,
JER.31.10	but I will gather them again.
JER.31.10	I will protect them like a shepherd
JER.31.10	guarding a flock;
JER.31.11	I will rescue them from enemies
JER.31.11	who could overpower them.
JER.31.12	My people will come
JER.31.12	to Mount Zion
JER.31.12	and celebrate;
JER.31.12	their faces will glow
JER.31.12	because of my blessings.
JER.31.12	I'll give them grain, grapes,
JER.31.12	and olive oil,
JER.31.12	as well as sheep and cattle.
JER.31.12	Israel will be prosperous
JER.31.12	and grow like a garden
JER.31.12	with plenty of water.
JER.31.13	Young women and young men,
JER.31.13	together with the elderly,
JER.31.13	will celebrate and dance,
JER.31.13	because I will comfort them
JER.31.13	and turn their sorrow
JER.31.13	into happiness.
JER.31.14	I will bless my people
JER.31.14	with more food
JER.31.14	than they need,
JER.31.14	and the priests will enjoy
JER.31.14	the choice cuts of meat.
JER.31.14	I, the 
JER.31.15	crying and weeping loudly.
JER.31.15	Rachel mourns for her children
JER.31.15	and refuses to be comforted,
JER.31.15	because they are dead.
JER.31.15	* 
JER.31.16	But I, the 
JER.31.16	to dry your tears.
JER.31.16	Someday your children
JER.31.16	will come home
JER.31.16	from the enemy's land.
JER.31.16	Then all you have done for them
JER.31.16	will be greatly rewarded.
JER.31.17	So don't lose hope.
JER.31.17	I, the 
JER.31.18	The people of Israel
JER.31.18	and say to me,
JER.31.18	“We were like wild bulls,
JER.31.18	but you, 
JER.31.18	and we learned to obey.
JER.31.18	You are our God—
JER.31.18	please let us come home.
JER.31.19	When we were young,
JER.31.19	we strayed and sinned,
JER.31.19	but then we realized
JER.31.19	what we had done.
JER.31.19	We are ashamed and disgraced
JER.31.19	and want to return to you.”
JER.31.20	People of Israel,
JER.31.20	you are my own dear children.
JER.31.20	Don't I love you best of all?
JER.31.20	Though I often make threats,
JER.31.20	I want you to be near me,
JER.31.20	so I will have mercy on you.
JER.31.20	I, the 
JER.31.21	With rock piles and signposts,
JER.31.21	mark the road well,
JER.31.21	my dear people.
JER.31.21	The road by which you left
JER.31.21	by will now lead you home.
JER.31.22	Will you ever decide
JER.31.22	to be faithful?
JER.31.22	I will make sure that someday
JER.31.22	things will be different,
JER.31.22	as different as a woman
JER.31.22	protecting a man.
JER.31.23	The 
JER.31.23	I promise to set the people of Judah free and to lead them back to their hometowns. And when I do, they will once again say,
JER.31.23	“We pray that the 
JER.31.23	will bless his home,
JER.31.23	the sacred hill in Jerusalem
JER.31.23	where his temple stands.”
JER.31.24	The people will live in Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah. Some will be farmers, and others will be shepherds. 
JER.31.25	Those who feel tired and worn out will find new life and energy, 
JER.31.26	and when they sleep, they will wake up refreshed.
JER.31.27	Someday, Israel and Judah will be my field where my people and their livestock will grow. 
JER.31.28	In the past, I took care to uproot them, to tear them down, and to destroy them. But when that day comes, I will take care to plant them and help them grow. 
JER.31.29	 No longer will anyone go around saying,
JER.31.29	“Sour grapes eaten by parents
JER.31.29	leave a sour taste in the mouths
JER.31.29	of their children.”
JER.31.30	When that day comes, only those who eat sour grapes will get the sour taste, and only those who sin will be put to death.
JER.31.31	The time will surely come when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and Judah. 
JER.31.32	It will be different from the agreement I made with their ancestors when I led them out of Egypt. Although I was their God, they broke that agreement.
JER.31.33	“I will write my laws
JER.31.33	on their hearts and minds.
JER.31.33	I will be their God,
JER.31.33	and they will be my people.
JER.31.35	I am the 
JER.31.35	I command the sun
JER.31.35	to give light each day,
JER.31.35	the moon and stars
JER.31.35	to shine at night,
JER.31.35	and ocean waves to roar.
JER.31.36	I will never forget
JER.31.36	to give those commands,
JER.31.36	and I will never let Israel
JER.31.36	stop being a nation.
JER.31.36	I, the 
JER.31.37	Can you measure the heavens?
JER.31.37	Can you explore
JER.31.37	the depths of the earth?
JER.31.37	That's how hard it would be
JER.31.37	for me to reject Israel forever,
JER.31.37	even though they have sinned.
JER.31.37	I, the 
JER.31.38	The 
JER.31.38	Someday, Jerusalem will truly belong to me. It will be rebuilt with a boundary line running from Hananel Tower to Corner Gate. 
JER.31.39	From there, the boundary will go in a straight line to Gareb Hill, then turn toward Goah. 
JER.31.40	Even that disgusting Hinnom Valley
JER.32.2	At that time, the Babylonian army had surrounded Jerusalem, and I was in the prison at the courtyard of the palace guards. 
JER.32.3	Zedekiah had ordered me to be held there because I told everyone that the 
JER.32.3	I am the 
JER.32.4	King Zedekiah will be captured and taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will speak with him face to face. 
JER.32.5	Then Zedekiah will be led away to Babylonia, where he will stay until I am finished with him. So, if you people of Judah fight against the Babylonians, you will lose. I, the 
JER.32.6	Later, when I was in prison, the 
JER.32.7	Jeremiah, your cousin Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will visit you. He must sell his field near the town of Anathoth, and because you are his nearest relative, you have the right and the responsibility to buy it and keep it in the family.
JER.32.8	Hanamel came, just as the 
JER.32.8	The 
JER.32.9	from Hanamel, and so I did. The price was 17 pieces of silver, and I weighed out the full amount on a scale. 
JER.32.10+JER.32.11	I had two copies of the bill of sale written out: an official copy containing the details of our agreement and another copy, without the details. Some witnesses and I signed the official copy, which was folded and tied, before being sealed shut with hot wax.
JER.32.12	And while he, the witnesses, and all the other Jews sitting in the courtyard were still watching, I gave both copies to Baruch son of Neriah.
JER.32.13+JER.32.14	I told Baruch that the 
JER.32.13+JER.32.14	Take both copies of this bill of sale, one sealed shut and the other open, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. 
JER.32.15	I am the 
JER.32.16	Then I prayed:
JER.32.18	You show kindness for a thousand generations,
JER.32.19	With great wisdom you make plans, and with your great power you do all the mighty things you planned. Nothing we do is hidden from your eyes, and you reward or punish us as we deserve.
JER.32.20	You are famous because you worked miracles in Egypt, and you are still working them in Israel and in the rest of the world as well. 
JER.32.21	You terrified the Egyptians with your miracles, and you reached out your mighty arm and rescued your people Israel from Egypt. 
JER.32.22	Then you gave Israel this land rich with milk and honey, just as you had promised our ancestors.
JER.32.23	But when our ancestors took over the land, they did not obey you. And now you have punished Israel with disaster. 
JER.32.24	Jerusalem is under attack, and we suffer from hunger and disease. The Babylonians have already built dirt ramps up to the walls of our city, and you can see that Jerusalem will be captured just as you said.
JER.32.25	So why did you tell me to get some witnesses and buy a field with my silver, when Jerusalem is about to be captured by the Babylonians?
JER.32.26	The 
JER.32.27	Jeremiah, I am the 
JER.32.29	The Babylonian army is already attacking, and they will capture the city and set it on fire. The people of Jerusalem have made me angry by going up to the flat roofs of their houses and burning incense to Baal and offering wine sacrifices to other gods. Now these houses will be burned to the ground!
JER.32.30+JER.32.31+JER.32.32+JER.32.33	The kings and the officials, the priests and the prophets, and everyone else in Israel and Judah have turned from me and made me angry by worshiping idols. Again and again I have tried to teach my people to obey me, but they refuse to be corrected.
JER.32.30+JER.32.31+JER.32.32+JER.32.33	I am going to get rid of Jerusalem, because its people have done nothing but evil. 
JER.32.34	 They have set up repulsive idols in my temple, and now it isn't a fit place to worship me. 
JER.32.35	 And they led Judah into sin by building places to worship Baal in Hinnom Valley, where they also sacrificed their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I have never even imagined they would commit such disgusting sins.
JER.32.36	Jeremiah, what you said is true. The people of Jerusalem are suffering from hunger and disease, and so the king of Babylonia will be able to capture Jerusalem.
JER.32.37	I am angry with the people of Jerusalem, and I will scatter them in foreign countries. But someday I will bring them back here and let them live in safety. 
JER.32.38	They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39+JER.32.40+JER.32.41	I will make their thoughts and desires pure. Then they will realize that, for their own good and the good of their children, they must worship only me. They will even be afraid to turn away from me. I will make an agreement with them that will never end, and I won't ever stop doing good things for them. With all my heart I promise that they will be planted in this land once again. 
JER.32.42	Even though I have brought disaster on the people, I will someday do all these good things for them.
JER.32.43	Jeremiah, when you bought the field, you showed that fields will someday be bought and sold again. You say that this land has been conquered by the Babylonians and has become a desert, emptied of people and animals. 
JER.32.44	But someday, people will again spend their silver to buy fields everywhere—in the territory of Benjamin, the region around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and in the hill country, the foothills to the west, and the Southern Desert. Buyers and sellers and witnesses will sign and seal the bills of sale for the fields. It will happen, because I will give this land back to my people. I, the 
JER.33.1+JER.33.2	I was still being held prisoner in the courtyard of the palace guards when the 
JER.33.1+JER.33.2	I am the 
JER.33.3	Ask me, and I will tell you things that you don't know and can't find out.
JER.33.4+JER.33.5	Many of the houses in Jerusalem and some of the buildings at the royal palace have been torn down to be used in repairing the walls to keep out the Babylonian attackers.
JER.33.6	Then someday, I will heal this place and my people as well, and let them enjoy unending peace.
JER.33.7	I will give this land to Israel and Judah once again, and I will make them as strong as they were before. 
JER.33.8	They sinned and rebelled against me, but I will forgive them and take away their guilt. 
JER.33.9	When that happens, all nations on earth will see the good things I have done for Jerusalem, and how I have given it complete peace. The nations will celebrate and praise and honor me, but they will also tremble with fear because of the powerful things I have done.
JER.33.10	Jeremiah, you say that this land is a desert without people or animals, and for now, you are right. The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are deserted, and people and animals are nowhere to be seen. But someday you will hear 
JER.33.11	 happy voices and the sounds of parties and wedding celebrations. And when people come to my temple to offer sacrifices to thank me, you will hear them say:
JER.33.11	“We praise you,
JER.33.11	You are good to us,
JER.33.11	and your love never fails.”
JER.33.11	The land will once again be productive. 
JER.33.12+JER.33.13	Now it is empty, without people or animals. But when that time comes, shepherds will take care of their flocks in pastures near every town in the hill country, in the foothills to the west, in the Southern Desert, in the land of the Benjamin tribe, and around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah.
JER.33.12+JER.33.13	I, the 
JER.33.14	I made a wonderful promise to Israel and Judah,
JER.33.15	I promise that the time will come
JER.33.15	when I will appoint a king
JER.33.15	from the family of David,
JER.33.15	a king who will be honest
JER.33.15	and rule with justice.
JER.33.16	In those days,
JER.33.16	Judah will be safe;
JER.33.16	Jerusalem will have peace
JER.33.16	and will be named,
JER.33.16	“The 
JER.33.18	 and there will always be priests from the Levi tribe serving at my altar and offering sacrifices to please me and to give thanks.
JER.33.19	Then the 
JER.33.20	I, the 
JER.33.21	and you can't break the agreements I have made with David's family and with the priests from the Levi tribe who serve at my altar. A descendant of David will always rule as king of Israel, 
JER.33.22	and there will be more descendants of David and of the priests from the Levi tribe than stars in the sky or grains of sand on the beach.
JER.33.23	The 
JER.33.24	You've heard foreigners insult my people by saying, “The 
JER.33.25	Jeremiah, I will never break my agreement with the day and the night or let the sky and the earth stop obeying my commands. 
JER.33.26	In the same way, I will never reject the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob or break my promise that they will always have a descendant of David as their king. I will be kind to my people Israel, and they will be successful again.
JER.34.2	to say to King Zedekiah:
JER.34.2	I am the 
JER.34.3	You will be taken prisoner and brought to Nebuchadnezzar, and he will speak with you face to face. Then you will be led away to Babylonia.
JER.34.4	Zedekiah, I promise that you won't die in battle. 
JER.34.5	You will die a peaceful death. People will mourn when you die, and they will light bonfires in your honor, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you.
JER.34.6	I went to Zedekiah and told him what the 
JER.34.7	Meanwhile, the king of Babylonia was trying to break through the walls of Lachish, Azekah, and Jerusalem, the only three towns of Judah that had not been captured.
JER.34.8+JER.34.9+JER.34.10	King Zedekiah,
JER.34.11	But those slave owners changed their minds and forced their former slaves back into slavery.
JER.34.12	That's when the 
JER.34.13	I am the 
JER.34.14	 As part of this agreement, you must let a Hebrew slave go free after six years of service.
JER.34.14	Your ancestors did not obey me, 
JER.34.15+JER.34.16	but you decided to obey me and do the right thing by setting your Hebrew slaves completely free. You even went to my temple, and in my name you made an agreement to set them free. But you have abused my name, because you broke that agreement and forced your former slaves back into slavery.
JER.34.17	You have disobeyed me by not giving your slaves their freedom. So I will give you freedom—the freedom to die in battle or from disease or hunger. I will make you disgusting to all other nations on earth.
JER.34.18	You asked me to be a witness when you made the agreement to set your slaves free. And as part of the ceremony you cut a calf into two parts, then walked between the parts. But you people of Jerusalem have broken that agreement as well as my agreement with Israel. So I will do to you what you did to that calf. 
JER.34.19+JER.34.20	I will let your enemies take all of you prisoner, including the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the royal officials, the priests, and everyone else who walked between the two parts of the calf. These enemies will kill you and leave your bodies lying on the ground as food for birds and wild animals.
JER.34.21+JER.34.22	These enemies are King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.35.2	“Go to the Rechabite clan and invite them to meet you in one of the side rooms
JER.35.3	So I went to Jaazaniah,
JER.35.4	I brought them into the temple courtyard and took them upstairs to a room belonging to the prophets who were followers of Hanan son of Igdaliah. It was next to a room belonging to some of the officials, and that room was over the one belonging to Maaseiah, a priest who was one of the high officials in the temple.
JER.35.5	I set out some large bowls full of wine together with some cups, and then I said to the Rechabites, “Have some wine!”
JER.35.6	But they answered:
JER.35.6	No! The ancestor of our clan, Jonadab son of Rechab,
JER.35.7	or build houses or plant crops and vineyards. Instead, you must always live in tents and move from place to place. If you obey this command, you will live a long time.”
JER.35.8+JER.35.9+JER.35.10	Our clan has always obeyed Jonadab's command. To this very day, we and our wives and sons and daughters don't drink wine or build houses or plant vineyards or crops. And we have lived in tents, 
JER.35.11	except now we have to live inside Jerusalem because Nebuchadnezzar
JER.35.12+JER.35.13	Then the 
JER.35.12+JER.35.13	I, the 
JER.35.14	from the Rechabite clan. Their ancestor Jonadab told his descendants never to drink wine, and to this very day they have obeyed him. But I have spoken to you over and over, and you haven't obeyed me! 
JER.35.15	You refused to listen to my prophets, who kept telling you, “Stop doing evil and worshiping other gods! Start obeying the 
JER.35.16	The Rechabites have obeyed the command of their ancestor Jonadab, but you have not obeyed me, 
JER.35.17	your God. I am the 
JER.35.18	Then the 
JER.35.18	“I am the 
JER.35.19	so I promise that your clan will be my servants and will never die out.”
JER.36.2	since the time Josiah was king, I have been speaking to you about Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Now, get a scroll
JER.36.3	then read it to the people of Judah. Maybe they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible things I plan for them. And if they turn back to me, I will forgive them.”
JER.36.4	I sent for Baruch son of Neriah and asked him to help me. I repeated everything the 
JER.36.5	Then I said,
JER.36.5	Baruch, the officials refuse to let me go into the 
JER.36.6	so you must go instead. Wait for the next holy day when the people of Judah come to the temple to pray and to go without eating.
JER.36.7	The 
JER.36.8+JER.36.9+JER.36.10	In the ninth month
JER.36.8+JER.36.9+JER.36.10	This covered area belonged to Gemariah,
JER.36.11	Gemariah's son Micaiah was there and heard Baruch read what the 
JER.36.12	When Baruch finished reading, Micaiah went down to the palace. His father Gemariah was in the officials' room, meeting with the rest of the king's officials, including Elishama, Delaiah, Elnathan, and Zedekiah.
JER.36.13	Micaiah told them what he had heard Baruch read to the people. 
JER.36.14	Then the officials sent Jehudi and Shelemiah
JER.36.14	When Baruch arrived with the scroll, 
JER.36.15	the officials said, “Please sit down and read it to us,” which he did. 
JER.36.16	After they heard what was written on the scroll, they were worried and said to each other, “The king needs to hear this!” Turning to Baruch, they asked, 
JER.36.17	“Did someone tell you what to write on this scroll?”
JER.36.18	“Yes, Jeremiah did,” Baruch replied. “I wrote down just what he told me.”
JER.36.19	The officials said, “You and Jeremiah must go into hiding, and don't tell anyone where you are going.”
JER.36.20+JER.36.21+JER.36.22	The officials put the scroll in Elishama's room and went to see the king, who was in one of the rooms where he lived and worked during the winter. It was the ninth month
JER.36.23+JER.36.24+JER.36.25	But every time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king would tell him to cut them off with his penknife and throw them in the fire. Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, but he ignored them, and soon there was nothing left of it.
JER.36.23+JER.36.24+JER.36.25	The king and his servants listened to what was written on the scroll, but they were not the least bit afraid, and they did not tear their clothes in sorrow.
JER.36.26	The king told his son Jerahmeel to take Seraiah and Shelemiah
JER.36.27	I had told Baruch what to write on that first scroll,
JER.36.28	to get another scroll and write down everything that had been on the first one. 
JER.36.29	Then he told me to say to King Jehoiakim:
JER.36.29	Not only did you burn Jeremiah's scroll, you had the nerve to ask why he had written that the king of Babylonia would attack and ruin the land, killing all the people and even the animals. 
JER.36.30	So I, the 
JER.36.31	You, your children, and your servants are evil, and I will punish everyone of you. I warned you and the people of Judah and Jerusalem that I would bring disaster, but none of you have listened. So now you are doomed!
JER.36.32	After the 
JER.37.2	But Zedekiah, his officials, and everyone else in Judah ignored everything the 
JER.37.3+JER.37.4+JER.37.5	Later, the Babylonian army attacked Jerusalem, but they left after learning that the Egyptian army
JER.37.3+JER.37.4+JER.37.5	One day, Zedekiah sent Jehucal and the priest Zephaniah
JER.37.6+JER.37.7	Then the 
JER.37.6+JER.37.7	Zedekiah, you wanted Jeremiah to ask me, the 
JER.37.8	Then the Babylonians will return and attack Jerusalem, and this time they will capture the city and set it on fire. 
JER.37.9	Don't fool yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians will leave as they did before. 
JER.37.10	Even if you could defeat their entire army, their wounded survivors would still be able to leave their tents and set Jerusalem on fire.
JER.37.11	The Babylonian army had left because the Egyptian army was on its way to help us. 
JER.37.12	So I decided to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of the Benjamin tribe to claim my share of my family's land. 
JER.37.13	I was leaving Jerusalem through Benjamin Gate, when I was stopped by Irijah,
JER.37.14	“I'm not trying to join them!” I answered. But Irijah wouldn't listen, and he took me to the king's officials. 
JER.37.15+JER.37.16	They were angry and ordered the soldiers to beat me. Then I was taken to the house that belonged to Jonathan, one of the king's officials. It had been turned into a prison, and I was kept in a basement room.
JER.37.15+JER.37.16	After I had spent a long time there, 
JER.37.17	King Zedekiah secretly had me brought to his palace, where he asked, “Is there any message for us from the 
JER.37.17	“Yes, there is, Your Majesty,” I replied. “The 
JER.37.18	Then I continued, “Your Majesty, why have you put me in prison? Have I committed a crime against you or your officials or the nation? 
JER.37.19	Have you locked up the prophets who lied to you and said that the king of Babylonia would never attack Jerusalem? 
JER.37.20	Please, don't send me back to that prison at Jonathan's house. If you do, I will die there.”
JER.37.21	King Zedekiah had me taken to the prison cells in the courtyard of the palace guards. He told the soldiers to give me a loaf of bread
JER.38.1	One day, Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jehucal,
JER.38.2+JER.38.3	that the 
JER.38.4	So the four of them went to the king and said, “You should put Jeremiah to death, because he is making the soldiers and everyone else lose hope. He isn't trying to help our people; he's trying to harm them.”
JER.38.5	Zedekiah replied, “Do what you want with him. I can't stop you.”
JER.38.6	Then they took me back to the courtyard of the palace guards and let me down with ropes into the well that belonged to Malchiah, the king's son. There was no water in the well, but I sank down in the mud.
JER.38.7+JER.38.8	Ebedmelech from Ethiopia
JER.38.9	Ebedmelech said, “Your Majesty, Jeremiah is a prophet, and those men were wrong to throw him into a well. And when Jerusalem runs out of food, Jeremiah will starve to death down there.”
JER.38.10	Zedekiah answered, “Take 30
JER.38.11	Ebedmelech and the soldiers went to the palace and got some rags from the room under the treasury. He used ropes to lower them into the well. 
JER.38.12	Then he said, “Put these rags under your arms so the ropes won't hurt you.” After I did, 
JER.38.13	the men pulled me out. And from then on, I was kept in the courtyard of the palace guards.
JER.38.14	King Zedekiah
JER.38.15	“Why?” I replied. “You won't listen, and you might even have me killed!”
JER.38.16	He said, “I swear in the name of the living 
JER.38.17	Then I told him that the 
JER.38.18	But if you don't surrender, I will let the Babylonian army capture Jerusalem and burn it down, and you will be taken prisoner.”
JER.38.19	Zedekiah answered, “I can't surrender to the Babylonians. I'm too afraid of the people of Judah who have already joined them. The Babylonians might hand me over to them, and they would torture me.”
JER.38.20	I said, “If you will just obey the 
JER.38.21	But the 
JER.38.22	then the women of your palace will be taken prisoner by Nebuchadnezzar's officials. And those women will say to you:
JER.38.22	Friends you trusted led you astray.
JER.38.22	Now you're trapped in mud,
JER.38.22	and those friends you trusted
JER.38.22	have all turned away.
JER.38.23	The Babylonian army will take your wives and children captive, you will be taken as a prisoner to the King of Babylonia, and Jerusalem will be burned down.”
JER.38.24	Zedekiah said, “Jeremiah, if you tell anyone what we have talked about, you might lose your life. 
JER.38.25	And I'm sure that if my officials hear about our meeting, they will ask you what we said to each other. They might even threaten to kill you if you don't tell them. 
JER.38.26	So if they question you, tell them you were begging me not to send you back to the prison at Jonathan's house, because going back there would kill you.”
JER.38.27	The officials did come and question me about my meeting with the king, and I told them exactly what he had ordered me to say. They never spoke to me about the meeting again, since no one had heard us talking.
JER.39.1+JER.39.2+JER.39.3	In the tenth month
JER.39.1+JER.39.2+JER.39.3	After Jerusalem was captured,
JER.39.4	When King Zedekiah and his troops saw that Jerusalem had been captured, they tried to escape from the city that same night. They went to the king's garden, where they slipped through the gate between the two city walls
JER.39.5	But the Babylonian troops caught up with them near Jericho. They arrested Zedekiah and took him to the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar put him on trial, then found him guilty, 
JER.39.6	and gave orders for him to be punished. Zedekiah's sons were killed there in front of him, and so were the leaders of Judah's ruling families. 
JER.39.7	Then his eyes were poked out, and he was put in chains, so he could be dragged off to Babylonia.
JER.39.8	Meanwhile, the Babylonian army had burned the houses in Jerusalem, including
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian officer in charge of the guards, led away everyone from the city as prisoners, even those who had deserted to Nebuchadnezzar. 
JER.39.10	Only the poorest people who owned no land were left behind in Judah, and Nebuzaradan gave them fields and vineyards.
JER.39.11	Nebuchadnezzar had given the following orders to Nebuzaradan: 
JER.39.12	“Find Jeremiah and keep him safe. Take good care of him and do whatever he asks.”
JER.39.13	Nebuzaradan, Nebushazban, Nergal Sharezer, and the other officers of King Nebuchadnezzar 
JER.39.14	sent some of their troops to bring me from the courtyard of the royal palace guards. They put me in the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam
JER.39.15	While I was a prisoner in the courtyard of the palace guard, the 
JER.39.16	to Ebedmelech from Ethiopia:
JER.39.16	I am the 
JER.39.17+JER.39.18	But because you trusted me,
JER.40.1	I was led away in chains along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem who were being taken to Babylonia. Nebuzaradan was the officer in charge of the guard, and while we were stopped at Ramah, the 
JER.40.2	Nebuzaradan said:
JER.40.2	Jeremiah, the 
JER.40.3	But they continued to rebel against him, and now he has punished them just as he threatened.
JER.40.4	Today I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free! If you want to, you can come with me to Babylonia, and I will see that you are taken care of. Or if you decide to stay here, you can go wherever you wish. 
JER.40.5	King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.40.5	Nebuzaradan gave me a supply of food, then let me leave. 
JER.40.6	I decided to stay with the people of Judah, and I went to live near Gedaliah in Mizpah.
JER.40.9	Gedaliah told them, “There's no need to be afraid of the Babylonians. Everything will be fine, if we live peacefully and obey King Nebuchadnezzar.
JER.40.10	I will stay here at Mizpah and meet with the Babylonian officials on each of their visits. But you must go back to your towns and bring in the harvest, then store the wine, olive oil, and dried fruit.”
JER.40.11+JER.40.12	Earlier, when the Babylonians had invaded Judah, many of the Jews escaped to Moab, Ammon, Edom, and several other countries. But these Jews heard that the king of Babylonia had appointed Gedaliah as ruler of Judah, and that only a few people were left there. So the Jews in these other countries came back to Judah and helped with the grape and fruit harvest, which was especially large that year.
JER.40.13	One day, Johanan got together with some of the other men who had been army officers, and they came to Mizpah and met with Gedaliah. 
JER.40.14	They said, “Gedaliah, we came to warn you that King Baalis of Ammon hired Ishmael to murder you!”
JER.40.14	Gedaliah refused to believe them, 
JER.40.15	so Johanan went to Gedaliah privately and said, “Let me kill Ishmael. No one will find out who did it. There are only a few people left in Judah, but they are depending on you. And if you are murdered, they will be scattered or killed.”
JER.40.16	Gedaliah answered, “Don't kill Ishmael! What you've said about him can't be true.”
JER.41.2	During the meal, Ishmael and his soldiers killed Gedaliah, the man chosen as ruler of Judah by the king of Babylonia. 
JER.41.3	Then they killed the Jews who were with Gedaliah, and they also killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there.
JER.41.4	The next day, the murders had still not been discovered, 
JER.41.5	when 80 men came down the road toward Mizpah from the towns of Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to the 
JER.41.6	Ishmael went out the town gate to meet them. He pretended to be weeping, and he asked them to come into Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah, the ruler of Judah. 
JER.41.7	But after they were inside the town, Ishmael ordered his soldiers to kill them and throw their bodies into a well. 
JER.41.8	He let ten of the men live, because they offered to give him supplies of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey they had hidden in a field. 
JER.41.9	The well that he filled with bodies
JER.41.10	Nebuzaradan, King Nebuchadnezzar's
JER.41.11	Johanan and the other army officers heard what Ishmael had done. 
JER.41.12	So they and their troops chased Ishmael and caught up with him at the large pit at Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the officers, they were happy 
JER.41.14	and turned around and ran toward Johanan. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael and eight of his men escaped and went to Ammon.
JER.41.16	Johanan and the officers had rescued the women, children, and royal officials that Ishmael had taken prisoner after killing Gedaliah. Johanan led the people from Gibeon 
JER.41.17+JER.41.18	toward Egypt. They wanted to go there, because they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do when they found out that Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, the ruler appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar.
JER.41.17+JER.41.18	On the way to Egypt, we
JER.42.1	Johanan, Jezaniah,
JER.42.2	and said, “Please, Jeremiah, pray to the 
JER.42.3	Ask the 
JER.42.4	“All right,” I answered, “I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	They answered, “The 
JER.42.6	even if it isn't what we want to do. We will obey the 
JER.42.7	Ten days later, the 
JER.42.8	Johanan, the officers, and the other people. So I called them together 
JER.42.9	and told them that the 
JER.42.9	You asked Jeremiah to pray and find out what you should do. 
JER.42.10	I am sorry that I had to punish you, and so I now tell you to stay here in Judah, where I will plant you and build you up, instead of tearing you down and uprooting you. 
JER.42.11	Don't be afraid of the King of Babylonia. I will protect you from him, 
JER.42.12	and I will even force him to have mercy on you and give back your farms.
JER.42.13	But you might keep on saying, “We won't stay here in Judah, and we won't obey the 
JER.42.14	We are going to Egypt, where there is plenty of food and no danger of war.”
JER.42.15	People of Judah, you survived when the Babylonian army attacked. Now you are planning to move to Egypt, and if you do go, this is what will happen. 
JER.42.16+JER.42.17	You are afraid of war, starvation, and disease here in Judah, but they will follow you to Egypt and kill you there. None of you will survive the disasters I will send.
JER.42.18	I, the 
JER.42.19	I told the people:
JER.42.19	You escaped the disaster that struck Judah, but now the 
JER.42.20	You asked me to pray and find out what the 
JER.42.21	because now that I have given you the 
JER.42.22	And so, you will die in Egypt from war, hunger, and disease.
JER.43.1	I told the people everything the 
JER.43.2	But Azariah, Johanan
JER.43.3	Baruch son of Neriah must have told you to say that. He wants the Babylonians to capture us, so they can take us away to Babylonia or even kill us.”
JER.43.4	Johanan, the other army officers, and everyone else refused to stay in Judah in spite of the 
JER.43.5	 So Johanan and the officers led us away toward Egypt. The group that left Judah included those who had been scattered in other countries and who had then come back to live in Judah. 
JER.43.6	Baruch and I and others in the group had been staying with Gedaliah, because Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian officer in charge of the guard, had ordered him to take care of the king's daughters and quite a few men, women, and children.
JER.43.7	The people disobeyed the 
JER.43.8	when the 
JER.43.9	Jeremiah, carry some large stones to the entrance of the government building in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones underneath the brick pavement
JER.43.10	Then tell them that I, the 
JER.43.11	He will attack Egypt and kill many of its people; others will die of disease or be dragged away as prisoners. 
JER.43.12+JER.43.13	I will let him set Egypt's temples on fire, and he will either burn or carry off their idols. He will destroy the sacred monuments at the temple of the sun-god.
JER.44.1	The 
JER.44.2	I am the 
JER.44.3	because the people of Judah made me angry by worshiping gods that had never helped them or their ancestors.
JER.44.4	Time after time I sent my servants the prophets to tell the people of Judah how much I hated their disgusting sins. The prophets warned them to stop sinning, 
JER.44.5	but they refused to listen and would not stop worshiping other gods. 
JER.44.6	Finally, my anger struck like a raging flood, and today Jerusalem and the towns of Judah are nothing but empty ruins.
JER.44.7	Why do you now insist on heading for another disaster? A disaster that will destroy not only you, but also your children and babies. 
JER.44.8	You have made me angry by worshiping idols and burning incense to other gods after you came here to Egypt. You will die such a disgusting death, that other nations will use the name of Judah as a curse word. 
JER.44.9	When you were living in Jerusalem and Judah, you followed the example of your ancestors in doing evil things, just like your kings and queens. 
JER.44.10	Even now, your pride keeps you from respecting me and obeying the laws and teachings I gave you and your ancestors.
JER.44.11	I, the 
JER.44.12	There were only a few of you left in Judah, and you decided to go to Egypt. But you will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation, that people of other countries will use the name of Judah as a curse word. 
JER.44.13	I punished Jerusalem with war, hunger, and disease, and that's how I will punish you. 
JER.44.14	None of you will survive. You may hope to return to Judah someday, but only a very few of you will escape death and be able to go back.
JER.44.15	A large number of Jews from both northern and southern Egypt listened to me as I told them what the 
JER.44.16	Jeremiah, what do we care if you speak in the 
JER.44.17	We have promised to worship the goddess Astarte, the Queen of Heaven,
JER.44.18	But since the time we stopped burning incense and offering wine sacrifices to her, we have been dying from war and hunger.
JER.44.19	Then the women said, “When we lived in Judah, we worshiped the Queen of Heaven and offered sacrifices of wine and special loaves of bread shaped like her. Our husbands knew what we were doing, and they approved of it.”
JER.44.20	Then I told the crowd:
JER.44.21	Don't you think the 
JER.44.22	And when he could no longer put up with your disgusting sins, he placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert, as it is today. 
JER.44.23	This disaster happened because you worshiped other gods and rebelled against the 
JER.44.24+JER.44.25	Then I told the men and their wives, that the 
JER.44.24+JER.44.25	Here in Egypt you still keep your promises to burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to the so-called Queen of Heaven. 
JER.44.26	Keep these promises! But let me tell you what will happen. As surely as I am the 
JER.44.27	Instead of watching over you, I will watch for chances to harm you. Some of you will die in war, and others will starve to death. 
JER.44.28	Only a few will escape and return to Judah. Then everyone who went to live in Egypt will know that when I say something will happen, it will—no matter what you say.
JER.44.29	And here is how you will know that I will keep my threats to punish you in Egypt. 
JER.44.30	 I will hand over King Hophra of Egypt to those who want to kill him,
JER.45.2	Then later, the 
JER.45.3	You are moaning and blaming me, the 
JER.45.4	But all over the earth I am tearing down what I built and pulling up what I planted. 
JER.45.5	I am bringing disaster everywhere, so don't even think about making any big plans for yourself. However, I promise that wherever you go, I will at least protect you from death. I, the 
JER.46.1	The 
JER.46.3	It's time to go into battle!
JER.46.3	So grab your shields,
JER.46.4	saddle your horses,
JER.46.4	and polish your spears.
JER.46.4	Put on your helmets and armor,
JER.46.4	then take your positions.
JER.46.5	I can see the battle now—
JER.46.5	you are defeated
JER.46.5	and running away,
JER.46.5	never once looking back.
JER.46.5	Terror is all around.
JER.46.6	You are strong and run fast,
JER.46.6	but you can't escape.
JER.46.6	You fall in battle
JER.46.6	near the Euphrates River.
JER.46.7	What nation is this,
JER.46.7	that rises like the Nile River
JER.46.7	overflowing its banks?
JER.46.8	It is Egypt, rising with a roar
JER.46.8	like a raging river
JER.46.8	and saying,
JER.46.8	“I'll flood the earth,
JER.46.8	destroying cities, and killing
JER.46.8	everyone in them.”
JER.46.9	Go ahead, Egypt.
JER.46.9	Tell your chariots and cavalry
JER.46.9	to attack and fight hard.
JER.46.9	Order your troops to march out,
JER.46.9	with Ethiopians
JER.46.9	carrying shields,
JER.46.9	and the Lydians
JER.46.9	and arrows.
JER.46.10	But the 
JER.46.10	will win this battle
JER.46.10	and take revenge
JER.46.10	on his enemies.
JER.46.10	His sword will eat them
JER.46.10	and drink their blood
JER.46.10	until it is full.
JER.46.10	They will be killed in the north
JER.46.10	near the Euphrates River,
JER.46.10	as a sacrifice to the 
JER.46.11	Egypt, no medicine can heal you,
JER.46.11	not even the soothing lotion
JER.46.11	from Gilead.
JER.46.12	All nations have heard you weep;
JER.46.12	you are disgraced,
JER.46.12	and they know it.
JER.46.12	Your troops fall to the ground,
JER.46.12	stumbling over each other.
JER.46.13+JER.46.14	Prepare to defend yourselves!
JER.46.13+JER.46.14	Everywhere in your nation,
JER.46.13+JER.46.14	people are dying in war.
JER.46.15	I have struck down
JER.46.15	your mighty god Apis
JER.46.15	and chased him away.
JER.46.16	Your soldiers stumble
JER.46.16	over each other
JER.46.16	and say, “Get up!
JER.46.16	The enemy will kill us,
JER.46.16	unless we can escape
JER.46.16	to our own land.”
JER.46.17	Give the king of Egypt
JER.46.17	this new name,
JER.46.17	“Talks-Big-Does-Nothing.”
JER.46.18	Egypt, I am the true king,
JER.46.18	the 
JER.46.18	and as surely as I live,
JER.46.18	those enemies who attack
JER.46.18	will tower over you
JER.46.18	like Mount Tabor among the hills
JER.46.18	or Mount Carmel by the sea.
JER.46.19	You will be led away captive,
JER.46.19	so pack a few things
JER.46.19	to bring with you.
JER.46.19	Your capital, Memphis,
JER.46.19	will lie empty and in ruins.
JER.46.20	An enemy from the north
JER.46.20	will attack you, beautiful Egypt,
JER.46.20	like a fly biting a cow.
JER.46.21	The foreign soldiers you hired
JER.46.21	will turn and run.
JER.46.21	But they are doomed,
JER.46.21	like well-fed calves
JER.46.21	being led to the butcher.
JER.46.21	* 
JER.46.22	The enemy army will go forward
JER.46.22	like a swarm of locusts.
JER.46.22	Your troops will feel helpless,
JER.46.22	like a snake in a forest
JER.46.23	when men with axes
JER.46.23	start chopping down trees.
JER.46.23	It can only hiss
JER.46.23	and try to escape.
JER.46.24	Your people will be disgraced
JER.46.24	and captured by the enemy
JER.46.24	from the north.
JER.46.25	I am the 
JER.46.26	I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar and his army. But I also promise that Egypt will someday have people living here again, just as it had before. I, the 
JER.46.27	Someday I will bring you home
JER.46.27	from foreign lands.
JER.46.27	You and your descendants
JER.46.27	will live in peace and safety,
JER.46.27	with nothing to fear.
JER.46.28	So don't be afraid,
JER.46.28	even though now
JER.46.28	you deserve to be punished
JER.46.28	and have been scattered
JER.46.28	among other nations.
JER.46.28	But when I destroy them,
JER.46.28	I will protect you.
JER.46.28	I, the 
JER.47.2	I, the 
JER.47.2	that your land will be flooded
JER.47.2	with an army from the north.
JER.47.2	It will destroy your towns
JER.47.2	and sweep you away,
JER.47.2	moaning and screaming.
JER.47.3	When you hear the thunder
JER.47.3	of horses and chariots,
JER.47.3	your courage will vanish,
JER.47.3	and parents will even abandon
JER.47.3	their own children.
JER.47.4	You refugees from Crete,
JER.47.4	your time has now come,
JER.47.4	and I will destroy you.
JER.47.4	None of you will be left
JER.47.4	to help the cities
JER.47.4	of Tyre and Sidon.
JER.47.5	The Anakim who survive
JER.47.5	in Gaza and Ashkelon
JER.47.5	will mourn for you
JER.47.5	by shaving their heads
JER.47.5	and sitting in silence.
JER.47.6	You ask how long will I continue
JER.47.6	to attack you with my sword,
JER.47.6	then you tell me to put it away
JER.47.6	and leave you alone.
JER.47.7	But how can my sword rest,
JER.47.7	when I have commanded it
JER.47.7	to attack Ashkelon
JER.47.7	and the seacoast?
JER.48.1	The town of Nebo is doomed;
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim will be captured
JER.48.1	and disgraced,
JER.48.1	and even its fortress
JER.48.1	will be left in ruins.
JER.48.2	No one honors you, Moab.
JER.48.2	In Heshbon, enemies make plans
JER.48.2	to end your life.
JER.48.2	My sword will leave only silence
JER.48.2	in your town named “Quiet.”
JER.48.3	The people of Horonaim
JER.48.3	will cry for help,
JER.48.3	as their town is attacked
JER.48.3	and destroyed.
JER.48.4	Moab will be shattered!
JER.48.4	Your children will sob
JER.48.5	and cry on their way up
JER.48.5	to the town of Luhith;
JER.48.5	on the road to Horonaim
JER.48.5	they will tell of disasters.
JER.48.6	Run for your lives!
JER.48.6	Head into the desert
JER.48.6	like a wild donkey.
JER.48.7	You thought you could be saved
JER.48.7	by your power and wealth,
JER.48.7	but you will be captured
JER.48.7	along with your god Chemosh,
JER.48.7	his priests, and officials.
JER.48.8	Not one of your towns
JER.48.8	will escape destruction.
JER.48.8	I have told your enemies,
JER.48.8	“Wipe out the valley
JER.48.8	and the flatlands of Moab.
JER.48.9	Spread salt on the ground
JER.48.9	to kill the crops.
JER.48.9	Leave its towns in ruins,
JER.48.9	with no one living there.
JER.48.10	I want you to kill the Moabites,
JER.48.10	and if you let them escape,
JER.48.10	I will put a curse on you.”
JER.48.11	Moab, you are like wine
JER.48.11	left to settle undisturbed,
JER.48.11	never poured from jar to jar.
JER.48.11	And so, your nation continues
JER.48.11	to prosper and improve.
JER.48.12	But now, I will send enemies
JER.48.12	to pour out the wine
JER.48.12	and smash the jars!
JER.48.13	Then you will be ashamed,
JER.48.13	because your god Chemosh
JER.48.13	cannot save you,
JER.48.13	just as Bethel
JER.48.13	the Israelites.
JER.48.14	You claim that your soldiers
JER.48.14	are strong and brave.
JER.48.15	But I am the 
JER.48.15	the all-powerful King,
JER.48.15	and I promise that enemies
JER.48.15	will overpower your towns.
JER.48.15	Even your best warriors
JER.48.15	will die in the battle.
JER.48.16	It won't be long now—
JER.48.16	disaster will hit Moab!
JER.48.17	I will order the nearby nations
JER.48.17	to mourn for you and say,
JER.48.17	“Isn't it sad? Moab ruled others,
JER.48.17	but now its glorious power
JER.48.17	has been shattered.”
JER.48.18	People in the town of Dibon,
JER.48.18	you will be honored no more,
JER.48.18	so have a seat in the dust.
JER.48.18	Your walls will be torn down
JER.48.18	when the enemies attack.
JER.48.19	You people of Aroer,
JER.48.19	go wait beside the road,
JER.48.19	and when refugees run by,
JER.48.19	ask them, “What happened?”
JER.48.20	They will answer,
JER.48.20	“Moab has been defeated!
JER.48.20	Weep with us in shame.
JER.48.20	Tell everyone at the Arnon River
JER.48.20	that Moab is destroyed.”
JER.48.21	I will punish every town
JER.48.21	that belongs to Moab,
JER.48.21	but especially Holon,
JER.48.21	Jahzah, Mephaath,
JER.48.22	Dibon, Nebo,
JER.48.22	Beth-Diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	Kiriathaim,
JER.48.23	Beth-Gamul, Beth-Meon,
JER.48.24	Kerioth, and Bozrah.
JER.48.25	My decision is final—
JER.48.25	your army will be crushed,
JER.48.25	and your power broken.
JER.48.26	People of Moab, you claim
JER.48.26	to be stronger than I am.
JER.48.26	Now I will tell other nations
JER.48.26	to make you drunk
JER.48.26	and to laugh while you collapse
JER.48.26	in your own vomit.
JER.48.27	You made fun of my people
JER.48.27	and treated them like criminals
JER.48.27	caught in the act.
JER.48.28	Now you must leave your towns
JER.48.28	and live like doves
JER.48.28	in the shelter of cliffs
JER.48.28	and canyons.
JER.48.29	I know about your pride,
JER.48.29	and how you strut and boast.
JER.48.30	But I also know bragging
JER.48.30	will never save you.
JER.48.31	So I will cry and mourn
JER.48.31	for Moab
JER.48.31	and its town of Kir-Heres.
JER.48.32	People of Sibmah,
JER.48.32	you were like a vineyard
JER.48.32	heavy with grapes,
JER.48.32	and with branches reaching
JER.48.32	north to the town of Jazer
JER.48.32	and west to the Dead Sea.
JER.48.32	But you have been destroyed,
JER.48.32	and so I will weep for you,
JER.48.32	as the people of Jazer weep
JER.48.32	for the vineyards.
JER.48.33	Harvest celebrations are gone
JER.48.33	from the orchards and farms
JER.48.33	of Moab.
JER.48.33	I have silenced the shouts
JER.48.33	of people making wine.
JER.48.34	Weeping from Heshbon
JER.48.34	can be heard as far
JER.48.34	as Elealeh and Jahaz;
JER.48.34	cries from Zoar are heard
JER.48.34	in Horonaim
JER.48.34	and Eglath-Shelishiyah.
JER.48.34	And Nimrim Creek has run dry.
JER.48.35	I will get rid of anyone
JER.48.35	who burns incense
JER.48.35	to the gods of Moab
JER.48.35	or offers sacrifices
JER.48.35	at their shrines.
JER.48.35	I, the 
JER.48.36	In my heart I moan for Moab,
JER.48.36	like a funeral song
JER.48.36	played on a flute.
JER.48.36	I mourn for the people
JER.48.36	of the town of Kir-Heres,
JER.48.36	because their wealth is gone.
JER.48.36	* 
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	The people of Moab
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	mourn on the rooftops
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	and in the streets.
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	Men cut off their beards,
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	people shave their heads;
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	they make cuts on their hands
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	and wear sackcloth.
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	And it's all because I, the 
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	have shattered Moab like a jar
JER.48.37+JER.48.38	that no one wants.
JER.48.39	Moab lies broken!
JER.48.39	Listen to its people cry
JER.48.39	as they turn away in shame.
JER.48.39	Other nations are horrified
JER.48.39	at what happened,
JER.48.39	but still they mock her.
JER.48.40	Moab, an enemy swoops down
JER.48.40	like an eagle spreading its wings
JER.48.40	over your land.
JER.48.41	Your cities
JER.48.41	will be captured,
JER.48.41	and your warriors as fearful
JER.48.41	as women giving birth.
JER.48.42	You are finished as a nation,
JER.48.42	because you dared oppose me,
JER.48.42	the 
JER.48.43	Terror, pits, and traps
JER.48.43	are waiting for you.
JER.48.44	If you are terrified and run,
JER.48.44	you will fall into a pit;
JER.48.44	and if you crawl out of the pit,
JER.48.44	you'll get caught in a trap.
JER.48.44	The time has come
JER.48.44	for you to be punished.
JER.48.44	I, the 
JER.48.45	Near the city of Heshbon,
JER.48.45	where Sihon once ruled,
JER.48.45	tired refugees stand in shadows
JER.48.45	cast by the flames
JER.48.45	of their burning city.
JER.48.45	Soon, the towns on other hilltops,
JER.48.45	where those warlike people live,
JER.48.45	will also go up in smoke.
JER.48.46	People of Moab, you worshiped
JER.48.46	Chemosh, your god,
JER.48.46	but now you are done for,
JER.48.46	and your children are prisoners
JER.48.46	in a foreign country.
JER.48.47	Yet someday, I will bring
JER.48.47	your people back home.
JER.48.47	I, the 
JER.49.1	The people of Israel
JER.49.1	have plenty of children
JER.49.1	to inherit their lands.
JER.49.1	So why have you worshipers
JER.49.1	of the god Milcom
JER.49.1	taken over towns and land
JER.49.1	belonging to the tribe of Gad?
JER.49.2	Someday I will send an army
JER.49.2	to attack you in Rabbah,
JER.49.2	your capital city.
JER.49.2	It will be left in ruins,
JER.49.2	and the surrounding villages
JER.49.2	will lie in ashes.
JER.49.2	You took some of Israel's land,
JER.49.2	but on that day
JER.49.2	Israel will take yours!
JER.49.3	Cry, people of Heshbon;
JER.49.3	your town will become
JER.49.3	a pile of rubble.
JER.49.3	You will turn here and there,
JER.49.3	but your path will be blocked.
JER.49.3	Put on sackcloth
JER.49.3	you citizens of Rabbah,
JER.49.3	because the idol you worship
JER.49.3	will be taken
JER.49.3	to a foreign country,
JER.49.3	along with its priests
JER.49.3	and temple officials.
JER.49.4	You rebellious Ammonites
JER.49.4	trust your wealth and ask,
JER.49.4	“Who could attack us?”
JER.49.4	But I warn you not to boast
JER.49.4	when your strength is fading.
JER.49.5	I, the 
JER.49.5	will send neighboring nations
JER.49.5	to strike you with terror.
JER.49.5	You will be scattered,
JER.49.5	with no one to care
JER.49.5	for your refugees.
JER.49.6	Yet someday, I will bring
JER.49.6	your people back home.
JER.49.6	I, the 
JER.49.7	Wisdom and common sense
JER.49.7	have vanished from Teman.
JER.49.8	I will send disaster to punish
JER.49.8	you descendants of Esau,
JER.49.8	so anyone from Dedan
JER.49.8	had better turn around
JER.49.8	and run back home.
JER.49.9	People who harvest grapes
JER.49.9	leave some for the poor.
JER.49.9	Thieves who break in at night
JER.49.9	take only what they want.
JER.49.10	But I will take everything
JER.49.10	that belongs to you,
JER.49.10	people of Edom,
JER.49.10	and I will uncover every place
JER.49.10	where you try to hide.
JER.49.10	Then you will die,
JER.49.10	and so will your children,
JER.49.10	relatives, and neighbors.
JER.49.11	But I can be trusted
JER.49.11	to care for your orphans
JER.49.11	and widows.
JER.49.12	Even those nations that don't deserve to be punished will have to drink from the cup of my anger. So how can you possibly hope to escape? 
JER.49.13	I, the 
JER.49.14	I have sent a messenger
JER.49.14	to command the nations
JER.49.14	to prepare for war
JER.49.14	against you people of Edom.
JER.49.15	Your nation will be small,
JER.49.15	yet hated by other nations.
JER.49.16	Pride tricks you into thinking
JER.49.16	that other nations
JER.49.16	look at you with fear.
JER.49.16	You live along the cliffs
JER.49.16	and high in the mountains
JER.49.16	like the eagles,
JER.49.16	but I am the 
JER.49.16	and I will bring you down.
JER.49.17	People passing by your country
JER.49.17	will be shocked and horrified
JER.49.17	to see a disaster
JER.49.18	of Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.49.18	and towns nearby.
JER.49.18	The towns of Edom will be empty.
JER.49.19	like a lion from the forest,
JER.49.19	attacking sheep in a meadow
JER.49.19	along the Jordan.
JER.49.19	In a moment the flock runs,
JER.49.19	and the land is empty.
JER.49.19	Who will I choose to attack you?
JER.49.19	I will do it myself!
JER.49.19	No one can force me to fight
JER.49.19	or chase me away.
JER.49.20	Listen to my plans for you,
JER.49.20	people of Edom.
JER.49.20	Your children will be dragged off
JER.49.20	and your country destroyed.
JER.49.21	The sounds of your destruction
JER.49.21	will reach the Red Sea
JER.49.21	and cause the earth to shake.
JER.49.22	An enemy will swoop down
JER.49.22	to attack you,
JER.49.22	like an eagle spreading its wings
JER.49.22	and circling over Bozrah.
JER.49.22	Your warriors will be as fearful
JER.49.22	as women giving birth.
JER.49.23	The towns of Hamath and Arpad
JER.49.23	have heard your bad news.
JER.49.23	They have lost hope,
JER.49.23	and worries roll over them
JER.49.23	like ocean waves.
JER.49.24	You people of Damascus
JER.49.24	have lost your courage,
JER.49.24	and in panic you turn to run,
JER.49.24	gripped by fear and pain.
JER.49.25	Once I was pleased
JER.49.25	with your famous city.
JER.49.25	But now I warn you, “Escape
JER.49.25	while you still can!”
JER.49.26	Soon, even your best soldiers
JER.49.26	will lie dead in your streets.
JER.49.26	I, the 
JER.49.26	have spoken.
JER.49.27	I will set fire to your city walls
JER.49.27	and burn down the fortresses
JER.49.27	King Benhadad built.
JER.49.28	Here is what the 
JER.49.28	Listen, you people of Kedar
JER.49.28	and the other tribes
JER.49.28	of the eastern desert.
JER.49.28	I have told Nebuchadnezzar
JER.49.28	to attack and destroy you.
JER.49.29	His fearsome army
JER.49.29	will surround you,
JER.49.29	taking your tents and possessions,
JER.49.29	your sheep and camels.
JER.49.30	Run and hide,
JER.49.30	you people of the desert
JER.49.30	who live in villages!
JER.49.30	Nebuchadnezzar has big plans
JER.49.30	for you.
JER.49.31	You have no city walls
JER.49.31	and no neighbors to help,
JER.49.31	yet you think you're safe—
JER.49.31	so I told him to attack.
JER.49.32	Then your camels
JER.49.32	and large herds
JER.49.32	will be yours no longer.
JER.49.32	People of the Arabian Desert,
JER.49.32	disaster will strike you
JER.49.32	from every side,
JER.49.32	and you will be scattered
JER.49.32	everywhere on earth.
JER.49.33	Only jackals
JER.49.33	where your villages
JER.49.33	I, the 
JER.49.34+JER.49.35	Not long after Zedekiah
JER.49.34+JER.49.35	People of Elam,
JER.49.34+JER.49.35	I, the 
JER.49.34+JER.49.35	will kill the archers
JER.49.34+JER.49.35	who make your army strong.
JER.49.36	Enemies will attack
JER.49.36	from all directions,
JER.49.36	and you will be led captive
JER.49.36	to every nation on earth.
JER.49.37	Their armies will crush
JER.49.37	and kill you,
JER.49.37	and you will face the disaster
JER.49.37	that my anger brings.
JER.49.38	Your king and his officials
JER.49.38	will die, and I will rule
JER.49.38	in their place.
JER.49.38	I, the 
JER.49.39	But I promise that someday
JER.49.39	I will bring your people
JER.49.39	back to their land.
JER.50.1	Announce what will happen
JER.50.1	and don't leave anything out.
JER.50.2	Raise the signal flags;
JER.50.2	shout so all nations can hear—
JER.50.2	Babylon will be captured!
JER.50.2	Marduk,
JER.50.2	will be ashamed and terrified,
JER.50.2	and his idols broken.
JER.50.3	The attack on the Babylonians
JER.50.3	will come from the north;
JER.50.3	they and their animals will run,
JER.50.3	leaving the land empty.
JER.50.4	The 
JER.50.4	People of Israel and Judah,
JER.50.4	when these things happen
JER.50.4	you will weep, and together
JER.50.4	you will return to your land
JER.50.4	and worship me,
JER.50.4	the 
JER.50.5	You will ask the way to Zion
JER.50.5	and then come and join with me
JER.50.5	in making an agreement
JER.50.5	you won't break or forget.
JER.50.6	My people, you are lost sheep
JER.50.6	abandoned in the mountains
JER.50.6	by their shepherds.
JER.50.6	You don't even remember
JER.50.6	your resting place.
JER.50.7	I am your true pastureland,
JER.50.7	the one who gave hope
JER.50.7	to your ancestors.
JER.50.7	But you abandoned me,
JER.50.7	so when your enemies found you,
JER.50.7	they felt no guilt
JER.50.7	as they gobbled you up.
JER.50.8	my people.
JER.50.8	Get out of that country!
JER.50.8	Don't wait for anyone else.
JER.50.9	In the north I am bringing
JER.50.9	great nations together.
JER.50.9	They will attack Babylon
JER.50.9	and capture it.
JER.50.9	The arrows they shoot
JER.50.9	are like the best soldiers,
JER.50.9	always finding their target.
JER.50.10	Babylonia will be conquered,
JER.50.10	and its enemies will carry off
JER.50.10	everything they want.
JER.50.11	People of Babylonia,
JER.50.11	you were glad
JER.50.11	to rob my people.
JER.50.11	You had a good time,
JER.50.11	making more noise
JER.50.11	than horses
JER.50.11	and jumping around
JER.50.11	like calves threshing grain.
JER.50.12	The city of Babylon
JER.50.12	was like a mother to you.
JER.50.12	But it will be disgraced
JER.50.12	and become nothing
JER.50.12	but a barren desert.
JER.50.13	My anger will destroy Babylon,
JER.50.13	and no one will live there.
JER.50.13	Everyone who passes by
JER.50.13	will be shocked to see
JER.50.13	what has happened.
JER.50.14	Babylon has rebelled against me.
JER.50.14	Archers, take your places.
JER.50.14	Shoot all your arrows at Babylon.
JER.50.15	Attack from every side!
JER.50.15	Babylon surrenders!
JER.50.15	The enemy tears down
JER.50.15	its walls and towers.
JER.50.15	I am taking my revenge
JER.50.15	by doing to Babylon what it did
JER.50.15	to other cities.
JER.50.16	There is no one in Babylonia
JER.50.16	to plant or harvest crops.
JER.50.16	Even foreigners who lived there
JER.50.16	have left for their homelands,
JER.50.16	afraid of the enemy armies.
JER.50.17	Israel is a flock of sheep
JER.50.17	scattered by hungry lions.
JER.50.17	The king of Assyria
JER.50.17	first gobbled Israel up.
JER.50.17	Then Nebuchadnezzar,
JER.50.17	king of Babylonia,
JER.50.17	crunched on Israel's bones.
JER.50.18	I, the 
JER.50.18	the God of Israel,
JER.50.18	punished the king of Assyria,
JER.50.18	and I will also punish
JER.50.18	the king of Babylonia.
JER.50.19	But I will bring Israel
JER.50.19	back to its own land.
JER.50.19	The people will be like sheep
JER.50.19	eating their fill
JER.50.19	on Mount Carmel
JER.50.19	and in Bashan,
JER.50.19	in the hill country of Ephraim
JER.50.19	and in Gilead.
JER.50.20	I will rescue a few people
JER.50.20	from Israel and Judah.
JER.50.20	I will forgive them so completely
JER.50.20	that their sin and guilt
JER.50.20	will disappear,
JER.50.20	never to be found.
JER.50.21	The 
JER.50.21	I have told
JER.50.21	the enemies of Babylonia,
JER.50.21	“Attack the people of Merathaim
JER.50.21	and Pekod.
JER.50.21	Kill them all!
JER.50.21	Destroy their possessions!”
JER.50.22	Sounds of war
JER.50.22	and the noise of destruction
JER.50.22	can be heard.
JER.50.23	Babylonia was a hammer
JER.50.23	pounding every country,
JER.50.23	but now it lies broken.
JER.50.23	What a shock to the nations
JER.50.23	of the world!
JER.50.24	Babylonia challenged me,
JER.50.24	the 
JER.50.24	but that nation doesn't know
JER.50.24	it is caught in a trap
JER.50.24	that I set.
JER.50.25	I've brought out my weapons,
JER.50.25	and with them I will put a curse
JER.50.25	on Babylonia.
JER.50.26	Come from far away,
JER.50.26	you enemies of Babylon!
JER.50.26	Pile up the grain
JER.50.26	from its storehouses,
JER.50.26	and destroy it completely,
JER.50.26	along with everything else.
JER.50.27	Kill the soldiers of Babylonia,
JER.50.27	because the time has come
JER.50.27	for them to be punished.
JER.50.28	The Babylonian army
JER.50.28	destroyed my temple,
JER.50.28	but soon I will take revenge.
JER.50.28	Then refugees from Babylon
JER.50.28	will tell about it in Zion.
JER.50.29	set up camp around the city,
JER.50.29	and don't let anyone escape.
JER.50.29	It challenged me, the holy God,
JER.50.29	so do to it
JER.50.29	what it did to other cities.
JER.50.30	People of Babylon,
JER.50.30	I, the 
JER.50.30	that even your best soldiers
JER.50.30	will lie dead in the streets.
JER.50.31	Babylon, you should be named,
JER.50.31	“The Proud One.”
JER.50.31	But the time has come when I,
JER.50.31	the 
JER.50.31	will punish you.
JER.50.32	You are proud,
JER.50.32	but you will stumble and fall,
JER.50.32	and no one will help you up.
JER.50.32	I will set your villages on fire,
JER.50.32	and everything around you
JER.50.32	will go up in flames.
JER.50.33	You Babylonians were cruel
JER.50.33	to Israel and Judah.
JER.50.33	You took them captive, and now
JER.50.33	you refuse to let them go.
JER.50.34	But I, the 
JER.50.34	will rescue and protect them.
JER.50.34	I will bring peace to their land
JER.50.34	and trouble to yours.
JER.50.35	I have declared war on you,
JER.50.35	your officials, and advisors.
JER.50.36	This war will prove
JER.50.36	that your prophets
JER.50.36	are liars and fools.
JER.50.36	And it will frighten
JER.50.36	your warriors.
JER.50.37	Then your chariot horses
JER.50.37	and the foreigners in your army
JER.50.37	will refuse to go into battle,
JER.50.37	and the enemy will carry away
JER.50.37	everything you treasure.
JER.50.38	Your rivers and canals
JER.50.38	will dry up.
JER.50.38	All of this will happen,
JER.50.38	because your land
JER.50.38	is full of idols,
JER.50.38	and they have made fools
JER.50.38	of you.
JER.50.39	in your land—
JER.50.39	only desert animals, jackals,
JER.50.39	and unclean birds.
JER.50.40	and the nearby towns,
JER.50.40	and I will destroy Babylon
JER.50.40	just as completely.
JER.50.40	No one will live there again.
JER.50.41	Far to the north,
JER.50.41	a nation and its allies
JER.50.41	have been awakened.
JER.50.41	They are powerful
JER.50.41	and ready for war.
JER.50.42	Bows and arrows and swords
JER.50.42	are in their hands.
JER.50.42	The soldiers are cruel
JER.50.42	and show no pity.
JER.50.42	The hoofbeats of their horses echo
JER.50.42	like ocean waves
JER.50.42	crashing against the shore.
JER.50.42	The army has lined up for battle
JER.50.42	and is coming to attack you,
JER.50.42	people of Babylonia!
JER.50.43	Ever since your king heard
JER.50.43	about this army,
JER.50.43	he has been weak with fear;
JER.50.43	he twists and turns in pain
JER.50.43	like a woman giving birth.
JER.50.44	Babylonia, I will attack you
JER.50.44	like a lion from the forest,
JER.50.44	attacking sheep in a meadow
JER.50.44	along the Jordan.
JER.50.44	In a moment the flock runs,
JER.50.44	and the land is empty.
JER.50.44	Who will I choose to attack you?
JER.50.44	I will do it myself!
JER.50.44	No one can force me to fight
JER.50.44	or chase me away.
JER.50.45	Listen to my plans for you,
JER.50.45	people of Babylonia.
JER.50.45	Your children will be dragged off,
JER.50.45	and your country destroyed.
JER.50.46	The sounds of your destruction
JER.50.46	will be heard among the nations,
JER.50.46	and the earth will shake.
JER.51.1	I, the 
JER.51.1	a wind
JER.51.1	the people of Babylonia
JER.51.1	and Babylon, its capital.
JER.51.2	Foreign soldiers will come
JER.51.2	from every direction,
JER.51.2	and when the disaster is over,
JER.51.2	Babylonia will be empty
JER.51.2	and worthless.
JER.51.3	I will tell these soldiers,
JER.51.3	“Attack quickly,
JER.51.3	before the Babylonians
JER.51.3	can string their bows
JER.51.3	or put on their armor.
JER.51.3	Kill their best soldiers
JER.51.3	and destroy their army!”
JER.51.4	Their troops will fall wounded
JER.51.4	in the streets of Babylon.
JER.51.5	Everyone in Israel and Judah
JER.51.5	is guilty.
JER.51.5	But I, the 
JER.51.5	their holy God,
JER.51.5	have not abandoned them.
JER.51.6	Get out of Babylon!
JER.51.6	Run for your lives!
JER.51.6	If you stay, you will be killed
JER.51.6	when I take revenge on the city
JER.51.6	and punish it for its sins.
JER.51.7	filled with the wine
JER.51.7	of my anger.
JER.51.7	The nations of the world
JER.51.7	got drunk on this wine
JER.51.7	and went insane.
JER.51.8	But suddenly, Babylon will fall
JER.51.8	and be destroyed.
JER.51.8	I, the 
JER.51.8	who lived there,
JER.51.8	“Weep for the city!
JER.51.8	Get medicine for its wounds;
JER.51.8	maybe they will heal.”
JER.51.9	The foreigners answered,
JER.51.9	“We have already tried
JER.51.9	to treat Babylon's wounds,
JER.51.9	but they would not heal.
JER.51.9	Come on, let's all go home
JER.51.9	to our own countries.
JER.51.9	Nothing is left in Babylonia;
JER.51.9	everything is destroyed.”
JER.51.10	The people of Israel said,
JER.51.10	“Tell everyone in Zion!
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.10	for what Babylon did to us.”
JER.51.11	I, the 
JER.51.11	want Babylon destroyed,
JER.51.11	because its army
JER.51.11	destroyed my temple.
JER.51.11	So, you kings of Media,
JER.51.11	sharpen your arrows
JER.51.11	and pick up your shields.
JER.51.12	Raise the signal flag
JER.51.12	and attack the city walls.
JER.51.12	Post more guards.
JER.51.12	Have soldiers watch the city
JER.51.12	and set up ambushes.
JER.51.12	I have made plans
JER.51.12	to destroy Babylon,
JER.51.12	and nothing will stop me.
JER.51.13	along the Euphrates River
JER.51.13	and are surrounded by canals.
JER.51.13	You are rich,
JER.51.13	but now the time has come
JER.51.13	for you to die.
JER.51.14	I, the 
JER.51.14	swear by my own life
JER.51.14	that enemy soldiers
JER.51.14	will fill your streets
JER.51.14	like a swarm of locusts.
JER.51.14	They will shout
JER.51.14	and celebrate their victory.
JER.51.15	God used his wisdom and power
JER.51.15	to create the earth
JER.51.15	and spread out the heavens.
JER.51.16	The waters in the heavens roar
JER.51.16	at his command.
JER.51.16	He makes clouds appear;
JER.51.16	he sends the wind
JER.51.16	from his storehouse
JER.51.16	and makes lightning flash
JER.51.16	in the rain.
JER.51.17	People who make idols
JER.51.17	are stupid!
JER.51.17	They will be disappointed,
JER.51.17	because their false gods
JER.51.17	cannot breathe.
JER.51.18	Idols are merely a joke,
JER.51.18	and when the time is right,
JER.51.18	they will be destroyed.
JER.51.19	But the 
JER.51.19	is all-powerful.
JER.51.19	He created everything,
JER.51.19	and he chose Israel
JER.51.19	to be his very own.
JER.51.20	Babylonia, you were my hammer;
JER.51.20	I used you to pound nations
JER.51.20	and break kingdoms,
JER.51.21	to shatter cavalry and chariots,
JER.51.22	as well as men and women,
JER.51.22	young and old,
JER.51.23	shepherds and their flocks,
JER.51.23	farmers and their oxen,
JER.51.23	and governors and leaders.
JER.51.24	But now, my people will watch,
JER.51.24	while I repay you
JER.51.24	for what you did to Zion.
JER.51.25	You destroyed the nations
JER.51.25	and seem strong as a mountain,
JER.51.25	but I am your enemy.
JER.51.25	I might even grab you
JER.51.25	and roll you off a cliff.
JER.51.25	When I am finished,
JER.51.25	you'll only be a pile
JER.51.25	of scorched bricks.
JER.51.26	Your stone blocks won't be reused
JER.51.26	for cornerstones
JER.51.26	or foundations,
JER.51.26	and I promise that forever
JER.51.26	you will be a desert.
JER.51.26	I, the 
JER.51.27	Signal the nations
JER.51.27	to get ready to attack.
JER.51.27	Raise a flag and blow a trumpet.
JER.51.27	Send for the armies of Ararat,
JER.51.27	Minni, and Ashkenaz.
JER.51.27	Choose a commander;
JER.51.27	let the cavalry attack
JER.51.27	like a swarm of locusts.
JER.51.28	Tell the kings and governors,
JER.51.28	the leaders and the people
JER.51.28	of the kingdoms of the Medes
JER.51.28	to prepare for war!
JER.51.29	The earth twists and turns
JER.51.29	in torment,
JER.51.29	because I have decided
JER.51.29	to make Babylonia a desert
JER.51.29	where no one can live,
JER.51.29	and I won't change my mind.
JER.51.30	The Babylonian soldiers
JER.51.30	have lost their strength
JER.51.30	and courage.
JER.51.30	They stay in their fortresses,
JER.51.30	unable to fight,
JER.51.30	while the enemy breaks through
JER.51.30	the city gates,
JER.51.30	then sets their homes on fire.
JER.51.31	One messenger after another
JER.51.31	announces to the king,
JER.51.31	“Babylon has been captured!
JER.51.32	The enemy now controls
JER.51.32	the river crossings!
JER.51.32	The marshes
JER.51.32	Your army has panicked!”
JER.51.33	I am the 
JER.51.33	the God of Israel,
JER.51.33	and I make this promise—
JER.51.33	“Soon Babylon will be leveled
JER.51.33	and packed down
JER.51.33	like a threshing place
JER.51.33	at harvest time.”
JER.51.34	The people of Jerusalem say,
JER.51.34	“King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.51.34	made us panic.
JER.51.34	That monster stuffed himself
JER.51.34	with us and our treasures,
JER.51.34	leaving us empty—
JER.51.34	he gobbled up
JER.51.34	what he wanted
JER.51.34	and spit out the rest.
JER.51.35	The people of Babylonia
JER.51.35	harmed some of us
JER.51.35	and killed others.
JER.51.35	Now, 
JER.51.36	My people, I am on your side,
JER.51.36	and I will take revenge
JER.51.36	on Babylon.
JER.51.36	I will cut off its water supply,
JER.51.36	and its stream
JER.51.37	Babylon will be a pile of rubble
JER.51.37	where only jackals
JER.51.37	and everyone will be afraid
JER.51.37	to walk among the ruins.
JER.51.38	The Babylonians roar and growl
JER.51.38	like young lions.
JER.51.39	And since they are hungry,
JER.51.39	I will give them a banquet.
JER.51.39	They will celebrate, get drunk,
JER.51.39	then fall asleep,
JER.51.39	never to wake up!
JER.51.40	I will lead them away to die,
JER.51.40	like sheep, lambs, and goats
JER.51.40	being led to the butcher.
JER.51.41	All nations now praise Babylon,
JER.51.41	but when it is captured,
JER.51.41	those same nations
JER.51.41	will be horrified.
JER.51.42	Babylon's enemies will rise
JER.51.42	like ocean waves
JER.51.42	and flood the city.
JER.51.43	Horrible destruction will strike
JER.51.43	the nearby towns.
JER.51.43	The land will become
JER.51.43	a barren desert,
JER.51.43	where no one can live
JER.51.43	or even travel.
JER.51.44	I will punish Marduk,
JER.51.44	the god of Babylon,
JER.51.44	and make him vomit out
JER.51.44	everything he gobbled up.
JER.51.44	Then nations will no longer
JER.51.44	bring him gifts,
JER.51.44	and Babylon's walls will crumble.
JER.51.45	Get out of Babylon, my people,
JER.51.45	and run for your lives,
JER.51.45	before I strike the city
JER.51.45	in my anger!
JER.51.46	Don't be afraid or lose hope,
JER.51.46	though year after year
JER.51.46	there are rumors
JER.51.46	of leaders fighting for control
JER.51.46	in the city of Babylon.
JER.51.47	The time will come
JER.51.47	when I will punish
JER.51.47	Babylon's false gods.
JER.51.47	Everyone there will die,
JER.51.47	and the whole nation
JER.51.47	will be disgraced,
JER.51.48	from the north
JER.51.48	and brings destruction.
JER.51.48	Then the earth and the heavens
JER.51.48	and everything in them
JER.51.48	will celebrate.
JER.51.49	because it slaughtered
JER.51.49	the people of Israel
JER.51.49	and of many other nations.
JER.51.50	My people, you escaped death
JER.51.50	when Jerusalem fell.
JER.51.50	Now you live far from home,
JER.51.50	but you should trust me
JER.51.50	and think about Jerusalem.
JER.51.50	Leave Babylon! Don't stay!
JER.51.51	You feel ashamed and disgraced,
JER.51.51	because foreigners have entered
JER.51.51	my sacred temple.
JER.51.52	Soon I will send a war
JER.51.52	to punish Babylon's idols
JER.51.52	and leave its wounded people
JER.51.52	moaning everywhere.
JER.51.53	Although Babylon's walls
JER.51.53	reach to the sky,
JER.51.53	the army I send
JER.51.53	will destroy that city.
JER.51.53	I, the 
JER.51.54	Listen to the cries for help
JER.51.54	coming from Babylon.
JER.51.54	Everywhere in the country
JER.51.54	the sounds of destruction
JER.51.54	can be heard.
JER.51.55	The shouts of the enemy,
JER.51.55	like crashing ocean waves,
JER.51.55	will drown out Babylon's cries
JER.51.55	as I level the city.
JER.51.56	An enemy will attack
JER.51.56	and destroy Babylon.
JER.51.56	Its soldiers will be captured
JER.51.56	and their weapons broken,
JER.51.56	because I am a God
JER.51.56	who takes revenge against nations
JER.51.56	for what they do.
JER.51.57	I, the 
JER.51.57	the true King, promise
JER.51.57	that the officials and advisors,
JER.51.57	the governors and leaders,
JER.51.57	and the soldiers of Babylon
JER.51.57	will get drunk, fall asleep,
JER.51.57	and never wake up.
JER.51.58	The thick walls of that city
JER.51.58	will be torn down,
JER.51.58	and its huge gates burned.
JER.51.58	Everything that nation
JER.51.58	worked so hard to gain
JER.51.58	will go up in smoke.
JER.51.59	During Zedekiah's
JER.51.60	Before they left, I wrote on a scroll
JER.51.61	I gave the scroll to Seraiah and said:
JER.51.61	When you get to Babylon, read this scroll aloud, 
JER.51.62	then pray, “Our 
JER.51.64	“This is how Babylon will sink when the 
JER.51.64	Jeremiah's writing ends here.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he was appointed king of Judah,
JER.52.2	Zedekiah disobeyed the 
JER.52.3	and it was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
JER.52.3	The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the 
JER.52.5+JER.52.6	After a year and a half,
JER.52.7	 the Babylonian troops broke through the city wall. That same night, Zedekiah and his soldiers tried to escape through the gate near the royal garden, even though they knew the enemy had the city surrounded. They headed toward the Jordan River valley, 
JER.52.8	but the Babylonian troops caught up with them near Jericho. The Babylonians arrested Zedekiah, but his soldiers scattered in every direction. 
JER.52.9	Zedekiah was taken to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar put him on trial and found him guilty. 
JER.52.10	Zedekiah's sons and the officials of Judah were killed while he watched, 
JER.52.11	 then his eyes were poked out. He was put in chains, then dragged off to Babylon and kept in prison until he died.
JER.52.12	Jerusalem was captured during Nebuchadnezzar's nineteenth year as king of Babylonia.
JER.52.12	About a month later,
JER.52.13	 and he burned down the 
JER.52.14	Then he ordered the Babylonian soldiers to break down the walls around Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	He led away the people left in the city, including everyone who had become loyal to Nebuchadnezzar, the rest of the skilled workers,
JER.52.16	Only the very poorest were left behind to work the vineyards and the fields.
JER.52.21	For example, the columns were about 8 meters high and 5.5 meters around. They were hollow, but the bronze was about 75 millimeters thick. 
JER.52.22	Each column had a bronze cap over 2 meters high that was decorated with bronze designs. Some of these designs were like chains and others were like pomegranates.
JER.52.23	There were 96 pomegranates evenly spaced
JER.52.24	Next, Nebuzaradan arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah his assistant, and three temple officials. 
JER.52.25	Then he arrested one of the army commanders, seven of King Zedekiah's personal advisors, and the officer in charge of gathering the troops for battle. He also found 60 more soldiers who were still in Jerusalem. 
JER.52.26+JER.52.27	Nebuzaradan led them to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar had them killed.
JER.52.26+JER.52.27	The people of Judah no longer lived in their own country.
JER.52.28+JER.52.29+JER.52.30	Here is a list of the number of the people of Judah that Nebuchadnezzar
JER.52.28+JER.52.29+JER.52.30	In his seventh year as king, he took 3,023 people.
JER.52.28+JER.52.29+JER.52.30	In his eighteenth year as king, he took 832 from Jerusalem.
JER.52.28+JER.52.29+JER.52.30	In his twenty-third year as king, his officer Nebuzaradan took 745 people.
JER.52.28+JER.52.29+JER.52.30	So, Nebuchadnezzar took a total of 4,600 people from Judah to Babylonia.
JER.52.31	Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon for 37 years. Then Evil Merodach
JER.52.32	Evil Merodach was kind to Jehoiachin and honored him more than any of the other kings held prisoner there. 
JER.52.33	Jehoiachin was allowed to wear regular clothes instead of a prison uniform, and he even ate at the king's table every day. 
JER.52.34	As long as Jehoiachin lived, he was paid a daily allowance to buy whatever he needed.
LAM.1.1	lies deserted and lonely.
LAM.1.1	This city that was known
LAM.1.1	all over the world
LAM.1.1	is now like a widow.
LAM.1.1	This queen of the nations
LAM.1.1	has been made a slave.
LAM.1.2	Each night, bitter tears
LAM.1.2	flood her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	None of her former lovers
LAM.1.2	are there to offer comfort;
LAM.1.2	her friends
LAM.1.2	and are now her enemies.
LAM.1.3	The people of Judah are slaves,
LAM.1.3	suffering in a foreign land,
LAM.1.3	with no rest from sorrow.
LAM.1.3	Their enemies captured them
LAM.1.3	and were terribly cruel.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion mourn
LAM.1.4	because no one travels there
LAM.1.4	to celebrate the festivals.
LAM.1.4	The city gates are deserted;
LAM.1.4	priests are weeping.
LAM.1.4	Young women are raped;
LAM.1.4	Zion is in sorrow!
LAM.1.5	Enemies now rule the city
LAM.1.5	and live as they please.
LAM.1.5	The 
LAM.1.5	because of her awful sins;
LAM.1.5	he has let her people
LAM.1.5	be dragged away.
LAM.1.6	Zion's glory has disappeared.
LAM.1.6	Her leaders are like deer
LAM.1.6	that cannot find pasture;
LAM.1.6	they are hunted down
LAM.1.6	till their strength is gone.
LAM.1.7	Her people recall the good life
LAM.1.7	that once was theirs;
LAM.1.7	now they suffer
LAM.1.7	and are scattered.
LAM.1.7	No one was there to protect them
LAM.1.7	from their enemies who sneered
LAM.1.7	when their city was taken.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem's horrible sins
LAM.1.8	have made the city a joke.
LAM.1.8	Those who once admired her
LAM.1.8	now hate her instead—
LAM.1.8	she has been disgraced;
LAM.1.8	she groans and turns away.
LAM.1.9	Her sins had made her filthy,
LAM.1.9	but she wasn't worried
LAM.1.9	about what could happen.
LAM.1.9	And when Jerusalem fell,
LAM.1.9	it was so tragic.
LAM.1.9	No one gave her comfort
LAM.1.9	when she cried out,
LAM.1.9	“Help! I'm in trouble, 
LAM.1.9	The enemy has won.”
LAM.1.10	Zion's treasures were stolen.
LAM.1.10	Jerusalem saw foreigners
LAM.1.10	enter her place of worship,
LAM.1.10	though the 
LAM.1.10	had forbidden them
LAM.1.10	to belong to his people.
LAM.1.11	Everyone in the city groans
LAM.1.11	while searching for food;
LAM.1.11	they trade their valuables
LAM.1.11	for barely enough scraps
LAM.1.11	to stay alive.
LAM.1.11	Jerusalem shouts to the 
LAM.1.11	“Please look and see
LAM.1.11	how miserable I am!”
LAM.1.12	No passerby even cares.
LAM.1.12	Why doesn't someone notice
LAM.1.12	my terrible sufferings?
LAM.1.12	You were fiercely angry, 
LAM.1.12	and you punished me
LAM.1.12	worst of all.
LAM.1.13	From heaven you sent a fire
LAM.1.13	that burned in my bones;
LAM.1.13	you set a trap for my feet
LAM.1.13	and made me turn back.
LAM.1.13	All day long you leave me
LAM.1.13	in shock from constant pain.
LAM.1.14	You have tied my sins
LAM.1.14	around my neck,
LAM.1.14	and they weigh so heavily
LAM.1.14	that my strength is gone.
LAM.1.14	You have put me in the power
LAM.1.14	of enemies too strong for me.
LAM.1.15	You, 
LAM.1.15	my warriors and crushed
LAM.1.15	my young heroes.
LAM.1.15	Judah was a woman untouched,
LAM.1.15	but you let her be trampled
LAM.1.15	like grapes in a wine pit.
LAM.1.16	Because of this, I mourn,
LAM.1.16	and tears flood my eyes.
LAM.1.16	No one is here to comfort
LAM.1.16	or to encourage me;
LAM.1.16	we have lost the war—
LAM.1.16	my people are suffering.
LAM.1.17	Zion reaches out her hands,
LAM.1.17	but no one offers comfort.
LAM.1.17	The 
LAM.1.17	the neighboring nations
LAM.1.17	against Jacob's descendants.
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem is merely a filthy rag
LAM.1.17	to her neighbors.
LAM.1.18	The 
LAM.1.18	but I refused to obey him.
LAM.1.18	Now I ask all of you to look
LAM.1.18	at my sufferings—
LAM.1.18	even my young people
LAM.1.18	have been dragged away.
LAM.1.19	I called out to my lovers,
LAM.1.19	but they betrayed me.
LAM.1.19	My priests and my leaders died
LAM.1.19	while searching the city
LAM.1.19	for scraps of food.
LAM.1.20	Won't you look and see
LAM.1.20	how upset I am, our 
LAM.1.20	My stomach is in knots,
LAM.1.20	and my heart is broken
LAM.1.20	because I betrayed you.
LAM.1.20	In the streets and at home,
LAM.1.20	my people are slaughtered.
LAM.1.21	Everyone heard my groaning,
LAM.1.21	but no one offered comfort.
LAM.1.21	My enemies know of the trouble
LAM.1.21	that you have brought on me,
LAM.1.21	and it makes them glad.
LAM.1.21	Hurry and punish them,
LAM.1.21	as you have promised.
LAM.1.22	Don't let their evil deeds
LAM.1.22	escape your sight.
LAM.1.22	Punish them as much
LAM.1.22	as you have punished me
LAM.1.22	because of my sins.
LAM.1.22	I never stop groaning—
LAM.1.22	I've lost all hope!
LAM.2.1	The Lord was angry!
LAM.2.1	So he disgraced
LAM.2.1	though it was Israel's pride
LAM.2.1	and his own place of rest.
LAM.2.1	In his anger he threw Zion down
LAM.2.1	from heaven to earth.
LAM.2.2	The 
LAM.2.2	He destroyed the homes
LAM.2.2	of Jacob's descendants.
LAM.2.2	In his anger he tore down
LAM.2.2	every walled city in Judah;
LAM.2.2	he toppled the nation
LAM.2.2	together with its leaders,
LAM.2.2	leaving them in shame.
LAM.2.3	The Lord was so furiously angry
LAM.2.3	that he wiped out
LAM.2.3	the whole army
LAM.2.3	by not supporting them
LAM.2.3	when the enemy attacked.
LAM.2.3	He was like a raging fire
LAM.2.3	that swallowed up
LAM.2.3	the descendants of Jacob.
LAM.2.4	He attacked like an enemy
LAM.2.4	with a bow and arrows,
LAM.2.4	killing our loved ones.
LAM.2.4	He has burned to the ground
LAM.2.4	the homes on Mount Zion.
LAM.2.5	The Lord was like an enemy!
LAM.2.5	He left Israel in ruins
LAM.2.5	with its palaces
LAM.2.5	and fortresses destroyed,
LAM.2.5	and with everyone in Judah
LAM.2.5	moaning and weeping.
LAM.2.6	He shattered his temple
LAM.2.6	like a hut in a garden;
LAM.2.6	he completely wiped out
LAM.2.6	his meeting place,
LAM.2.6	and did away with festivals
LAM.2.6	and Sabbaths
LAM.2.6	in the city of Zion.
LAM.2.6	In his fierce anger he rejected
LAM.2.6	our king and priests.
LAM.2.7	The Lord abandoned his altar
LAM.2.7	and his temple;
LAM.2.7	he let Zion's enemies
LAM.2.7	capture her fortresses.
LAM.2.7	Noisy shouts were heard
LAM.2.7	from the temple,
LAM.2.7	as if it were a time
LAM.2.7	of celebration.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	to tear down the walls of Zion
LAM.2.8	stone by stone.
LAM.2.8	So he started destroying
LAM.2.8	and did not stop
LAM.2.8	until walls and fortresses
LAM.2.8	mourned and trembled.
LAM.2.9	Zion's gates have fallen
LAM.2.9	facedown on the ground;
LAM.2.9	the bars that locked the gates
LAM.2.9	are smashed to pieces.
LAM.2.9	Her king and royal family
LAM.2.9	are prisoners
LAM.2.9	in foreign lands.
LAM.2.9	Her priests don't teach,
LAM.2.9	and her prophets don't have
LAM.2.9	a message from the 
LAM.2.10	Zion's leaders are silent.
LAM.2.10	They just sit on the ground,
LAM.2.10	tossing dirt on their heads
LAM.2.10	and wearing sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	Her young women can do nothing
LAM.2.10	but stare at the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes are red from crying,
LAM.2.11	my stomach is in knots,
LAM.2.11	and I feel sick all over.
LAM.2.11	My people are being wiped out,
LAM.2.11	and children lie helpless
LAM.2.11	in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	A child begs its mother
LAM.2.12	for food and drink,
LAM.2.12	then blacks out
LAM.2.12	like a wounded soldier
LAM.2.12	lying in the street.
LAM.2.12	The child slowly dies
LAM.2.12	in its mother's arms.
LAM.2.13	Zion, how can I comfort you?
LAM.2.13	How great is your pain?
LAM.2.13	Lovely city of Jerusalem,
LAM.2.13	how can I heal your wounds,
LAM.2.13	gaping as wide as the sea?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets deceived you
LAM.2.14	with false visions
LAM.2.14	and lying messages—
LAM.2.14	they should have warned you
LAM.2.14	to leave your sins
LAM.2.14	and be saved from disaster.
LAM.2.15	Those who pass by
LAM.2.15	shake their heads and sneer
LAM.2.15	as they make fun and shout,
LAM.2.15	“What a lovely city you were,
LAM.2.15	the happiest on earth,
LAM.2.15	but look at you now!”
LAM.2.16	Zion, your enemies curse you
LAM.2.16	and snarl like wild animals,
LAM.2.16	while shouting,
LAM.2.16	“This is the day
LAM.2.16	we've waited for!
LAM.2.16	At last, we've got you!”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	that he had planned
LAM.2.17	and threatened long ago.
LAM.2.17	He destroyed you without mercy
LAM.2.17	and let your enemies boast
LAM.2.17	about their powerful forces.
LAM.2.18	Zion, deep in your heart
LAM.2.18	you cried out to the Lord.
LAM.2.18	Now let your tears overflow
LAM.2.18	your walls day and night.
LAM.2.18	Don't ever lose hope
LAM.2.18	or let your tears stop.
LAM.2.19	Get up and pray for help
LAM.2.19	all through the night.
LAM.2.19	Pour out your feelings
LAM.2.19	to the Lord,
LAM.2.19	as you would pour water
LAM.2.19	out of a jug.
LAM.2.19	Beg him to save your people,
LAM.2.19	who are starving to death
LAM.2.19	at every street crossing.
LAM.2.20	Think about it, 
LAM.2.20	Have you ever been this cruel
LAM.2.20	to anyone before?
LAM.2.20	Is it right for mothers
LAM.2.20	to eat their children,
LAM.2.20	or for priests and prophets
LAM.2.20	to be killed in your temple?
LAM.2.21	My people, both young and old,
LAM.2.21	lie dead in the streets.
LAM.2.21	Because you were angry,
LAM.2.21	my young men and women
LAM.2.21	were brutally slaughtered.
LAM.2.22	When you were angry, 
LAM.2.22	you invited my enemies
LAM.2.22	like guests for a party.
LAM.2.22	No one survived that day;
LAM.2.22	enemies killed my children,
LAM.2.22	my own little ones.
LAM.3.1	I have suffered much
LAM.3.1	because God was angry.
LAM.3.2	He chased me into a dark place,
LAM.3.2	where no light could enter.
LAM.3.3	I am the only one he punishes
LAM.3.3	over and over again,
LAM.3.3	without ever stopping.
LAM.3.4	God caused my skin and flesh
LAM.3.4	to waste away,
LAM.3.4	and he crushed my bones.
LAM.3.5	He attacked and surrounded me
LAM.3.5	with hardships and trouble;
LAM.3.6	he forced me to sit in the dark
LAM.3.6	like someone long dead.
LAM.3.7	God built a fence around me
LAM.3.7	that I cannot climb over,
LAM.3.7	and he chained me down.
LAM.3.8	Even when I shouted
LAM.3.8	and prayed for help,
LAM.3.8	he refused to listen.
LAM.3.9	God put big rocks in my way
LAM.3.9	and made me follow
LAM.3.9	a crooked path.
LAM.3.10	God was like a bear or a lion
LAM.3.10	waiting in ambush for me;
LAM.3.11	he dragged me from the road,
LAM.3.11	then tore me to shreds.
LAM.3.12	God took careful aim
LAM.3.12	and shot his arrows
LAM.3.13	straight through my heart.
LAM.3.14	I am a joke to everyone—
LAM.3.14	no one ever stops
LAM.3.14	making fun of me.
LAM.3.15	God has turned my life sour.
LAM.3.16	He made me eat gravel
LAM.3.16	and rubbed me in the dirt.
LAM.3.17	I cannot find peace
LAM.3.17	or remember happiness.
LAM.3.18	I tell myself, “I am finished!
LAM.3.18	I can't count on the 
LAM.3.18	to do anything for me.”
LAM.3.19	Just thinking of my troubles
LAM.3.19	and my lonely wandering
LAM.3.19	makes me miserable.
LAM.3.20	That's all I ever think about,
LAM.3.20	and I am depressed.
LAM.3.21	Then I remember something
LAM.3.21	that fills me with hope.
LAM.3.22	The 
LAM.3.22	If he had not been merciful,
LAM.3.22	we would have been destroyed.
LAM.3.23	The 
LAM.3.23	to show mercy each morning.
LAM.3.24	Deep in my heart I say,
LAM.3.24	“The 
LAM.3.24	I can depend on him!”
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	who trusts and obeys him.
LAM.3.26	It is good to wait patiently
LAM.3.26	for the 
LAM.3.27	When we are young,
LAM.3.27	it is good to struggle hard
LAM.3.28	and to sit silently alone,
LAM.3.28	if this is what
LAM.3.28	the 
LAM.3.29	Being rubbed in the dirt
LAM.3.29	can teach us a lesson;
LAM.3.30	we can also learn from insults
LAM.3.30	and hard knocks.
LAM.3.31	The Lord won't always reject us!
LAM.3.32	He causes a lot of suffering,
LAM.3.32	but he also has pity
LAM.3.32	because of his great love.
LAM.3.33	The Lord doesn't enjoy
LAM.3.33	sending grief or pain.
LAM.3.34	Don't trample prisoners
LAM.3.34	under your feet
LAM.3.35	or cheat anyone out of
LAM.3.35	what is rightfully theirs.
LAM.3.35	God Most High sees everything,
LAM.3.36	and he knows when you refuse
LAM.3.36	to give someone a fair trial.
LAM.3.37	No one can do anything
LAM.3.37	without the Lord's approval.
LAM.3.38	Good and bad each happen
LAM.3.38	at the command
LAM.3.38	of God Most High.
LAM.3.39	We're still alive!
LAM.3.39	We shouldn't complain
LAM.3.39	when we are being punished
LAM.3.39	for our sins.
LAM.3.40	Instead, we should think
LAM.3.40	about the way we are living,
LAM.3.40	and turn back to the 
LAM.3.41	When we lift our hands
LAM.3.41	in prayer to God in heaven,
LAM.3.41	we should offer him our hearts
LAM.3.41	and say, 
LAM.3.42	“We've sinned!
LAM.3.42	We've rebelled against you,
LAM.3.42	and you haven't forgiven us!
LAM.3.43	Anger is written all over you,
LAM.3.43	as you pursue and slaughter us
LAM.3.43	without showing pity.
LAM.3.44	You are behind a wall of clouds
LAM.3.44	that blocks out our prayers.
LAM.3.45	You allowed nations
LAM.3.45	to treat us like garbage;
LAM.3.46	our enemies curse us.
LAM.3.47	We are terrified and trapped,
LAM.3.47	caught and crushed.”
LAM.3.48	My people are destroyed!
LAM.3.48	Tears flood my eyes,
LAM.3.49	and they won't stop
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	from heaven and helps.
LAM.3.51	I am horrified when I see
LAM.3.51	what enemies have done
LAM.3.51	to the young women of our city.
LAM.3.52	No one had reason to hate me,
LAM.3.52	but I was hunted down
LAM.3.52	like a bird.
LAM.3.53	Then they tried to kill me
LAM.3.53	by tossing me into a pit
LAM.3.53	and throwing stones at me.
LAM.3.54	Water covered my head—
LAM.3.54	I thought I was gone.
LAM.3.55	From the bottom of the pit,
LAM.3.55	I prayed to you, 
LAM.3.56	I begged you to listen.
LAM.3.56	“Help!” I shouted. “Save me!”
LAM.3.56	You answered my prayer
LAM.3.57	and came when I was in need.
LAM.3.57	You told me, “Don't worry!”
LAM.3.58	You rescued me
LAM.3.58	and saved my life.
LAM.3.59	You saw them abuse me, 
LAM.3.59	so make things right.
LAM.3.60	You know every plot
LAM.3.60	they have made against me.
LAM.3.61	Yes, you know their insults
LAM.3.61	and their evil plans.
LAM.3.62	All day long they attack
LAM.3.62	with words and whispers.
LAM.3.63	No matter what they are doing,
LAM.3.63	they keep on mocking me.
LAM.3.64	Pay them back for everything
LAM.3.64	they have done, 
LAM.3.65	Put your curse on them
LAM.3.65	and make them suffer.
LAM.3.66	Get angry and go after them
LAM.3.66	until not a trace is left
LAM.3.66	under the heavens.
LAM.4.1	The purest gold is ruined
LAM.4.1	and has lost its shine;
LAM.4.1	jewels from the temple
LAM.4.1	lie scattered in the streets.
LAM.4.2	These are Zion's people,
LAM.4.2	worth more than purest gold;
LAM.4.2	yet they are counted worthless
LAM.4.2	like dishes of clay.
LAM.4.3	Even jackals
LAM.4.3	but my people are like ostriches
LAM.4.3	that abandon their own.
LAM.4.4	Babies are so thirsty
LAM.4.4	that their tongues are stuck
LAM.4.4	to the roof of the mouth.
LAM.4.4	Children go begging for food,
LAM.4.4	but no one gives them any.
LAM.4.5	All who ate expensive foods
LAM.4.5	lie starving in the streets;
LAM.4.5	those who grew up in luxury
LAM.4.5	now sit on trash heaps.
LAM.4.6	than the people of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	whose city was destroyed
LAM.4.6	in a flash without the help
LAM.4.6	of human hands.
LAM.4.7	The leaders of Jerusalem
LAM.4.7	were purer than snow
LAM.4.7	and whiter than milk;
LAM.4.7	their bodies were healthy
LAM.4.7	and glowed like jewels.
LAM.4.8	Now they are blacker than tar,
LAM.4.8	and no one recognizes them;
LAM.4.8	their skin clings to their bones
LAM.4.8	and is drier than firewood.
LAM.4.9	Being killed with a sword
LAM.4.9	is better than slowly
LAM.4.9	starving to death.
LAM.4.10	that loving mothers have boiled
LAM.4.10	and eaten their own children.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	that he burned the city of Zion
LAM.4.11	to the ground.
LAM.4.12	Not a king on this earth
LAM.4.12	or the people of any nation
LAM.4.12	believed enemies could break
LAM.4.12	through her gates.
LAM.4.13	Jerusalem was punished because
LAM.4.13	her prophets and her priests
LAM.4.13	had sinned and caused the death
LAM.4.13	of innocent victims.
LAM.4.14	Yes, her prophets and priests
LAM.4.14	were covered with blood;
LAM.4.14	no one would come near them,
LAM.4.14	as they wandered
LAM.4.14	from street to street.
LAM.4.15	Instead, everyone shouted,
LAM.4.15	“Go away! Don't touch us!
LAM.4.15	You're filthy and unfit
LAM.4.15	to belong to God's people!”
LAM.4.15	So they had to leave
LAM.4.15	and become refugees.
LAM.4.15	But foreign nations told them,
LAM.4.15	“You can't stay here!”
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	who sent them scattering,
LAM.4.16	and he has forgotten them.
LAM.4.16	No respect or kindness
LAM.4.16	will be shown
LAM.4.16	to the priests or leaders.
LAM.4.17	Our eyes became weary,
LAM.4.17	hopelessly looking
LAM.4.17	for help from a nation
LAM.4.17	that could not save us.
LAM.4.18	Enemies hunted us down
LAM.4.18	on every public street.
LAM.4.18	Our time was up;
LAM.4.18	our doom was near.
LAM.4.19	They swooped down faster
LAM.4.19	than eagles from the sky.
LAM.4.19	They hunted for us in the hills
LAM.4.19	and set traps to catch us
LAM.4.19	out in the desert.
LAM.4.20	The 
LAM.4.20	was our hope for survival!
LAM.4.20	We thought he would keep us safe
LAM.4.20	somewhere among the nations,
LAM.4.20	but even he was caught
LAM.4.20	in one of their traps.
LAM.4.21	You people of Edom
LAM.4.21	can celebrate now!
LAM.4.21	But your time will come
LAM.4.21	to suffer and stagger
LAM.4.21	around naked.
LAM.4.22	The people of Zion
LAM.4.22	have paid for their sins,
LAM.4.22	and the Lord will soon
LAM.4.22	let them return home.
LAM.4.22	But, people of Edom,
LAM.4.22	you will be punished,
LAM.4.22	and your sins exposed.
LAM.5.1	Our 
LAM.5.1	how we have suffered
LAM.5.1	and been disgraced.
LAM.5.2	Foreigners and strangers
LAM.5.2	have taken our land
LAM.5.2	and our homes.
LAM.5.3	We are like children
LAM.5.3	whose mothers are widows.
LAM.5.4	The water we drink
LAM.5.4	and the wood we burn
LAM.5.4	cost far too much.
LAM.5.5	We are terribly mistreated;
LAM.5.5	we are worn out
LAM.5.5	and can find no rest.
LAM.5.6	We had to surrender
LAM.5.6	to
LAM.5.6	because we were hungry.
LAM.5.7	Our ancestors sinned,
LAM.5.7	but they are dead,
LAM.5.7	and we are left to pay
LAM.5.7	for their sins.
LAM.5.8	Slaves are now our rulers,
LAM.5.8	and there is no one
LAM.5.8	to set us free.
LAM.5.9	We are in danger
LAM.5.9	from brutal desert tribes;
LAM.5.9	we must risk our lives
LAM.5.9	just to bring in our crops.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is scorched
LAM.5.10	from fever and hunger.
LAM.5.11	On Zion and everywhere in Judah
LAM.5.11	our wives and daughters
LAM.5.11	are being raped.
LAM.5.12	Our rulers are strung up
LAM.5.12	by their arms,
LAM.5.12	and our nation's advisors
LAM.5.12	are treated shamefully.
LAM.5.13	Young men are forced
LAM.5.13	to do the work of slaves;
LAM.5.13	boys must carry
LAM.5.13	heavy loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	Our leaders are not allowed
LAM.5.14	to decide cases in court,
LAM.5.14	and young people
LAM.5.14	no longer play music.
LAM.5.15	Our hearts are sad;
LAM.5.15	instead of dancing,
LAM.5.15	we mourn.
LAM.5.16	Zion's glory has disappeared!
LAM.5.16	And we are doomed
LAM.5.16	because of our sins.
LAM.5.17	We feel sick all over
LAM.5.17	and can't even see straight;
LAM.5.18	our city is in ruins,
LAM.5.18	overrun by wild dogs.
LAM.5.19	You will rule forever, 
LAM.5.19	You are King for all time.
LAM.5.20	Why have you forgotten us
LAM.5.20	for so long?
LAM.5.21	Bring us back to you!
LAM.5.21	Give us a fresh start.
LAM.5.22	Or do you despise us so much
LAM.5.22	that you don't want us?
EZK.1.1+EZK.1.2+EZK.1.3	Five years after King Jehoiachin of Judah had been led away as a prisoner to Babylonia, I was living near the Chebar River among those who had been taken there with him. Then on the fifth day of the fourth month
EZK.1.4	I saw a windstorm blowing in from the north. Lightning flashed from a huge cloud and lit up the whole sky with a dazzling brightness. The fiery center of the cloud was as shiny as polished metal, 
EZK.1.5	 and in that center I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were somewhat like humans, 
EZK.1.6	except that each one had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight, but their feet looked like the hoofs of calves and sparkled like bronze. 
EZK.1.8	Under each of their wings, these creatures had a human hand. 
EZK.1.9	The four creatures were standing back to back with the tips of their wings touching. They moved together in every direction, without turning their bodies.
EZK.1.11	Two wings
EZK.1.12	The four living creatures went wherever the Spirit led them, and they moved together without turning their bodies, because each creature faced straight ahead. 
EZK.1.13	 The creatures were glowing like hot coals, and I saw something like a flaming torch moving back and forth among them. Lightning flashed from the torch every time its flame blazed up.
EZK.1.14	The creatures themselves moved as quickly as sparks jumping from a fire.
EZK.1.16	shining like chrysolite.
EZK.1.17	so that they could move in any direction without turning. 
EZK.1.18	 The rims of the wheels were large and frightening, and they had eyes all the way around them.
EZK.1.19+EZK.1.20+EZK.1.21	The creatures controlled when and where the wheels moved—the wheels went wherever the four creatures went and stopped whenever they stopped. Even when the creatures flew in the air, the wheels were beside them.
EZK.1.24	 Whenever the creatures flew, their wings roared like an ocean or a large army or even the voice of God All-Powerful. And whenever the creatures stopped, they folded their wings against their bodies.
EZK.1.25	When the creatures stopped flapping their wings, I heard a sound coming from above the dome. 
EZK.1.26	 I then saw what looked like a throne made of sapphire,
EZK.1.27	 From the waist up, it was glowing like metal in a hot furnace, and from the waist down it looked like the flames of a fire. The figure was surrounded by a bright light, 
EZK.1.28	as colorful as a rainbow that appears after a storm.
EZK.1.28	I realized I was seeing the brightness of the 
EZK.2.1	The 
EZK.2.2	After he said this, his Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet. Then the 
EZK.2.3	Ezekiel, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are just like their ancestors who rebelled against me and refused to stop. 
EZK.2.4	They are stubborn and hardheaded. But I, the 
EZK.2.5	Those rebels may not even listen, but at least they will know that a prophet has come to them.
EZK.2.6	Don't be afraid of them or of anything they say. You may think you're in the middle of a thorn patch or a bunch of scorpions. But be brave 
EZK.2.7	and preach my message to them, whether they choose to listen or not. 
EZK.2.8	Ezekiel, don't rebel against me, as they have done. Instead, listen to everything I tell you.
EZK.2.8	And now, Ezekiel, open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you.
EZK.2.10	The hand opened the scroll, and both sides of it were filled with words of sadness, mourning, and grief.
EZK.3.2+EZK.3.3	He handed me the scroll and said, “Eat this and fill up on it.” So I ate the scroll, and it tasted sweet as honey.
EZK.3.4	The 
EZK.3.4	Ezekiel, I am sending you to your own people. 
EZK.3.5+EZK.3.6	They are Israelites, not some strangers who speak a foreign language you can't understand. If I were to send you to foreign nations, they would listen to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the people of Israel will refuse to listen, because they have refused to listen to me. All of them are stubborn and hardheaded, 
EZK.3.8	so I will make you as stubborn as they are. 
EZK.3.9	You will be so determined to speak my message that nothing will stop you. I will make you hard like a diamond, and you'll have no reason to be afraid of those arrogant rebels.
EZK.3.10	Listen carefully to everything I say and then think about it. 
EZK.3.11	Then go to the people who were brought here to Babylonia with you and tell them you have a message from me, the 
EZK.3.12	The Spirit
EZK.3.13	It was the sound made by the creatures' wings as they brushed against each other, and by the rumble of the wheels beside them. 
EZK.3.14	Then the Spirit carried me away.
EZK.3.14	The 
EZK.3.15	When I was back with the others living at Abib Hill near the Chebar River, I sat among them for seven days, shocked at what had happened to me.
EZK.3.16	Seven days after I had seen the brightness of the 
EZK.3.17	Ezekiel, son of man, I have appointed you to stand watch for the people of Israel. So listen to what I say, then warn them for me. 
EZK.3.18	When I tell wicked people they will die because of their sins, you must warn them to turn from their sinful ways so they won't be punished. If you refuse, you are responsible for their death. 
EZK.3.19	However, if you do warn them, and they keep on sinning, they will die because of their sins, and you will be innocent.
EZK.3.20	Now suppose faithful people start sinning, and I decide to put stumbling blocks in their paths to make them fall. They deserve to die because of their sins. So if you refuse to warn them, I will forget about the times they were faithful, and I will hold you responsible for their death. 
EZK.3.21	But if you do warn them, and they listen to you and stop sinning, I will let them live. And you will be innocent.
EZK.3.22	The 
EZK.3.23	I immediately went to the valley, where I saw the brightness of the 
EZK.3.24	His Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet. Then the 
EZK.3.24	Go back and lock yourself in your house! 
EZK.3.25	You will be tied up to keep you inside, 
EZK.3.26	and I will make you unable to talk or to warn those who have rebelled against me. 
EZK.3.27	But the time will come, when I will tell you what to say, and you will again be able to speak my message.
EZK.4.1	Ezekiel, son of man, find a brick and sketch a picture of Jerusalem on it. 
EZK.4.2	Then prepare to attack the brick as if it were a real city. Build a dirt mound and a ramp up to the top and surround the brick with enemy camps. On every side put large wooden poles as though you were going to break down the gate to the city. 
EZK.4.3	Set up an iron pan like a wall between you and the brick. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel.
EZK.4.4+EZK.4.5	After that, lie down on your left side and stay there for 390 days as a sign of Israel's punishment
EZK.4.6	Then turn over and lie on your right side 40 more days. That will be a sign of Judah's punishment—one day for each year of its suffering.
EZK.4.7	The brick stands for Jerusalem, so attack it! Stare at it and shout angry warnings. 
EZK.4.8	I will tie you up, so you can't leave until your attack has ended.
EZK.4.9	Get a large bowl. Then mix together wheat, barley, beans, lentils, and millet, and make some bread. This is what you will eat for the 390 days you are lying down. 
EZK.4.10	Eat only a small loaf of bread each day 
EZK.4.11	and drink only two large cups of water. 
EZK.4.12	Use dried human waste to start a fire, then bake the bread on the coals where everyone can watch you. 
EZK.4.13	When I scatter the people of Israel among the nations, they will also have to eat food that is unclean, just as you must do.
EZK.4.14	I said, “
EZK.4.15	The 
EZK.4.16	Ezekiel, the people of Jerusalem will starve. They will have so little food and water that they will be afraid and hopeless. 
EZK.4.17	Everyone will be shocked at what is happening, and, because of their sins, they will die a slow death.”
EZK.5.1	Ezekiel, son of man, get a sharp sword and use it to cut off your hair and beard. Weigh the hair and divide it into three equal piles. 
EZK.5.2	After you attack the brick that stands for Jerusalem, burn one pile of your hair on the brick. Chop up the second pile and let the small pieces of hair fall around the brick. Throw the third pile into the wind, and I will strike it with my own sword.
EZK.5.3	Keep a few of the hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes. 
EZK.5.4	Then pull out a few of those hairs and throw them in the fire, so they will also burn. This fire will spread, destroying everyone in Israel.
EZK.5.5	I am the 
EZK.5.6	But the people of Jerusalem rebelled and refuse to obey me. They ignored my laws and have become even more sinful than the nations around them.
EZK.5.7	So tell the people of Jerusalem:
EZK.5.7	I am the 
EZK.5.8	Now all those nations will watch as I turn against you and punish you 
EZK.5.9	for your sins. Your punishment will be more horrible than anything I've ever done or will ever do again. 
EZK.5.10	 Parents will be so desperate for food that they will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. Those who survive this horror will be scattered in every direction.
EZK.5.11	Your sins have disgusted me and made my temple unfit as a place to worship me. So I swear by my own life that I will cut you down
EZK.5.12	A third of you will die here in Jerusalem from disease or starvation. Another third will be killed in war. And I will scatter the last third of you in every direction, then track you down and kill you.
EZK.5.13	You will feel my fierce anger until I have finished taking revenge. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.5.14	Every passerby will laugh at your destruction. Foreign nations 
EZK.5.15	will insult you and make fun of you, but they will also be shocked and terrified at what I did in my anger. 
EZK.5.16	I will destroy your crops until you starve to death, and disasters will strike you like arrows. 
EZK.5.17	 Starvation and wild animals will kill your children. I'll punish you with horrible diseases, and your enemies will strike you down with their swords. I, the 
EZK.6.1	The 
EZK.6.2	Ezekiel, son of man, face the hills of Israel and tell them:
EZK.6.3	Listen, you mountains and hills, and every valley and gorge! I, the 
EZK.6.4	Every altar will be smashed, and in front of the idols I will put to death the people who worship them. 
EZK.6.5	Dead bodies and bones will be lying around the idols and the altars. 
EZK.6.6	Every town in Israel will be destroyed to make sure that each shrine, idol, and altar is smashed—everything the Israelites made will be a pile of ruins.
EZK.6.7	All over the country, your people will die. And those who survive will know that I, the 
EZK.6.8	I will let some of the people live through this punishment, but I will scatter them among the nations, 
EZK.6.9	where they will be prisoners. And when they think of me, they will realize that they disgraced me by rebelling and by worshiping idols. They will hate themselves for the evil things they did, 
EZK.6.10	and they will know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	The 
EZK.6.11	Ezekiel, beat your fists together and stomp your feet in despair! Moan in sorrow, because the people of Israel have done disgusting things and now will be killed by enemy troops, or they will die from starvation and disease. 
EZK.6.12	Those who live far away will be struck with deadly diseases. Those who live nearby will be killed in war. And the ones who are left will starve to death. I will let loose my anger on them! 
EZK.6.13	These people used to offer incense to idols at altars built on hills and mountaintops and in the shade of large oak trees. But when they see dead bodies lying around those altars, they will know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	I will make their country a barren wasteland, from the Southern Desert to the town of Diblah in the north. Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.7.1	The 
EZK.7.2	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Israel that I am saying:
EZK.7.2	Israel will soon come to an end! Your whole country is about to be destroyed 
EZK.7.3	as punishment for your disgusting sins. I, the 
EZK.7.4	that I will show no pity. I will punish you for the evil you've done, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	There's never been anything like the coming disaster.
EZK.7.6	And when it comes, your life will be over. 
EZK.7.7	You people of Israel are doomed! Soon there will be panic on the mountaintops instead of celebration.
EZK.7.8	I will let loose my anger and punish you for the evil things you've done. You'll get what you deserve. 
EZK.7.9	Your sins are so terrible, that you'll get no mercy from me. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.7.10	Disaster is near! Injustice and arrogance are everywhere, 
EZK.7.11	and violent criminals run free. None of you will survive the disaster, and everything you own and value will be shattered.
EZK.7.12	The time is coming when everyone will be ruined. Buying and selling will stop, 
EZK.7.13	and people who sell property will never get it back, because all of you must be punished for your sins. And I won't change my mind!
EZK.7.14	A signal has been blown on the trumpet, and weapons are prepared for battle. But no one goes to war, because in my anger I will strike down everyone in Israel.
EZK.7.15	War, disease, and starvation are everywhere! People who live in the countryside will be killed in battle, and those who live in towns will die from starvation or deadly diseases. 
EZK.7.16	Anyone who survives will escape into the hills, like doves who leave the valleys to find safety.
EZK.7.16	All of you will moan
EZK.7.17	Your hands will tremble, and your knees go limp. 
EZK.7.18	You will put on sackcloth
EZK.7.19	Your silver and gold will be thrown into the streets like garbage, because those are the two things that led you into sin, and now they cannot save you from my anger. They are not even worth enough to buy food. 
EZK.7.20	You took great pride in using your beautiful jewelry to make disgusting idols of foreign gods. So I will make your jewelry worthless.
EZK.7.21	Wicked foreigners will rob and disgrace you. 
EZK.7.22	They will break into my temple
EZK.7.23	Your whole country is in confusion!
EZK.7.24	so I will tell the most wicked nations to come and take over your homes. They will put an end to the pride you have in your strong army, and they will make your places of worship unfit to use. 
EZK.7.25	You will be terrified and will desperately look for peace—but there will be no peace. 
EZK.7.26	One tragedy will follow another, and you'll hear only bad news. People will beg prophets to give them a message from me. Priests will stop teaching my Law, and wise leaders won't be able to give advice. 
EZK.7.27	Even your king and his officials will lose hope and cry in despair. Your hands will tremble with fear.
EZK.7.27	I will punish you for your sins and treat you the same way you have treated others. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	Six years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the leaders of Judah were meeting with me in my house. On the fifth day of the sixth month,
EZK.8.2	 and I saw something in the shape of a human.
EZK.8.3	It reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed my hair. Then in my vision the 
EZK.8.3	The Spirit took me to the north gate of the temple's inner courtyard, where there was an idol that disgusted the 
EZK.8.4	 Then I saw the brightness of the glory of the God of Israel, just as I had seen it near the Chebar River.
EZK.8.5	God said to me, “Ezekiel, son of man, look north.” And when I did, I saw that repulsive idol by the altar near the gate.
EZK.8.6	God then said, “Do you see the terrible sins of the people of Israel? Their sins are making my holy temple unfit as a place to worship me. Yet you will see even worse things than this.”
EZK.8.7	Next, I was taken to the entrance of the courtyard, where I saw a hole in the wall.
EZK.8.8	God said, “Make this hole bigger.” And when I did, I realized it was a doorway. 
EZK.8.9	“Go in,” God said, “and see what horrible and evil things the people are doing.”
EZK.8.10	Inside, I saw that the walls were covered with pictures of reptiles and disgusting, unclean animals,
EZK.8.11	Seventy Israelite leaders were standing there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each of these leaders was holding an incense burner, and the smell of incense filled the room.
EZK.8.12	God said, “Ezekiel, do you see what horrible things Israel's leaders are doing in secret? They have filled their rooms with idols. And they say I can't see them, because they think I have already deserted Israel. 
EZK.8.13	But I will show you something even worse than this.”
EZK.8.14	He took me to the north gate of the temple, where I saw women mourning for the god Tammuz.
EZK.8.15	God asked me, “Can you believe what these women are doing? But now I want to show you something even worse.”
EZK.8.16	I was then led into the temple's inner courtyard, where I saw about 25 men standing near the entrance, between the porch and the altar. Their backs were to the 
EZK.8.17	God said, “Ezekiel, it's bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these disgusting things. But they have also spread violence and injustice everywhere in Israel and have made me very angry. They have disgraced and insulted me in the worst possible way.
EZK.8.18	So in my fierce anger, I will punish them without mercy and refuse to help them when they cry out to me.”
EZK.9.1	After that, I heard the 
EZK.9.2	I saw six men come through the north gate of the temple, each one holding a deadly weapon. A seventh man dressed in a linen robe was with them, and he was carrying things to write with. The men went into the temple and stood by the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	The brightness of God's glory then left its place above the statues of the winged creatures
EZK.9.4	 “Walk through the city of Jerusalem and mark the forehead of anyone who is truly upset and sad about the terrible things that are being done here.”
EZK.9.5+EZK.9.6	He turned to the other six men and said, “Follow him and put to death everyone who doesn't have a mark on their forehead. Show no mercy or pity! Kill men and women, parents and children. Begin here at my temple, but be sure not to harm those who are marked.”
EZK.9.5+EZK.9.6	The men immediately killed the leaders who were standing there.
EZK.9.7	Then the 
EZK.9.8	I was then alone, so I bowed down and cried out to the 
EZK.9.9	The 
EZK.9.10	And so I will not have pity on them or forgive them. They will be punished for what they have done.”
EZK.9.11	Just then, the man in the linen robe returned and said, “I have done what you commanded.”
EZK.10.2	 The 
EZK.10.3	The winged creatures were standing south of the temple when the man walked among them. A cloud filled the inner courtyard, 
EZK.10.4	and the brightness of the 
EZK.10.5	The sound of the creatures' wings was as loud as the voice of God All-Powerful and could even be heard in the outer courtyard.
EZK.10.6	The man in the robe was now standing beside a wheel. 
EZK.10.7	One of the four creatures reached its hand into the fire among them and gave him some of the hot coals. The man took the coals and left.
EZK.10.8	I noticed again that each of the four winged creatures had what looked like human hands under their wings, 
EZK.10.9	 and I saw the four wheels near the creatures. These wheels were shining like chrysolite.
EZK.10.10	Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it,
EZK.10.11	so that they could move in any direction without turning. The wheels moved together whenever the creatures moved. 
EZK.10.12	 I also noticed that the wheels and the creatures' bodies, including their backs, their hands, and their wings, were covered with eyes. 
EZK.10.13	And I heard a voice calling these “the wheels that spin.”
EZK.10.15+EZK.10.16+EZK.10.17	These were the same creatures I had seen near the Chebar River. They controlled when and where the wheels moved—the wheels went wherever the creatures went and stopped whenever they stopped. Even when the creatures flew in the air, the wheels stayed beside them.
EZK.10.18	Then I watched the brightness of the 
EZK.10.19	They spread their wings and flew into the air with the wheels at their side. They stopped at the east gate of the temple, and the 
EZK.10.20	I knew for sure that these were the same creatures I had seen beneath the 
EZK.10.21+EZK.10.22	They had four wings with hands beneath them, and they had the same four faces as those near the River. Each creature moved straight ahead without turning.
EZK.11.1	The 
EZK.11.2	The 
EZK.11.3	They say things like, ‘Let's build more houses.
EZK.11.4	So, Ezekiel, condemn them!”
EZK.11.5	The 
EZK.11.5	I, the 
EZK.11.6	You have murdered so many people that the city is filled with dead bodies! 
EZK.11.7	This city is indeed a cooking pot, but the bodies of those you killed are the meat. And so I will force you to leave Jerusalem, 
EZK.11.8	and I'll send armies to attack you, just as you fear. 
EZK.11.9	Then you will be captured and punished by foreign enemies.
EZK.11.10	You will be killed in your own country, but not before you realize that I, the 
EZK.11.11	You leaders claim to be meat in a cooking pot, but you won't be protected by this city. No, you will die at the border of Israel. 
EZK.11.12	You will realize that while you were following the laws of nearby nations, you were disobeying my laws and teachings. And I am the 
EZK.11.13	Before I finished speaking, Pelatiah dropped dead. I bowed down and cried out, “Please, 
EZK.11.14	The 
EZK.11.15	Ezekiel, son of man, the people living in Jerusalem claim that you and the other Israelites who were taken to Babylonia are too far away to worship me. They also claim that the land of Israel now belongs only to them. 
EZK.11.16	But here is what I want you to tell the Israelites in Babylonia:
EZK.11.16	It's true that I, the 
EZK.11.17	And someday, I will gather you from the nations where you are scattered and let you live in Israel again. 
EZK.11.18	When that happens, I want you to clear the land of all those idols I hate so much. 
EZK.11.19	 Then I will take away your stubbornness and make you eager to be completely faithful to me. You will want to obey me 
EZK.11.20	and all my laws and teachings. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.11.21	But those who worship idols will be punished and get what they deserve. I, the 
EZK.11.23	left Jerusalem and stopped at a hill east of the city.
EZK.11.24	Then in my vision, the 
EZK.11.25	and I told them everything the 
EZK.12.1	The 
EZK.12.3	So before it gets dark, here is what I want you to do. Pack a few things as though you were going to be taken away as a prisoner. Then go outside where everyone can see you and walk around from place to place. Maybe as they watch, they will realize what rebels they are. 
EZK.12.4	After you have done this, return to your house.
EZK.12.4	Later that evening leave your house as if you were going into exile. 
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall of your house
EZK.12.6	Lift the bag to your shoulders, and with your face covered, take it into the darkness, so that you cannot see the land you are leaving. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel.
EZK.12.7	I did everything the 
EZK.12.8	The next morning, the 
EZK.12.9	reminded me that those rebellious people didn't even ask what I was doing. 
EZK.12.10	So he sent me back to tell them:
EZK.12.10	The 
EZK.12.11	I have done these things to show them what will happen when they are taken away as prisoners.
EZK.12.12	The leader of Jerusalem will lift his own bag to his shoulders at sunset and leave through a hole that the others have dug in the wall of his house. He will cover his face, so he can't see the land he is leaving. 
EZK.12.13	 The 
EZK.12.14	His own officials and troops will scatter in every direction, and the 
EZK.12.15	The 
EZK.12.16	Some of them will survive the war, the starvation, and the deadly diseases. That way, they will be able to tell foreigners how disgusting their sins were, and that it was the 
EZK.12.17	The 
EZK.12.18	Ezekiel, son of man, shake with fear when you eat, and tremble when you drink. 
EZK.12.19	Tell the people of Israel that I, the 
EZK.12.20	Every town will lie in ruins, and the land will be a barren desert. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	The 
EZK.12.22	Ezekiel, son of man, you've heard people in Israel use the saying, “Time passes, and prophets are proved wrong.” 
EZK.12.23	Now tell the people that I, the 
EZK.12.24	The people will hear no more useless warnings and false messages. 
EZK.12.25	I will give them my message, and what I say will certainly happen. Warn those rebels that the time has come for them to be punished. I, the 
EZK.12.26+EZK.12.27	Ezekiel, the people of Israel are also saying that your visions and messages are only about things in the future. 
EZK.12.28	So tell them that my words will soon come true, just as I have warned. I, the 
EZK.13.1	The 
EZK.13.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the prophets of Israel who say they speak in my name, but who preach messages that come from their own imagination. Tell them it's time to hear my message.
EZK.13.3	I, the 
EZK.13.4	Israel's prophets are no better than jackals
EZK.13.5	They don't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me. 
EZK.13.6	Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me, but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets. And they still think their words will come true. 
EZK.13.7	They say they're preaching my messages, but they are full of lies—I did not speak to them!
EZK.13.8	So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages. 
EZK.13.9	I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people. They will not be allowed to call themselves Israelites or even to set foot in Israel. Then they will realize that I am the 
EZK.13.11	But when I send rainstorms, hailstones, and strong winds, the wall will surely collapse. 
EZK.13.12	People will then ask the workers why the paint didn't hold it up.
EZK.13.13	That wall is the city of Jerusalem. And I, the 
EZK.13.14	The lying prophets have tried to cover up the evil in Jerusalem, but I will tear down the city, all the way to its foundations. And when it collapses, those prophets will be killed, and everyone will know that I have done these things.
EZK.13.15	The city of Jerusalem and its lying prophets will feel my fierce anger. Then I will announce that the city has fallen and that the lying prophets are dead, 
EZK.13.16	because they promised my people peace, when there was no peace. I, the 
EZK.13.17	Ezekiel, son of man, now condemn the women of Israel who preach messages that come from their own imagination. 
EZK.13.18	Tell them they're doomed! They wear magic charms on their wrists and scarves on their heads, then trick others into believing they can predict the future.
EZK.13.19	They charge my people a few handfuls of barley and a couple pieces of bread, and then give messages that are insulting to me. They use lies to sentence the innocent to death and to help the guilty go free. And my people believe them!
EZK.13.20	I hate the magic charms they use to trick people into believing their lies. I will rip those charms from their wrists and set free the people they have trapped like birds.
EZK.13.21	I will tear the scarves from their heads and rescue my people from their power once and for all. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	They do things I would never do. They lie to good people and encourage them to do wrong, and they convince the wicked to ruin their own lives by not turning from sin. 
EZK.13.23	I will no longer let these women give false messages and use magic, and I will free my people from their control. Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.14.1	One day, some of Israel's leaders came to me and asked for a message from the 
EZK.14.2	While they were there, the 
EZK.14.3	Ezekiel, son of man, these men have started worshiping idols, though they know it will cause them to sin even more. So I refuse to give them a message!
EZK.14.4	Tell the people of Israel that if they sin by worshiping idols and then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will give them the answer their sins deserve. 
EZK.14.5	When they hear my message, maybe they will see that they need to turn back to me and stop worshiping those idols.
EZK.14.6	Now, Ezekiel, tell everyone in Israel:
EZK.14.6	I am the 
EZK.14.7	Suppose one of you Israelites or a foreigner living in Israel rejects me and starts worshiping idols. If you then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will answer 
EZK.14.8	by turning against you. I will make you a warning to anyone who might think of doing the same thing, and you will no longer belong to my people. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	If a prophet gives a false message, I am the one who caused that prophet to lie. But I will still reject him and cut him off from my people, 
EZK.14.10	and anyone who goes to that prophet for a message will be punished in the same way. 
EZK.14.11	I will do this, so that you will come back to me and stop destroying yourselves with these disgusting sins. So turn back to me! Then I will be your God, and you will be my people. I, the 
EZK.14.12	The 
EZK.14.13	Ezekiel, son of man, suppose an entire nation sins against me, and I punish it by destroying the crops and letting its people and livestock starve to death. 
EZK.14.14	 Even if Noah, Daniel,
EZK.14.15	Or suppose I punish a nation by sending wild animals to eat people and scare away every passerby, so that the land becomes a barren desert. 
EZK.14.16	As surely as I live, I promise that even if these three men lived in that nation, their own children would not be spared. The three men would live, but the land would be an empty desert.
EZK.14.17	Or suppose I send an enemy to attack a sinful nation and kill its people and livestock. 
EZK.14.18	If these three men were in that nation when I punished it, not even their children would be spared. Only the three men would live.
EZK.14.19	And suppose I am so angry that I send a deadly disease to wipe out the people and livestock of a sinful nation. 
EZK.14.20	Again, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were living there, I, the 
EZK.14.22	And those who survive will be taken from their country and led here to Babylonia. Ezekiel, when you see how sinful they are, you will know why I did all these things to Jerusalem. 
EZK.14.23	You will be convinced that I, the 
EZK.15.1	Some time later, the 
EZK.15.2	Ezekiel, son of man, what happens to the wood of a grapevine after the grapes have been picked? It isn't like other trees in the forest, 
EZK.15.3	because the wood of a grapevine can't be used to make anything, not even a small peg to hang things on. 
EZK.15.4	It can only be used as firewood. But after its ends are burnt and its middle is charred, it can't be used for anything. 
EZK.15.5	The wood is useless before it is burned, and afterwards, it is completely worthless.
EZK.15.6	I, the 
EZK.15.7	I will punish the people of Jerusalem with fire. Some of them have escaped one destruction, but soon they will be completely burned. And when that happens, you, Ezekiel, will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	I will make their country an empty wasteland, because they have not been loyal to me. I, the 
EZK.16.1	The 
EZK.16.2	Ezekiel, son of man, remind the people of Jerusalem of their disgusting sins 
EZK.16.3	and tell them that I, the 
EZK.16.3	Jerusalem, you were born in the country where Canaanites lived. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.
EZK.16.4	When you were born, no one cut you loose from your mother or washed your body. No one rubbed your skin with salt and olive oil,
EZK.16.5	Not one person loved you enough to do any of these things, and no one even felt sorry for you. You were despised, thrown into a field, and forgotten.
EZK.16.6	I saw you lying there, rolling around in your own blood, and I couldn't let you die. 
EZK.16.7	I took care of you, like someone caring for a tender, young plant. You grew up to be a beautiful young woman with mature breasts and hair, but you were still naked.
EZK.16.8	When I saw you again, you were old enough to have sex. So I covered your naked body with my own robe.
EZK.16.9	I washed the blood off you and rubbed your skin with olive oil. 
EZK.16.10	I gave you the finest clothes and the most expensive robes,
EZK.16.11	I gave you bracelets, a necklace, 
EZK.16.12	a ring for your nose, some earrings, and a beautiful crown. 
EZK.16.13	Your jewelry was gold and silver, and your clothes were made of only the finest material and embroidered linen. Your bread was baked from fine flour, and you ate honey and olive oil. You were as beautiful as a queen, 
EZK.16.14	and everyone on earth knew it. I, the 
EZK.16.15	You learned that you were attractive enough to have any man you wanted, so you offered yourself to every passerby.
EZK.16.16	You made shrines for yourself and decorated them with some of your clothes. That's where you took your visitors to have sex with them. These things should never have happened!
EZK.16.17	You made idols out of the gold and silver jewelry I gave you, then you sinned by worshiping those idols. 
EZK.16.18	You dressed them in the clothes you got from me, and you offered them the olive oil and incense I gave you. 
EZK.16.19	I supplied you with fine flour, olive oil, and honey, but you sacrificed it all as offerings to please those idols. I, the 
EZK.16.20	But you did something even worse than that—you sacrificed your own children to those idols! 
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered my children, so you could offer them as sacrifices. 
EZK.16.22	You were so busy sinning and being a prostitute that you refused to think about the days when you were young and were rolling around naked in your own blood.
EZK.16.23	Now I, the 
EZK.16.24	but you also built places on every street corner 
EZK.16.25	where you disgraced yourself by having sex with anyone who walked by. And you did that more and more every day! 
EZK.16.26	To make me angry, you even offered yourself to Egyptians, who were always ready to sleep with you.
EZK.16.27	So I punished you by letting those greedy Philistine enemies take over some of your territory. But even they were offended by your repulsive behavior.
EZK.16.28	You couldn't get enough sex, so you chased after Assyrians and slept with them. You still weren't satisfied, 
EZK.16.29	so you went after Babylonians. But those merchants could not satisfy you either.
EZK.16.30	I, the 
EZK.16.31	You had sex on every street corner, and when you finished, you refused to accept money. That's worse than being a prostitute! 
EZK.16.32	You are nothing but an unfaithful wife who would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband. 
EZK.16.33	Prostitutes accept money for having sex, but you bribe men from everywhere to have sex with you. 
EZK.16.34	You're not like other prostitutes. Men don't ask you for sex—you offer to pay them!
EZK.16.35	Jerusalem, you prostitute, listen to me. 
EZK.16.36	You chased after lovers, then took off your clothes and had sex. You even worshiped disgusting idols and sacrificed your own children as offerings to them. 
EZK.16.37	So I, the 
EZK.16.38	I will find you guilty of being an unfaithful wife and a murderer, and in my fierce anger I will sentence you to a violent death! 
EZK.16.39	Then I will hand you over to your lovers, who will tear down the places where you had sex. They will take your clothes and jewelry, leaving you naked and empty-handed.
EZK.16.40	Your lovers and an angry mob will stone you to death; they will cut your dead body into pieces 
EZK.16.41	and burn down your houses. Other women will watch these terrible things happen to you. I promise to stop you from being a prostitute and paying your lovers for sex.
EZK.16.42	Only then will I calm down and stop being angry and jealous. 
EZK.16.43	You made me furious by doing all these disgusting things and by forgetting how I took care of you when you were young. Then you made things worse by acting like a prostitute. You must be punished! I, the 
EZK.16.44	People will use this saying about you, Jerusalem: “If the mother is bad, so is her daughter.” 
EZK.16.45	You are just like your mother, who hated her husband and her own children. You are also like your sisters, who hated their husbands and children. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.
EZK.16.46	Your older sister was Samaria, that city to your north with her nearby villages. Your younger sister was Sodom, that city to your south with her nearby villages. 
EZK.16.47	You followed their way of life and their wicked customs, and soon you were more repulsive than they were.
EZK.16.48	As surely as I am the living 
EZK.16.49	They were arrogant and spoiled; they had everything they needed and still refused to help the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	They thought they were better than everyone else, and they did things I hate. And so I destroyed them.
EZK.16.51	You people of Jerusalem have sinned twice as much as the people of Samaria. In fact, your evil ways have made both Sodom and Samaria look innocent. 
EZK.16.52	So their punishment will seem light compared to yours. You will be disgraced and put to shame because of your disgusting sins.
EZK.16.53	Someday I will bless Sodom and Samaria and their nearby villages. I will also bless you, Jerusalem. 
EZK.16.54	Then you will be ashamed of how you've acted, and Sodom and Samaria will be relieved that they weren't as sinful as you. 
EZK.16.55	When that day comes, you and Sodom and Samaria will once again be well-off, and all nearby villages will be restored.
EZK.16.56	Jerusalem, you were so arrogant that you sneered at Sodom. 
EZK.16.57	But now everyone has learned how wicked you really are. The countries of Syria and Philistia, as well as your other neighbors, hate you and make insulting remarks. 
EZK.16.58	You must pay for all the vulgar and disgusting things you have done. I, the 
EZK.16.59	Jerusalem, you deserve to be punished, because you broke your promises and ignored our agreement. 
EZK.16.60	But I remember the agreement I made with you when you were young,
EZK.16.61	When you think about how you acted, you will be ashamed, especially when I return your sisters
EZK.16.62	I will keep this solemn promise, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	I will forgive you, but you will think about your sins and be too ashamed to say a word. I, the 
EZK.17.1	The 
EZK.17.2	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Israel the following story, 
EZK.17.3	so they will understand what I am saying to them:
EZK.17.3	A large eagle with strong wings and beautiful feathers once flew to Lebanon. It broke the top branch off a cedar tree, 
EZK.17.4	then carried it to a nation of merchants and left it in one of their cities. 
EZK.17.5	The eagle also took a seed from Israel and planted it in a fertile field with plenty of water, like a willow tree beside a stream.
EZK.17.6	The seed sprouted and grew into a grapevine that spread over the ground. It had lots of leaves and strong, deep roots, and its branches grew upward toward the eagle.
EZK.17.7	There was another eagle with strong wings and thick feathers. The roots and branches of the grapevine soon turned toward this eagle, hoping it would bring water for the soil. 
EZK.17.8	But the vine was already growing in fertile soil, where there was plenty of water to produce healthy leaves and large grapes.
EZK.17.9	Now tell me, Ezekiel, do you think this grapevine will live? Or will the first eagle pull it up by its roots and pluck off the grapes and let its new leaves die? The eagle could easily kill it without the help of a large and powerful army. 
EZK.17.10	The grapevine is strong and healthy, but as soon as the scorching desert wind blows, it will quickly wither.
EZK.17.11	The 
EZK.17.12	Tell them that the king of Babylonia came to Jerusalem, then he captured the king of Judah
EZK.17.13	He chose someone from the family of Judah's king
EZK.17.14	so that the rest of the people of Judah would obey only him and never gain control of their own country again.
EZK.17.15	But this new king of Judah later rebelled against Babylonia and sent officials to Egypt to get horses and troops. Will this king be successful in breaking the treaty with Babylonia? Or will he be punished for what he's done?
EZK.17.16	As surely as I am the living 
EZK.17.17	Even the king of Egypt and his powerful army will be useless to Judah when the Babylonians attack and build towers and dirt ramps to destroy the cities of Judah and its people. 
EZK.17.18	The king of Judah broke his own promises and ignored the treaty with Babylonia. And so he will be punished!
EZK.17.19	He made a promise in my name and swore to honor the treaty. And now that he has broken that promise, my name is disgraced. He must pay for what he's done. 
EZK.17.20	I will spread out a net to trap him. Then I will drag him to Babylon and see that he is punished for his unfaithfulness to me. 
EZK.17.21	His best troops
EZK.17.22	Someday, I, the 
EZK.17.22	will cut a tender twig
EZK.17.22	from the top of a cedar tree,
EZK.17.22	then plant it on the peak
EZK.17.22	of Israel's tallest mountain,
EZK.17.23	where it will grow
EZK.17.23	strong branches
EZK.17.23	and produce large fruit.
EZK.17.23	All kinds of birds will find
EZK.17.23	shelter under the tree,
EZK.17.23	and they will rest in the shade
EZK.17.23	of its branches.
EZK.17.24	Every tree in the forest
EZK.17.24	will know that I, the 
EZK.17.24	can bring down tall trees
EZK.17.24	and help short ones grow.
EZK.17.24	I dry up green trees
EZK.17.24	and make dry ones green.
EZK.17.24	I, the 
EZK.17.24	and I will keep my word.
EZK.18.1	The 
EZK.18.2	“Sour grapes eaten by parents
EZK.18.2	leave a sour taste in the mouths
EZK.18.2	of their children.”
EZK.18.3	Now tell them that I am the 
EZK.18.4	The lives of all people belong to me—parents as well as children. However, only those who sin will be put to death.
EZK.18.5	Suppose there is a truly good man who always does what is fair and right. 
EZK.18.6	He refuses to eat meat sacrificed to foreign gods at local shrines or to worship Israel's idols. He doesn't have sex with someone else's wife or with a woman having her monthly period. 
EZK.18.7	He never cheats or robs anyone and always returns anything taken as security for a loan; he gives food and clothes to the poor 
EZK.18.8	and doesn't charge interest when lending money. He refuses to do anything evil; he is fair to everyone 
EZK.18.9	 and faithfully obeys my laws and teachings. This man is good, and I promise he will live.
EZK.18.10	But suppose this good man has an evil son who is violent and commits sins 
EZK.18.11	his father never did. He eats meat at local shrines, has sex with someone else's wife, 
EZK.18.12	cheats the poor, and robs people. He keeps what is given to him as security for a loan. He worships idols, does disgusting things, 
EZK.18.13	and charges high interest when lending money. An evil man like that will certainly not live. He is the one who has done these horrible sins, so it's his own fault that he will be put to death.
EZK.18.14	But suppose this evil man has a son who sees his father do these things and refuses to act like him. 
EZK.18.15	He doesn't eat meat at local shrines or worship Israel's idols, and he doesn't have sex with someone else's wife. 
EZK.18.16	He never cheats or robs anyone and doesn't even demand security for a loan. He gives food and clothes to the poor 
EZK.18.17	and refuses to do anything evil
EZK.18.18	It is his father who will die for cheating and robbing and doing evil.
EZK.18.19	You may wonder why a son isn't punished for the sins of his father. It is because the son does what is right and obeys my laws. 
EZK.18.20	 Only those who sin will be put to death. Children won't suffer for the sins of their parents, and parents won't suffer for the sins of their children. Good people will be rewarded for what they do, and evil people will be punished for what they do.
EZK.18.21	Suppose wicked people stop sinning and start obeying my laws and doing right. They won't be put to death. 
EZK.18.22	All their sins will be forgiven, and they will live because they did right. 
EZK.18.23	I, the 
EZK.18.24	But when good people start sinning and doing disgusting things, will they live? No! All their good deeds will be forgotten, and they will be put to death because of their sins.
EZK.18.25	You people of Israel accuse me of being unfair! But listen—I'm not unfair; you are! 
EZK.18.26	If good people start doing evil, they must be put to death, because they have sinned. 
EZK.18.27	And if wicked people start doing right, they will save themselves from punishment. 
EZK.18.28	They will think about what they've done and stop sinning, and so they won't be put to death. 
EZK.18.29	But you still say that I am unfair. You are the ones who have done wrong and are unfair!
EZK.18.30	I will judge each of you for what you've done. So stop sinning, or else you will certainly be punished. 
EZK.18.31	Give up your evil ways and start thinking pure thoughts. And be faithful to me! Do you really want to be put to death for your sins? 
EZK.18.32	 I, the 
EZK.19.1	Ezekiel, sing a funeral song for two of Israel's leaders:
EZK.19.2	Your mother was a brave lioness
EZK.19.2	who raised her cubs
EZK.19.2	among lions.
EZK.19.3	She taught one of them to hunt,
EZK.19.3	and he learned to eat people.
EZK.19.4	When the nations heard of him,
EZK.19.4	they trapped him in a pit,
EZK.19.4	then they used hooks
EZK.19.4	to drag him to Egypt.
EZK.19.5	His mother waited
EZK.19.5	for him to return.
EZK.19.5	But soon she lost all hope
EZK.19.5	and raised another cub,
EZK.19.5	who also became fierce.
EZK.19.6	He hunted with other lions
EZK.19.6	and learned to eat people.
EZK.19.7	He destroyed fortresses
EZK.19.7	and ruined towns;
EZK.19.7	his mighty roar
EZK.19.7	terrified everyone.
EZK.19.8	Nations plotted to kill him,
EZK.19.8	and people came from all over
EZK.19.8	to spread out a net
EZK.19.8	and catch him in a trap.
EZK.19.9	They put him in a cage
EZK.19.9	and took him to Babylonia.
EZK.19.9	The lion was locked away,
EZK.19.9	so that his mighty roar
EZK.19.9	would never again be heard
EZK.19.9	on Israel's hills.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was a vine like you,
EZK.19.10	growing near a stream.
EZK.19.10	There was plenty of water,
EZK.19.10	so she was filled with branches
EZK.19.10	and with lots of fruit.
EZK.19.11	Her strong branches
EZK.19.11	became symbols of authority,
EZK.19.11	and she was taller
EZK.19.11	than all other trees—
EZK.19.11	everyone could see how strong
EZK.19.11	and healthy she was.
EZK.19.12	But in anger, I pulled her up
EZK.19.12	by the roots
EZK.19.12	and threw her to the ground,
EZK.19.12	where the scorching desert wind
EZK.19.12	dried out her fruit.
EZK.19.12	Her strong branches wilted
EZK.19.12	and burned up.
EZK.19.13	Then she was planted
EZK.19.13	in a hot, dry desert,
EZK.19.14	where her stem caught fire,
EZK.19.14	and flames burned
EZK.19.14	her branches and fruit.
EZK.19.14	Not one strong branch is left;
EZK.19.14	she is stripped bare.
EZK.19.14	This funeral song must be sung with sorrow.
EZK.20.1	Seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, some of Israel's leaders came to me on the tenth day of the fifth month.
EZK.20.2	Just then, the 
EZK.20.3	Ezekiel, son of man, these leaders have come to find out what I want them to do. As surely as I live, I will not give them an answer of any kind.
EZK.20.4	Are you willing to warn them, Ezekiel? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors.
EZK.20.6	I swore that I would rescue them from Egypt and lead them to a land I had already chosen. This land was rich with milk and honey and was the most splendid land of all. 
EZK.20.7	I told them to get rid of their disgusting idols and not to sin by worshiping the gods of Egypt. I reminded them that I was the 
EZK.20.8	but they still rebelled against me. They refused to listen and kept on worshiping their idols and foreign gods.
EZK.20.8	In my anger, I decided to punish the Israelites in Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But that would have made me look like a liar, because I had already promised in front of everyone that I would lead them out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I brought them out and led them into the desert. 
EZK.20.11	 I gave them my laws and teachings, so they would know how to live right. 
EZK.20.12	 And I commanded them to respect the Sabbath as a way of showing that they were holy and belonged to me. 
EZK.20.13	But the Israelites rebelled against me in the desert. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath like any other day.
EZK.20.13	Then in my anger, I decided to destroy the Israelites in the desert once and for all. 
EZK.20.14	But that would have disgraced me, because many other nations had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.15	 Instead, I told them in the desert that I would not lead them into the beautiful, fertile land I had promised. 
EZK.20.16	I said this because they had not only ignored my laws and teachings, but had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped idols.
EZK.20.17	Yet, I felt sorry for them and could not let them die in the desert. 
EZK.20.18	So I warned the children not to act like their parents or follow their evil ways or worship their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I reminded them that I was the 
EZK.20.20	I told them to respect my Sabbath to show that they were my people and that I was the 
EZK.20.21	But the children also rebelled against me. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath as any other day.
EZK.20.21	I became angry and decided to punish them in the desert. 
EZK.20.22	But I did not. That would have disgraced me in front of the nations that had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.23	 So I solemnly swore that I would scatter the people of Israel across the nations, 
EZK.20.24	because they had disobeyed my laws and ignored my teachings; they had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped the idols their ancestors had made. 
EZK.20.25	I gave them laws that bring punishment instead of life, 
EZK.20.26	and I let them offer me unacceptable sacrifices, including their first-born sons. I did this to horrify them and to let them know that I, the 
EZK.20.27	Ezekiel, tell the people of Israel that their ancestors also rejected and insulted me 
EZK.20.28	by offering sacrifices, incense, and wine to gods on every hill and under every large tree. I was very angry, because they did these things in the land I had given them! 
EZK.20.29	I asked them where they went to worship those gods, and they answered, “At the local shrines.”
EZK.20.30	Then ask the Israelites why they are following the example of their wicked ancestors 
EZK.20.31	by worshiping idols and by sacrificing their own children as offerings. They commit these sins and still think they can ask me for a message. As surely as I am the living 
EZK.20.32	They may think they can be like other nations and get away with worshiping idols made of wood and stone. But that will never happen!
EZK.20.33	As surely as I am the living 
EZK.20.34	and my power, when I gather you from the places where you are scattered 
EZK.20.35	and lead you into a desert surrounded by nations. I will meet you there face to face. Then I will pass judgment on you 
EZK.20.36	and punish you, just as I punished your ancestors in the desert near Egypt.
EZK.20.37	I will force each of you to obey the regulations of our solemn agreement. 
EZK.20.38	I will separate the sinful rebels from the rest of you, and even though I will bring them from the nations where they live in exile, they won't be allowed to return to Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	Go ahead and worship your idols for now, you Israelites, because soon I will no longer let you dishonor me by offering gifts to them. You will have no choice but to obey me!
EZK.20.40	When that day comes, everyone in Israel will worship me on Mount Zion, my holy mountain in Jerusalem. I will once again call you my own, and I will accept your sacred offerings and sacrifices. 
EZK.20.41	When I bring you home from the places where you are now scattered, I will be pleased with you, just as I am pleased with the smell of the smoke from your sacrifices. Every nation on earth will see that I am holy, 
EZK.20.42	and you will know that I, the 
EZK.20.43	Then you will remember your wicked sins, and you will hate yourselves for doing such horrible things. They have made you unacceptable to me, 
EZK.20.44	so you deserve to be punished. But I will treat you in a way that will bring honor to my name, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	The 
EZK.20.46	“Ezekiel, son of man, turn toward the south and warn the forests 
EZK.20.47	that I, the 
EZK.20.48	Everyone will know that I started it, and that it cannot be stopped.”
EZK.20.49	But I complained, “
EZK.21.1	The 
EZK.21.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the places in Jerusalem where people worship. Warn everyone in Israel 
EZK.21.3	that I am about to punish them. I will pull out my sword and have it ready to kill everyone, whether good or evil. 
EZK.21.4	From south to north, people will die, 
EZK.21.5	knowing that my sword will never be put away.
EZK.21.6	Ezekiel, groan in sorrow and despair so that everyone can hear you. 
EZK.21.7	When they ask why you are groaning, tell them you have terrifying news that will make them faint and tremble in fear and lose all courage. These things will happen soon. I, the 
EZK.21.8	The 
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Jerusalem:
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	I have sharpened my sword
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	to slaughter you;
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	it is shiny and will flash
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	like lightning!
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	Don't celebrate—
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	punishment is coming,
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	because everyone has ignored
EZK.21.9+EZK.21.10	my warnings.
EZK.21.11	My sword has been polished;
EZK.21.11	it's sharp and ready to kill.
EZK.21.12	Groan in sorrow, Ezekiel;
EZK.21.12	the sword is drawn against
EZK.21.12	my people and their leaders.
EZK.21.12	They will die!
EZK.21.12	So give up all hope.
EZK.21.13	I am testing my people,
EZK.21.13	and they can do nothing
EZK.21.13	to stop me.
EZK.21.13	I, the 
EZK.21.14	Ezekiel, warn my people,
EZK.21.14	then celebrate my victory
EZK.21.14	by clapping your hands.
EZK.21.14	My vicious sword will attack
EZK.21.14	again and again,
EZK.21.14	killing my people
EZK.21.14	with every stroke.
EZK.21.15	They will lose all courage
EZK.21.15	and stumble with fear.
EZK.21.15	My slaughtering sword
EZK.21.15	is waiting at every gate,
EZK.21.15	flashing and ready to kill.
EZK.21.16	It will slash right and left,
EZK.21.16	wherever the blade is pointed.
EZK.21.17	Then I will stop being angry,
EZK.21.17	and I will clap my hands
EZK.21.17	in victory.
EZK.21.17	I, the 
EZK.21.18	The 
EZK.21.19	Ezekiel, son of man, mark two roads for the king of Babylonia to follow when he comes with his sword. The roads will begin at the same place, but be sure to put up a signpost where the two roads separate and go in different directions. 
EZK.21.20	Clearly mark where the two roads lead. One goes to Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, and the other goes to Jerusalem, the fortified capital of Judah. 
EZK.21.21	When the Babylonian king stands at that signpost, he will decide which way to go by shaking his arrows, by asking his idols, and by carefully looking at the liver of a sacrificed animal.
EZK.21.22	His right hand will pull out the arrow marked “Jerusalem.” Then he will immediately give the signal to shout the battle cry, to build dirt ramps up to the top of the city walls, to break down its walls and gates with large wooden poles, and to kill the people. 
EZK.21.23	Everyone in Jerusalem had promised to be loyal to Babylonia, and so none of them will believe that this could happen to them. But Babylonia's king will remind them of their sinful ways and warn them of their coming captivity.
EZK.21.24	Ezekiel, tell the people of Jerusalem and their ruler that I, the 
EZK.21.24	Everything you do is wicked and shows how sinful you are. You are guilty and will be taken away as prisoners.
EZK.21.25	And now, you evil and wicked ruler of Israel, your day of final punishment is almost here. 
EZK.21.26	I, the 
EZK.21.27	I will leave Jerusalem in complete ruins like no one has ever seen until my chosen one comes to punish this city.
EZK.21.28	Ezekiel, son of man, the Ammonites have insulted Israel, so condemn them and tell them I am saying:
EZK.21.28	A sword is drawn,
EZK.21.28	ready to slaughter;
EZK.21.28	it is polished and prepared
EZK.21.28	to kill as fast as lightning.
EZK.21.29	You wicked Ammonites see false visions and believe untrue messages. But your day of punishment is coming soon, and my sword will slaughter you!
EZK.21.30	Your days to punish others are over, so put your swords away.
EZK.21.31	My furious anger will scorch you like fire, and I will hand you over to cruel men who are experts in killing. 
EZK.21.32	You will be burned and will die in your own land. Then you will be forgotten forever. I, the 
EZK.22.1	Some time later, the 
EZK.22.2	Ezekiel, son of man, are you ready to condemn Jerusalem? That city is filled with murderers, so remind the people of their sins 
EZK.22.3	and tell them I am saying:
EZK.22.3	Jerusalem, you have murdered many of your own people and have worshiped idols. You will soon be punished! 
EZK.22.4	Those crimes have made you guilty, and the idols have made you unacceptable to me. So your final punishment is near. Other nations will laugh at you and make insulting remarks, 
EZK.22.5	and people far and near will make fun of your misery.
EZK.22.6	Your own leaders use their power to murder. 
EZK.22.7	 None of you honor your parents, and you cheat foreigners, orphans, and widows. 
EZK.22.8	 You show no respect for my sacred places and treat the Sabbath just like any other day. 
EZK.22.9	Some of your own people tell lies, so that others will be put to death. Some of you eat meat sacrificed to idols at local shrines, and others never stop doing vulgar things. 
EZK.22.10	 Men have sex with their father's wife or with women who are having their monthly period 
EZK.22.11	or with someone else's wife. Some men even sleep with their own daughter-in-law or half sister. 
EZK.22.12	 Others of you accept money to murder someone. Your own people charge high interest when making a loan to other Israelites, and they get rich by cheating. Worst of all, you have forgotten me, the 
EZK.22.13	I will shake my fist in anger at your violent crimes. 
EZK.22.14	When I'm finished with you, your courage will disappear, and you will be so weak that you won't be able to lift your hands. I, the 
EZK.22.15	I will scatter you throughout every nation on earth and put a stop to your sinful ways. 
EZK.22.16	You
EZK.22.17	The 
EZK.22.18	Ezekiel, son of man, I consider the people of Israel as worthless as the leftover metal in a furnace after silver has been purified. 
EZK.22.19	So I am going to bring them together in Jerusalem. 
EZK.22.20+EZK.22.21	I will be like a metalworker who collects that metal from the furnace and melts it down. I will collect the Israelites and blow on them with my fiery anger. They will melt inside the city of Jerusalem 
EZK.22.22	like silver in a furnace. Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.22.23	The 
EZK.22.24	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Israel that their country is full of sin, and that I, the 
EZK.22.25	Their leaders are like
EZK.22.27	Israel's officials are like ferocious wolves, ripping their victims apart. They make a dishonest living by injuring and killing people.
EZK.22.28	And then the prophets in Israel cover up these sins by giving false visions. I have never spoken to them, but they lie and say they have a message from me. 
EZK.22.29	The people themselves cheat and rob; they abuse the poor and take advantage of foreigners.
EZK.22.30	I looked for someone to defend the city and to protect it from my anger, as well as to stop me from destroying it. But I found no one. 
EZK.22.31	So in my fierce anger, I will punish the Israelites for what they have done, and they will know that I am furious. I, the 
EZK.23.1	The 
EZK.23.2	Ezekiel, son of man, listen to this story about two sisters. 
EZK.23.3	While they were young and living in Egypt, they became prostitutes. 
EZK.23.4	The older one was named Oholah, which stands for Samaria; the younger one was Oholibah, which stands for Jerusalem.
EZK.23.5	Even though Oholah was my wife, she continued to be a prostitute and chased after Assyrian lovers. 
EZK.23.6	She offered herself to soldiers in purple uniforms: handsome, high-ranking officers and cavalry troops. 
EZK.23.7	She had sex with all the important Assyrian officials and even worshiped their disgusting idols. 
EZK.23.8	Once she started doing these things in Egypt, she never stopped. Men slept with her, and she was always ready for sex.
EZK.23.9	So I gave Oholah to the Assyrian lovers she wanted so badly. 
EZK.23.10	They ripped off her clothes, then captured her children and killed her. Women everywhere talked about what had happened to Oholah.
EZK.23.11	Oholibah saw all this, but she was more sinful and wanted sex more than her sister Oholah ever did. 
EZK.23.12	Oholibah also chased after good-looking Assyrian officers, uniformed soldiers, and cavalry troops. 
EZK.23.13	Just like her sister, she did vulgar things.
EZK.23.14	But Oholibah behaved worse than her sister. Oholibah saw images of Babylonian men carved into walls and painted red. 
EZK.23.15	They had belts around their waists and large turbans on their heads, and they reminded her of Babylonian cavalry officers. 
EZK.23.16	As soon as she looked at them, she wanted to have sex with them. And so, she sent messengers to bring them to her. 
EZK.23.17	Men from Babylonia came and had sex with her so many times that she got disgusted with them. 
EZK.23.18	She let everyone see her naked body and didn't care if they knew she was a prostitute. That's why I turned my back on her, just as I had done with her older sister.
EZK.23.19	Oholibah didn't stop there, but became even more immoral and acted as she had back in Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	She eagerly wanted to go to bed with Egyptian men, who were famous for their sexual powers. 
EZK.23.21	And she longed for the days when she was a young prostitute, when men enjoyed caressing her body.
EZK.23.22	The 
EZK.23.22	Oholibah,
EZK.23.23	I will gather all the handsome young officials and the high-ranking cavalry officers from Babylonia and Assyria, as well as from the Chaldean tribes of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa. 
EZK.23.24	Their large armies will come from the north
EZK.23.25	I am angry with you, so I will let them be very cruel. They will cut off your nose and ears; they will kill your children and burn alive anyone in your family who survives. 
EZK.23.26	Your clothes and jewelry will be torn off. 
EZK.23.27	I will stop your wickedness and the prostitution you started back in Egypt. You will never want to think about those days again.
EZK.23.28	I, the 
EZK.23.29	They will cruelly take away everything you have worked for and strip you naked. Then everyone will see you for the prostitute you really are. Your own vulgar sins 
EZK.23.30	have led to this. You were the one determined to have sex with men from other nations and to worship their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have turned out no better than your older sister, and now you must drink from the cup filled with my anger.
EZK.23.32	I, the 
EZK.23.33	You will end up drunk and devastated, because that cup is filled with horror and ruin. 
EZK.23.34	But you must drink every drop! Then smash the cup and chew on its broken pieces. Use them to cut your breasts in sorrow. I, the 
EZK.23.35	You have completely rejected me, and so I promise that you will be punished for the disgusting things you did as a prostitute.
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.36	Ezekiel, son of man, it's time for you to tell Oholah and Oholibah
EZK.23.37	They have been unfaithful by worshiping idols, and they have committed murder by sacrificing my own children as offerings to idols. 
EZK.23.38+EZK.23.39	They came into my temple that same day, and that made it unfit as a place to worship me. They have even stopped respecting the Sabbath.
EZK.23.40	They sent messengers to attract men from far away. When those men arrived, the two sisters bathed themselves and put on eye shadow and jewelry. 
EZK.23.41	They sat on a fancy couch, and in front of them was a table for the olive oil and incense that had belonged to me. 
EZK.23.42	Their room was always filled with a noisy crowd of drunkards brought in from the desert. These men gave the women bracelets and beautiful crowns, 
EZK.23.43	and I noticed that the men were eager to have sex with these women, though they were exhausted from being prostitutes.
EZK.23.44	In fact, the men had sex over and over with Oholah and Oholibah, the two sinful sisters. 
EZK.23.45	But honest judges will someday accuse those two of murder and of being unfaithful, because they are certainly guilty.
EZK.23.46	So I, the 
EZK.23.46	I will call together an angry mob that will abuse and rob you. 
EZK.23.47	They will stone you to death and cut you to pieces; they will kill your children and burn down your houses. 
EZK.23.48	I will get rid of sinful prostitution in this country, so that women everywhere will be warned not to act as you have. 
EZK.23.49	You will be punished for becoming prostitutes and for worshiping idols. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.24.1	Nine years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the 
EZK.24.3	Then tell my rebellious people:
EZK.24.3	“Pour water in a cooking pot
EZK.24.3	and set it over a fire.
EZK.24.3	* 
EZK.24.4	Throw
EZK.24.4	of your finest sheep
EZK.24.4	and put in the juicy bones.
EZK.24.5	Pile wood
EZK.24.5	and let the meat and bones
EZK.24.5	boil until they are done.”
EZK.24.6	These words mean that Jerusalem is doomed! The city is filled with murderers and is like an old, rusty pot. The meat is taken out piece by piece, and no one cares what happens to it.
EZK.24.7	The people of Jerusalem murdered innocent people in the city and didn't even try to cover up the blood that flowed out on the hard ground. 
EZK.24.8	But I have seen that blood, and it cries out for me to take revenge.
EZK.24.9	I, the 
EZK.24.10	so bring more wood and light it. Cook the meat and boil away the broth
EZK.24.11	Then set the empty pot over the hot coals until it is red-hot. That will clean the pot and burn off the rust. 
EZK.24.12	I've tried everything else. Now the rust must be burned away.
EZK.24.13	Jerusalem is so full of sin and evil that I can't get it clean, even though I have tried. It will stay filthy until I let loose my fierce anger against it. 
EZK.24.14	That time will certainly come! And when it does, I won't show the people of Jerusalem any pity or change my mind. They must be punished for the evil they have done. I, the 
EZK.24.15	The 
EZK.24.16	“Ezekiel, son of man, I will suddenly take the life of the person you love most. But I don't want you to complain or cry. 
EZK.24.17	Mourn in silence and don't show that you are grieving. Don't remove your turban or take off your sandals; don't cover your face to show your sorrow, or eat the food that mourners eat.”
EZK.24.18	One morning, I was talking with the people as usual, and by sunset my wife was dead. The next day I did what the 
EZK.24.19	and when people saw me, they asked, “Why aren't you mourning for your wife?”
EZK.24.20	I answered:
EZK.24.20	The 
EZK.24.21	he is ready to destroy the temple in which you take such pride and which makes you feel so safe. Your children who now live in Jerusalem will be killed. 
EZK.24.22	Then you will do the same things I have done. You will leave your face uncovered and refuse to eat the food that mourners usually eat. 
EZK.24.23	You won't take off your turbans and your sandals.
EZK.24.24	I am a warning sign—everything I have done, you will also do. And then you will know the 
EZK.24.25	The 
EZK.24.26	On that same day, someone will escape from the city and come to tell you what has happened. 
EZK.24.27	Then you will be able to speak again,
EZK.25.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the people of Ammon 
EZK.25.3	and tell them:
EZK.25.3	You celebrated when my temple was destroyed, when Israel was defeated, and when my people were taken away as prisoners. 
EZK.25.4	Now I am going to let you be conquered by tribes from the eastern desert. They will set up their camps in your land and eat your fruit and drink your milk. 
EZK.25.5	Your capital city of Rabbah will be nothing but pastureland for camels, and the rest of the country will be pastures for sheep. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.25.6	You hated Israel so much that you clapped and shouted and celebrated. 
EZK.25.7	And so I will hand you over to enemies who will rob you. I will completely destroy you. There won't be enough of your people left to be a nation ever again, and you will know that I, the 
EZK.25.9	So I will let Moab's fortress towns along its border be attacked, including Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim. 
EZK.25.10	The same eastern desert tribes that invade Ammon will invade Moab, and just as Ammon will be forgotten forever, 
EZK.25.11	Moab will be punished. Then the people there will know that I am the 
EZK.25.13	So I will punish Edom by killing all its people and livestock. It will be an empty wasteland all the way from Teman to Dedan. 
EZK.25.14	I will send my own people to take revenge on the Edomites by making them feel my fierce anger. And when I punish them, they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.16	Now it's my turn to treat the Philistines as my enemies and to kill everyone
EZK.25.17	In my fierce anger, I will take revenge on them. And when I punish them, they will know that I am the 
EZK.26.2	Ezekiel, son of man, the people of the city of Tyre
EZK.26.2	“Jerusalem has fallen!
EZK.26.2	It used to be powerful,
EZK.26.2	a center of trade.
EZK.26.2	Now the city is shattered,
EZK.26.2	and we will take its place.”
EZK.26.3	Because the people of Tyre have sung that song, I have the following warning for them: I am the 
EZK.26.4	They will tear down your city walls and defense towers. I will sweep away the ruins until all that's left of you is a bare rock, 
EZK.26.5	where fishermen can dry their nets along the coast. I promise that you will be robbed 
EZK.26.6	and that the people who live in your towns along the coast will be killed. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia is the world's most powerful king, and I will send him to attack you. He will march from the north with a powerful army, including horses and chariots and cavalry troops. 
EZK.26.8	First, he will attack your towns along the coast and kill the people who live there. Then he will build dirt ramps up to the top of your city walls and set up rows of shields around you. 
EZK.26.9	He will command some of his troops to use large wooden poles to beat down your walls, while others use iron rods to knock down your watchtowers. 
EZK.26.10	He will have so many horses that the dust they stir up will seem like a thick fog. And as his chariots and cavalry approach, even the walls will shake, especially when he proudly enters your ruined city. 
EZK.26.11	His troops will ride through your streets, killing people left and right, and your strong columns will crumble to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	The troops will steal your valuable possessions; they will break down your walls, and crush your expensive houses. Then the stones and wood and all the remains will be dumped into the sea. 
EZK.26.13	 You will have no reason to sing or play music on harps, 
EZK.26.14	because I will turn you into a bare rock where fishermen can dry their nets. And you will never rebuild your city. I, the 
EZK.26.15	The people of the nations up and down the coast will shudder when they hear your screams and moans of death. 
EZK.26.16	 The kings will step down from their thrones, then take off their royal robes and fancy clothes, and sit on the ground, trembling. They will be so shocked at the news of your defeat that they will shake in fear 
EZK.26.17	and sing this funeral song:
EZK.26.17	“The great city beside the sea
EZK.26.17	is destroyed!
EZK.26.17	Its people once ruled the coast
EZK.26.17	and terrified everyone there.
EZK.26.18	But now Tyre is in ruins,
EZK.26.18	and the people on the coast
EZK.26.18	stare at it in horror
EZK.26.18	and tremble in fear.”
EZK.26.19	I, the 
EZK.26.20	and carry you down to the world of the dead, where you will join people of ancient times and towns ruined long ago. You will stay there and never again be a city filled with people.
EZK.26.21	 You will die a horrible death! People will come looking for your city, but it will never be found. I, the 
EZK.27.1	The 
EZK.27.2	Ezekiel, son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre,
EZK.27.3	the city that is built along the sea and that trades with nations along the coast. Tell the people of Tyre that the following message is from me:
EZK.27.3	Tyre, you brag about
EZK.27.3	your perfect beauty,
EZK.27.4	and your control of the sea.
EZK.27.4	You are a ship
EZK.27.4	built to perfection.
EZK.27.5	Builders used cypress trees
EZK.27.5	from Mount Hermon
EZK.27.5	to make your planks
EZK.27.5	and a cedar tree from Lebanon
EZK.27.5	for your tall mast.
EZK.27.6	Oak trees from Bashan
EZK.27.6	were shaped into oars;
EZK.27.6	pine trees from Cyprus
EZK.27.6	were cut for your deck,
EZK.27.6	which was then decorated
EZK.27.6	with strips of ivory.
EZK.27.7	The builders used fancy linen
EZK.27.7	from Egypt for your sails,
EZK.27.7	so everyone could see you.
EZK.27.7	Blue and purple cloth
EZK.27.7	from Cyprus was used
EZK.27.7	to shade your deck.
EZK.27.8	Men from Sidon and Arvad
EZK.27.8	did the rowing,
EZK.27.8	and your own skilled workers
EZK.27.8	were the captains.
EZK.27.9	Experienced men from Byblos
EZK.27.9	repaired any damages.
EZK.27.9	Sailors from all over
EZK.27.9	shopped at the stores
EZK.27.9	in your port.
EZK.27.10	Brave soldiers from Persia,
EZK.27.10	Lydia, and Libya
EZK.27.10	served in your navy,
EZK.27.10	protecting you with shields
EZK.27.10	and helmets,
EZK.27.10	and making you famous.
EZK.27.11	Your guards came from
EZK.27.11	Arvad and Cilicia,
EZK.27.11	and men from Gamad
EZK.27.11	stood watch in your towers.
EZK.27.11	With their weapons
EZK.27.11	hung on your walls,
EZK.27.11	your beauty was complete.
EZK.27.12	Merchants from southern Spain
EZK.27.13	The people of Greece, Tubal, and Meshech traded slaves and things made of bronze, 
EZK.27.14	and those from Beth-Togarmah traded work horses, war horses, and mules. 
EZK.27.15	You also did business with people from Rhodes,
EZK.27.16	Edom
EZK.27.17	Judah and Israel gave you their finest wheat, fancy figs,
EZK.27.18	The people of Damascus saw what you had to offer and brought you wine from Helbon and wool from Zahar. 
EZK.27.19	Vedan and Javan near Uzal
EZK.27.20	The people of Dedan supplied you with saddle blankets, 
EZK.27.21	while people from Arabia and the rulers of Kedar traded lambs, sheep, and goats. 
EZK.27.22	Merchants from Sheba and Raamah gave you excellent spices, precious stones, and gold in exchange for your products. 
EZK.27.23	You also did business with merchants from the cities of Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, 
EZK.27.24	and they gave you expensive clothing, purple and embroidered cloth, brightly colored rugs, and strong rope. 
EZK.27.25	 Large, seagoing ships
EZK.27.25	You were like a ship
EZK.27.25	loaded with heavy cargo
EZK.27.26	and sailing across the sea,
EZK.27.26	but you were wrecked
EZK.27.26	by strong eastern winds.
EZK.27.27	Everything on board was lost—
EZK.27.27	your valuable cargo,
EZK.27.27	your sailors and carpenters,
EZK.27.27	merchants and soldiers.
EZK.27.28	The shouts of your drowning crew
EZK.27.28	were heard on the shore.
EZK.27.29	Every ship is deserted;
EZK.27.29	rowers and sailors and captains
EZK.27.29	all stand on shore,
EZK.27.30	mourning for you.
EZK.27.30	They show their sorrow
EZK.27.30	by putting dust on their heads
EZK.27.30	and rolling in ashes;
EZK.27.31	they shave their heads
EZK.27.31	and dress in sackcloth
EZK.27.31	as they cry in despair.
EZK.27.32	In their grief they sing
EZK.27.32	a funeral song for you:
EZK.27.32	“Tyre, you were greater
EZK.27.32	than all other cities.
EZK.27.32	But now you lie in silence
EZK.27.32	at the bottom of the sea.
EZK.27.33	“Nations that received
EZK.27.33	your merchandise
EZK.27.33	were always pleased;
EZK.27.33	kings everywhere got rich
EZK.27.33	from your costly goods.
EZK.27.34	But now you are wrecked
EZK.27.34	in the deep sea,
EZK.27.34	with your cargo and crew
EZK.27.34	scattered everywhere.
EZK.27.35	People living along the coast
EZK.27.35	are shocked at the news.
EZK.27.35	Their rulers are horrified,
EZK.27.35	and terror is written
EZK.27.35	across their faces.
EZK.27.36	The merchants of the world
EZK.27.36	can't believe what happened.
EZK.27.36	Your death was gruesome,
EZK.27.36	and you are gone forever.”
EZK.28.1	The 
EZK.28.2	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the king of Tyre
EZK.28.2	You are so arrogant that you think you're a god and that the city of Tyre is your throne. You may claim to be a god, though you're nothing but a mere human. 
EZK.28.3	You think you're wiser than Daniel
EZK.28.4	Your wisdom has certainly made you rich, because you have storehouses filled with gold and silver. 
EZK.28.5	You're a clever businessman and are extremely wealthy, but your wealth has led to arrogance!
EZK.28.6	You compared yourself to a god, so now I, the 
EZK.28.7	will make you the victim of cruel enemies. They will destroy all the possessions you've worked so hard to get. 
EZK.28.8	Your enemies will brutally kill you, and the sea will be your only grave.
EZK.28.9	When you face your enemies, will you still claim to be a god? They will attack, and you will suffer like any other human. 
EZK.28.10	Foreigners will kill you, and you will die the death of those who don't worship me. I, the 
EZK.28.11	The 
EZK.28.12	Ezekiel, son of man, sing a funeral song for the king of Tyre
EZK.28.12	At one time, you were perfect,
EZK.28.13	You lived in the garden of Eden and wore jewelry made of brightly colored gems and precious stones. They were all set in gold
EZK.28.14	I appointed a winged creature to guard your home
EZK.28.15	You were truly good from the time of your birth, but later you started doing wicked things. 
EZK.28.16	You traded with other nations and became more and more cruel and evil. So I forced you to leave my mountain, and the creature that had been your protector now chased you away from the jewels.
EZK.28.17	It was your good looks that made you arrogant, and you were so famous that you started acting like a fool. That's why I threw you to the ground and let other kings sneer at you. 
EZK.28.18	You have cheated so many other merchants that your places of worship are corrupt. So I set your city on fire and burned it down. Now everyone sees only ashes where your city once stood, 
EZK.28.19	and the people of other nations are shocked. Your punishment was horrible, and you are gone forever.
EZK.28.21	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the city of Sidon
EZK.28.22	and tell its people:
EZK.28.22	I, the 
EZK.28.23	I will send deadly diseases to wipe you out, and I will send enemies to invade and surround you. Your people will be killed, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	When that happens, the people of Israel will no longer have cruel neighbors that abuse them and make them feel as though they are in a field of thorns and briers. And the Israelites will know that I, the 
EZK.28.25	The 
EZK.28.25	Someday I will gather the people of Israel from the nations where they are now scattered, and every nation will see that I am holy. The Israelites will once again live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob. 
EZK.28.26	They will be safe and will build houses and plant vineyards. They will no longer be in danger, because I will punish their hateful neighbors. Israel will know that I am the 
EZK.29.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the king of Egypt. Tell him and his people 
EZK.29.3	that I am saying:
EZK.29.3	King of Egypt, you were like a giant crocodile lying in a river. You acted as though you owned the Nile and made it for yourself. But now I, the 
EZK.29.4	I will put a hook in your jaw and pull you out of the water, and all the fish in your river will stick to your scaly body.
EZK.29.5	I'll throw you and the fish into the desert, and your body will fall on the hard ground. You will be left unburied,
EZK.29.6	 Then everyone in Egypt will know that I am the 
EZK.29.6	You and your nation refused to help the people of Israel and were nothing more than a broken stick. 
EZK.29.7	When they reached out to you for support, you broke in half, cutting their arms and making them fall.
EZK.29.8	So I, the 
EZK.29.9	until your land is a barren desert. Then you will know that I have done these things.
EZK.29.9	You claimed that you made the Nile River and control it. 
EZK.29.10	Now I am turning against you and your river. Your nation will be nothing but an empty wasteland all the way from the town of Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south, and as far as the border of Ethiopia.
EZK.29.11	No human or animal will even dare travel through Egypt, because no sign of life will be found there for 40 years. 
EZK.29.12	It will be the most barren place on earth. Every city in Egypt will lie in ruins during those 40 years, and I will scatter your people throughout the nations of the world.
EZK.29.13	Then after those 40 years have passed, I will bring your people back from the places where I scattered them. 
EZK.29.14	They will once again live in their homeland in southern Egypt. But they will be a weak kingdom 
EZK.29.15	and won't ever be strong enough to rule nations, as they did in the past. 
EZK.29.16	My own people Israel will never again depend on your nation. In fact, when the Israelites remember what happened to you Egyptians, they will realize how wrong they were to turn to you for help. Then the Israelites will know that I, the 
EZK.29.17	Twenty-seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the 
EZK.29.18	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has attacked the city of Tyre. He forced his soldiers to carry so many heavy loads that their heads were rubbed bald, and their shoulders were red and sore. Nebuchadnezzar and his army still could not capture the city. 
EZK.29.19	So now I will hand over the nation of Egypt to him. He will take Egypt's valuable treasures and give them to his own troops. 
EZK.29.20	Egypt will be his reward, because he and his army have been following my orders. I, the 
EZK.29.21	Ezekiel, when Egypt is defeated, I will make the people of Israel strong, and I will give you the power to speak to them. Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.30.1	The 
EZK.30.2	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Egypt that I am saying:
EZK.30.2	Cry out in despair,
EZK.30.3	because you will soon
EZK.30.3	be punished!
EZK.30.3	That will be a time
EZK.30.3	of darkness and doom
EZK.30.3	for all nations.
EZK.30.4	Your own nation of Egypt
EZK.30.4	will be attacked,
EZK.30.4	and Ethiopia
EZK.30.4	You will be killed in battle,
EZK.30.4	and your land will be robbed
EZK.30.4	and left in ruins.
EZK.30.5	Soldiers hired from Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, Arabia, Kub, as well as from Israel,
EZK.30.6	All of your allies will be killed, and your proud strength will crumble. People will die from Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south. I, the 
EZK.30.7	Your nation of Egypt will be the most deserted place on earth, and its cities will lie in complete ruin. 
EZK.30.8	I will set fire to your land, and anyone who defended your nation will die. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	On the same day I destroy Egypt, I will send messengers to the Ethiopians to announce their coming destruction. They think they are safe, but they will be terrified.
EZK.30.10	Your Egyptian army is very strong, but I will send King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to completely defeat that army. 
EZK.30.11	He and his cruel troops will invade and destroy your land and leave your dead bodies piled everywhere.
EZK.30.12	I will dry up the Nile River, then sell the land to evil buyers. I will send foreigners to turn your entire nation into a barren desert. I, the 
EZK.30.13	All the idols and images you Egyptians worship in the city of Memphis
EZK.30.14	The city of Pathros will be left in ruins, and Zoan will be burned to the ground. Thebes,
EZK.30.15	The fortress city of Pelusium will feel my fierce anger, and all the troops stationed at Thebes will be slaughtered.
EZK.30.16	I will set fire to your nation of Egypt! The city of Pelusium will be in anguish. Thebes will fall, and the people of Memphis will live in constant fear.
EZK.30.17	The young soldiers in the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis
EZK.30.18	You were so proud of your nation's power, but when I crush that power and kill that pride, darkness will fall over the city of Tahpanhes. A dark, gloomy cloud will cover the land as you are being led away into captivity. 
EZK.30.19	When I'm through punishing Egypt, you will know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the 
EZK.30.21	Ezekiel, son of man, I, the 
EZK.30.22	So tell him that I am now his worst enemy. I will break both his arms—the good one and the broken one! His sword will drop from his hand forever, 
EZK.30.23	and I will scatter the Egyptians all over the world.
EZK.30.24+EZK.30.25	I will strengthen the power of Babylonia's king and give him my sword to use against Egypt. I will also make the wounded king of Egypt powerless, and he will moan in pain and die in front of the Babylonian king. Then everyone on earth will know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	I will force the Egyptians to live as prisoners in foreign nations, and they will know that I, the 
EZK.31.1	Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the 
EZK.31.2	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the king of Egypt and his people that I am saying:
EZK.31.2	You are more powerful
EZK.31.2	than anyone on earth.
EZK.31.2	Now listen to this.
EZK.31.3	There was once a cedar tree
EZK.31.3	in Lebanon
EZK.31.3	with large, strong branches
EZK.31.3	reaching to the sky.
EZK.31.4	This tree had plenty of water
EZK.31.4	to help it grow tall,
EZK.31.4	and nearby streams watered
EZK.31.4	the other trees
EZK.31.4	in the forest.
EZK.31.5	But this tree towered over
EZK.31.5	those other trees,
EZK.31.5	and its branches
EZK.31.5	grew long and thick.
EZK.31.6	Birds built nests
EZK.31.6	in its branches,
EZK.31.6	and animals were born
EZK.31.6	beneath it.
EZK.31.6	People from all nations
EZK.31.6	lived in the shade
EZK.31.6	of this strong tree.
EZK.31.7	It had beautiful,
EZK.31.7	long branches,
EZK.31.7	and its roots found water
EZK.31.7	deep in the soil.
EZK.31.8	in my garden of Eden
EZK.31.8	were as beautiful
EZK.31.8	as this tree;
EZK.31.8	no tree of any kind
EZK.31.8	had such long branches.
EZK.31.9	I, the 
EZK.31.9	its beauty,
EZK.31.9	and I helped the branches
EZK.31.9	grow strong.
EZK.31.9	All other trees in Eden
EZK.31.9	wanted to be just like it.
EZK.31.10	King of Egypt, now listen to what I, the 
EZK.31.10	The tree grew so tall that it reached the sky
EZK.31.11	So I, the 
EZK.31.12	Cruel foreigners will chop it down and leave it wherever it falls. Branches and broken limbs will be scattered over the mountains and in the valleys. The people living in the shade of those branches will go somewhere else. 
EZK.31.13	Birds will then nest on the stump of the fallen tree, and wild animals will trample its branches.
EZK.31.14	Never again will any tree dare to grow as tall as this tree, no matter how much water it has. Every tree must die, just as humans die and go down to the world of the dead.
EZK.31.15	On the day this tree dies and goes to the world below, I, the 
EZK.31.16	This tree will crash to the ground, and I will send it to the world below. Then the nations of the earth will tremble.
EZK.31.16	The trees from Eden and the choice trees from Lebanon are now in the world of the dead, and they will be comforted when this tree falls. 
EZK.31.17	Those people who found protection in its shade will also be sent to the world below, where they will join the dead.
EZK.31.18	King of Egypt, all these things will happen to you and your people! You were like this tree at one time—taller and stronger than anyone on earth. But now you will be chopped down, just as every tree in the garden of Eden must die. You will be sent down to the world of the dead, where you will join the godless and the other victims of violent death. I, the 
EZK.32.1	Twelve years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the 
EZK.32.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the king of Egypt and tell him I am saying:
EZK.32.2	You act like a lion
EZK.32.2	roaming the earth;
EZK.32.2	but you are nothing more than
EZK.32.2	a crocodile in a river,
EZK.32.2	churning up muddy water
EZK.32.2	with your feet.
EZK.32.3	King of Egypt, listen to me. I, the 
EZK.32.4	I will throw you into an open field, where birds and animals will come to feed on your flesh. 
EZK.32.5	I will spread your rotting flesh
EZK.32.6	and your blood will flow throughout the land and fill up the streams. 
EZK.32.7	 I will cover the whole sky and every star with thick clouds, so that the sun and moon will stop shining. 
EZK.32.8	The heavens will become black, leaving your country in total darkness. I, the 
EZK.32.9	Foreign nations you have never heard of will be shocked when I tell them how I destroyed you.
EZK.32.10	They will be horrified, and when I flash my sword in victory on the day of your death, their kings will tremble in the fear of what could happen to them.
EZK.32.11	The king of Babylonia is coming to attack you, king of Egypt! 
EZK.32.12	Your soldiers will be killed by the cruelest army in the world, and everything you take pride in will be crushed. 
EZK.32.13	I will slaughter your cattle that graze by the river,
EZK.32.14	The water will be clear, and streams will be calm. I, the 
EZK.32.15	Egypt will become a barren wasteland, and no living thing will ever survive there. Then you and your people will know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This is your warning, and it will be used as a funeral song by foreign women to mourn the death of your people. I, the 
EZK.32.17	On the fifteenth day of that same month,
EZK.32.18	Ezekiel, son of man, mourn for the Egyptians and condemn them to the world of the dead, where they will be buried alongside the people of other powerful nations.
EZK.32.19	Say to them:
EZK.32.19	You may be more beautiful
EZK.32.19	than the people
EZK.32.19	of other nations,
EZK.32.19	but you will also die
EZK.32.19	and join the godless
EZK.32.19	in the world below.
EZK.32.20	You cannot escape! The enemy's sword is ready to slaughter every one of you.
EZK.32.21	Brave military leaders killed in battle will gladly welcome you and your allies into the world of the dead.
EZK.32.22+EZK.32.23	The graves of soldiers from Assyria are there. They once terrified people, but they were killed in battle and now lie deep in the world of the dead.
EZK.32.24+EZK.32.25	The graves of soldiers from Elam are there. The very sight of those godless soldiers once terrified their enemies and made them panic. But now they are disgraced and ashamed as they lie in the world of the dead, alongside others who were killed in battle.
EZK.32.26	The graves of soldiers from Meshech and Tubal are there. These godless soldiers who terrified people were all killed in battle. 
EZK.32.27	They were not given a proper burial like the heroes of long ago,
EZK.32.28	You Egyptians will be cruelly defeated, and you will be buried alongside these other godless soldiers who died in battle.
EZK.32.29	The graves of kings and leaders from Edom are there. They were powerful at one time. Now they are buried in the world of the dead with other godless soldiers killed in battle.
EZK.32.30	The graves of the rulers of the north
EZK.32.31	The 
EZK.32.31	When your king of Egypt sees all of these graves, he and his soldiers will be glad they are not the only ones suffering. 
EZK.32.32	I sent him to terrify people all over the earth. But he and his army will be killed and buried alongside other godless soldiers in the world of the dead. I, the 
EZK.33.1	The 
EZK.33.2	Ezekiel, son of man, warn your people by saying:
EZK.33.2	Someday, I, the 
EZK.33.3	and to sound a warning signal when the enemy is seen coming. 
EZK.33.4+EZK.33.5	If any of these people hear the signal and ignore it, they will be killed in battle. But it will be their own fault, because they could have escaped if they had paid attention.
EZK.33.6	But suppose the person watching fails to sound the warning signal. The enemy will attack and kill some of the sinful people in that country, and I, the 
EZK.33.7	Ezekiel, I have appointed you to stand watch for the people of Israel. So listen to what I say, then warn them for me. 
EZK.33.8	When I tell wicked people they will die because of their sins, you must warn them to turn from their sinful ways. But if you refuse to warn them, you are responsible for their death. 
EZK.33.9	If you do warn them, and they keep sinning, they will die because of their sins, and you will be innocent.
EZK.33.10	The 
EZK.33.10	Ezekiel, son of man, the people of Israel are complaining that the punishment for their sins is more than they can stand. They have lost all hope for survival, and they blame me. 
EZK.33.11	Tell them that as surely as I am the living 
EZK.33.12	Tell them that when good people start sinning, all the good they did in the past cannot save them from being punished. And remind them that when wicked people stop sinning, their past sins will be completely forgiven, and they won't be punished.
EZK.33.13	Suppose I promise good people that they will live, then later they start sinning and believe they will be saved by the good they did in the past. These people will certainly be put to death because of their sins. Their good deeds will be forgotten.
EZK.33.14	Suppose I warn wicked people that they will die because of their sins, and they stop sinning and start doing right. 
EZK.33.15	For example, they need to return anything they have taken as security for a loan and anything they have stolen. Then if they stop doing evil and start obeying my Law, they will live. 
EZK.33.16	Their past sins will be forgiven, and they will live because they have done right.
EZK.33.17	Ezekiel, your people accuse me of being unfair. But they are the ones who are unfair. 
EZK.33.18	If good people start doing evil, they will be put to death, because they have sinned. 
EZK.33.19	And if wicked people stop sinning and start doing right, they will save themselves from punishment. 
EZK.33.20	But the Israelites still think I am unfair. So warn them that they will be punished for what they have done.
EZK.33.22	The evening before this man arrived at my house, the 
EZK.33.23	Then the 
EZK.33.24	Ezekiel, son of man, the people living in the ruined cities of Israel are saying, “Abraham was just one man, and the 
EZK.33.25	So, Ezekiel, tell them I am saying:
EZK.33.25	How can you think the land is still yours? You eat meat with blood in it and worship idols. You commit murder 
EZK.33.26	and spread violence throughout the land. Everything you do is wicked; you are even unfaithful in marriage. And you claim the land is yours!
EZK.33.27	As surely as I am the living 
EZK.33.28	I will make the whole country an empty wasteland and crush the power in which you take such pride. Even the mountains will be bare, and no one will try to cross them. 
EZK.33.29	I will punish you because of your sins, and I will turn your nation into a barren desert. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	Ezekiel, son of man, the people with you in Babylonia talk about you when they meet by the city walls or in the doorways of their houses. They say, “Let's ask Ezekiel what the 
EZK.33.31	So they all come and listen to you, but they refuse to do what you tell them. They claim to be faithful, but they are forever trying to cheat others out of their money. 
EZK.33.32	They treat you as though you were merely singing love songs or playing music. They listen, but don't do anything you say.
EZK.33.33	Soon they will be punished, just as you warned, and they will know that a prophet has been among them.
EZK.34.2	Ezekiel, son of man, Israel's leaders are like shepherds taking care of my sheep, the people of Israel. But I want you to condemn these leaders and tell them:
EZK.34.2	I, the 
EZK.34.3	You drink their milk and use their wool to make your clothes. Then you butcher the best ones for food. But you don't take care of the flock! 
EZK.34.4	You have never protected the weak ones or healed the sick ones or bandaged those that get hurt. You let them wander off and never look for those that get lost. You are cruel and mean to my sheep. 
EZK.34.5	 They strayed in every direction, and because there was no shepherd to watch them, they were attacked and eaten by wild animals. 
EZK.34.6	So my sheep were scattered across the earth. They roamed on hills and mountains, without anyone even bothering to look for them.
EZK.34.7+EZK.34.8	Now listen to what I, the living 
EZK.34.9+EZK.34.10	So I, the 
EZK.34.11	The 
EZK.34.11	I will look for my sheep and take care of them myself, 
EZK.34.12	just as a shepherd looks for lost sheep. My sheep have been lost since that dark and miserable day when they were scattered throughout the nations.
EZK.34.13	and bring them back from the foreign nations where they now live. I will be their shepherd and will let them graze on Israel's mountains and in the valleys and fertile fields. 
EZK.34.14	They will be safe as they feed on grassy meadows and green hills. 
EZK.34.15	I promise to take care of them and keep them safe, 
EZK.34.16	to look for those that are lost and bring back the ones that wander off, to bandage those that are hurt and protect the ones that are weak. I will also slaughter
EZK.34.17	The 
EZK.34.17	I will carefully watch each one of you to decide which ones are the strong sheep and which ones are weak. 
EZK.34.18	Some of you eat the greenest grass, then trample down what's left when you finish. Others drink clean water, then step in the water to make the rest of it muddy. 
EZK.34.19	That means my other sheep have nothing fit to eat or drink.
EZK.34.20	So I, the 
EZK.34.21	You strong ones have used your powerful horns to chase off those that are weak, 
EZK.34.22	but I will rescue them and no longer let them be mistreated. I will separate the good from the bad.
EZK.34.24	 He will be your leader, and I will be your God. I, the 
EZK.34.25	The people of Israel are my sheep, and I solemnly promise that they will live in peace. I will chase away every wild animal from the desert and the forest, so my sheep will not be afraid. 
EZK.34.26	They will live around my holy mountain,
EZK.34.27	to make their trees produce fruit and their crops to grow. I will set them free from slavery and let them live safely in their own land. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	Foreign nations will never again rob them, and wild animals will no longer kill and eat them. They will have nothing to fear. 
EZK.34.29	I will make their fields produce large amounts of crops, so they will never again go hungry or be laughed at by foreigners. 
EZK.34.30	Then everyone will know that I protect my people Israel. I, the 
EZK.34.31	They are my sheep; I am their God, and I take care of them.
EZK.35.2	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the people of Edom
EZK.35.3	and say to them:
EZK.35.3	I, the 
EZK.35.3	am now your enemy!
EZK.35.3	And I will turn your nation
EZK.35.3	into an empty wasteland,
EZK.35.4	leaving your towns in ruins.
EZK.35.4	Your land will be a desert,
EZK.35.4	and then you will know
EZK.35.4	that I am the 
EZK.35.5	People of Edom, not only have you been Israel's longtime enemy, you simply watched when disaster wiped out its people as punishment for their sins. 
EZK.35.6	And so, as surely as I am the living 
EZK.35.7	I will destroy your nation and kill anyone who travels through it. 
EZK.35.8	Dead bodies will cover your mountains and fill up your valleys, 
EZK.35.9	and your land will lie in ruins forever. No one will live in your towns ever again. You will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	You thought the nations of Judah and Israel belonged to you, and that you could take over their territory. But I am their God, 
EZK.35.11	and as surely as I live, I will punish you for treating my people with anger and hatred. Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.35.12	And you will finally realize that I heard you laugh at their destruction and say their land was yours to take. 
EZK.35.13	You even insulted me, but I heard it all.
EZK.35.14	Everyone on earth will celebrate when I destroy you, 
EZK.35.15	just as you celebrated when Israel was destroyed. Your nation of Edom will be nothing but a wasteland. Then everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	The 
EZK.36.1	Ezekiel, son of man, tell the mountains of Israel 
EZK.36.2	that I, the 
EZK.36.2	Your enemies sneered and said that you mountains belonged to them. 
EZK.36.3	They ruined and crushed you from every side, and foreign nations captured and made fun of you. 
EZK.36.4	So all you mountains and hills, streams and valleys, listen to what I will do. Your towns may now lie in ruins, and nations may laugh and insult you. 
EZK.36.5	But in my fierce anger, I will turn against those nations, and especially the Edomites, because they laughed at you the loudest and took over your pasturelands. 
EZK.36.6	You have suffered long enough, and, I, the 
EZK.36.7	so I will now insult and disgrace them. That is my solemn promise.
EZK.36.8	Trees will grow on you mountains of Israel and produce fruit for my people, because they will soon come home. 
EZK.36.9	I will take care of you by plowing your soil and planting crops on your fertile slopes. 
EZK.36.10	The people of Israel will return and rebuild your ruined towns and live in them. 
EZK.36.11	Children will be born, and animals will give birth to their young. You will no longer be deserted as you are now, but you will be covered with people and treated better than ever. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	I will bring my people Israel home, and they will live on you mountains, because you belong to them, and your fertile slopes will never again let them starve. 
EZK.36.13	It's true that you have been accused of not producing enough food and of letting your people starve. 
EZK.36.14+EZK.36.15	But I, the 
EZK.36.16	The 
EZK.36.17	Ezekiel, son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own country, they made the land unclean by the way they behaved, just as a woman's monthly period makes her unclean. 
EZK.36.18	They committed murders and worshiped idols, which made the land even worse. So in my anger, I punished my people 
EZK.36.19	and scattered them throughout the nations, just as they deserved. 
EZK.36.20	Wherever they went, my name was disgraced, because foreigners insulted my people by saying I had forced them out of their own land.
EZK.36.21	I care what those foreigners think of me, 
EZK.36.22	so tell the Israelites that I am saying:
EZK.36.22	You have disgraced my holy name among the nations where you now live. So you don't deserve what I'm going to do for you. I will lead you home to bring honor to my name 
EZK.36.23	and to show foreign nations that I am holy. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	I will gather you from the foreign nations and bring you home. 
EZK.36.25	I will sprinkle you with clean water, and you will be clean and acceptable to me. I will wash away everything that makes you unclean, and I will remove your disgusting idols. 
EZK.36.26	 I will take away your stubborn heart and give you a new heart and a desire to be faithful. You will have only pure thoughts, 
EZK.36.27	because I will put my Spirit in you and make you eager to obey my laws and teachings. 
EZK.36.28	You will once again live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.
EZK.36.29	I will protect you from anything that makes you unclean. Your fields will overflow with grain, and no one will starve. 
EZK.36.30	Your trees will be filled with fruit, and crops will grow in your fields, so that you will never again feel ashamed for not having enough food. 
EZK.36.31	You will remember your evil ways and hate yourselves for what you've done. 
EZK.36.32	People of Israel, I'm not doing these things for your sake. You sinned against me, and you must suffer shame and disgrace for what you have done. I, the 
EZK.36.33	After I have made you clean, I will let you rebuild your ruined towns and let you live in them. 
EZK.36.34	Your land will be plowed again, and nobody will be able to see that it was once barren. 
EZK.36.35	Instead, they will say that it looks as beautiful as the garden of Eden. They won't see towns lying in ruins, but they will see your strong cities filled with people. 
EZK.36.36	Then the nearby nations that survive will know that I am the one who rebuilt the ruined places and replanted the barren fields. I, the 
EZK.36.37	I will once again answer your prayers, and I will let your nation grow until you are like a large flock of sheep. 
EZK.36.38	The towns that now lie in ruins will be filled with people, just as Jerusalem was once filled with sheep to be offered as sacrifices during a festival. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	Some time later, I felt the 
EZK.37.2	The 
EZK.37.3	He said, “Ezekiel, son of man, can these bones come back to life?”
EZK.37.3	I replied, “
EZK.37.4	He then told me to say:
EZK.37.4	Dry bones, listen to what the 
EZK.37.5	“I, the 
EZK.37.6	I will wrap you with muscles and skin and breathe life into you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	I did what the 
EZK.37.8	I saw muscles and skin cover the bones, but they had no life in them.
EZK.37.9	The 
EZK.37.9	Ezekiel, now say to the wind,
EZK.37.11	The 
EZK.37.11	Ezekiel, the people of Israel are like dead bones. They complain that they are dried up and that they have no hope for the future. 
EZK.37.12	So tell them, “I, the 
EZK.37.13	and when that happens, you will realize that I am the 
EZK.37.14	My Spirit will give you breath, and you will live again. I will bring you home, and you will know that I have kept my promise. I, the 
EZK.37.15	The 
EZK.37.16	Ezekiel, son of man, get a stick and write on it, “The kingdom of Judah.” Then get another stick and write on it, “The kingdom of Israel.”
EZK.37.17	Hold these two sticks end to end, so they look like one stick. 
EZK.37.18	And when your people ask you what this means, 
EZK.37.19	tell them that I, the 
EZK.37.20	Hold these two sticks where they can be seen by everyone 
EZK.37.21	and then say:
EZK.37.21	I, the 
EZK.37.22	I will make them into one nation and let them once again live in the land of Israel. Only one king will rule them, and they will never again be divided into two nations. 
EZK.37.23	They will no longer worship idols and do things that make them unacceptable to me. I will wash away their sin and make them clean, and I will protect them from everything that makes them unclean. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.37.26	I solemnly promise to bless the people of Israel with unending peace. I will protect them and let them become a powerful nation. My temple will stand in Israel for all time, 
EZK.37.27	 and I will live among my people and be their God. 
EZK.37.28	Every nation on earth will know that my temple is in Israel and that I have chosen the Israelites to be my people.
EZK.38.1	The 
EZK.38.3	I, the 
EZK.38.4	and I will make you powerless! I will put a hook in your jaw and drag away both you and your large army. You command cavalry troops that wear heavy armor and carry shields and swords. 
EZK.38.5	Your army includes soldiers from Persia, Ethiopia,
EZK.38.6	as well as from Gomer and Beth-Togarmah in the north. Your army is enormous!
EZK.38.7	So keep your troops prepared to fight, 
EZK.38.8	because in a few years, I will command you to invade Israel, a country that was ruined by war. It was deserted for a long time, but its people have returned from the foreign nations where they once lived. The Israelites now live in peace in the mountains of their own land. 
EZK.38.9	But you and your army will attack them like a fierce thunderstorm and surround them like a cloud.
EZK.38.10	When that day comes, I know that you will have an evil plan 
EZK.38.11	to take advantage of Israel, that weak and peaceful country where people live safely inside towns that have no walls or gates or locks. 
EZK.38.12	You will rob the people in towns that were once a pile of rubble. These people lived as prisoners in foreign nations, but they have returned to Israel, the most important place in the world, and they own livestock and property. 
EZK.38.13	The people of Sheba and Dedan, along with merchants from villages in
EZK.38.14	I, the 
EZK.38.15	you will lead your powerful cavalry from your kingdom in the north. 
EZK.38.16	You will attack my people like a storm-cloud that covers their land. I will let you invade my country Israel, so that every nation on earth will know that I, the 
EZK.38.17	The 
EZK.38.17	Long ago, I ordered my prophets to warn the people of Israel that someday I would send an enemy to attack them. You, Gog, are that enemy, and that day is coming. 
EZK.38.18	When you invade Israel, I will become furious, 
EZK.38.19	and in my anger I will send a terrible earthquake to shake Israel. 
EZK.38.20	Every living thing on earth will tremble in fear of me—every fish and bird, every wild animal and reptile, and every human. Mountains will crumble, cliffs will fall, and cities will collapse. 
EZK.38.21	I, the 
EZK.38.22	I will strike you with diseases and punish you with death. You and your army will be pounded with rainstorms, hailstones, and burning sulfur. 
EZK.38.23	I will do these things to show the world that I, the 
EZK.39.1	Ezekiel, son of man, condemn Gog and tell him:
EZK.39.1	You are the ruler of Meshech and Tubal, but I, the 
EZK.39.2	I will turn you around and drag you from the north until you reach the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.39.3	I will knock the bow out of your left hand and the arrows out of your right hand, 
EZK.39.4	 and you and your army will die on those mountains. Then birds and wild animals will eat the flesh 
EZK.39.5	of your dead bodies left lying in open fields. I, the 
EZK.39.6	I will set fire to the land of Magog and to those nations along the seacoast that think they are so secure, and they will know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	My people Israel will know me, and they will no longer disgrace my holy name. Everyone on earth will know that I am the holy 
EZK.39.8	The day is coming when these things will happen, just as I have promised.
EZK.39.9	When that day comes, the people in the towns of Israel will collect the weapons of their dead enemies. They will use these shields, bows and arrows, spears, and clubs as firewood, and there will be enough to last for seven years. 
EZK.39.10	They will burn these weapons instead of gathering sticks or chopping down trees. That's how the Israelites will take revenge on those who robbed and abused them. I, the 
EZK.39.11	After Gog has been destroyed, I will bury him and his army in Israel, in Travelers'
EZK.39.12	The Israelites will spend seven months burying dead bodies and cleaning up their land. 
EZK.39.13	Everyone will help with the burial, and they will be honored for this on the day the brightness of my glory is seen. 
EZK.39.14	After those seven months, the people will appoint a group of men to look for any dead bodies left unburied. This must be done for seven months to make sure that the land is no longer unclean. 
EZK.39.15	Whenever they find a human bone, they will set up a marker next to it. Then the gravediggers will bury it in “The Valley of Gog's Army” 
EZK.39.16	near the town of “Gog's Army.” After that, the land will be pure again.
EZK.39.18	will feast on the bodies of warriors and foreign rulers that I will sacrifice like sheep, goats, and bulls. 
EZK.39.19	I want the birds and animals to eat until they are full and drink until they are drunk. 
EZK.39.20	They will come to my table and stuff themselves with the flesh of horses and warriors of every kind. I, the 
EZK.39.21	When I punish the nations of the earth, they will see the brightness of my glory. 
EZK.39.22	The people of Israel will know from then on that I am the 
EZK.39.23	Foreign nations will realize that the Israelites were forced to leave their own land because they sinned against me. I turned my back on my people and let enemies attack and kill them. 
EZK.39.24	Their lives were wicked and corrupt, and they deserved to be punished.
EZK.39.25	Now I will show mercy to the people of Israel and bring them back from the nations where they are living. They are Jacob's descendants, so I will bless them and show that I am holy. 
EZK.39.26	They will live safely in their own land, but will be ashamed when they remember their evil ways and how they disgraced me.
EZK.39.27	Foreign nations will watch as I take the Israelites from enemy lands and bring them back home, and those nations will see that I am holy.
EZK.39.28	My people will realize that I, the 
EZK.39.29	Never again will I turn my back on the people of Israel, and my Spirit will live in them. I, the 
EZK.40.3	 In my vision the 
EZK.40.4	The man said, “Ezekiel, son of man, pay close attention to everything I'm going to show you—that's why you've been brought here. Listen carefully, because you must tell the people of Israel what you see.”
EZK.40.6+EZK.40.7	Then he went to the east gate, where he walked up steps that led to a long passageway. On each side of this passageway were three guardrooms, which were three meters square, and they were separated by walls two and a half meters thick. The man measured the distance between the opening of the gate and the first guardroom, and it was three meters, the thickness of the outer wall.
EZK.40.6+EZK.40.7	At the far end of this passageway, I saw an entrance room that faced the courtyard of the temple itself. There was also a distance of three meters between the last guardroom and the entrance room 
EZK.40.8+EZK.40.9	at the end of the passageway. The man measured this room: It was four meters from the doorway to the opposite wall, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was one meter. 
EZK.40.10	The three guardrooms on each side of the passageway were the same size, and the walls that separated them were the same thickness.
EZK.40.11	Next, the man measured the width of the passageway, and it was six and a half meters, but the two doors of the gate were only five meters wide.
EZK.40.12	In front of the guardrooms, which were three meters square, was a railing about 50 centimeters high and 50 centimeters thick. 
EZK.40.13	The man measured the distance from the back wall
EZK.40.14	He measured the entrance room at the far end of the passageway, and it was ten meters wide.
EZK.40.15	Finally, he measured the total length of the passageway, from the outer wall to the entrance room, and it was 25 meters. 
EZK.40.16	The three walls in the guardrooms had small windows in them, just like the ones in the entrance room.
EZK.40.17	The man then led me through the passageway and into the outer courtyard of the temple, where I saw 30 rooms built around the outside of the courtyard.
EZK.40.18	This was known as the lower sidewalk, and it was 25 meters wide.
EZK.40.19	I saw the gates that led to the inner courtyard of the temple and noticed that they were higher than those leading to the outer courtyard. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gates, and it was 50 meters.
EZK.40.20	Next, the man measured the north gate that led to the outer courtyard. 
EZK.40.21	This gate also had three guardrooms on each side of a passageway. The measurements of these rooms, the walls between them, and the entrance room at the far end of the passageway were exactly the same as those of the east gate. The north gate was also 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide, 
EZK.40.22	and the windows, the entrance room, and the carvings of palm trees were just like those in the east gate. The entrance room also faced the courtyard of the temple and had seven steps leading up to it. 
EZK.40.23	Directly across the outer courtyard was a gate that led to the inner courtyard, just as there was for the east gate. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate, and it was 50 meters.
EZK.40.24	The man then took me to the south gate. He measured the walls and the entrance room of this gate, and the measurements were exactly the same as those of the other two gates. 
EZK.40.25	There were windows in the guardrooms of this gate and in the entrance room, just like the others, and this gate was also 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide. 
EZK.40.26	Seven steps led up to the gate; the entrance room was at the far end of the passageway and faced the courtyard of the temple. Carvings of palm trees decorated the walls along the passageway. 
EZK.40.27	And directly across the outer courtyard was a gate on the south side of the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate, and it was also 50 meters.
EZK.40.28	We then went into the inner courtyard, through the gate on the south side of the temple. The man measured the gate, and it was the same size as the gates in the outer wall. 
EZK.40.29+EZK.40.30	In fact, everything along the passageway was also the same size, including the guardrooms, the walls separating them, the entrance room at the far end, and the windows. This gate, like the others, was 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide. 
EZK.40.31	The entrance room of this gate faced the outer courtyard, and carvings of palm trees decorated the walls of the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate.
EZK.40.32	Next, we went through the east gate to the inner courtyard. The man measured this gate, and it was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.33	The guardrooms, the walls separating them, and its entrance room had the same measurements as the other gates. The guardrooms and the entrance room had windows, and the gate was 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide. 
EZK.40.34	The entrance room faced the outer courtyard, and the walls in the passageway were decorated with carvings of palm trees. Eight steps also led up to this gate.
EZK.40.35	Then the man took me to the north gate. He measured it, and it was the same size as the others, 
EZK.40.36	including the guardrooms, the walls separating them, and the entrance room. There were also windows in this gate. It was 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide, 
EZK.40.37	and like the other inner gates, its entrance room faced the outer courtyard, and its walls were decorated with carvings of palm trees. Eight steps also led up to this gate.
EZK.40.38+EZK.40.39	Inside the entrance room of the north gate, I saw four tables, two on each side of the room, where the animals to be sacrificed were killed. Just outside
EZK.40.40	Four more tables were in the outer courtyard, two on each side of the steps leading into the entrance room. 
EZK.40.41	So there was a total of eight tables, four inside and four outside, where the animals were killed, 
EZK.40.42+EZK.40.43	and where the meat was placed until it was sacrificed on the altar.
EZK.40.42+EZK.40.43	Next to the tables in the entrance room were four stone tables 50 centimeters high and 75 centimeters square; the equipment used for killing the animals was kept on top of these tables. All around the walls of this room was a 75-millimeter shelf.
EZK.40.44	The man then took me to the inner courtyard, where I saw two buildings, one beside the inner gate on the north and the other beside the inner gate on the south.
EZK.40.45	He said, “The building beside the north gate belongs to the priests who serve in the temple, 
EZK.40.46	and the building beside the south gate belongs to those who serve at the altar. All of them are descendants of Zadok and are the only Levites allowed to serve as the 
EZK.40.47	Now the man measured the inner courtyard; it was 50 meters square. I also saw an altar in front of the temple.
EZK.40.48	We walked to the porch of the temple, and the man measured the doorway of the porch: It was seven meters long,
EZK.40.49	The porch itself was ten meters by six
EZK.41.1	Next we went into the main room of the temple. The man measured the doorway of this room: It was 3 meters wide,
EZK.41.2	five meters long, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was two and a half meters. The main room itself was 20 meters by 10 meters.
EZK.41.3+EZK.41.4	Then the man walked to the far end of the temple's main room and said, “Beyond this doorway is the most holy place.” He first measured the doorway: It was one meter wide, 3 meters long, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was 3.5 meters. Then he measured the most holy place, and it was 10 meters square.
EZK.41.5	The man measured the wall of the temple, and it was three meters thick. Storage rooms two meters wide were built against the outside of the wall. 
EZK.41.6	There were three levels of rooms, with 30 rooms on each level, and they rested on ledges that were attached to the temple walls, so that nothing was built into the walls. 
EZK.41.7	The walls of the temple were thicker at the bottom than at the top, which meant that the storage rooms on the top level were wider than those on the bottom level.
EZK.41.8	The temple rested on a stone base three meters high, which also served as the foundation for the storage rooms. 
EZK.41.9	The outside walls of the storage rooms were two and a half meters thick; there was nothing between these walls 
EZK.41.10	and the nearest buildings ten meters away. 
EZK.41.11	One door led into the storage rooms on the north side of the temple, and another door led to those on the south side. The stone base extended two and a half meters beyond the outside wall of the storage rooms.
EZK.41.12	I noticed another building: It faced the west end of the temple and was 35 meters wide, 45 meters long, and had walls over 2.5 meters thick.
EZK.41.13	The man measured the length of the temple, and it was 50 meters. He then measured from the back wall of the temple, across the open space behind the temple, to the back wall of the west building; it was 50 meters. 
EZK.41.14	The distance across the front of the temple, including the open space on either side, was also 50 meters.
EZK.41.15	Finally, the man measured the length of the west building, including the side rooms on each end, and it was also 50 meters.
EZK.41.15	The inside walls of the temple's porch and main room
EZK.41.16	were paneled with wood all the way from the floor to the windows, while the doorways, the small windows, and the three side rooms were trimmed in wood.
EZK.41.17	The paneling stopped just above the doorway. These walls were decorated
EZK.41.18+EZK.41.19+EZK.41.20	with carvings of winged creatures and had a carving of a palm tree between the creatures. Each winged creature had two faces: A human face looking at the palm tree on one side, and a lion's face looking at the palm tree on the other side. These designs were carved into the paneling all the way around the two rooms.
EZK.41.21	The doorframe to the temple's main room was in the shape of a rectangle.
EZK.41.21	In front of the doorway to the most holy place was something that looked like 
EZK.41.22	a wooden altar. It was one and a half meters high and one meter square,
EZK.41.23	Both the doorway to the main room of the temple and the doorway to the most holy place had two doors, 
EZK.41.24	and each door had two sections that could fold open. 
EZK.41.25	The doors to the main room were decorated with carvings of winged creatures and palm trees just like those on the walls, and there was a wooden covering over the porch just outside these doors. 
EZK.41.26	The walls on each side of this porch had small windows and were also decorated with carvings of palm trees.
EZK.42.1+EZK.42.2	After the man and I left the temple and walked back to the outer courtyard, he showed me a set of rooms on the north side of the west building.
EZK.42.3	On one side of them was the 10 meters of open space that ran alongside the temple,
EZK.42.4	with doors that opened toward the north, and in front of them was a walkway five meters wide and 50 meters long.
EZK.42.5	The rooms on the top level were narrower than those on the middle level, and the rooms on the middle level were narrower than those on the bottom level. 
EZK.42.6	The rooms on the bottom level supported those on the two upper levels, and so these rooms did not have columns like other buildings in the courtyard. 
EZK.42.7+EZK.42.8	To the north was a privacy wall 25 meters long,
EZK.42.9+EZK.42.10	and at the east end of this wall was the door leading from the courtyard to these rooms.
EZK.42.9+EZK.42.10	There was also a set of rooms on the south
EZK.42.11	These rooms were exactly like those on the north side, and they also had a walkway in front of them. 
EZK.42.12	The door to these rooms was at the east end of the wall that stood in front of them.
EZK.42.13	The man then said to me:
EZK.42.13	These rooms on the north and south sides of the temple are the sacred rooms where the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests are ready to leave the temple, they must go through these rooms before they return to the outer courtyard. They must leave their sacred clothes in these rooms and put on regular clothes before going anywhere near other people.
EZK.42.15	After the man had finished measuring the buildings inside the temple area, he took me back through the east gate and measured the wall around this area. 
EZK.42.16	He used his measuring stick to measure the east side of this wall; it was 250 meters long. 
EZK.42.17+EZK.42.18+EZK.42.19	Then he measured the north side, the south side, and the west side of the wall, and they were each 250 meters long, 
EZK.42.20	and so the temple area was a perfect square. The wall around this area separated what was sacred from what was ordinary.
EZK.43.1	The man took me back to the east gate of the temple, 
EZK.43.2	 where I saw the brightness of the glory of Israel's God coming from the east. The sound I heard was as loud as ocean waves, and everything around was shining with the dazzling brightness of his glory. 
EZK.43.3	This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem and like the one I had seen near the Chebar River.
EZK.43.3	I immediately bowed with my face to the ground, 
EZK.43.4	and the 
EZK.43.5	The 
EZK.43.6	The man was standing beside me, and I heard the 
EZK.43.7	Ezekiel, son of man, this temple is my throne on earth. I will live here among the people of Israel forever. They and their kings will never again disgrace me by worshiping idols at local shrines or by setting up memorials to their dead kings.
EZK.43.8	Israel's kings built their palaces so close to my holy temple that only a wall separated them from me. Then these kings disgraced me with their evil ways, and in my fierce anger I destroyed them. 
EZK.43.9	But if the people and their kings stop worshiping other gods and tear down those memorials, I will live among them forever.
EZK.43.10	The people of Israel must suffer shame for sinning against me, so tell them about my holy temple. Let them think about it, 
EZK.43.11	then if they are truly sorry, describe for them the design and shape of the temple, the gates, the measurements, and how the buildings are arranged. Explain the regulations about worshiping there, then write down these things, so they can study and obey them.
EZK.43.12	The temple area on my holy mountain must be kept sacred! This is the most important law about the temple.
EZK.43.14+EZK.43.15+EZK.43.16+EZK.43.17	The altar rested on a base and had three sections, each one of them square. The bottom section was 8 meters on each side and one meter high. The middle section was 7 meters on each side and 2 meters high, and it had a 25-centimeter rim around its outer edge. The top section, which was 6 meters on each side and 2 meters high, was the place where sacrifices were burned, and the four corners of the top section looked like the horns of a bull. The steps leading up to the altar were on the east side.
EZK.43.18	Ezekiel, son of man, after the altar is built, it must be dedicated by offering sacrifices on it and by splattering it with blood. Here is what you must do: 
EZK.43.19	The priests of the Levi tribe from the family of Zadok the priest are the only ones who may serve in my temple—this is my law. So give them a young bull to slaughter as a sacrifice for sin. 
EZK.43.20	Take some of the animal's blood and smear it on the four corners of the altar, some on the corners of the middle section, and some more on the rim around its edge. That will purify the altar and make it fit for offering sacrifices to me. 
EZK.43.21	Then take the body of the bull outside the temple area and burn it at the special place.
EZK.43.22	The next day, a goat
EZK.43.23	Then choose a young bull and a young ram that have nothing wrong with them, 
EZK.43.24	and bring them to my temple. The priests will sprinkle salt on them
EZK.43.25	Each day for the next seven days, you must offer a goat and a bull and a ram as sacrifices for sin. These animals must have nothing wrong with them. 
EZK.43.26	The priests will purify the altar during those days, so that it will be acceptable to me and ready to use. 
EZK.43.27	From then on, the priests will use this altar to offer sacrifices to please me and sacrifices to ask my blessing.
EZK.44.1	The man took me back to the outer courtyard, near the east gate of the temple area. I saw that the doors to this gate were closed. 
EZK.44.2	The 
EZK.44.2	I, the 
EZK.44.3	The ruler of Israel may come here to eat a sacrificial meal that has been offered to me, but he must use only the entrance room of this gate.
EZK.44.4	Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the temple. I saw that the brightness of the 
EZK.44.5	The 
EZK.44.5	Ezekiel, son of man, I am going to give you the laws for my temple. So pay attention and listen carefully to what kind of people are allowed to come in the temple, and what kind are not. 
EZK.44.6	Tell those rebellious people of Israel:
EZK.44.6	I, the 
EZK.44.7	My temple has been disgraced, because you have let godless, stubborn foreigners come here when sacrifices are being offered to me. You have sinned and have broken our solemn agreement. 
EZK.44.8	Instead of following the proper ways to worship me, you have put foreigners in charge of worship at my temple.
EZK.44.9	And so I, the 
EZK.44.10	Some of the Levites turned their backs on me and joined the other people of Israel in worshiping idols. So these Levites must be punished! 
EZK.44.11	They will still be allowed to serve me as temple workers by guarding the gates and by killing the animals to be sacrificed and by helping the worshipers. 
EZK.44.12	But because these Levites served the people of Israel when they worshiped idols, I, the 
EZK.44.13	and now I will no longer let the Levites serve as my priests or come near anything sacred to me. They must suffer shame and disgrace for their disgusting sins. 
EZK.44.14	They will be responsible for all the hard work that must be done in the temple.
EZK.44.15	The priests of the Levi tribe who are descendants of Zadok the priest were faithful to me, even when the rest of the Israelites turned away. And so, these priests will continue to serve as my priests and to offer the fat and the blood of sacrifices. 
EZK.44.16	They will come into my temple, where they will offer sacrifices at my altar and lead others in worship.
EZK.44.18	Even their turbans and underwear must be made of linen to keep my priests from sweating when they work. 
EZK.44.19	 And before they leave to join the other people in the outer courtyard, they must take off their priestly clothes, then place them in the sacred rooms and put on their regular clothes.
EZK.44.21	 They must not drink wine before going to the inner courtyard.
EZK.44.24	They will make decisions in difficult legal cases, according to my own laws. They must also observe the religious festivals my Law requires and must always respect the Sabbath.
EZK.44.26	If a priest touches a dead body, he is unclean and must go through a ceremony to make himself clean. Then seven days later, 
EZK.44.27	he must go to the inner courtyard of the temple and offer a sacrifice for sin. After that, he may once again serve as my priest. I, the 
EZK.44.29	 Instead, they will receive part of the grain sacrifices, as well as part of the sacrifices for sin and sacrifices to make things right. They will also be given everything in Israel that has been completely dedicated to me.
EZK.44.30	The first part of every harvest will belong to the priests. They will also receive part of all special gifts and offerings the Israelites bring to me. And whenever any of my people bake bread, they will give their first loaf as an offering to the priests, and I will bless the homes of the people when they do this.
EZK.45.1	When the land of Israel is divided among the twelve tribes, you must set aside an area that will belong to me. This sacred area will be 12.5 kilometers long and 10 kilometers
EZK.45.2	The temple will be on a piece of land 255 meters square, and the temple will be completely surrounded by an open space 25 meters wide.
EZK.45.3+EZK.45.4	I will give half of my sacred land, a section 12.5 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide, to the priests who serve in the temple. Their houses will be in this half, as well as my temple, which is the most sacred place of all.
EZK.45.5	I will give the other half of my land to the Levites who work in my temple, and the towns
EZK.45.6	Next to my sacred land will be an area 12.5 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide. This will belong to the people of Israel and will include the city of Jerusalem.
EZK.45.7+EZK.45.8	The regions west and east of my sacred land and the city of Jerusalem will belong to the ruler of Israel. He will be given the region between the western edge of my land and the Mediterranean Sea, and between the eastern edge of my land and the Jordan River. This will mean that the length of his property will be the same as the sections of land given to the tribes.
EZK.45.7+EZK.45.8	This property will belong to every ruler of Israel, so they will always be fair to my people and will let them live peacefully in the land given to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	The 
EZK.45.9	You leaders of Israel have cheated and abused my people long enough! I want you to stop sinning and start doing what is right and fair. You must never again force my people off their own land. I, the 
EZK.45.11	The 
EZK.45.12	The standard unit of weight will be the 
EZK.45.13	Leaders of Israel, the people must bring you one sixtieth of their grain harvests as offerings to me. 
EZK.45.14	They will also bring one percent of their olive oil. These things will be measured according to the 
EZK.45.15	Finally, they must bring one sheep out of every 200 from their flocks.
EZK.45.15	These offerings will be used as grain sacrifices, as well as sacrifices to please me
EZK.45.16	The people of Israel will bring you these offerings. 
EZK.45.17	But during New Moon Festivals, Sabbath celebrations, and other religious feasts, you leaders will be responsible for providing animals for the sacrifices, as well as the grain and wine. All these will be used for the sacrifices for sin, the grain sacrifices, the sacrifices to please me, and those to ask my blessing. I will be pleased and will forgive the sins of my people.
EZK.45.18	The 
EZK.45.18	On the first day of the first month,
EZK.45.19	The priest will take some blood from this sacrifice and smear it on the doorposts of the temple, as well as on the four corners of the altar and on the doorposts of the gates that lead into the inner courtyard.
EZK.45.20	The same ceremony must also be done on the seventh day of the month, so that anyone who sins accidentally or without knowing it will be forgiven, and so that my temple will remain holy.
EZK.45.22	On the first day, the ruler will bring a bull to offer as a sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the people. 
EZK.45.23	Each day of the festival he is to bring seven bulls and seven rams as sacrifices to please me,
EZK.45.24	He will also provide nine kilograms of grain and three liters of olive oil to be offered with each bull and each ram.
EZK.46.1	The 
EZK.46.1	The east gate of the inner courtyard must remain closed during the six working days of each week. But on the Sabbath and on the first day of the month, this gate will be opened. 
EZK.46.2	Israel's ruler will go from the outer courtyard into the entrance room of this gate and stand in the doorway while the priest offers sacrifices to ask my blessing
EZK.46.3	Each Sabbath and on the first day of each month, the people of Israel must also come to the east gate and worship me. 
EZK.46.4	On the Sabbath, the ruler will bring six lambs and one ram to be offered as sacrifices to please me. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals. 
EZK.46.5	With the ram, he is to offer nine kilograms of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three liters of olive oil with every nine kilograms of grain.
EZK.46.6	The ruler is to bring six lambs, a bull, and a ram to be offered as sacrifices at the New Moon Festival. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals. 
EZK.46.7	With the bull and the ram, he is to offer nine kilograms of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three liters of olive oil with every nine kilograms of grain. 
EZK.46.8	The ruler must come through the entrance room of the east gate and leave the same way.
EZK.46.9	When my people come to worship me during any festival, they must always leave by the opposite gate from which they came: Those who come in the north gate must leave by the south gate, and those who come in the south gate must leave by the north gate. 
EZK.46.10	Their ruler will come in at the same time they do and leave at the same time they leave.
EZK.46.11	At all other festivals and celebrations, nine kilograms of grain will be offered with a bull, and nine kilograms will be offered with a ram. The worshipers can offer as much grain as they want with each lamb. Three liters of olive oil must be offered with every nine kilograms of grain.
EZK.46.12	If the ruler voluntarily offers a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing, the east gate of the inner courtyard will be opened for him. He will offer his sacrifices just as he does on each Sabbath; then he will leave, and the gate will be closed.
EZK.46.13	Each morning a year-old lamb that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice to please me. 
EZK.46.14	Along with it, two kilograms of fine flour mixed with a liter of olive oil must be offered as a grain sacrifice. This law will never change— 
EZK.46.15	the lamb, the flour, and the olive oil will be offered to me every morning for all time.
EZK.46.16	The 
EZK.46.16	If the ruler of Israel gives some of his land to one of his children, it will belong to the ruler's child as part of the family property. 
EZK.46.17	 But if the ruler gives some of his land to one of his servants, the land will belong to the servant until the Year of Celebration, when it will be returned to the ruler.
EZK.46.18	The ruler must never abuse my people by taking land from them. Any land he gives his children must already belong to him.
EZK.46.19	The man who was showing me the temple
EZK.46.20	and said, “These are the kitchens where the priests must boil the meat to be offered as sacrifices to make things right
EZK.46.21	We went back to the outer courtyard and walked past the four corners. 
EZK.46.22	At each corner I saw a smaller courtyard, 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. 
EZK.46.23	Around the inside of these smaller courtyards was a low wall of stones, and against the wall were places to build fires.
EZK.46.24	The man said, “These are the kitchens where the temple workers will boil the meat that worshipers offer as sacrifices.”
EZK.47.2	We walked out of the temple area through the north gate and went around to the east gate. I saw the small stream of water flowing east from the south side of the gate.
EZK.47.3	The man walked east, then took out his measuring stick and measured 500 meters downstream. He told me to wade through the stream there, and the water came up to my ankles. 
EZK.47.4	Then he measured another 500 meters downstream, and told me to wade through it there. The water came up to my knees. Another 500 meters downstream the water came up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	Another 500 meters downstream, the stream had become a river that could be crossed only by swimming. 
EZK.47.6	The man said, “Ezekiel, son of man, pay attention to what you've seen.”
EZK.47.6	We walked to the riverbank, 
EZK.47.7	where I saw dozens of trees on each side. 
EZK.47.8	The man said:
EZK.47.8	This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water. 
EZK.47.9	Wherever this water flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish, because it will bring life and fresh water to the Dead Sea. 
EZK.47.10	From En-Gedi to Eneglaim, people will fish in the sea and dry their nets along the coast. There will be as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But the marshes along the shore will remain salty, so that people can use the salt from them.
EZK.47.13+EZK.47.14	The 
EZK.47.13+EZK.47.14	When the land is divided among the twelve tribes of Israel, the Joseph tribe
EZK.47.15	The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea, then continue eastward to Hethlon, to Lebo-Hamath, then across to Zedad, 
EZK.47.16	Berothah,
EZK.47.17	So the northern border will run between the Mediterranean Sea and Hazar-Enon, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath.
EZK.47.18	The eastern border will begin on the border between the two kingdoms of Hauran and Damascus. It will run south along the Jordan River, which separates the territories of Gilead and Israel, and it will end at the Dead Sea near the town of Tamar.
EZK.47.19	The southern border will begin at Tamar, then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh. It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and will end at the Mediterranean Sea.
EZK.47.20	The western border will run north along the Mediterranean Sea to a point just west of Lebo-Hamath.
EZK.47.21	That is the land to be divided among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	It will belong to the Israelites and to any foreigners living among them whose children were born in Israel. These foreigners must be treated like any other Israelite citizen, and they will receive 
EZK.47.23	a share of the land given to the tribe where they live. I, the 
EZK.48.1+EZK.48.2+EZK.48.3+EZK.48.4+EZK.48.5+EZK.48.6+EZK.48.7	Each tribe will receive a section of land that runs from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea. The northern border of Israel will run along the towns of Hethlon and Lebo-Hamath, and will end at Hazar-Enon, which is on the border between the kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath. The tribes will receive their share of land in the following order, from north to south: Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and Judah.
EZK.48.8	South of Judah's territory will be a special section of land. Its length will be twelve and a half kilometers, and its width will run from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea. My temple will be located in this section of land.
EZK.48.9	An area in the center of this land will belong to me. It will be twelve and a half kilometers long and ten kilometers
EZK.48.10	I, the 
EZK.48.11	Only priests who are descendants of Zadok will receive a share of this sacred land, because they remained faithful to me when the Levites and the rest of the Israelites started sinning. 
EZK.48.12	The land belonging to the priests will be the most sacred area and will lie south of the area that belongs to the Levites.
EZK.48.13	I will give the other half of my sacred land to the Levites. Their share will also be twelve and a half kilometers long and five kilometers wide, 
EZK.48.14	and they must never sell or trade any of this land—it is the best land and belongs to me.
EZK.48.15	South of my sacred land will be a section twelve and a half kilometers long and three kilometers wide. It will not be sacred, but will belong to the people of Israel and will include the city of Jerusalem, together with its houses and pastureland. 
EZK.48.16	The city will be a square: Each side will be two kilometers long, 
EZK.48.17	and an open area 125 meters wide will surround the city. 
EZK.48.18	The land on the east and west sides of the city limits will be farmland for the people of Jerusalem; both sections will be five kilometers long and three kilometers wide. 
EZK.48.19	People from the city will farm the land, no matter which tribe they belong to.
EZK.48.20	And so the center of this special section of land will be for my sacred land, as well as for the city and its property. The land will be a square, twelve and a half kilometers on each side.
EZK.48.21	The regions east and west of this square of land will belong to the ruler of Israel. His property will run east to the Jordan River and west to the Mediterranean Sea. In the very center of his property will be my sacred land, as well as the temple, 
EZK.48.22	together with the share belonging to the Levites and the city of Jerusalem. The northern border of the ruler's property will be the land that belongs to Judah, and the southern border will be the land that belongs to Benjamin.
EZK.48.23+EZK.48.24+EZK.48.25+EZK.48.26+EZK.48.27	South of this special section will be the land that belongs to the rest of Israel's tribes. Each tribe will receive a section of land that runs from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea. The tribes will receive their share of land in the following order, from north to south: Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad.
EZK.48.28	Gad's southern border is also the southern border of Israel. It will begin at the town of Tamar, then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh. It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea.
EZK.48.29	That's how the land of Israel will be divided among the twelve tribes. I, the 
EZK.48.35	and so the total length of the wall will be ten kilometers. The new name of the city will be “The-
DAN.1.2	 The Lord let Nebuchadnezzar capture Jehoiakim and take away some of the things used in God's temple. And when the king returned to Babylonia,
DAN.1.3	One day the king ordered Ashpenaz, his highest palace official, to choose some young men from the royal family of Judah and from other leading Jewish families. 
DAN.1.4	The king said, “They must be healthy, handsome, smart, wise, educated, and fit to serve in the royal palace. Teach them how to speak and write our language 
DAN.1.5	and give them the same food and wine that I am served. Train them for three years, and then they can become court officials.”
DAN.1.6	Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all from the tribe of Judah. 
DAN.1.7	But the king's chief official gave them Babylonian names: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego.
DAN.1.8	Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat. And he asked the king's chief official for permission not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace. 
DAN.1.9	God had made the official friendly and kind to Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	But the man still told him, “The king has decided what you must eat and drink. And I am afraid he will kill me, if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men.”
DAN.1.11	The king's official had put a guard in charge of Daniel and his three friends. So Daniel said to the guard, 
DAN.1.12	“For the next ten days, let us have only vegetables and water at mealtime. 
DAN.1.13	When the ten days are up, compare how we look with the other young men, and decide what to do with us.” 
DAN.1.14	The guard agreed to do what Daniel had asked.
DAN.1.15	Ten days later, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better than the young men who had been served food from the royal palace. 
DAN.1.16	After this, the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine.
DAN.1.17	God made the four young men smart and wise. They read a lot of books and became well educated. Daniel could also tell the meaning of dreams and visions.
DAN.1.18	At the end of the three-year period set by King Nebuchadnezzar, his chief palace official brought all the young men to him. 
DAN.1.19	The king interviewed them and discovered that none of the others were as outstanding as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they were given positions in the royal court. 
DAN.1.20	From then on, whenever the king asked for advice, he found their wisdom was ten times better than that of any of his other advisors and magicians. 
DAN.1.21	Daniel served there until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	During the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had such horrible nightmares that he could not sleep. 
DAN.2.2	So he called in his counselors, advisors, magicians, and wise men, 
DAN.2.3	and said, “I am disturbed by a dream that I don't understand, and I want you to explain it.”
DAN.2.4	They answered in Aramaic,
DAN.2.5	But the king replied, “No! I have made up my mind. If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down. 
DAN.2.6	However, if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be greatly rewarded and highly honored. Now tell me the dream and explain what it means.”
DAN.2.7	“Your Majesty,” they said, “if you will only tell us your dream, we will interpret it for you.”
DAN.2.8	The king replied, “You're just stalling for time, 
DAN.2.9	because you know what's going to happen if you don't come up with the answer. You've decided to make up a bunch of lies, hoping I might change my mind. Now tell me the dream, and that will prove that you can interpret it.”
DAN.2.10	His advisors explained, “Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible! No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisors, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing. 
DAN.2.11	It can't be done, except by the gods, and they don't live here on earth.”
DAN.2.12+DAN.2.13	This made the king so angry that he gave orders for every wise man in Babylonia to be put to death, including Daniel and his three friends.
DAN.2.14	Arioch was the king's official in charge of putting the wise men to death. He was on his way to have it done, when Daniel very wisely went to him 
DAN.2.15	and asked, “Why did the king give such cruel
DAN.2.16	Daniel rushed off and said to the king, “If you will just give me some time, I'll explain your dream.”
DAN.2.17	Daniel returned home and told his three friends. 
DAN.2.18	Then he said, “Pray that the God who rules from heaven will be merciful and explain this mystery, so that we and the others won't be put to death.” 
DAN.2.19	In a vision one night, Daniel was shown the dream and its meaning. Then he praised the God who rules from heaven:
DAN.2.20	“Our God, your name
DAN.2.20	will be praised
DAN.2.20	forever and forever.
DAN.2.20	You are all-powerful,
DAN.2.20	and you know everything.
DAN.2.21	You control human events—
DAN.2.21	you give rulers their power
DAN.2.21	and take it away,
DAN.2.21	and you are the source
DAN.2.21	of wisdom and knowledge.
DAN.2.22	“You explain deep mysteries,
DAN.2.22	because even the dark
DAN.2.22	is light to you.
DAN.2.23	You are the God
DAN.2.23	who was worshiped
DAN.2.23	by my ancestors.
DAN.2.23	Now I thank you and praise you
DAN.2.23	for making me wise
DAN.2.23	and telling me the king's dream,
DAN.2.23	together with its meaning.”
DAN.2.24	Daniel went back to Arioch, the official in charge of executing the wise men. Daniel said, “Don't kill those men! Take me to the king, and I will explain the meaning of his dream.”
DAN.2.25	Arioch rushed Daniel to the king and announced, “Your Majesty, I have found out that one of the men brought here from Judah can explain your dream.”
DAN.2.26	The king asked Daniel,
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered:
DAN.2.27	Your Majesty, not even the smartest person in all the world can do what you are demanding. 
DAN.2.28+DAN.2.29	But the God who rules from heaven can explain mysteries. And while you were sleeping, he showed you what will happen in the future. 
DAN.2.30	However, you must realize that these mysteries weren't explained to me because I am smarter than everyone else. Instead, it was done so that you would understand what you have seen.
DAN.2.31	Your Majesty, what you saw standing in front of you was a huge and terrifying statue, shining brightly. 
DAN.2.32	Its head was made of gold, its chest and arms were silver, and from its waist down to its knees, it was bronze. 
DAN.2.33	From there to its ankles it was iron, and its feet were a mixture of iron and clay.
DAN.2.34	As you watched, a stone was cut from a mountain—but not by human hands. The stone struck the feet, completely shattering the iron and clay. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed and blown away without a trace, like husks of wheat at threshing time. But the stone became a tremendous mountain that covered the entire earth.
DAN.2.36	That was the dream, and now I'll tell you what it means. 
DAN.2.37	Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings, and God has highly honored you with power 
DAN.2.38	over all humans, animals, and birds. You are the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	After you are gone, another kingdom will rule, but it won't be as strong. Then it will be followed by a kingdom of bronze that will rule the whole world. 
DAN.2.40	Next, a kingdom of iron will come to power, crushing and shattering everything.
DAN.2.41+DAN.2.42	This fourth kingdom will be divided—it will be both strong and brittle, just as you saw that the feet and toes were a mixture of iron and clay. 
DAN.2.43	This kingdom will be the result of a marriage between kingdoms, but it will crumble, just as iron and clay don't stick together.
DAN.2.44+DAN.2.45	During the time of those kings, the God who rules from heaven will set up an eternal kingdom that will never fall. It will be like the stone that was cut from the mountain, but not by human hands—the stone that crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. Your Majesty, in your dream the great God has told you what is going to happen, and you can trust this interpretation.
DAN.2.46	King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low to the ground and worshiped Daniel. Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice of grain to be offered in honor of Daniel. 
DAN.2.47	The king said, “Now I know that your God is above all other gods and kings, because he gave you the power to explain this mystery.” 
DAN.2.48	The king then presented Daniel with a lot of gifts; he promoted him to governor of Babylon Province and put him in charge of the other wise men. 
DAN.2.49	At Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to high positions in Babylon Province, and he let Daniel stay on as a palace official.
DAN.3.2	and he commanded his governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom to the dedication of the statue. 
DAN.3.3	So all of them came and stood in front of it.
DAN.3.4	Then an official stood up and announced:
DAN.3.4	People of every nation and race, now listen to the king's command! 
DAN.3.5	Trumpets, flutes, harps, and all other kinds of musical instruments will soon start playing. When you hear the music, you must bow down and worship the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Anyone who refuses will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace.
DAN.3.7	As soon as the people heard the music, they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue that the king had set up.
DAN.3.8	Some Babylonians used this as a chance to accuse the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.3.9	They said, “Your Majesty, we hope you live forever! 
DAN.3.10	You commanded everyone to bow down and worship the gold statue when the music played. 
DAN.3.11	And you said that anyone who did not bow down and worship it would be thrown into a flaming furnace. 
DAN.3.12	Sir, you appointed three men to high positions in Babylon Province, but they have disobeyed you. Those Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	King Nebuchadnezzar was furious. So he sent for the three young men and said, 
DAN.3.14	“I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up. 
DAN.3.15	Now I am going to give you one more chance. If you bow down and worship the statue when you hear the music, everything will be all right. But if you don't, you will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace. No god can save you from me.”
DAN.3.16	The three men replied, “Your Majesty, we don't need to defend ourselves. 
DAN.3.17	The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace. 
DAN.3.18	But even if he doesn't, we still won't worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Nebuchadnezzar's face twisted with anger at the three men. And he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
DAN.3.20	Next, he commanded some of his strongest soldiers to tie up the men and throw them into the flaming furnace. 
DAN.3.21+DAN.3.22+DAN.3.23	 The king wanted it done at that very moment. So the soldiers tied up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and threw them into the flaming furnace with all of their clothes still on, including their turbans. The fire was so hot that flames leaped out and killed the soldiers.
DAN.3.24	Suddenly the king jumped up and shouted, “Weren't only three men tied up and thrown into the fire?”
DAN.3.24	“Yes, Your Majesty,” his officers answered.
DAN.3.25	“But I see four men walking around in the fire,” the king replied. “None of them is tied up or harmed, and the fourth one looks like a god.”
DAN.3.26	Nebuchadnezzar went closer to the flaming furnace and said to the three young men, “You servants of the Most High God, come out at once!”
DAN.3.26	They came out, 
DAN.3.27	and the king's high officials, governors, and advisors all crowded around them. The men were not burned, their hair wasn't scorched, and their clothes didn't even smell like smoke. 
DAN.3.28	King Nebuchadnezzar said:
DAN.3.28	Praise their God for sending an angel to rescue his servants! They trusted their God and refused to obey my commands. Yes, they chose to die rather than to worship or serve any god except their own. 
DAN.3.29	And I won't allow people of any nation or race to say anything against their God. Anyone who does will be chopped up and their houses will be torn down, because no other god has such great power to save.
DAN.3.30	After this happened, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in Babylon Province.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following letter to the people of all nations and races on the earth:
DAN.4.1	Greetings to all of you!
DAN.4.2	I am glad to tell about
DAN.4.2	the wonderful miracles
DAN.4.2	God Most High
DAN.4.2	has done for me.
DAN.4.3	His miracles are mighty
DAN.4.3	and marvelous.
DAN.4.3	He will rule forever,
DAN.4.3	and his kingdom
DAN.4.3	will never end.
DAN.4.4	I was enjoying a time of peace and prosperity, 
DAN.4.5	when suddenly I had some horrifying dreams and visions. 
DAN.4.6	Then I commanded every wise man in Babylonia to appear in my court, so they could explain the meaning of my dream. 
DAN.4.7	After they arrived, I told them my dream, but they were not able to say what it meant. 
DAN.4.8	Finally, a young man named Daniel came in, and I told him the dream. The holy gods had given him special powers, and I had renamed him Belteshazzar after my own god.
DAN.4.9	I said, “Belteshazzar, not only are you the wisest of all advisors and counselors, but the holy gods have given you special powers to solve the most difficult mysteries. So listen to what I dreamed and tell me what it means:
DAN.4.10	In my sleep I saw
DAN.4.10	a very tall tree
DAN.4.10	in the center of the world.
DAN.4.11	It grew stronger and higher,
DAN.4.11	until it reached to heaven
DAN.4.11	and could be seen
DAN.4.11	from anywhere on earth.
DAN.4.12	It was covered with leaves
DAN.4.12	and heavy with fruit—
DAN.4.12	enough for all nations.
DAN.4.12	Wild animals enjoyed its shade,
DAN.4.12	birds nested in its branches,
DAN.4.12	and all creatures on earth
DAN.4.12	lived on its fruit.
DAN.4.13	“While I was in bed, having this vision, a holy angel
DAN.4.14	and shouted:
DAN.4.14	‘Chop down the tree
DAN.4.14	and cut off its branches;
DAN.4.14	strip off its leaves
DAN.4.14	and scatter its fruit.
DAN.4.14	Make the animals leave its shade
DAN.4.14	and send the birds flying
DAN.4.14	from its branches.
DAN.4.15	But leave its stump and roots
DAN.4.15	in the ground,
DAN.4.15	surrounded by grass
DAN.4.15	and held by chains
DAN.4.15	of iron and bronze.
DAN.4.15	‘Make sure that this ruler
DAN.4.15	lives like the animals
DAN.4.15	out in the open fields,
DAN.4.15	unprotected from the dew.
DAN.4.16	Give him the mind
DAN.4.16	of a wild animal
DAN.4.16	for seven long years.
DAN.4.17	This punishment is given
DAN.4.17	at the command
DAN.4.17	of the holy angels.
DAN.4.17	It will show to all who live
DAN.4.17	that God Most High
DAN.4.17	controls all kingdoms
DAN.4.17	and chooses for their rulers
DAN.4.17	persons of humble birth.’
DAN.4.18	“Daniel,
DAN.4.19	For a while, Daniel
DAN.4.19	Daniel replied:
DAN.4.19	Your Majesty, I wish the dream had been against your enemies. 
DAN.4.20	You saw a tree that grew so big and strong that it reached up to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth. 
DAN.4.21	Its leaves were beautiful, and it produced enough fruit for all living creatures; animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. 
DAN.4.22	Your Majesty, that tree is you. Your glorious reputation has reached heaven, and your kingdom covers the earth.
DAN.4.23	Then you saw a holy angel
DAN.4.24	Your Majesty, God Most High has sent you this message, and it means 
DAN.4.25	that you will be forced to live with the wild animals, far away from humans. You will eat grass like a wild animal and live outdoors for seven years,
DAN.4.26	But he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots. This is to show that you will be king once again, after you learn that the God who rules from heaven is in control. 
DAN.4.27	 Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say. Turn from your sins and start living right; have mercy on those who are mistreated. Then all will go well with you for a long time.
DAN.4.28+DAN.4.29+DAN.4.30	About twelve months later, I was walking on the flat roof of my royal palace and admiring the beautiful city of Babylon, when these things started happening to me. I was saying to myself, “Just look at this wonderful capital city that I have built by my own power and for my own glory!”
DAN.4.31	But before I could finish speaking, a voice from heaven interrupted:
DAN.4.31	King Nebuchadnezzar, this kingdom is no longer yours. 
DAN.4.32	You will be forced to live with the wild animals, away from people. For seven years
DAN.4.33	This was no sooner said than done—I was forced to live like a wild animal; I ate grass and was unprotected from the dew. As time went by, my hair grew longer than eagle feathers, and my fingernails looked like the claws of a bird.
DAN.4.34	“I praise and honor
DAN.4.34	God Most High.
DAN.4.34	God lives forever,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom
DAN.4.34	will never end.
DAN.4.35	To him the nations
DAN.4.35	are far less than nothing;
DAN.4.35	God controls the stars in the sky
DAN.4.35	and everyone on this earth.
DAN.4.35	When God does something,
DAN.4.35	we cannot change it
DAN.4.35	or even ask why.”
DAN.4.36	At that time my mind was healed, and once again I became the ruler of my glorious kingdom. My advisors and officials returned to me, and I had greater power than ever before. 
DAN.4.37	That's why I say:
DAN.4.37	“Praise and honor the King
DAN.4.37	who rules from heaven!
DAN.4.37	Everything he does
DAN.4.37	is honest and fair,
DAN.4.37	and he can shatter the power
DAN.4.37	of those who are proud.”
DAN.5.1	One evening, King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his highest officials, and he drank wine with them. 
DAN.5.2	He got drunk and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups his father Nebuchadnezzar
DAN.5.5	Suddenly a human hand was seen writing on the plaster wall of the palace. The hand was just behind the lampstand, and the king could see it writing. 
DAN.5.6	He was so frightened that his face turned pale, his knees started shaking, and his legs became weak.
DAN.5.7	The king called in his advisors, who claimed they could talk with the spirits of the dead and understand the meanings found in the stars. He told them, “The man who can read this writing and tell me what it means will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom. He will wear robes of royal purple and a gold chain around his neck.”
DAN.5.8	All of King Belshazzar's highest officials came in, but not one of them could read the writing or tell what it meant, 
DAN.5.9	and they were completely puzzled. Now the king was more afraid than ever before, and his face turned white as a ghost.
DAN.5.10	When the queen heard the king and his officials talking, she came in and said:
DAN.5.10	Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! Don't be afraid or look so pale. 
DAN.5.11	In your kingdom there is a man who has been given special powers by the holy gods. When your father Nebuchadnezzar was king, this man was known to be as smart, intelligent, and wise as the gods themselves. Your father put him in charge of all who claimed they could talk with the spirits or understand the meanings in the stars or tell about the future. 
DAN.5.12	He also changed the man's name from Daniel to Belteshazzar. Not only is he wise and intelligent, but he can explain dreams and riddles and solve difficult problems. Send for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.
DAN.5.13	When Daniel was brought in, the king said:
DAN.5.13	So you are Daniel, one of the captives my father brought back from Judah! 
DAN.5.14	I was told that the gods have given you special powers and that you are intelligent and very wise. 
DAN.5.15	Neither my advisors nor the men who talk with the spirits of the dead could read this writing or tell me what it means. 
DAN.5.16	But I have been told that you understand everything and that you can solve difficult problems. Now then, if you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom. You will wear royal purple robes and have a gold chain around your neck.
DAN.5.17	Daniel answered:
DAN.5.17	Your Majesty, I will read the writing and tell you what it means. But you may keep your gifts or give them to someone else. 
DAN.5.18	Sir, the Most High God made your father a great and powerful man and brought him much honor and glory. 
DAN.5.19	God did such great things for him that people of all nations and races shook with fear.
DAN.5.19	Your father had the power of life or death over everyone, and he could honor or ruin anyone he chose. 
DAN.5.20	But when he became proud and stubborn, his glorious kingdom was taken from him. 
DAN.5.21	His mind became like that of an animal, and he was forced to stay away from people and live with wild donkeys. Your father ate grass like an ox, and he slept outside where his body was soaked with dew. He was forced to do this until he learned that the Most High God rules all kingdoms on earth and chooses their kings.
DAN.5.22	King Belshazzar, you knew all of this, but you still refused to honor the Lord who rules from heaven. 
DAN.5.23	Instead, you turned against him and ordered the cups from his temple to be brought here, so that you and your wives and officials could drink wine from them. You praised idols made of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, even though they cannot see or hear or think. You refused to worship the God who gives you breath and controls everything you do. 
DAN.5.24	That's why he sent the hand to write this message on the wall.
DAN.5.25+DAN.5.26+DAN.5.27+DAN.5.28	The words written there are 
DAN.5.29	Belshazzar gave a command for Daniel to be made the third most powerful man in his kingdom and to be given a purple robe and a gold chain.
DAN.5.30	That same night, the king was killed. 
DAN.5.31	Then Darius the Mede, who was 62 years old, took over his kingdom.
DAN.6.1	Darius divided his kingdom into 120 states and placed a governor in charge of each one. 
DAN.6.2	In order to make sure that his government was run properly, Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors. One of these officials was Daniel. 
DAN.6.3	And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom.
DAN.6.4	The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king. But they could not accuse him of anything wrong, because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do. 
DAN.6.5	Finally, they said to one another, “We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel, unless it has to do with his religion.”
DAN.6.6	They all went to the king and said:
DAN.6.6	“Your Majesty, we hope you live forever! 
DAN.6.7	 All of your officials, leaders, advisors, and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days. Everyone who disobeys this law must be thrown into a pit of lions. 
DAN.6.8	Order this to be written and then sign it, so it cannot be changed, just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed.”
DAN.6.9	So King Darius made the law and had it written down.
DAN.6.10	Daniel heard about the law, but when he returned home, he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem. In the same way that he had always done, he knelt down in prayer three times a day, giving thanks to God.
DAN.6.11	The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help. 
DAN.6.12	They went back to the king and said, “Didn't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days? And doesn't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions?”
DAN.6.12	“Yes, that's the law I made,” the king agreed. “And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be changed.”
DAN.6.13	The men then told the king, “That Jew named Daniel, who was brought here as a captive, refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written. And he still prays to his god three times a day.” 
DAN.6.14	The king was really upset to hear about this, and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel.
DAN.6.15	At sunset the men returned and said, “Your Majesty, remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed, not even by the king.”
DAN.6.17	A stone was rolled over the pit, and it was sealed. Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out. 
DAN.6.18	All night long the king could not sleep. He did not eat anything, and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him.
DAN.6.19	At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit. 
DAN.6.20	He was anxious and shouted, “Daniel, you were faithful and served your God. Was he able to save you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Daniel answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! 
DAN.6.22	 My God knew that I was innocent, and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me. Your Majesty, I have never done anything to hurt you.”
DAN.6.23	The king was relieved to hear Daniel's voice, and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit. Daniel's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed. 
DAN.6.24	And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit, together with their wives and children. But before they even reached the bottom, the lions ripped them to pieces.
DAN.6.25	King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world:
DAN.6.25	“Greetings to all of you!
DAN.6.26	I command everyone
DAN.6.26	in my kingdom
DAN.6.26	to worship and honor
DAN.6.26	the God of Daniel.
DAN.6.26	He is the living God,
DAN.6.26	the one who lives forever.
DAN.6.26	His power and his kingdom
DAN.6.26	will never end.
DAN.6.27	He rescues people
DAN.6.27	and sets them free
DAN.6.27	by working great miracles.
DAN.6.27	Daniel's God has rescued him
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	All went well for Daniel while Darius was king, and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled.
DAN.7.1+DAN.7.2	Daniel wrote:
DAN.7.1+DAN.7.2	In the first year of King Belshazzar
DAN.7.1+DAN.7.2	The four winds were stirring up the mighty sea, 
DAN.7.3	 when suddenly four powerful beasts came out of the sea. Each beast was different. 
DAN.7.4	 The first was like a lion with the wings of an eagle. As I watched, its wings were pulled off. Then it was lifted to an upright position and made to stand on two feet, just like a human, and it was given a human mind.
DAN.7.5	The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs.
DAN.7.6	The third beast was like a leopard—except that it had four wings and four heads. It was given authority to rule.
DAN.7.8	 Just as I was thinking about these horns, a smaller horn appeared, and three of the other horns were pulled up by the roots to make room for it. This horn had the eyes of a human and a mouth that spoke with great arrogance.
DAN.7.9	while I was watching,
DAN.7.9	and the Eternal God
DAN.7.9	took his place.
DAN.7.9	His clothing and his hair
DAN.7.9	were white as snow.
DAN.7.9	His throne was a blazing fire
DAN.7.9	with fiery wheels,
DAN.7.10	from all around him.
DAN.7.10	Countless thousands
DAN.7.10	were standing there
DAN.7.10	to serve him.
DAN.7.10	The time of judgment began,
DAN.7.10	and the books
DAN.7.11	I watched closely to see what would happen to this smaller horn because of the arrogant things it was saying. Then before my very eyes, the fourth beast was killed and its body destroyed by fire. 
DAN.7.12	The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were allowed to live a while longer.
DAN.7.13	 As I continued to watch the vision that night,
DAN.7.13	I saw what looked like
DAN.7.13	a son of man
DAN.7.13	coming with the clouds of heaven,
DAN.7.13	and he was presented
DAN.7.13	to the Eternal God.
DAN.7.14	and given power and glory,
DAN.7.14	so that all people
DAN.7.14	of every nation and race
DAN.7.14	would serve him.
DAN.7.14	He will rule forever,
DAN.7.14	and his kingdom is eternal,
DAN.7.14	never to be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	Daniel wrote:
DAN.7.15	I was terrified by these visions, and I didn't know what to think. 
DAN.7.16	So I asked one of those standing there,
DAN.7.17	“The four beasts are four earthly kingdoms. 
DAN.7.18	 But God Most High will give his kingdom to his chosen ones, and it will be theirs forever and ever.”
DAN.7.19	I wanted to know more about the fourth beast,
DAN.7.20	I also wanted to know more about all ten of those horns on its head. I especially wanted to know more about the one that took the place of three of the others—the horn that had eyes and spoke with arrogance and seemed greater than the others. 
DAN.7.21	 While I was looking, this horn attacked God's chosen ones and was winning the battle. 
DAN.7.22	 Then God Most High, the Eternal God,
DAN.7.23	Then I was told
DAN.7.23	by the one standing there:
DAN.7.23	“The fourth beast
DAN.7.23	will be a fourth kingdom
DAN.7.23	to appear on earth.
DAN.7.23	It will be different
DAN.7.23	from all the others—
DAN.7.23	it will trample the earth
DAN.7.23	and crush it to pieces.
DAN.7.24	who will come from this kingdom,
DAN.7.24	and one more will follow.
DAN.7.24	This horn will be different
DAN.7.24	from the others,
DAN.7.24	and it will conquer
DAN.7.24	three other kings.
DAN.7.25	of God Most High,
DAN.7.25	and he will be cruel
DAN.7.25	to God's chosen ones.
DAN.7.25	He will try to change God's Law
DAN.7.25	and the sacred seasons.
DAN.7.25	And he will be able to do this
DAN.7.25	for a time, two times,
DAN.7.25	and half a time.
DAN.7.26	But he will finally be judged,
DAN.7.26	and his kingdom
DAN.7.26	completely destroyed.
DAN.7.27	will be given to the chosen ones
DAN.7.27	of God Most High.
DAN.7.27	His kingdom will be eternal,
DAN.7.27	and all others will serve
DAN.7.27	and obey him.”
DAN.7.28	That was what I saw and heard. I turned pale with fear and kept it all to myself.
DAN.8.1	Daniel wrote:
DAN.8.1	In the third year of King Belshazzar of Babylonia,
DAN.8.2	in which I was in Susa, the chief city of Babylonia's Elam Province. I was beside the Ulai River,
DAN.8.3	when I looked up and saw a ram standing there with two horns on its head—both of them were long, but the second one was longer than the first. 
DAN.8.4	The ram went charging toward the west, the north, and the south. No other animals were strong enough to oppose him, and nothing could save them from his power. So he did as he pleased and became even more powerful.
DAN.8.5	I kept on watching and saw a goat come from the west and charge across the entire earth, without even touching the ground. Between his eyes was a powerful horn,
DAN.8.6	and with tremendous anger the goat started toward the ram that I had seen beside the river.
DAN.8.7	The goat was so fierce that its attack broke both horns of the ram, leaving him powerless. Then the goat trampled on the ram, and no one could do anything to help. 
DAN.8.8	After this, the goat became even more powerful. But at the peak of his power, his mighty horn was broken, and four other mighty horns took its place—one pointing to the north and one to the east, one to the south and one to the west.
DAN.8.9	A little horn came from one of these, and its power reached to the south, the east, and even to the holy land.
DAN.8.10	 It became so strong that it attacked the stars in the sky, which were heaven's army.
DAN.8.11+DAN.8.12	It humiliated heaven's army and dishonored its leader
DAN.8.13	Then one of the holy angels asked another, “When will the daily sacrifices be offered again? What about this horrible rebellion? When will the temple and heaven's army no longer be trampled in the dust?”
DAN.8.14	The other answered, “It will be 2,300 evenings and mornings before the temple is dedicated and in use again.”
DAN.8.15	Daniel wrote:
DAN.8.15	I was trying to figure out the meaning of the vision, when someone suddenly appeared there beside me. 
DAN.8.16	 And from beside the Ulai River,
DAN.8.17	Gabriel came over, and I fell to the ground in fear. Then he said, “You are merely a human, but you need to understand that this vision is about the end of time.”
DAN.8.18	While he was speaking, I fell facedown in a deep sleep. But he lifted me to my feet 
DAN.8.19	and said:
DAN.8.19	Listen, and I will tell you what will happen at the end of time, when God has chosen to show his anger. 
DAN.8.20	The two horns of the ram are the kings of Media and Persia, 
DAN.8.21	the goat is the kingdom of Greece, and the powerful horn between his eyes is the first of its kings. 
DAN.8.22	After this horn is broken, four other kingdoms will appear, but they won't be as strong.
DAN.8.23	When these rulers have become as evil as possible, their power will end, and then a king who is dangerous and cannot be trusted will appear. 
DAN.8.24	He will gain strength, but not on his own, and he will cause terrible destruction. He will wipe out powerful leaders and God's people as well. 
DAN.8.25	His deceitful lies will make him so successful, that he will think he is really great. Suddenly he will kill many people, and he will even attack God, the Supreme Ruler. But God will crush him!
DAN.8.26	This vision about the evenings and mornings is true, but these things won't happen for a long time, so don't tell it to others.
DAN.8.27	After this, I was so worn out and weak that it was several days before I could get out of bed and go about my duties for the king. I was disturbed by this vision that made no sense to me.
DAN.9.1+DAN.9.2	Some years later, Darius the Mede,
DAN.9.3+DAN.9.4	Then, to show my sorrow, I went without eating and dressed in sackcloth
DAN.9.3+DAN.9.4	Our Lord, you are a great and fearsome God, and you faithfully keep your agreement with those who love and obey you. 
DAN.9.5	But we have sinned terribly by rebelling against you and rejecting your laws and teachings. 
DAN.9.6	We have ignored the message your servants the prophets spoke to our kings, our leaders, our ancestors, and everyone else.
DAN.9.8	and even our kings, our officials, and our ancestors. 
DAN.9.9	 God, you are merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against you 
DAN.9.10	and rejected your teachings that came to us from your servants the prophets.
DAN.9.12	You warned us and our leaders that Jerusalem would suffer the worst disaster in human history, and you did exactly as you had threatened. 
DAN.9.13	We have not escaped any of the terrible curses written by Moses, and yet we have refused to beg you for mercy and to remind ourselves of how faithful you have always been. 
DAN.9.14	And when you finally punished us with this horrible disaster, that was also the right thing to do, because we deserved it so much.
DAN.9.16	In the past, you treated us with such kindness, that we now beg you to stop being so terribly angry with Jerusalem. After all, it is your chosen city built on your holy mountain, even though it has suffered public disgrace because of our sins and those of our ancestors.
DAN.9.18	 Please show mercy to your chosen city, not because we deserve it, but because of your great kindness. 
DAN.9.19	Forgive us! Hurry and do something, not only for your city and your chosen people, but to bring honor to yourself.
DAN.9.20	I was still confessing my sins and those of all Israel to the 
DAN.9.21	 when Gabriel suddenly came flying in at the time of the evening sacrifice. This was the same Gabriel I had seen in my vision, 
DAN.9.22	and he explained:
DAN.9.22	Daniel, I am here to help you understand the vision. 
DAN.9.23	God thinks highly of you, and at the very moment you started praying, I was sent to give you the answer. 
DAN.9.24	God has decided that for 70 weeks,
DAN.9.25	You need to realize that from the command to rebuild Jerusalem until the coming of the Chosen Leader,
DAN.9.26	At the end of the 62 weeks,
DAN.9.26	A foreign ruler and his army will sweep down like a mighty flood, leaving both the city and the temple in ruins, and war and destruction will continue until the end, just as God has decided. 
DAN.9.27	 For one week
DAN.10.1	In the third year
DAN.10.2	Daniel wrote:
DAN.10.2	For three weeks I was in sorrow. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no fancy food or meat, I drank no wine, and I put no olive oil on my face or hair.
DAN.10.4	Then, on the twenty-fourth day of the first month,
DAN.10.5	 when I looked up and saw someone dressed in linen and wearing a solid gold belt.
DAN.10.6	His body was like a precious stone,
DAN.10.7	 Although the people who were with me did not see the vision, they became so frightened that they scattered and hid. 
DAN.10.8	Only I saw this great vision. I became weak and pale, 
DAN.10.9	and at the sound of his voice, I fell facedown in a deep sleep.
DAN.10.10	He raised me to my hands and knees 
DAN.10.11	and then said, “Daniel, your God thinks highly of you, and he has sent me. So stand up and pay close attention.” I stood trembling, while the angel said:
DAN.10.12	Daniel, don't be afraid! God has listened to your prayers since the first day you humbly asked for understanding, and he has sent me here. 
DAN.10.13	 But the guardian angel
DAN.10.14	Now I have come here to give you another vision about what will happen to your people in the future.
DAN.10.15	While this angel was speaking to me, I stared at the ground, speechless. 
DAN.10.16	Then he appeared in human form and touched my lips. I said, “Sir, this vision has brought me great pain and has drained my strength. 
DAN.10.17	I am merely your servant. How can I possibly speak with someone so powerful, when I am almost too weak to get my breath?”
DAN.10.18+DAN.10.19	The angel touched me a second time and said, “Don't be frightened! God thinks highly of you, and he intends this for your good, so be brave and strong.”
DAN.10.18+DAN.10.19	At this, I regained my strength and replied, “Please speak! You have already made me feel much better.”
DAN.10.20	Then the angel said:
DAN.10.20	Now do you understand why I have come? Soon I must leave to fight against the guardian angel of Persia. Then after I have defeated him, the guardian angel of Greece will attack me. 
DAN.10.21	I will tell you what is written in 
DAN.11.1	You also need to know that I protected and helped Darius the Mede
DAN.11.2	What I am going to tell you is certain to happen. Four kings will rule Persia, one after the other, but the fourth one will become much richer than the others. In fact, his wealth will make him so powerful that he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	Then a mighty king will come to power and will be able to do whatever he pleases. 
DAN.11.4	But suddenly his kingdom will be crushed and scattered to the four corners of the earth, where four more kingdoms will rise. But these won't be ruled by his descendants or be as powerful as his kingdom.
DAN.11.5	The king of the south will grow powerful. Then one of his generals will rebel and will rule an even larger kingdom. 
DAN.11.6	Years later the southern kingdom and the northern kingdom will make a treaty, and the daughter of the king of the south will marry the king of the north. But she will lose her power. Then she, her husband, their child,
DAN.11.6	After this, 
DAN.11.7	one of her relatives will become the ruler of the southern kingdom. He will attack the army of the northern kingdom and capture its fortresses. 
DAN.11.8	Then he will carry their idols to Egypt, together with their precious treasures of silver and gold, but it will be a long time before he attacks the northern kingdom again. Some years later 
DAN.11.9	the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom, but he will be forced back to his own country.
DAN.11.10	The sons of the king of the north will gather a huge army that will sweep down like a roaring flood, reaching all the way to the fortress of the southern kingdom. 
DAN.11.11	 But this will make the king of the south angry, and he will defeat this large army from the north. 
DAN.11.12	The king of the south will feel proud because of the many thousands he has killed. But his victories won't last long, 
DAN.11.13	because the king of the north will gather a larger and more powerful army than ever before. Then in a few years, he will start invading other countries.
DAN.11.14	At this time many of your own people will try to make this vision come true by rebelling against the king of the south, but their rebellion will fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the army from the north will surround and capture a fortress in the south, and not even the most experienced troops of the southern kingdom will be able to make them retreat. 
DAN.11.16	The king who invaded from the north will do as he pleases, and he will even capture and destroy the holy land.
DAN.11.17	In fact, he will decide to invade the south with his entire army. Then he will attempt to make peace by giving the king of the south a bride from the northern kingdom, but this won't be successful.
DAN.11.18	Afterwards, this proud king of the north will invade and conquer many of the nations along the coast, but a military leader will defeat him and make him lose his pride. 
DAN.11.19	He will retreat to his fortresses in his own country, but on the way he will be defeated and never again be seen.
DAN.11.20	The next king of the north will try to collect taxes for the glory of his kingdom. However, he will come to a sudden end in some mysterious way, instead of in battle or because of someone's anger.
DAN.11.21	The successor of this king of the north will be a worthless nobody, who doesn't even come from a royal family. He will suddenly appear and gain control of the kingdom by treachery. 
DAN.11.22	Then he will destroy armies and remove God's chosen high priest. 
DAN.11.23	He will make a treaty, but he will be deceitful and break it, even though he has only a few followers. 
DAN.11.24	Without warning, he will successfully invade a wealthy province, which is something his ancestors never did. Then he will divide among his followers all of its treasures and property. But none of this will last very long.
DAN.11.25	He will gather a large and powerful army, and with great courage he will attack the king of the south. The king of the south will meet him with a much stronger army, but he will lose the battle, because he will be betrayed 
DAN.11.26	by members of the royal court. He will be ruined, and most of his army will be slaughtered.
DAN.11.27	The two kings will meet around a table and tell evil lies to each other. But their plans will fail, because God has already decided what will happen. 
DAN.11.28	Then the king of the north will return to his country with great treasures. But on the way, he will attack the religion of God's people and do whatever else he pleases.
DAN.11.29	At the time God has decided, the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom again, but this time, things will be different. 
DAN.11.30	 Ships from the west will come to attack him, and he will be discouraged. Then he will start back to his own country and take out his anger on the religion of God's faithful people, while showing kindness to those who are unfaithful. 
DAN.11.31	 He will send troops to pollute the temple and the fortress, and he will stop the daily sacrifices. Then he will set up that “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction. 
DAN.11.32	The king will use deceit to win followers from those who are unfaithful to God, but those who remain faithful will do everything possible to oppose him.
DAN.11.33	Wise leaders will instruct many of the people. But for a while, some of these leaders will either be killed with swords or burned alive, or else robbed of their possessions and thrown into prison. 
DAN.11.34	They will receive only a little help in their time of trouble, and many of their followers will be treacherous. 
DAN.11.35	Some of those who are wise will suffer, so that God will make them pure and acceptable until the end, which will still come at the time he has decided.
DAN.11.37	This king will reject the gods his ancestors worshiped and the god preferred by women.
DAN.11.38	and worship only the so-called god of fortresses, who was unknown to his ancestors. And he will honor it with gold, silver, precious stones, and other costly gifts. 
DAN.11.39	With the help of this foreign god, he will capture the strongest fortresses. Everyone who worships this god will be put in a position of power and rewarded with wealth and land.
DAN.11.40	At the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the kingdom of the north. But its king will rush out like a storm with war chariots, cavalry, and many ships. Indeed, his forces will flood one country after another, 
DAN.11.41	and when they reach the holy land,
DAN.11.42	The king of the north will invade many countries, including Egypt, 
DAN.11.43	and he will take its rich treasures of gold and silver. He will also conquer Libya and Ethiopia.
DAN.11.44	But he will be alarmed by news from the east and the north, and he will become furious and cause great destruction. 
DAN.11.45	After this, he will set up camp between the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Zion. Then he will be destroyed, and no one will be able to save him.
DAN.12.2	 Many of those who lie dead in the ground will rise from death. Some of them will be given eternal life, and others will receive nothing but eternal shame and disgrace. 
DAN.12.3	 Everyone who has been wise will shine as bright as the sky above, and everyone who has led others to please God will shine forever like the stars.
DAN.12.5	Daniel wrote:
DAN.12.5	I looked around and saw two other people—one on this side of the river and one on the other side. 
DAN.12.6	The angel who had spoken to me was dressed in linen and was standing upstream from them.
DAN.12.8	I heard what the angel said, but I didn't understand. So I asked, “Sir, how will it all end?”
DAN.12.8	The angel in my vision then replied:
DAN.12.9	Daniel, go about your business, because the meaning of this message will remain secret until the end of time. 
DAN.12.10	 Many people will have their hearts and lives made pure and clean, but those who are evil will keep on being evil and never understand. Only the wise will understand. 
DAN.12.11	 There will be 1,290 days from the time that the daily sacrifices are stopped, until someone sets up the “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction. 
DAN.12.12	God will bless everyone who patiently waits until 1,335 days have gone by.
DAN.12.13	So, Daniel, be faithful until the end! You will rest, and at the end of time, you will rise from death to receive your reward.
HOS.1.2	The 
HOS.1.3	So I married Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and we had a son.
HOS.1.5	and in Jezreel Valley I will break the power of Israel.”
HOS.1.6	Later, Gomer had a daughter, and the 
HOS.1.7	But I am the 
HOS.1.8	After Gomer had stopped nursing Lo-Ruhamah, she had another son. 
HOS.1.9	Then the 
HOS.1.11	Israel and Judah will unite and choose one leader. Then they will take back their land, and this will be a great day for Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	So let your brothers be called “My People” and your sisters be called “Shown Mercy.”
HOS.2.2	Accuse! Accuse your mother!
HOS.2.2	She is no longer my wife,
HOS.2.2	and now I, the 
HOS.2.2	am not her husband.
HOS.2.2	Beg her to give up prostitution
HOS.2.2	and stop being unfaithful,
HOS.2.3	or I will strip her naked
HOS.2.3	like the day she was born.
HOS.2.3	I will make her barren
HOS.2.3	like a desert,
HOS.2.3	and she will die of thirst.
HOS.2.4	You children are the result
HOS.2.4	of her unfaithfulness,
HOS.2.4	and I'll show you no pity.
HOS.2.5	Your mother was unfaithful.
HOS.2.5	She was disgraceful and said,
HOS.2.5	“I'll run after my lovers.
HOS.2.5	Everything comes from them—
HOS.2.5	my food and drink,
HOS.2.5	my linen and wool,
HOS.2.5	my olive oil and wine.”
HOS.2.6	I, the 
HOS.2.6	a fence of thorns
HOS.2.6	to block her path.
HOS.2.7	She will run after her lovers,
HOS.2.7	but not catch them;
HOS.2.7	she will search,
HOS.2.7	but not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will say, “I'll return
HOS.2.7	to my first husband.
HOS.2.7	Life was better then.”
HOS.2.8	She didn't know that her grain,
HOS.2.8	wine, and olive oil
HOS.2.8	were gifts from me,
HOS.2.8	as were the gold and silver
HOS.2.8	she used in worshiping Baal.
HOS.2.9	So I'll hold back the harvest
HOS.2.9	of grain and grapes.
HOS.2.9	I'll take back
HOS.2.9	my wool and my linen
HOS.2.9	that cover her body.
HOS.2.10	Then I'll strip her naked
HOS.2.10	in the sight of her lovers.
HOS.2.10	No one can rescue her.
HOS.2.11	I'll stop Israel's celebrations—
HOS.2.11	no more New Moon Festivals,
HOS.2.11	Sabbaths, or other feasts.
HOS.2.12	She said, “My lovers gave me
HOS.2.12	vineyards and fig trees
HOS.2.12	as payment
HOS.2.12	Now I, the 
HOS.2.12	her vineyards and fig trees;
HOS.2.12	they will become clumps of weeds
HOS.2.12	eaten by wild animals.
HOS.2.13	I'll punish her for the days
HOS.2.13	she worshiped Baal
HOS.2.13	and burned incense to him.
HOS.2.13	I'll punish her for the times
HOS.2.13	she forgot about me
HOS.2.13	and wore jewelry and rings
HOS.2.13	to attract her lovers.
HOS.2.13	I, the 
HOS.2.14	Israel, I, the 
HOS.2.14	will lure you into the desert
HOS.2.14	and speak gently to you.
HOS.2.15	and then Trouble Valley
HOS.2.15	will become Hopeful Valley.
HOS.2.15	You will say “Yes” to me
HOS.2.15	as you did in your youth,
HOS.2.15	when leaving Egypt.
HOS.2.16	I promise from that day on, you will call me your husband instead of your master.
HOS.2.17	I will no longer even let you mention the names of those pagan gods that you called “Master.” 
HOS.2.18	And I will agree to let you live in peace—you will no longer be attacked by wild animals and birds or by weapons of war. 
HOS.2.19	I will accept you as my wife forever, and instead of a bride price
HOS.2.20	and faithfulness. Then you will truly know who I am.
HOS.2.21	I will command the sky to send rain on the earth, 
HOS.2.22	and it will produce grain, grapes, and olives in Jezreel Valley. 
HOS.2.23	 I will scatter the seeds and show mercy to Lo-Ruhamah.
HOS.3.1	Once again the 
HOS.3.2	So I paid 15 pieces of silver and about 150 kilograms of grain for such a woman. 
HOS.3.3	Then I said, “Now you are mine! You will have to remain faithful to me, though it will be a long time before we sleep together.”
HOS.3.4	It will also be a long time before Israel has a king or before sacrifices are offered at the temple or before there is any way to get guidance from God. 
HOS.3.5	But later, Israel will turn back to the 
HOS.4.1	Israel, listen
HOS.4.1	as the 
HOS.4.1	everyone in the land!
HOS.4.1	No one is faithful or loyal
HOS.4.1	or truly cares about God.
HOS.4.2	Cursing, dishonesty, murder,
HOS.4.2	robbery, unfaithfulness—
HOS.4.2	these happen all the time.
HOS.4.2	Violence is everywhere.
HOS.4.3	And so your land is a desert.
HOS.4.3	Every living creature is dying—
HOS.4.3	people and wild animals,
HOS.4.3	birds and fish.
HOS.4.4	Don't accuse just anyone!
HOS.4.4	Not everyone is at fault.
HOS.4.4	My case is against you,
HOS.4.4	the priests.
HOS.4.5	You and the prophets
HOS.4.5	will stumble day and night;
HOS.4.5	I'll silence your mothers.
HOS.4.6	You priests have rejected me,
HOS.4.6	and my people are destroyed
HOS.4.6	by refusing to obey.
HOS.4.6	Now I'll reject you and forget
HOS.4.6	your children, because you
HOS.4.6	have forgotten my Law.
HOS.4.7	By adding more of you priests,
HOS.4.7	you multiply the number
HOS.4.7	of people who sin.
HOS.4.7	Now I'll change your pride
HOS.4.7	into shame.
HOS.4.8	You encourage others to sin,
HOS.4.8	so you can stuff yourselves
HOS.4.8	on their sin offerings.
HOS.4.9	That's why I will punish
HOS.4.9	the people for their deeds,
HOS.4.9	just as I will punish
HOS.4.9	you priests.
HOS.4.10	Their food won't satisfy,
HOS.4.10	and having sex at pagan shrines
HOS.4.10	won't produce children.
HOS.4.10	My people have rebelled
HOS.4.11	and have been unfaithful
HOS.4.11	to me, their 
HOS.4.11	My people, you are foolish
HOS.4.11	because of too much pleasure
HOS.4.11	and too much wine.
HOS.4.12	You expect wooden idols
HOS.4.12	and other objects of wood
HOS.4.12	to give you advice.
HOS.4.12	Lusting for sex at pagan shrines
HOS.4.12	has made you unfaithful
HOS.4.12	to me, your God.
HOS.4.13	You offer sacrifices
HOS.4.13	on mountaintops and hills,
HOS.4.13	under oak trees, and wherever
HOS.4.13	good shade is found.
HOS.4.13	Your own daughters
HOS.4.13	and daughters-in-law
HOS.4.13	sell themselves for sex.
HOS.4.14	But I won't punish them.
HOS.4.14	You men are to blame,
HOS.4.14	because you go to prostitutes
HOS.4.14	and offer sacrifices with them
HOS.4.14	at pagan shrines.
HOS.4.14	Your own foolishness
HOS.4.14	will lead to your ruin.
HOS.4.15	Israel, you are unfaithful,
HOS.4.15	but don't lead Judah to sin.
HOS.4.15	Stop worshiping at Gilgal
HOS.4.15	or at sinful Bethel.
HOS.4.15	And quit making promises
HOS.4.15	in my name—the name
HOS.4.15	of the living 
HOS.4.16	You are nothing more
HOS.4.16	than a stubborn cow—
HOS.4.16	so stubborn that I, the 
HOS.4.16	cannot feed you like lambs
HOS.4.16	in an open pasture.
HOS.4.17	You people of Israel
HOS.4.17	are charmed by
HOS.4.17	Leave those people alone!
HOS.4.18	You get drunk, then sleep
HOS.4.18	with prostitutes;
HOS.4.18	you would rather be vulgar
HOS.4.18	than lead a decent life.
HOS.4.19	And so you will be swept away
HOS.4.19	in a whirlwind
HOS.4.19	for sacrificing to idols.
HOS.5.1	Listen, you priests!
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, Israel!
HOS.5.1	Listen, you members
HOS.5.1	of the royal family.
HOS.5.1	Justice was your duty.
HOS.5.1	But
HOS.5.1	you trapped the people.
HOS.5.2	At the place of worship
HOS.5.2	you were a treacherous pit,
HOS.5.2	and I will punish you.
HOS.5.3	Israel, I know all about you,
HOS.5.3	and because of your unfaithfulness,
HOS.5.3	I find you unacceptable.
HOS.5.4	Your evil deeds are the reason
HOS.5.4	you won't return to me,
HOS.5.4	your 
HOS.5.4	And your constant craving for sex
HOS.5.4	keeps you from knowing me.
HOS.5.5	Israel, your pride
HOS.5.5	testifies to your guilt;
HOS.5.5	it makes you stumble,
HOS.5.5	and Judah stumbles too.
HOS.5.6	You offer sheep and cattle
HOS.5.6	as sacrifices to me,
HOS.5.6	but I have turned away
HOS.5.6	and refuse to be found.
HOS.5.7	You have been unfaithful
HOS.5.7	to me, your 
HOS.5.7	you have had children
HOS.5.7	by prostitutes.
HOS.5.7	So at the New Moon Festival,
HOS.5.7	you and your crops
HOS.5.7	will be destroyed.
HOS.5.8	Give a warning on the trumpet!
HOS.5.8	Let it be heard in Gibeah,
HOS.5.8	Ramah, and sinful Bethel.
HOS.5.8	Benjamin, watch out!
HOS.5.9	I, the 
HOS.5.9	and wipe out Israel.
HOS.5.9	This is my solemn promise
HOS.5.9	to every tribe of Israel.
HOS.5.10	Judah's leaders are like crooks
HOS.5.10	who move boundary markers;
HOS.5.10	that's why I will flood them
HOS.5.10	with my anger.
HOS.5.11	Israel was brutally crushed.
HOS.5.11	They got what they deserved
HOS.5.11	for worshiping useless idols.
HOS.5.12	Now I, the 
HOS.5.12	will fill Israel with maggots
HOS.5.12	and make Judah rot.
HOS.5.13	When Israel and Judah saw
HOS.5.13	their sickness and wounds,
HOS.5.13	Israel asked help from Assyria
HOS.5.13	and its mighty king.
HOS.5.13	But the king cannot cure them
HOS.5.13	or heal their wounds.
HOS.5.14	So I'll become a fierce lion
HOS.5.14	attacking Israel and Judah.
HOS.5.14	I'll snatch and carry off
HOS.5.14	what I want,
HOS.5.14	and no one can stop me.
HOS.5.15	Then I'll return to my temple
HOS.5.15	until they confess their guilt
HOS.5.15	and worship me,
HOS.5.15	until they are desperate
HOS.5.15	and beg for my help.
HOS.6.1	Let's return to the 
HOS.6.1	He has torn us to shreds,
HOS.6.1	but he will bandage our wounds
HOS.6.1	and make us well.
HOS.6.2	In two or three days
HOS.6.2	he will heal us
HOS.6.2	and restore our strength
HOS.6.2	that we may live with him.
HOS.6.3	Let's do our best
HOS.6.3	to know the 
HOS.6.3	His coming is as certain
HOS.6.3	as the morning sun;
HOS.6.3	he will refresh us like rain
HOS.6.3	renewing the earth
HOS.6.3	in the springtime.
HOS.6.4	People of Israel and Judah,
HOS.6.4	what can I do with you?
HOS.6.4	Your love for me disappears
HOS.6.4	more quickly than mist
HOS.6.4	or dew at sunrise.
HOS.6.5	That's why I slaughtered you
HOS.6.5	with the words
HOS.6.5	of my prophets.
HOS.6.5	That's why my judgments blazed
HOS.6.5	like the dawning sun.
HOS.6.6	and to know me
HOS.6.6	than to offer sacrifices.
HOS.6.7	At a place named Adam,
HOS.6.7	you
HOS.6.7	by breaking our agreement.
HOS.6.8	Everyone in Gilead is evil;
HOS.6.8	your hands are stained
HOS.6.8	with the blood of victims.
HOS.6.9	You priests are like a gang
HOS.6.9	of robbers in ambush.
HOS.6.9	On the road to Shechem
HOS.6.9	you murder and commit
HOS.6.9	other horrible crimes.
HOS.6.10	I have seen a terrible thing
HOS.6.10	in Israel—
HOS.6.10	you are unfaithful
HOS.6.10	and unfit to worship me.
HOS.6.11	People of Judah,
HOS.6.11	your time is coming too.
HOS.6.11	I, the 
HOS.6.11	my nation prosper again
HOS.7.1	and to heal its wounds.
HOS.7.1	But then I see the crimes
HOS.7.1	in Israel
HOS.7.1	Everyone is deceitful;
HOS.7.1	robbers roam the streets.
HOS.7.2	No one realizes
HOS.7.2	that I have seen their sins
HOS.7.2	surround them like a flood.
HOS.7.3	The king and his officials
HOS.7.3	take great pleasure
HOS.7.3	in their sin and deceit.
HOS.7.4	Everyone burns with desire—
HOS.7.4	they are like coals in an oven,
HOS.7.4	ready to burst into flames.
HOS.7.5	On the day their king
HOS.7.5	was crowned,
HOS.7.5	his officials got him drunk,
HOS.7.5	and he joined
HOS.7.5	in their foolishness.
HOS.7.6	Their anger is a fire
HOS.7.6	that smolders all night,
HOS.7.6	then flares up at dawn.
HOS.7.7	They are flames
HOS.7.7	destroying their leaders.
HOS.7.7	And their kings are powerless;
HOS.7.7	none of them trust me.
HOS.7.8	The people of Israel
HOS.7.8	have mixed with foreigners;
HOS.7.8	they are a thin piece of bread
HOS.7.8	scorched on one side.
HOS.7.9	They don't seem to realize
HOS.7.9	how weak and feeble they are;
HOS.7.9	their hair has turned gray,
HOS.7.9	while foreigners rule.
HOS.7.10	I am the 
HOS.7.10	but in all of their troubles
HOS.7.10	their pride keeps them
HOS.7.10	from returning to me.
HOS.7.11	Israel
HOS.7.11	fluttering back and forth
HOS.7.11	between Egypt and Assyria.
HOS.7.12	But I will catch them in a net
HOS.7.12	as hunters trap birds;
HOS.7.12	I threatened to punish them,
HOS.7.12	and indeed I will.
HOS.7.13	Trouble and destruction
HOS.7.13	will be their reward
HOS.7.13	for rejecting me.
HOS.7.13	I would have rescued them,
HOS.7.13	but they told me lies.
HOS.7.14	They don't really pray to me;
HOS.7.14	they just howl in their beds.
HOS.7.14	They have rejected me for Baal
HOS.7.14	and slashed themselves,
HOS.7.14	in the hope that Baal
HOS.7.14	will bless their crops.
HOS.7.15	I taught them what they know,
HOS.7.15	and I made them strong.
HOS.7.15	Now they plot against me
HOS.7.16	and refuse to obey.
HOS.7.16	They are more useless
HOS.7.16	than a crooked arrow.
HOS.7.16	Their leaders will die in war
HOS.7.16	for saying foolish things.
HOS.7.16	Egyptians will laugh at them.
HOS.8.1	Sound a warning!
HOS.8.1	Israel, you broke our agreement
HOS.8.1	and ignored my teaching.
HOS.8.1	Now an eagle
HOS.8.1	to attack my land.
HOS.8.2	Israel, you say, “We claim you,
HOS.8.2	the 
HOS.8.3	But your enemies
HOS.8.3	will chase you for rejecting
HOS.8.3	our good agreement.
HOS.8.4	You chose kings and leaders
HOS.8.4	without consulting me;
HOS.8.4	you made silver and gold idols
HOS.8.4	that led to your downfall.
HOS.8.5	City of Samaria, I'm angry
HOS.8.5	because of your idol
HOS.8.5	in the shape of a calf.
HOS.8.5	When will you ever
HOS.8.5	be innocent again?
HOS.8.6	Someone from Israel built
HOS.8.6	that idol for you,
HOS.8.6	but only I am God.
HOS.8.6	And so it will be smashed
HOS.8.6	to pieces.
HOS.8.7	If you scatter wind
HOS.8.7	instead of wheat,
HOS.8.7	you will harvest a whirlwind
HOS.8.7	and have no wheat.
HOS.8.7	Even if you harvest grain,
HOS.8.7	enemies will steal it all.
HOS.8.8	Israel, you are ruined,
HOS.8.8	and now the nations
HOS.8.8	consider you worthless.
HOS.8.9	You are like a wild donkey
HOS.8.9	that goes its own way.
HOS.8.9	You've run off to Assyria
HOS.8.9	and hired them as allies.
HOS.8.10	You can bargain with nations,
HOS.8.10	but I'll catch you anyway.
HOS.8.10	Soon you will suffer abuse
HOS.8.10	by kings and rulers.
HOS.8.11	Israel, you have built
HOS.8.11	many altars where you offer
HOS.8.11	sacrifices for sin.
HOS.8.11	But these altars have become
HOS.8.11	places for sin.
HOS.8.12	My instructions for sacrifices
HOS.8.12	were written in detail,
HOS.8.12	but you ignored them.
HOS.8.13	You sacrifice your best animals
HOS.8.13	and eat the sacrificial meals,
HOS.8.13	but I, the 
HOS.8.13	refuse your offerings.
HOS.8.13	I will remember your sins
HOS.8.13	and punish you.
HOS.8.13	Then you will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	Israel, I created you,
HOS.8.14	but you forgot me.
HOS.8.14	You and Judah built palaces
HOS.8.14	and many strong cities.
HOS.8.14	Now I will send fire to destroy
HOS.8.14	your towns and fortresses.
HOS.9.1	Israel, don't celebrate
HOS.9.1	or make noisy shouts
HOS.9.1	like other nations.
HOS.9.1	You have been unfaithful
HOS.9.1	to your God.
HOS.9.1	Wherever grain is threshed,
HOS.9.1	you behave like prostitutes
HOS.9.1	because you enjoy
HOS.9.1	the money you receive.
HOS.9.2	But you will run short
HOS.9.2	of grain and wine,
HOS.9.3	and you will have to leave
HOS.9.3	the land of the 
HOS.9.3	Some of you will go to Egypt;
HOS.9.3	others will go to Assyria
HOS.9.3	and eat unclean food.
HOS.9.4	You won't be able to offer
HOS.9.4	sacrifices of wine
HOS.9.4	to the 
HOS.9.4	None of your sacrifices
HOS.9.4	will please him—
HOS.9.4	they will be unclean
HOS.9.4	like food offered to the dead.
HOS.9.4	Your food will only be used
HOS.9.4	to satisfy your hunger;
HOS.9.4	none of it will be brought
HOS.9.4	to the 
HOS.9.5	You will no longer be able
HOS.9.5	to celebrate the festival
HOS.9.5	of the 
HOS.9.6	Even if you escape alive,
HOS.9.6	you will end up in Egypt
HOS.9.6	and be buried in Memphis.
HOS.9.6	Your silver treasures
HOS.9.6	will be lost among weeds;
HOS.9.6	thorns will sprout in your tents.
HOS.9.7	You will get what you deserve,
HOS.9.7	and you will know it.
HOS.9.7	“Prophets are fools,” you say.
HOS.9.7	“And God's messengers
HOS.9.7	are crazy.”
HOS.9.7	Your terrible guilt
HOS.9.7	has filled you with hatred.
HOS.9.8	Israel, the 
HOS.9.8	to look after you.
HOS.9.8	But you trap his prophets
HOS.9.8	and flood his temple
HOS.9.8	with your hatred.
HOS.9.9	as were the men of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	But God remembers your sin,
HOS.9.9	and you will be punished.
HOS.9.10	found you long ago
HOS.9.10	it was like finding
HOS.9.10	grapes in a barren desert
HOS.9.10	or tender young figs.
HOS.9.10	Then you worshiped Baal Peor,
HOS.9.10	that disgusting idol,
HOS.9.10	and you became as disgusting
HOS.9.10	as the idol you loved.
HOS.9.11	And so, Israel, your glory
HOS.9.11	will fly away like birds—
HOS.9.11	your women will no longer
HOS.9.11	be able to give birth.
HOS.9.12	Even if you do have children,
HOS.9.12	I will take them all
HOS.9.12	and leave you to mourn.
HOS.9.12	I will turn away,
HOS.9.12	and you will sink down
HOS.9.12	in deep trouble.
HOS.9.13	Israel, when I first met you,
HOS.9.13	I thought of you as palm trees
HOS.9.13	growing in fertile ground.
HOS.9.13	Now you lead your people out,
HOS.9.13	only to be slaughtered.
HOS.9.14	Our 
HOS.9.14	for your people—
HOS.9.14	make their women unable
HOS.9.14	to have children
HOS.9.14	or to nurse their babies.
HOS.9.15	Israel, I first began
HOS.9.15	to hate you because
HOS.9.15	you did evil at Gilgal.
HOS.9.15	Now I will chase you
HOS.9.15	out of my house.
HOS.9.15	No longer will I love you;
HOS.9.15	your leaders betrayed me.
HOS.9.16	Israel, you are a vine
HOS.9.16	with dried-up roots
HOS.9.16	and fruitless branches.
HOS.9.16	Even if you had more children
HOS.9.16	and loved them dearly,
HOS.9.16	I would slaughter them all.
HOS.9.17	Israel, you disobeyed my God.
HOS.9.17	Now he will force you to roam
HOS.9.17	from nation to nation.
HOS.10.1	You were a healthy vine
HOS.10.1	covered with grapes.
HOS.10.1	But the more grapes you grew,
HOS.10.1	the more altars you built;
HOS.10.1	the better off you became,
HOS.10.1	the better shrines you set up
HOS.10.1	for pagan gods.
HOS.10.2	You are deceitful and disloyal.
HOS.10.2	So you will pay
HOS.10.2	for your sins,
HOS.10.2	because the 
HOS.10.2	your altars and images.
HOS.10.3	“We don't have a king,”
HOS.10.3	you will say.
HOS.10.3	“We don't fear the 
HOS.10.3	And what good are kings?”
HOS.10.4	Israel, you break treaties
HOS.10.4	and don't keep promises;
HOS.10.4	you turn justice
HOS.10.4	into poisonous weeds
HOS.10.4	where healthy plants should grow.
HOS.10.5	All who live in Samaria tremble
HOS.10.5	with concern for the idols
HOS.10.5	at sinful Bethel.
HOS.10.5	The idol there was the pride
HOS.10.5	of the priests,
HOS.10.5	but it has been put to shame;
HOS.10.5	now everyone will cry.
HOS.10.6	It will be taken to Assyria
HOS.10.6	and given to the great king.
HOS.10.6	Then Israel will be disgraced
HOS.10.6	for worshiping that idol.
HOS.10.7	Like a twig in a stream,
HOS.10.7	the king of Samaria
HOS.10.7	will be swept away.
HOS.10.8	will be destroyed
HOS.10.8	for causing Israel to sin;
HOS.10.8	they will be grown over
HOS.10.8	with thorns and thistles.
HOS.10.8	Then everyone will beg
HOS.10.8	the mountains and hills
HOS.10.8	to cover and protect them.
HOS.10.9	stopped sinning
HOS.10.9	since that time at Gibeah.
HOS.10.9	That's why you
HOS.10.9	will be attacked at Gibeah.
HOS.10.10	Your sins have doubled,
HOS.10.10	and you are rebellious.
HOS.10.10	Now I have decided
HOS.10.10	to send nations to attack
HOS.10.10	and put you in chains.
HOS.10.11	Once you were obedient
HOS.10.11	like a calf
HOS.10.11	that loved to thresh grain.
HOS.10.11	But I will put a harness
HOS.10.11	on your beautiful neck;
HOS.10.11	you and Judah must plow
HOS.10.11	and cultivate the ground.
HOS.10.12	scatter seeds of justice,
HOS.10.12	and harvest faithfulness.
HOS.10.12	Worship me, the 
HOS.10.12	and I will send my saving power
HOS.10.12	down like rain.
HOS.10.13	You have planted evil,
HOS.10.13	harvested injustice, and eaten
HOS.10.13	the fruit of your lies.
HOS.10.13	You trusted your own strength
HOS.10.13	and your powerful forces.
HOS.10.14	So war will break out,
HOS.10.14	and your fortresses
HOS.10.14	will be destroyed.
HOS.10.14	Your enemies will do to you
HOS.10.14	what Shalman
HOS.10.14	of Beth-Arbel—
HOS.10.14	mothers and their children
HOS.10.14	will be beaten to death
HOS.10.14	against rocks.
HOS.10.15	Bethel, this will be your fate
HOS.10.15	because of your evil.
HOS.10.15	Israel, at dawn your king
HOS.10.15	will be killed.
HOS.11.1	I loved him, and I called
HOS.11.1	my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	But as the saying goes,
HOS.11.2	“The more they were called,
HOS.11.2	the more they rebelled.”
HOS.11.2	They never stopped offering
HOS.11.2	incense and sacrifices
HOS.11.2	to the idols of Baal.
HOS.11.3	I took Israel by the arm
HOS.11.3	and taught them to walk.
HOS.11.3	But they would not admit
HOS.11.3	that I was the one
HOS.11.3	who had healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with kindness
HOS.11.4	and with love,
HOS.11.4	not with ropes.
HOS.11.4	I held them close to me;
HOS.11.4	I bent down to feed them.
HOS.11.5	But they rejected me,
HOS.11.5	and so must return to Egypt;
HOS.11.5	now Assyria will rule them.
HOS.11.6	War will visit their cities,
HOS.11.6	and their plans will fail.
HOS.11.7	My people are determined
HOS.11.7	to reject me for a god
HOS.11.7	they think is stronger,
HOS.11.7	but he can't help.
HOS.11.8	I can't give you up.
HOS.11.8	How could I possibly destroy you
HOS.11.8	as I did the towns of Admah
HOS.11.8	and Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	I just can't do it.
HOS.11.8	My feelings for you
HOS.11.8	are much too strong.
HOS.11.9	Israel, I won't lose my temper
HOS.11.9	and destroy you again.
HOS.11.9	I am the Holy God—
HOS.11.9	not merely some human,
HOS.11.9	and I won't stay angry.
HOS.11.10	I, the 
HOS.11.10	and my children will return,
HOS.11.10	trembling from the west.
HOS.11.11	They will come back,
HOS.11.11	fluttering like birds from Egypt
HOS.11.11	or like doves from Assyria.
HOS.11.11	Then I will bring them
HOS.11.11	back to their homes.
HOS.11.11	I, the 
HOS.11.12	Israel is deceitful to me,
HOS.11.12	their loyal and holy God;
HOS.11.12	they surround me with lies,
HOS.11.12	and Judah worships
HOS.11.12	other gods.
HOS.12.1	All day long Israel chases
HOS.12.1	wind from the desert;
HOS.12.1	deceit and violence
HOS.12.1	are found everywhere.
HOS.12.1	Treaties are made with Assyria;
HOS.12.1	olive oil is taken to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.2	against the people of Judah,
HOS.12.2	the descendants of Jacob.
HOS.12.2	He will punish them
HOS.12.2	for what they have done.
HOS.12.3	he cheated his brother,
HOS.12.3	and when he grew up,
HOS.12.3	he fought against God.
HOS.12.4	with an angel and won;
HOS.12.4	then with tears in his eyes,
HOS.12.4	he asked for a blessing,
HOS.12.4	and God spoke to us
HOS.12.5	God's name is the 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	So return to your God.
HOS.12.6	Patiently trust him,
HOS.12.6	and show love and justice.
HOS.12.7	Israel, you enjoy cheating
HOS.12.7	and taking advantage
HOS.12.7	of others.
HOS.12.8	You say to yourself, “I'm rich!
HOS.12.8	I earned it all on my own,
HOS.12.8	without committing a sin.”
HOS.12.9	am still your God,
HOS.12.9	just as I have been
HOS.12.9	since the time
HOS.12.9	you were in Egypt.
HOS.12.9	Now I will force you
HOS.12.9	to live in tents once again,
HOS.12.9	as you did in the desert.
HOS.12.10	I spoke to the prophets—
HOS.12.10	often I spoke in visions.
HOS.12.10	And so, I will send my prophets
HOS.12.10	with messages of doom.
HOS.12.11	Gilead is terribly sinful
HOS.12.11	and will end up ruined.
HOS.12.11	Bulls are sacrificed in Gilgal
HOS.12.11	on altars made of stones,
HOS.12.11	but those stones will be scattered
HOS.12.11	in every field.
HOS.12.12	where he tended sheep
HOS.12.12	to earn himself a wife.
HOS.12.13	to lead Israel from Egypt
HOS.12.13	and to keep them safe.
HOS.12.14	Israel, I will make you pay
HOS.12.14	for your violent crimes
HOS.12.14	and for insulting me.
HOS.13.1	When your leaders
HOS.13.1	everyone in Israel trembled
HOS.13.1	and showed great respect.
HOS.13.1	But you sinned by worshiping Baal,
HOS.13.1	and you were destroyed.
HOS.13.2	Now you continue to sin
HOS.13.2	by designing and making
HOS.13.2	idols of silver
HOS.13.2	in the shape of calves.
HOS.13.2	You are told to sacrifice
HOS.13.2	to these idols
HOS.13.2	yes, even to kiss them.
HOS.13.3	And so, all of you will vanish
HOS.13.3	like the mist or the dew
HOS.13.3	of early morning,
HOS.13.3	or husks of grain in the wind
HOS.13.3	or smoke from a chimney.
HOS.13.4	I, the 
HOS.13.4	since the time
HOS.13.4	you were in Egypt.
HOS.13.4	I am the only God you know,
HOS.13.4	the only one who can save.
HOS.13.5	in a thirsty desert.
HOS.13.6	I fed you till you were satisfied,
HOS.13.6	then you became proud
HOS.13.6	and forgot about me.
HOS.13.7	Now I will attack like a lion,
HOS.13.7	ambush you like a leopard,
HOS.13.8	and rip you apart like a bear
HOS.13.8	robbed of her cubs.
HOS.13.8	I will gnaw on your bones,
HOS.13.8	as though I were a lion
HOS.13.8	or some other wild animal.
HOS.13.9	Israel, you are done for.
HOS.13.9	Don't expect help from me.
HOS.13.10	Where is your king now?
HOS.13.10	What cities have rulers?
HOS.13.11	in my fury, I took him away.
HOS.13.12	Israel, your terrible sins
HOS.13.12	are written down
HOS.13.12	and stored away.
HOS.13.13	You are like a senseless child
HOS.13.13	who refuses to be born
HOS.13.13	at the proper time.
HOS.13.14	from death and the grave?
HOS.13.14	No! I call death and the grave
HOS.13.14	to strike you like a plague.
HOS.13.14	I refuse to show mercy.
HOS.13.15	No matter if you prosper
HOS.13.15	more than the other tribes,
HOS.13.15	I, the 
HOS.13.15	just as a scorching desert wind
HOS.13.15	dries up streams of water.
HOS.13.15	I will take away
HOS.13.15	your precious treasures.

HOS.13.16	for turning against me.
HOS.13.16	It will be destroyed in war—
HOS.13.16	children will be beaten
HOS.13.16	against rocks,
HOS.13.16	and pregnant women
HOS.13.16	will be ripped open.
HOS.14.1	Israel, return! Come back
HOS.14.1	to the 
HOS.14.1	Sin has made you fall.
HOS.14.2	Return to the 
HOS.14.2	“Please forgive our sins.
HOS.14.2	Accept our good sacrifices
HOS.14.2	of praise instead of bulls.
HOS.14.3	Assyria can't save us,
HOS.14.3	and chariots can't help.
HOS.14.3	So we will no longer worship
HOS.14.3	the idols we have made.
HOS.14.3	Our 
HOS.14.3	to orphans.”
HOS.14.4	Israel, you have rejected me,
HOS.14.4	but my anger is gone;
HOS.14.4	I will heal you and love you
HOS.14.4	without limit.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew—
HOS.14.5	then you will blossom like lilies
HOS.14.5	and have roots like a tree.
HOS.14.6	Your branches will spread
HOS.14.6	with the beauty
HOS.14.6	of an olive tree
HOS.14.6	and with the aroma
HOS.14.6	of Lebanon Forest.
HOS.14.7	You will rest in my shade,
HOS.14.7	and your grain will grow.
HOS.14.7	You will blossom
HOS.14.7	like a vineyard
HOS.14.7	and be famous as the wine
HOS.14.7	from Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	Israel, give up your idols!
HOS.14.8	I will answer your prayers
HOS.14.8	and take care of you.
HOS.14.8	I am that glorious tree,
HOS.14.8	the source of your fruit.
HOS.14.9	If you are wise, you will know
HOS.14.9	and understand what I mean.
HOS.14.9	I am the 
HOS.14.9	along the right path.
HOS.14.9	If you obey me,
HOS.14.9	we will walk together,
HOS.14.9	but if you are wicked,
HOS.14.9	you will stumble.
JOL.1.1	I am Joel the son of Pethuel.
JOL.1.1	And this is the message
JOL.1.1	the 
JOL.1.2	Listen, you leaders
JOL.1.2	and everyone else
JOL.1.2	in the land.
JOL.1.2	Has anything like this
JOL.1.2	ever happened before?
JOL.1.3	Tell our children!
JOL.1.3	Let it be told
JOL.1.3	to our grandchildren
JOL.1.3	and their children too.
JOL.1.4	Swarm after swarm of locusts
JOL.1.4	has attacked our crops,
JOL.1.4	eating everything in sight.
JOL.1.5	Sober up, you drunkards!
JOL.1.5	Cry long and loud;
JOL.1.5	your wine supply is gone.
JOL.1.6	with countless troops
JOL.1.6	has invaded our land.
JOL.1.6	They have the teeth and jaws
JOL.1.6	of powerful lions.
JOL.1.7	Our grapevines and fig trees
JOL.1.7	are stripped bare;
JOL.1.7	only naked branches remain.
JOL.1.8	Grieve like a young woman
JOL.1.8	mourning for the man
JOL.1.8	she was to marry.
JOL.1.9	Offerings of grain and wine
JOL.1.9	are no longer brought
JOL.1.9	to the 
JOL.1.9	His servants, the priests,
JOL.1.9	are deep in sorrow.
JOL.1.10	Barren fields mourn;
JOL.1.10	grain, grapes, and olives
JOL.1.10	are scorched and shriveled.
JOL.1.11	Mourn for our farms
JOL.1.11	and our vineyards!
JOL.1.11	There's no wheat or barley
JOL.1.11	growing in our fields.
JOL.1.12	Grapevines have dried up
JOL.1.12	and so has every tree—
JOL.1.12	figs and pomegranates,
JOL.1.12	date palms and apples.
JOL.1.12	All happiness has faded away.
JOL.1.13	Mourn, you priests who serve
JOL.1.13	at the altar of my God.
JOL.1.13	Spend your days and nights
JOL.1.13	wearing sackcloth.
JOL.1.13	Offerings of grain and wine
JOL.1.13	are no longer brought
JOL.1.13	to the 
JOL.1.14	Tell the leaders and people
JOL.1.14	to come together
JOL.1.14	at the temple.
JOL.1.14	Order them to go without eating
JOL.1.14	and to pray sincerely.
JOL.1.15	Soon the 
JOL.1.15	will bring disaster.
JOL.1.16	Our food is already gone;
JOL.1.16	there's no more celebrating
JOL.1.16	at the temple of our God.
JOL.1.17	Seeds dry up in the ground;
JOL.1.17	no harvest is possible.
JOL.1.17	Our barns are in bad shape,
JOL.1.17	with no grain
JOL.1.17	to store in them.
JOL.1.18	Our cattle wander aimlessly,
JOL.1.18	moaning for lack of pasture,
JOL.1.18	and sheep are suffering.
JOL.1.19	I cry out to you, 
JOL.1.19	Grasslands and forests are eaten
JOL.1.19	by the scorching heat.
JOL.1.20	Wild animals have no water
JOL.1.20	because of you;
JOL.1.20	rivers and streams are dry,
JOL.1.20	and pastures are parched.
JOL.2.1	Sound the trumpet on Zion,
JOL.2.1	the 
JOL.2.1	Warn everyone to tremble!
JOL.2.1	The judgment day of the 
JOL.2.1	is coming soon.
JOL.2.2	It will be dark and gloomy
JOL.2.2	with storm clouds overhead.
JOL.2.2	Troops will cover the mountains
JOL.2.2	like thunderclouds.
JOL.2.2	No army this powerful
JOL.2.2	has ever been gathered before
JOL.2.2	or will be gathered again.
JOL.2.3	Fiery flames surround them;
JOL.2.3	no one escapes.
JOL.2.3	Before they invaded,
JOL.2.3	the land was like Eden;
JOL.2.3	now only a desert remains.
JOL.2.4	and charge like cavalry.
JOL.2.5	They roar over mountains
JOL.2.5	like noisy chariots,
JOL.2.5	or a mighty army
JOL.2.5	ready for battle.
JOL.2.5	They are a forest fire
JOL.2.5	that feasts on straw.
JOL.2.6	The very sight of them
JOL.2.6	is frightening.
JOL.2.7	They climb over walls
JOL.2.7	like warriors;
JOL.2.7	they march in columns
JOL.2.7	and never turn aside.
JOL.2.8	They charge straight ahead,
JOL.2.8	without pushing each other;
JOL.2.8	even arrows and spears
JOL.2.8	cannot make them retreat.
JOL.2.9	They swarm over city walls
JOL.2.9	and enter our homes;
JOL.2.9	they crawl in through windows,
JOL.2.9	just like thieves.
JOL.2.10	and the heavens shake;
JOL.2.10	the sun and moon turn dark,
JOL.2.10	and stars stop shining.
JOL.2.11	of countless troops,
JOL.2.11	and they obey his commands.
JOL.2.11	The day of his judgment
JOL.2.11	is so terrible
JOL.2.11	that no one can stand it.
JOL.2.12	The 
JOL.2.12	It isn't too late.
JOL.2.12	You can still return to me
JOL.2.12	with all your heart.
JOL.2.12	Start crying and mourning!
JOL.2.12	Go without eating.
JOL.2.13	Don't rip your clothes
JOL.2.13	to show your sorrow.
JOL.2.13	Instead, turn back to me
JOL.2.13	with broken hearts.
JOL.2.13	I am merciful, kind, and caring.
JOL.2.13	I don't easily lose my temper,
JOL.2.13	and I don't like to punish.
JOL.2.14	I am the 
JOL.2.14	Perhaps I will change my mind
JOL.2.14	and treat you with mercy.
JOL.2.14	Then you will be blessed
JOL.2.14	with enough grain and wine
JOL.2.14	for offering sacrifices to me.
JOL.2.15	Sound the trumpet on Zion!
JOL.2.15	Call the people together.

JOL.2.15	by going without food.
JOL.2.16	is fit to worship me.
JOL.2.16	Bring adults, children, babies,
JOL.2.16	and even bring newlyweds
JOL.2.16	from their festivities.
JOL.2.17	to cry inside the temple
JOL.2.17	and to offer this prayer
JOL.2.17	near the altar:
JOL.2.17	“Save your people, 
JOL.2.17	Don't let foreign nations
JOL.2.17	make jokes about us.
JOL.2.17	Don't let them laugh and ask,
JOL.2.17	‘Where is your God?’ ”
JOL.2.18	The 
JOL.2.18	about his land
JOL.2.18	and had pity on his people.
JOL.2.19	In answer to their prayers
JOL.2.19	he said,
JOL.2.19	“I will give you enough grain,
JOL.2.19	wine, and olive oil
JOL.2.19	to satisfy your needs.
JOL.2.19	No longer will I let you
JOL.2.19	be insulted by the nations.
JOL.2.20	An army attacked from the north,
JOL.2.20	but I will chase it
JOL.2.20	into a scorching desert.
JOL.2.20	There it will rot and stink
JOL.2.20	from the Dead Sea
JOL.2.20	to the Mediterranean.”
JOL.2.20	The 
JOL.2.21	and does great things.
JOL.2.21	So tell the soil to celebrate
JOL.2.22	and wild animals
JOL.2.22	to stop being afraid.
JOL.2.22	Grasslands are green again;
JOL.2.22	fruit trees and fig trees
JOL.2.22	are loaded with fruit.
JOL.2.22	Grapevines are covered
JOL.2.22	with grapes.
JOL.2.23	People of Zion,

JOL.2.23	of the 
JOL.2.23	He is generous and has sent
JOL.2.23	the autumn and spring rains
JOL.2.23	in the proper seasons.
JOL.2.24	Grain will cover
JOL.2.24	your threshing places;
JOL.2.24	jars will overflow
JOL.2.24	with wine and olive oil.
JOL.2.25	I, the 
JOL.2.25	will make up for the losses
JOL.2.25	caused by those swarms
JOL.2.25	and swarms of locusts
JOL.2.25	I sent to attack you.
JOL.2.26	My people, you will eat
JOL.2.26	until you are satisfied.
JOL.2.26	Then you will praise me
JOL.2.26	for the wonderful things
JOL.2.26	I have done.
JOL.2.26	Never again will you
JOL.2.26	be put to shame.
JOL.2.27	Israel, you will know
JOL.2.27	that I stand at your side.
JOL.2.27	I am the 
JOL.2.27	there are no other gods.
JOL.2.27	Never again will you
JOL.2.27	be put to shame.
JOL.2.28	to everyone.
JOL.2.28	Your sons and daughters
JOL.2.28	will prophesy.
JOL.2.28	Your old men
JOL.2.28	will have dreams,
JOL.2.28	and your young men
JOL.2.28	will see visions.
JOL.2.29	In those days I will even give
JOL.2.29	my Spirit to my servants,
JOL.2.29	both men and women.
JOL.2.30	I will work wonders
JOL.2.30	in the sky above
JOL.2.30	and on the earth below.
JOL.2.30	There will be blood and fire
JOL.2.30	and clouds of smoke.
JOL.2.31	and the moon
JOL.2.31	will be as red as blood
JOL.2.31	before that great
JOL.2.31	and terrible day
JOL.2.31	when I appear.
JOL.3.1	At that time I, the 
JOL.3.2	Then in Judgment Valley
JOL.3.3	and gambled to see who would get my people; they sold boys and girls to pay for prostitutes and wine.
JOL.3.5	You've taken my prized possessions, including my silver and gold, and carried them off to your temples.
JOL.3.6	You have dragged the people of Judah and Jerusalem from their land and sold them to the Greeks.
JOL.3.7	But I'll make the people of Judah determined to come home, and what happened to them will happen to you. 
JOL.3.8	I'll hand over your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans,
JOL.3.9	Say to the nations:
JOL.3.9	“Get ready for war!
JOL.3.9	Be eager to fight.
JOL.3.9	Line up for battle
JOL.3.9	and prepare to attack.
JOL.3.10	and spears out of garden tools.
JOL.3.10	Strengthen every weakling.”
JOL.3.11	Hurry, all you nations!
JOL.3.11	Come quickly.
JOL.3.11	Ask the 
JOL.3.11	his warriors along.
JOL.3.12	You must come now
JOL.3.12	to Judgment Valley,
JOL.3.12	where the 
JOL.3.12	the surrounding nations.
JOL.3.13	Bring in the harvest!
JOL.3.13	They are grapes piled high.
JOL.3.13	Start trampling them now!
JOL.3.13	If our enemy's sins were wine,
JOL.3.13	every jar would overflow.
JOL.3.14	Crowds fill Decision Valley.
JOL.3.14	The judgment day of the 
JOL.3.14	will soon be here—
JOL.3.15	no light from the sun or moon,
JOL.3.15	and stars no longer shine.
JOL.3.16	the 
JOL.3.16	shaking the earth and sky.
JOL.3.16	But the 
JOL.3.16	a place of safety
JOL.3.16	for his people Israel.
JOL.3.17	I am the 
JOL.3.17	And you will know I live on Zion,
JOL.3.17	my sacred hill,
JOL.3.17	because Jerusalem will be sacred,
JOL.3.17	untouched by foreign troops.
JOL.3.18	On that day, fruitful vineyards
JOL.3.18	will cover the mountains.
JOL.3.18	And your cattle and goats
JOL.3.18	that graze on the hills
JOL.3.18	will produce a lot of milk.
JOL.3.18	Streams in Judah
JOL.3.18	will never run dry;
JOL.3.18	a stream from my house
JOL.3.18	will flow in Acacia Valley.
JOL.3.19	Egypt and Edom were cruel
JOL.3.19	and brutal to Judah,
JOL.3.19	without a reason.
JOL.3.19	Now their countries will become
JOL.3.19	a barren desert,
JOL.3.20	but Judah and Jerusalem
JOL.3.20	will always have people.
JOL.3.21	I, the 
JOL.3.21	I will punish the guilty
JOL.3.21	and defend the innocent.
AMO.1.1	Two years before the earthquake,
AMO.1.2	 and I said:
AMO.1.2	When the 
AMO.1.2	from Jerusalem,
AMO.1.2	pasturelands and Mount Carmel
AMO.1.2	dry up and turn brown.
AMO.1.3	I will punish Syria
AMO.1.3	for countless crimes,
AMO.1.3	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.1.3	They dragged logs with spikes
AMO.1.3	over the people of Gilead.
AMO.1.4	Now I will burn down the palaces
AMO.1.4	and fortresses of King Hazael
AMO.1.4	and of King Benhadad.
AMO.1.5	I will break through
AMO.1.5	the gates of Damascus.
AMO.1.5	I will destroy the people
AMO.1.5	of Wicked Valley
AMO.1.5	and the ruler of Beth-Eden.
AMO.1.5	Then the Syrians will be dragged
AMO.1.5	as prisoners to Kir.
AMO.1.5	I, the 
AMO.1.6	I will punish Philistia
AMO.1.6	for countless crimes,
AMO.1.6	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.1.6	They dragged off my people
AMO.1.6	from town after town
AMO.1.6	to sell them as slaves
AMO.1.6	to the Edomites.
AMO.1.7	That's why I will burn down
AMO.1.7	the walls and fortresses
AMO.1.7	of the city of Gaza.
AMO.1.8	I will destroy the king
AMO.1.8	and the ruler of Ashkelon.
AMO.1.8	I will strike down Ekron,
AMO.1.8	and that will be the end
AMO.1.8	of the Philistines.
AMO.1.8	I, the 
AMO.1.9	I will punish Phoenicia
AMO.1.9	for countless crimes,
AMO.1.9	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.1.9	They broke their treaty
AMO.1.9	and dragged off my people
AMO.1.9	from town after town
AMO.1.9	to sell them as slaves
AMO.1.9	to the Edomites.
AMO.1.10	That's why I will send flames
AMO.1.10	to burn down the city of Tyre
AMO.1.10	along with its fortresses.
AMO.1.11	I will punish Edom
AMO.1.11	for countless crimes,
AMO.1.11	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.1.11	They killed their own relatives
AMO.1.11	and were so terribly furious
AMO.1.11	that they showed no mercy.
AMO.1.12	Now I will send fire to wipe out
AMO.1.12	the fortresses of Teman
AMO.1.12	and Bozrah.
AMO.1.13	I will punish Ammon
AMO.1.13	for countless crimes,
AMO.1.13	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.1.13	In Gilead they ripped open
AMO.1.13	pregnant women,
AMO.1.13	just to take the land.
AMO.1.14	Now I will send fire to destroy
AMO.1.14	the walls and fortresses
AMO.1.14	of Rabbah.
AMO.1.14	Enemies will shout and attack
AMO.1.14	like a whirlwind.
AMO.1.15	Ammon's king and leaders
AMO.1.15	will be dragged away.
AMO.1.15	I, the 
AMO.2.1	I will punish Moab
AMO.2.1	for countless crimes,
AMO.2.1	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.2.1	They made lime from the bones
AMO.2.1	of the king of Edom.
AMO.2.2	Now I will send fire to destroy
AMO.2.2	the fortresses of Kerioth.
AMO.2.2	Battle shouts and trumpet blasts
AMO.2.2	will be heard as I destroy Moab
AMO.2.3	with its king and leaders.
AMO.2.3	I, the 
AMO.2.4	The 
AMO.2.4	I will punish Judah
AMO.2.4	for countless crimes,
AMO.2.4	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.2.4	They have rejected my teachings
AMO.2.4	and refused to obey me.
AMO.2.4	They were led astray
AMO.2.4	by the same false gods
AMO.2.4	their ancestors worshiped.
AMO.2.5	Now I will send fire on Judah
AMO.2.5	and destroy the fortresses
AMO.2.5	of Jerusalem.
AMO.2.6	The 
AMO.2.6	I will punish Israel
AMO.2.6	for countless crimes,
AMO.2.6	and I won't change my mind.
AMO.2.6	They sell honest people for money,
AMO.2.6	and the needy are sold
AMO.2.6	for the price of sandals.
AMO.2.7	They smear the poor in the dirt
AMO.2.7	and push aside
AMO.2.7	those who are helpless.
AMO.2.7	My holy name is dishonored,
AMO.2.7	because fathers and sons sleep
AMO.2.7	with the same young women.
AMO.2.8	They lie down beside altars
AMO.2.8	on clothes taken
AMO.2.8	as security for loans.
AMO.2.8	And they drink wine in my temple,
AMO.2.8	wine bought with the money
AMO.2.8	they received from fines.
AMO.2.9	when you entered Canaan.
AMO.2.9	They were tall as cedars
AMO.2.9	and strong as oaks.
AMO.2.9	But I wiped them out—
AMO.2.9	I destroyed their branches
AMO.2.9	and their roots.
AMO.2.10	I had rescued you from Egypt,
AMO.2.10	and for forty years I had led you
AMO.2.10	through the desert.
AMO.2.10	Then I gave you the land
AMO.2.10	of the Amorites.
AMO.2.11	to be prophets
AMO.2.11	and others to be Nazirites.
AMO.2.11	People of Israel,
AMO.2.11	you know this is true.
AMO.2.11	I, the 
AMO.2.12	But you commanded the prophets
AMO.2.12	not to speak their message,
AMO.2.12	and you pressured the Nazirites
AMO.2.12	into drinking wine.
AMO.2.13	And so I will crush you,
AMO.2.13	just as a wagon full of grain
AMO.2.13	crushes the ground.
AMO.2.14	No matter how fast you run,
AMO.2.14	you won't escape.
AMO.2.14	No matter how strong you are,
AMO.2.14	you will lose your strength
AMO.2.14	and your life.
AMO.2.15	Even if you are an expert
AMO.2.15	with a bow and arrow,
AMO.2.15	you will retreat.
AMO.2.15	And you won't get away alive,
AMO.2.15	not even if you run fast
AMO.2.15	or ride a horse.
AMO.2.16	You may be brave and strong,
AMO.2.16	but you will run away,
AMO.2.16	stripped naked.
AMO.2.16	I, the 
AMO.3.1	People of Israel,
AMO.3.1	I rescued you from Egypt.
AMO.3.1	Now listen to my judgment
AMO.3.1	against you.
AMO.3.2	Of all nations on earth,
AMO.3.2	you are the only one
AMO.3.2	I have chosen.
AMO.3.2	That's why I will punish you
AMO.3.2	because of your sins.
AMO.3.3	Can two people walk together
AMO.3.3	without agreeing to meet?
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar in the forest
AMO.3.4	unless it has caught
AMO.3.4	a victim?
AMO.3.4	Does it growl in its den
AMO.3.4	unless it is eating?
AMO.3.5	How can anyone catch a bird
AMO.3.5	without using a net?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring shut
AMO.3.5	unless something is caught?
AMO.3.6	Isn't the whole city frightened
AMO.3.6	when the trumpet
AMO.3.6	signals an attack?
AMO.3.6	Isn't the 
AMO.3.6	disaster on a city?
AMO.3.7	Whatever the 
AMO.3.7	plans to do,
AMO.3.7	he tells his servants,
AMO.3.7	the prophets.
AMO.3.8	Everyone is terrified
AMO.3.8	when a lion roars—
AMO.3.8	and ordinary people
AMO.3.8	become prophets
AMO.3.8	when the 
AMO.3.9	Here is a message
AMO.3.9	for the leaders
AMO.3.9	of Philistia
AMO.3.9	tell everyone to come together
AMO.3.9	on the hills of Samaria.
AMO.3.9	Let them see the injustice
AMO.3.9	and the lawlessness
AMO.3.9	in that city.
AMO.3.10	The 
AMO.3.10	that they don't even know how
AMO.3.10	to do right.
AMO.3.10	They have become rich
AMO.3.10	from violence and robbery.
AMO.3.11	And so the 
AMO.3.11	that they will be surrounded.
AMO.3.11	Enemies will break through
AMO.3.11	their defenses
AMO.3.11	and steal their treasures.
AMO.3.12	The 
AMO.3.12	that only a few from Samaria
AMO.3.12	will escape with their lives
AMO.3.12	and with some broken pieces
AMO.3.12	of their beds and couches.
AMO.3.12	It will be like when a shepherd
AMO.3.12	rescues two leg bones
AMO.3.12	and part of a sheep's ear
AMO.3.12	from the jaws of a lion.
AMO.3.13	The 
AMO.3.13	told me to speak this message
AMO.3.13	against Jacob's descendants:
AMO.3.14	for their sins,
AMO.3.14	I will destroy the altars
AMO.3.14	at Bethel.
AMO.3.14	Even the corners of the altar
AMO.3.14	will be left in the dirt.
AMO.3.15	I will tear down winter homes
AMO.3.15	and summer homes.
AMO.3.15	Houses decorated with ivory
AMO.3.15	and all other mansions
AMO.3.15	will be gone forever.
AMO.3.15	I, the 
AMO.4.1	You women of Samaria
AMO.4.1	are fat cows!
AMO.4.1	You mistreat and abuse
AMO.4.1	the poor and needy,
AMO.4.1	then you say to your husbands,
AMO.4.1	“Bring us more drinks!”
AMO.4.2	I, the 
AMO.4.2	by my own name
AMO.4.2	that your time is coming.
AMO.4.2	Not one of you will be left—
AMO.4.2	you will be taken away
AMO.4.2	by sharp hooks.
AMO.4.3	You will be dragged through holes
AMO.4.3	in your city walls,
AMO.4.3	and you will be thrown
AMO.4.3	toward Harmon.
AMO.4.3	I, the 
AMO.4.4	Come to Bethel and Gilgal.
AMO.4.4	Sin all you want!
AMO.4.4	Offer sacrifices the next morning
AMO.4.4	and bring a tenth of your crops
AMO.4.4	on the third day.
AMO.4.5	Bring offerings to show me
AMO.4.5	how thankful you are.
AMO.4.5	Gladly bring more offerings
AMO.4.5	than I have demanded.
AMO.4.5	You really love to do this.
AMO.4.5	I, the 
AMO.4.6	from every town and village,
AMO.4.6	but still you rejected me.
AMO.4.7	Three months before harvest,
AMO.4.7	I kept back the rain.
AMO.4.7	Sometimes I would let it fall
AMO.4.7	on one town or field
AMO.4.7	but not on another,
AMO.4.7	and pastures dried up.
AMO.4.8	People from two or three towns
AMO.4.8	would go to a town
AMO.4.8	that still had water,
AMO.4.8	but it wasn't enough.
AMO.4.8	Even then you rejected me.
AMO.4.8	I, the 
AMO.4.9	I dried up your grain fields;
AMO.4.9	your gardens and vineyards
AMO.4.9	turned brown.
AMO.4.9	Locusts
AMO.4.9	and olive orchards,
AMO.4.9	but even then you rejected me.
AMO.4.9	I, the 
AMO.4.10	I did terrible things to you,
AMO.4.10	just as I did to Egypt—
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men in war;
AMO.4.10	I let your horses be stolen,
AMO.4.10	and I made your camp stink
AMO.4.10	with dead bodies.
AMO.4.10	Even then you rejected me.
AMO.4.10	I, the 
AMO.4.11	just as I did the cities
AMO.4.11	of Sodom and Gomorrah.
AMO.4.11	You were a burning stick
AMO.4.11	I rescued from the fire.
AMO.4.11	But even then you rejected me.
AMO.4.11	I, the 
AMO.4.12	Now, Israel, I myself
AMO.4.12	will deal with you.
AMO.4.12	Get ready to face your God!
AMO.4.13	I created the mountains
AMO.4.13	and the wind.
AMO.4.13	I let humans know
AMO.4.13	what I am thinking.
AMO.4.13	I bring darkness at dawn
AMO.4.13	and step over hills.
AMO.4.13	I am the 
AMO.5.1	Listen, nation of Israel,
AMO.5.1	to my mournful message:
AMO.5.2	You, dearest Israel, have fallen,
AMO.5.2	never to rise again—
AMO.5.2	you lie deserted in your own land,
AMO.5.2	with no one to help you up.
AMO.5.3	The 
AMO.5.3	“From every ten soldiers
AMO.5.3	only one will be left;
AMO.5.3	from a thousand troops,
AMO.5.3	only a hundred will survive.”
AMO.5.4	The 
AMO.5.4	“Israel, turn back to me
AMO.5.4	and you will live!
AMO.5.5	Don't go to Gilgal or Bethel
AMO.5.5	or even to Beersheba.
AMO.5.5	Gilgal will be dragged away,
AMO.5.5	and Bethel will end up
AMO.5.5	as nothing.”
AMO.5.6	Turn back to the 
AMO.5.6	you descendants of Joseph,
AMO.5.6	and you will live.
AMO.5.6	If you don't, the 
AMO.5.6	will attack like fire.
AMO.5.6	Bethel will burn to the ground,
AMO.5.6	and no one can save it.
AMO.5.7	You people are doomed!
AMO.5.7	You twist the truth
AMO.5.7	and trample on justice.
AMO.5.8	and put them in place.
AMO.5.8	He turns darkness to dawn
AMO.5.8	and daylight to darkness;
AMO.5.8	he scoops up the ocean
AMO.5.8	and empties it on the earth.
AMO.5.9	God destroys mighty soldiers
AMO.5.9	and strong fortresses.
AMO.5.10	You people hate judges
AMO.5.10	and honest witnesses;
AMO.5.11	you abuse the poor and demand
AMO.5.11	heavy taxes from them.
AMO.5.11	You have built expensive homes,
AMO.5.11	but you won't enjoy them;
AMO.5.11	you have planted vineyards,
AMO.5.11	but you will get no wine.
AMO.5.12	I am the 
AMO.5.12	your terrible sins.
AMO.5.12	You cheat honest people
AMO.5.12	and take bribes;
AMO.5.12	you rob the poor of justice.
AMO.5.13	Times are so evil
AMO.5.13	that anyone with good sense
AMO.5.13	will keep quiet.
AMO.5.14	If you really want to live,
AMO.5.14	you must stop doing wrong
AMO.5.14	and start doing right.
AMO.5.14	I, the 
AMO.5.14	will then be on your side,
AMO.5.14	just as you claim I am.
AMO.5.15	Choose good instead of evil!
AMO.5.15	See that justice is done.
AMO.5.15	Maybe I, the 
AMO.5.15	will be kind to what's left
AMO.5.15	of your people.
AMO.5.16	This is what the 
AMO.5.16	Noisy crying will be heard
AMO.5.16	in every town and street.
AMO.5.16	Even farmers will be told
AMO.5.16	to mourn for the dead,
AMO.5.16	together with those
AMO.5.16	who are paid to mourn.
AMO.5.17	Your vineyards will be filled
AMO.5.17	with crying and weeping,
AMO.5.17	because I will punish you.
AMO.5.17	I, the 
AMO.5.18	You look forward to the day
AMO.5.18	when the 
AMO.5.18	But you are in for trouble!
AMO.5.18	It won't be a time of sunshine;
AMO.5.18	all will be darkness.
AMO.5.19	You will run from a lion,
AMO.5.19	only to meet a bear.
AMO.5.19	You will escape to your house,
AMO.5.19	rest your hand on the wall,
AMO.5.19	and be bitten by a snake.
AMO.5.20	The day when the 
AMO.5.20	will be dark, very dark,
AMO.5.20	without a ray of light.
AMO.5.21	your religious celebrations
AMO.5.21	and your times of worship.
AMO.5.22	I won't accept your offerings
AMO.5.22	or animal sacrifices—
AMO.5.22	not even your very best.
AMO.5.23	No more of your noisy songs!
AMO.5.23	I won't listen
AMO.5.23	when you play your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice and fairness
AMO.5.24	flow like a river
AMO.5.24	that never runs dry.
AMO.5.25	you wandered in the desert,
AMO.5.25	without bringing offerings
AMO.5.25	or sacrifices to me.
AMO.5.26	Now you will have to carry
AMO.5.26	the two idols you made—
AMO.5.26	Sakkuth, the one you call king,
AMO.5.26	and Kaiwan, the one you built
AMO.5.26	in the shape of a star.
AMO.5.27	I will force you to march
AMO.5.27	as captives beyond Damascus.
AMO.5.27	I, the 
AMO.5.27	have spoken!
AMO.6.1	Do you rulers in Jerusalem
AMO.6.1	and in the city of Samaria
AMO.6.1	feel safe and at ease?
AMO.6.1	Everyone bows down to you,
AMO.6.1	and you think you are better
AMO.6.1	than any other nation.
AMO.6.1	But you are in for trouble!
AMO.6.2	Look what happened
AMO.6.2	to the cities of Calneh,
AMO.6.2	powerful Hamath,
AMO.6.2	and Gath
AMO.6.2	Are you greater than any
AMO.6.2	of those kingdoms?
AMO.6.3	You are cruel, and you forget
AMO.6.3	the coming day of judgment.
AMO.6.4	You rich people lounge around
AMO.6.4	on beds with ivory posts,
AMO.6.4	while dining on the meat
AMO.6.4	of your lambs and calves.
AMO.6.5	You sing foolish songs
AMO.6.5	to the music of harps,
AMO.6.5	and you make up new tunes,
AMO.6.5	just as David used to do.
AMO.6.6	You drink all the wine you want
AMO.6.6	and wear expensive perfume,
AMO.6.6	but you don't care about
AMO.6.6	the ruin of your nation.
AMO.6.7	So you will be the first
AMO.6.7	to be dragged off as captives;
AMO.6.7	your good times will end.
AMO.6.8	The 
AMO.6.8	has sworn by his own name:
AMO.6.8	“You descendants of Jacob
AMO.6.8	make me angry by your pride,
AMO.6.8	and I hate your fortresses.
AMO.6.8	And so I will surrender your city
AMO.6.8	and possessions
AMO.6.8	to your enemies.”
AMO.6.9	If only ten of you survive
AMO.6.9	by hiding in a house
AMO.6.9	you will still die.
AMO.6.10	As you carry out a corpse
AMO.6.10	to prepare it for burial,
AMO.6.10	your relative in the house
AMO.6.10	will ask, “Are there others?”
AMO.6.10	You will answer, “No!”
AMO.6.10	Then your relative will reply,
AMO.6.10	“Be quiet! Don't dare mention
AMO.6.10	the name of the 
AMO.6.11	At the 
AMO.6.11	houses great and small
AMO.6.11	will be smashed to pieces.
AMO.6.12	Horses can't gallop on rocks;
AMO.6.12	oceans
AMO.6.12	But you have turned justice
AMO.6.12	and fairness
AMO.6.12	into bitter poison.
AMO.6.13	You celebrate the defeat
AMO.6.13	of Lo-Debar and Karnaim,
AMO.6.13	and you boast by saying,
AMO.6.13	“We did it on our own.”
AMO.6.14	But the 
AMO.6.14	will send a nation to attack
AMO.6.14	you people of Israel.
AMO.6.14	They will capture Lebo-Hamath
AMO.6.14	in the north,
AMO.6.14	Arabah Creek
AMO.6.14	and everything in between.
AMO.7.1	The 
AMO.7.2	In my vision the locusts ate every crop in the land, and I said to the 
AMO.7.3	Then the 
AMO.7.4	The 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “Won't you please stop? How can our weak nation survive?”
AMO.7.6	Again the 
AMO.7.7	The 
AMO.7.8	Then he asked, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.7.8	“A measuring line,” I answered.
AMO.7.8	The 
AMO.7.9	Their sacred places will be destroyed, and I will send war against the nation of King Jeroboam.”
AMO.7.10	Amaziah the priest at Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel, “Amos is plotting against you in the very heart of Israel. Our nation cannot put up with his message for very long. 
AMO.7.11	Here is what he is saying:
AMO.7.11	‘Jeroboam will be put to death,
AMO.7.11	and the people will be taken
AMO.7.11	to a foreign country.’ ”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah told me, “Amos, take your visions and get out! Go back to Judah and earn your living there as a prophet. 
AMO.7.13	Don't do any more preaching at Bethel. The king worships here at our national temple.”
AMO.7.14	I answered:
AMO.7.14	I'm not a prophet! And I wasn't trained to be a prophet. I am a shepherd, and I take care of fig trees. 
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	And here you are, telling me not to preach! 
AMO.7.17	Now, listen to what the 
AMO.7.17	Your wife will become
AMO.7.17	a prostitute in the city,
AMO.7.17	your sons and daughters
AMO.7.17	will be killed in war,
AMO.7.17	and your land will be divided
AMO.7.17	among others.
AMO.7.17	You will die in a country
AMO.7.17	of foreigners,
AMO.7.17	and the people of Israel
AMO.7.17	will be dragged
AMO.7.17	from their homeland.
AMO.8.1	The 
AMO.8.2	and asked, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.8.2	“A basket of ripe fruit,” I replied.
AMO.8.2	Then he said,
AMO.8.2	“This is the end
AMO.8.2	for my people Israel.
AMO.8.2	I won't forgive them again.
AMO.8.3	Instead of singing
AMO.8.3	in the temple,
AMO.8.3	they will cry and weep.
AMO.8.3	Dead bodies will be everywhere.
AMO.8.3	So keep silent!
AMO.8.3	I, the 
AMO.8.4	You people crush those in need
AMO.8.4	and wipe out the poor.
AMO.8.5	You say to yourselves,
AMO.8.5	“How much longer before the end
AMO.8.5	of the New Moon Festival?
AMO.8.5	When will the Sabbath
AMO.8.5	Our wheat is ready,
AMO.8.5	and we want to sell it now.
AMO.8.5	We can't wait to cheat
AMO.8.5	and charge high prices
AMO.8.5	for the grain we sell.
AMO.8.5	We will use dishonest scales
AMO.8.6	and mix dust in the grain.
AMO.8.6	Those who are needy and poor
AMO.8.6	don't have any money.
AMO.8.6	We will make them our slaves
AMO.8.6	for the price
AMO.8.6	of a pair of sandals.”
AMO.8.7	I, the 
AMO.8.7	any of this,
AMO.8.7	though you take great pride
AMO.8.7	in your ancestor Jacob.
AMO.8.8	Your country will tremble,
AMO.8.8	and you will mourn.
AMO.8.8	It will be like the Nile River
AMO.8.8	that rises and overflows,
AMO.8.8	then sinks back down.
AMO.8.9	On that day, I, the 
AMO.8.9	will make the sun
AMO.8.9	go down at noon,
AMO.8.9	and I will turn daylight
AMO.8.9	into darkness.
AMO.8.10	Your festivals and joyful singing
AMO.8.10	will turn into sorrow.
AMO.8.10	You will wear sackcloth
AMO.8.10	and shave your heads,
AMO.8.10	as you would at the death
AMO.8.10	of your only son.
AMO.8.10	It will be a horrible day.
AMO.8.11	I, the 
AMO.8.11	a terrible shortage,
AMO.8.11	but not of food and water.
AMO.8.11	You will hunger and thirst
AMO.8.11	to hear my message.
AMO.8.12	You will search everywhere—
AMO.8.12	from north to south,
AMO.8.12	from east to west.
AMO.8.12	You will go all over the earth,
AMO.8.12	seeking a message
AMO.8.12	from me, the 
AMO.8.12	But you won't find one.
AMO.8.13	Your beautiful young women
AMO.8.13	and your young men
AMO.8.13	will faint from thirst.
AMO.8.14	You made promises
AMO.8.14	to the goddess Ashimah
AMO.8.14	at Samaria;
AMO.8.14	you made vows to other gods
AMO.8.14	at the shrines
AMO.8.14	of Dan and Beersheba.
AMO.8.14	So now you will fall
AMO.8.14	and never get up.
AMO.9.1	I saw a vision of the 
AMO.9.1	standing by the temple altar,
AMO.9.1	and he said,
AMO.9.1	“Shake the columns
AMO.9.1	until the tops fall loose,
AMO.9.1	and the doorposts crumble.
AMO.9.1	Then make the pieces fall
AMO.9.1	on the people below.
AMO.9.1	I will take a sword and kill
AMO.9.1	anyone who escapes.
AMO.9.2	“If they dig deep into the earth
AMO.9.2	or climb to the sky,
AMO.9.2	I'll reach out and get them.
AMO.9.3	If they escape to the peaks
AMO.9.3	of Mount Carmel,
AMO.9.3	I'll search and find them.
AMO.9.3	And if they hide from me
AMO.9.3	at the bottom of the ocean,
AMO.9.3	I'll command a sea monster
AMO.9.3	to bite them.
AMO.9.4	I'll send a sword to kill them,
AMO.9.4	wherever their enemies
AMO.9.4	drag them off as captives.
AMO.9.4	I'm determined to hurt them,
AMO.9.4	not to help them.”
AMO.9.5	When the 
AMO.9.5	touches the earth, it melts,
AMO.9.5	and its people mourn.
AMO.9.5	God makes the earth rise
AMO.9.5	and then fall,
AMO.9.5	just like the Nile River.
AMO.9.6	He built his palace in the heavens
AMO.9.6	and let its foundations
AMO.9.6	rest on the earth.
AMO.9.6	He scoops up the ocean
AMO.9.6	and empties it on the earth.
AMO.9.6	His name is the 
AMO.9.7	Israel, I am the 
AMO.9.7	and the Ethiopians
AMO.9.7	are no less important to me
AMO.9.7	than you are.
AMO.9.7	I brought you out of Egypt,
AMO.9.7	but I also brought
AMO.9.7	the Philistines from Crete
AMO.9.7	and the Arameans from Kir.
AMO.9.8	My eyes have seen
AMO.9.8	what a sinful nation you are,
AMO.9.8	and I'll wipe you out.
AMO.9.8	But I will leave a few
AMO.9.8	of Jacob's descendants.
AMO.9.8	I, the 
AMO.9.9	At my command, all of you
AMO.9.9	will be sifted like grain.
AMO.9.9	Israelites who remain faithful
AMO.9.9	will be scattered
AMO.9.9	among the nations.
AMO.9.9	And the others will be trapped
AMO.9.9	like trash in a sifter.
AMO.9.10	Some of you are evil,
AMO.9.10	and you deny
AMO.9.10	that you will ever get caught.
AMO.9.10	But you will be killed.
AMO.9.11	David's fallen kingdom.
AMO.9.11	I will build it from its ruins
AMO.9.11	and set it up again,
AMO.9.11	just as it used to be.
AMO.9.12	Then you will capture Edom
AMO.9.12	and the other nations
AMO.9.12	that are mine.
AMO.9.12	I, the 
AMO.9.12	and my words will come true.
AMO.9.13	You will have such a harvest
AMO.9.13	that you won't be able
AMO.9.13	to bring in all of your wheat
AMO.9.13	before plowing time.
AMO.9.13	You will have grapes left over
AMO.9.13	from season to season;
AMO.9.13	your fruitful vineyards
AMO.9.13	will cover the mountains.
AMO.9.14	I'll make Israel prosper again.
AMO.9.14	You will rebuild your towns
AMO.9.14	and live in them.
AMO.9.14	You will drink wine
AMO.9.14	from your own vineyards
AMO.9.14	and eat the fruit you grow.
AMO.9.15	I'll plant your roots deep
AMO.9.15	in the land I have given you,
AMO.9.15	and you won't ever
AMO.9.15	be uprooted again.
AMO.9.15	I, the 
OBA.1.1	a message
OBA.1.1	and this is what we heard:
OBA.1.1	“I, the 
OBA.1.1	a messenger
OBA.1.1	with orders for the nations
OBA.1.1	to attack Edom.”
OBA.1.2	The 
OBA.1.2	I will make you the weakest
OBA.1.2	and most despised nation.
OBA.1.3	You live in a mountain fortress,
OBA.1.3	because your pride
OBA.1.3	makes you feel safe from attack,
OBA.1.3	but you are mistaken.
OBA.1.4	I will still bring you down,
OBA.1.4	even if you fly higher
OBA.1.4	than an eagle
OBA.1.4	or nest among the stars.
OBA.1.4	I, the 
OBA.1.5	If thieves break in at night,
OBA.1.5	they steal
OBA.1.5	only what they want.
OBA.1.5	And people who harvest grapes
OBA.1.5	always leave some unpicked.
OBA.1.5	But, Edom, you are doomed!
OBA.1.6	Everything you treasure most
OBA.1.6	will be taken from you.
OBA.1.7	Your allies can't be trusted.
OBA.1.7	They will force you out
OBA.1.7	of your own country.
OBA.1.7	And your best friends
OBA.1.7	will trick and trap you,
OBA.1.7	even before you know it.
OBA.1.8	Edom, when this happens,
OBA.1.8	I, the 
OBA.1.8	all your marvelous wisdom.
OBA.1.9	Warriors from the city of Teman
OBA.1.9	will be terrified,
OBA.1.9	and you descendants of Esau
OBA.1.9	will be wiped out.
OBA.1.10	You were cruel to your relatives,
OBA.1.10	the descendants of Jacob.
OBA.1.10	Now you will be destroyed,
OBA.1.10	disgraced forever.
OBA.1.11	You stood there and watched
OBA.1.11	as foreigners entered Jerusalem
OBA.1.11	and took what they wanted.
OBA.1.11	In fact, you were no better
OBA.1.11	than those foreigners.
OBA.1.12	Why did you celebrate
OBA.1.12	when such a dreadful disaster
OBA.1.12	struck your relatives?
OBA.1.12	Why were you so pleased
OBA.1.12	when everyone in Judah
OBA.1.12	was suffering?
OBA.1.13	They are my people,
OBA.1.13	and you were cruel to them.
OBA.1.13	You went through their towns,
OBA.1.13	sneering and stealing
OBA.1.13	whatever was left.
OBA.1.14	In their time of torment,
OBA.1.14	you ambushed refugees
OBA.1.14	and handed them over
OBA.1.14	to their attackers.
OBA.1.15	The day is coming
OBA.1.15	when I, the 
OBA.1.15	will judge the nations.
OBA.1.15	And, Edom, you will pay in full
OBA.1.15	for what you have done.
OBA.1.16	I forced the people of Judah
OBA.1.16	to drink the wine of my anger
OBA.1.16	on my sacred mountain.
OBA.1.16	Soon the neighboring nations
OBA.1.16	must drink their fill—
OBA.1.16	then vanish without a trace.
OBA.1.17	The 
OBA.1.17	will go to Mount Zion,
OBA.1.17	and it will be holy.
OBA.1.17	Then Jacob's descendants
OBA.1.17	will capture the land of those
OBA.1.17	who took their land.
OBA.1.18	Israel
OBA.1.18	and Edom will be straw
OBA.1.18	going up in flames.
OBA.1.18	The 
OBA.1.19	The people of Israel
OBA.1.19	who live in the Southern Desert
OBA.1.19	will take the land of Edom.
OBA.1.19	Those who live in the hills
OBA.1.19	will capture Philistia,
OBA.1.19	Ephraim, and Samaria.
OBA.1.19	And the tribe of Benjamin
OBA.1.19	will conquer Gilead.
OBA.1.20	Those who return from captivity
OBA.1.20	will control Phoenicia
OBA.1.20	as far as Zarephath.
OBA.1.20	Captives from Jerusalem
OBA.1.20	who were taken to Sepharad
OBA.1.20	will capture the towns
OBA.1.20	of the Southern Desert.
OBA.1.21	Those the 
OBA.1.21	will live on Mount Zion
OBA.1.21	and rule over Edom.
OBA.1.21	Then the kingdom will belong
OBA.1.21	to the 
JON.1.2	to go to the great city of Nineveh
JON.1.3	Instead, Jonah ran from the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	The sailors were frightened, and they all started praying to their gods. They even threw the ship's cargo overboard to make the ship lighter.
JON.1.5	All this time, Jonah was down below deck, sound asleep. 
JON.1.6	The ship's captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep at a time like this? Get up and pray to your God! Maybe he will have pity on us and keep us from drowning.”
JON.1.7	Finally, the sailors got together and said, “Let's ask our gods to show us
JON.1.8	They started asking him, “Are you the one who brought all this trouble on us? What business are you in? Where do you come from? What is your country? Who are your people?”
JON.1.9	Jonah answered, “I'm a Hebrew, and I worship the 
JON.1.10	When the sailors heard this, they were frightened, because Jonah had already told them he was running from the 
JON.1.11	The storm kept getting worse, until finally the sailors asked him, “What should we do with you to make the sea calm down?”
JON.1.12	Jonah told them, “Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I'm the cause of this terrible storm.”
JON.1.13	The sailors tried their best to row to the shore. But they could not do it, and the storm kept getting worse every minute. 
JON.1.14	So they prayed to the 
JON.1.15	Then they threw Jonah overboard, and the sea calmed down. 
JON.1.16	The sailors were so terrified that they offered a sacrifice to the 
JON.2.1	From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	When I was in trouble, 
JON.2.2	I prayed to you,
JON.2.2	and you listened to me.
JON.2.2	From deep in the world
JON.2.2	of the dead,
JON.2.2	I begged for your help,
JON.2.2	and you answered my prayer.
JON.2.3	You threw me down
JON.2.3	to the bottom of the sea.
JON.2.3	The water was churning
JON.2.3	all around;
JON.2.3	I was completely covered
JON.2.3	by your mighty waves.
JON.2.4	I thought I was swept away
JON.2.4	from your sight,
JON.2.4	never again to see
JON.2.4	your holy temple.
JON.2.5	I was almost drowned
JON.2.5	by the swirling waters
JON.2.5	that surrounded me.
JON.2.5	Seaweed had wrapped
JON.2.5	around my head.
JON.2.6	I had sunk down deep
JON.2.6	below the mountains
JON.2.6	beneath the sea.
JON.2.6	I knew that forever,
JON.2.6	I would be a prisoner there.
JON.2.6	But, you, 
JON.2.6	rescued me from that pit.
JON.2.7	When my life was slipping away,
JON.2.7	I remembered you—
JON.2.7	and in your holy temple
JON.2.7	you heard my prayer.
JON.2.8	All who worship worthless idols
JON.2.8	turn from the God
JON.2.8	who offers them mercy.
JON.2.9	But with shouts of praise,
JON.2.9	I will offer a sacrifice
JON.2.9	to you, my 
JON.2.9	I will keep my promise,
JON.2.9	because you are the one
JON.2.9	with power to save.
JON.3.1	Once again the 
JON.3.2	to go to that great city of Nineveh and preach his message of doom.
JON.3.3	Jonah obeyed the 
JON.3.4	 After walking for a day, Jonah warned the people, “Forty days from now, Nineveh will be destroyed!”
JON.3.5	They believed God's message and set a time when they would go without eating to show their sorrow. Then everyone in the city, no matter who they were, dressed in sackcloth.
JON.3.6	When the king of Nineveh heard what was happening, he also dressed in sackcloth; he left the royal palace and sat in dust.
JON.3.7+JON.3.8+JON.3.9	Then he and his officials sent out an order for everyone in the city to obey. It said:
JON.3.7+JON.3.8+JON.3.9	None of you or your animals may eat or drink a thing. Each of you must wear sackcloth, and you must even put sackcloth on your animals.
JON.3.7+JON.3.8+JON.3.9	You must also pray to the 
JON.3.10	When God saw that the people had stopped doing evil things, he had pity and did not destroy them as he had planned.
JON.4.1	Jonah was really upset and angry. 
JON.4.2	 So he prayed:
JON.4.2	Our 
JON.4.4	The 
JON.4.5	Jonah then left through the east gate of the city and made a shelter to protect himself from the sun. He sat under the shelter, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh.
JON.4.6	The 
JON.4.7	but early the next morning the 
JON.4.8	During the day the 
JON.4.9	But the 
JON.4.9	“Yes, I do,” he answered, “and I'm angry enough to die.”
JON.4.10	But the 
JON.4.10	You are concerned about a vine that you did not plant or take care of, a vine that grew up in one night and died the next. 
JON.4.11	In that city of Nineveh there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell right from wrong, and many cattle are also there. Don't you think I should be concerned about that big city?
MIC.1.2	Listen, all of you!
MIC.1.2	Earth and everything on it,
MIC.1.2	pay close attention.
MIC.1.2	The 
MIC.1.2	from his holy temple.
MIC.1.3	And he will come down
MIC.1.3	to crush underfoot
MIC.1.3	every pagan altar.
MIC.1.4	Mountains will melt
MIC.1.4	beneath his feet
MIC.1.4	like wax beside a fire.
MIC.1.4	Valleys will vanish like water
MIC.1.4	rushing down a ravine.
MIC.1.5	This will happen because of
MIC.1.5	the terrible sins of Israel,
MIC.1.5	the descendants of Jacob.
MIC.1.5	Samaria has led Israel to sin,
MIC.1.5	and pagan altars at Jerusalem
MIC.1.5	have made Judah sin.
MIC.1.6	So the 
MIC.1.6	in ruins—
MIC.1.6	merely an empty field
MIC.1.6	where vineyards are planted.
MIC.1.6	He will scatter its stones
MIC.1.6	and destroy its foundations.
MIC.1.7	Samaria's idols will be smashed,
MIC.1.7	and the wages
MIC.1.7	of temple prostitutes
MIC.1.7	will be destroyed by fire.
MIC.1.7	Silver and gold from those idols
MIC.1.7	will then be used by foreigners
MIC.1.7	as payment for prostitutes.
MIC.1.8	Because of this tragedy,
MIC.1.8	I go barefoot and naked.
MIC.1.8	My crying and weeping
MIC.1.8	sound like howling wolves
MIC.1.8	or ostriches.
MIC.1.9	The nation is fatally wounded.
MIC.1.9	Judah is doomed.
MIC.1.9	Jerusalem will fall.
MIC.1.10	Don't tell it in Gath!
MIC.1.10	Don't even cry.
MIC.1.10	Instead, roll in the dust
MIC.1.10	at Beth-Leaphrah.
MIC.1.11	Depart naked and ashamed,
MIC.1.11	you people of Shaphir.
MIC.1.11	The town of Bethezel
MIC.1.11	because no one from Zaanan
MIC.1.11	went out to help.
MIC.1.12	Everyone in Maroth
MIC.1.12	hoped for the best,
MIC.1.12	but the 
MIC.1.12	down on Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	Get the war chariots ready,
MIC.1.13	you people of Lachish.
MIC.1.13	You led Jerusalem into sin,
MIC.1.13	just as Israel did.
MIC.1.14	Now you will have to give
MIC.1.14	a going-away gift
MIC.1.14	to Moresheth.
MIC.1.14	Israel's kings will discover
MIC.1.14	that they cannot trust
MIC.1.14	the town of Achzib.
MIC.1.15	People of Mareshah,
MIC.1.15	the 
MIC.1.15	to capture your town.
MIC.1.15	Then Israel's glorious king
MIC.1.15	will be forced to hide
MIC.1.15	in Adullam Cave.
MIC.1.16	Judah, shave your head
MIC.1.16	as bald as a vulture
MIC.1.16	and start mourning.
MIC.1.16	Your precious children
MIC.1.16	will be dragged off
MIC.1.16	to a foreign country.
MIC.2.1	Doomed! You're doomed!
MIC.2.1	At night you lie in bed,
MIC.2.1	making evil plans.
MIC.2.1	And when morning comes,
MIC.2.1	you do what you've planned
MIC.2.1	because you have the power.
MIC.2.2	You grab any field or house
MIC.2.2	that you want;
MIC.2.2	you cheat families
MIC.2.2	out of homes and land.
MIC.2.3	But here is what the 
MIC.2.3	“I am planning trouble for you.
MIC.2.3	Your necks will be caught
MIC.2.3	in a noose,
MIC.2.3	and you will be disgraced
MIC.2.3	in this time of disaster.”
MIC.2.4	When that happens,
MIC.2.4	this sorrowful song
MIC.2.4	will be sung about you:
MIC.2.4	“Ruined! Completely ruined!
MIC.2.4	The 
MIC.2.4	and given it to traitors.”
MIC.2.5	And so you will never again
MIC.2.5	own property
MIC.2.5	among the 
MIC.2.6	“Enough of your preaching!”
MIC.2.6	That's what you tell me.
MIC.2.6	“We won't be disgraced,
MIC.2.6	so stop preaching!”
MIC.2.7	Descendants of Jacob,
MIC.2.7	is it right for you to claim
MIC.2.7	that the 
MIC.2.7	because he was angry?
MIC.2.7	Doesn't he always bless
MIC.2.7	those who do right?
MIC.2.8	My people, you have turned against
MIC.2.8	one another!
MIC.2.8	You have even stolen
MIC.2.8	clothes right off the backs
MIC.2.8	of innocent neighbors
MIC.2.8	who pass by in peace.
MIC.2.9	You take over lovely homes
MIC.2.9	that belong to the women
MIC.2.9	of my nation.
MIC.2.9	Then you cheat their children
MIC.2.9	out of the inheritance
MIC.2.9	that comes from the 
MIC.2.10	Get out of here, you crooks!
MIC.2.10	You'll find no rest here.
MIC.2.10	You're not fit to belong
MIC.2.10	to the 
MIC.2.10	and you will be destroyed.
MIC.2.11	The only prophet you want
MIC.2.11	is a liar who will say,
MIC.2.11	“Drink and get drunk!”
MIC.2.12	I, the 
MIC.2.12	to bring together
MIC.2.12	the people of Israel
MIC.2.12	who have survived.
MIC.2.12	I will gather them,
MIC.2.12	just as a shepherd
MIC.2.12	brings sheep together,
MIC.2.12	and there will be many.
MIC.2.13	I will break down the gate
MIC.2.13	and lead them out—
MIC.2.13	then I will be their king.
MIC.3.1	Listen to me,
MIC.3.1	you rulers of Israel!
MIC.3.1	You know right from wrong,
MIC.3.2	but you prefer to do evil
MIC.3.2	instead of what is right.
MIC.3.2	You skin my people alive.
MIC.3.2	You strip off their flesh,
MIC.3.3	break their bones,
MIC.3.3	cook it all in a pot,
MIC.3.3	and gulp it down.
MIC.3.4	Someday you will beg the 
MIC.3.4	to help you,
MIC.3.4	but he will turn away
MIC.3.4	because of your sins.
MIC.3.5	You lying prophets promise
MIC.3.5	security for anyone
MIC.3.5	who gives you food,
MIC.3.5	but disaster for anyone
MIC.3.5	who refuses to feed you.
MIC.3.5	Here is what the 
MIC.3.5	to you prophets:
MIC.3.6	“You will live in the dark,
MIC.3.6	far from the sight of the sun,
MIC.3.6	with no message from me.
MIC.3.7	You prophets and fortunetellers
MIC.3.7	will all be disgraced,
MIC.3.7	with no message from me.”
MIC.3.8	But the 
MIC.3.8	with power and his Spirit.
MIC.3.8	I have been given the courage
MIC.3.8	to speak about justice
MIC.3.8	and to tell you people of Israel
MIC.3.8	that you have sinned.
MIC.3.9	So listen to my message,
MIC.3.9	you rulers of Israel!
MIC.3.9	You hate justice
MIC.3.9	and twist the truth.
MIC.3.10	You make cruelty and murder
MIC.3.10	a way of life in Jerusalem.
MIC.3.11	You leaders accept bribes
MIC.3.11	for dishonest decisions.
MIC.3.11	You priests and prophets
MIC.3.11	teach and preach,
MIC.3.11	but only for money.
MIC.3.11	Then you say,
MIC.3.11	“The 
MIC.3.11	No harm will come to us.”
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will be plowed under
MIC.3.12	and left in ruins.
MIC.3.12	Thorns will cover the mountain
MIC.3.12	where the temple now stands.
MIC.4.1	In the future, the mountain
MIC.4.1	with the 
MIC.4.1	will be the highest of all.
MIC.4.1	It will reach above the hills,
MIC.4.1	and every nation
MIC.4.1	will rush to it.
MIC.4.2	People of many nations
MIC.4.2	will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Let's go up to the mountain
MIC.4.2	of the 
MIC.4.2	and worship in his temple.”
MIC.4.2	The 
MIC.4.2	from Jerusalem,
MIC.4.2	and we will obey him.
MIC.4.3	between distant
MIC.4.3	and powerful nations.
MIC.4.3	They will pound their swords
MIC.4.3	and their spears
MIC.4.3	into rakes and shovels;
MIC.4.3	they will never again make war
MIC.4.3	or attack one another.
MIC.4.4	beneath their own fig trees
MIC.4.4	or grape vines,
MIC.4.4	and they will live in peace.
MIC.4.4	This is a solemn promise
MIC.4.4	of the 
MIC.4.5	Others may follow their gods,
MIC.4.5	but we will always follow
MIC.4.5	the 
MIC.4.6	The 
MIC.4.6	At that time
MIC.4.6	I will gather my people—
MIC.4.6	the lame and the outcasts,
MIC.4.6	and all others into whose lives
MIC.4.6	I have brought sorrow.
MIC.4.7	Then the lame and the outcasts
MIC.4.7	will belong to my people
MIC.4.7	and become a strong nation.
MIC.4.7	I, the 
MIC.4.7	from Mount Zion forever.
MIC.4.8	Mount Zion in Jerusalem,
MIC.4.8	guardian of my people,
MIC.4.8	you will rule again.
MIC.4.9	Jerusalem, why are you crying?
MIC.4.9	Don't you have a king?
MIC.4.9	Have your advisors gone?
MIC.4.9	Are you suffering
MIC.4.9	like a woman in childbirth?
MIC.4.10	Keep on groaning with pain,
MIC.4.10	you people of Jerusalem!
MIC.4.10	If you escape from your city
MIC.4.10	to the countryside,
MIC.4.10	you will still be taken
MIC.4.10	as prisoners to Babylonia.
MIC.4.10	But later I will rescue you
MIC.4.10	from your enemies.
MIC.4.11	Zion, because of your sins
MIC.4.11	you are surrounded
MIC.4.11	by many nations who say,
MIC.4.11	“We can hardly wait
MIC.4.11	to see you disgraced.”
MIC.4.12	But they don't know
MIC.4.12	that I, the 
MIC.4.12	have gathered them here
MIC.4.12	to grind them like grain.
MIC.4.13	Smash them to pieces, Zion!
MIC.4.13	I'll let you be like a bull
MIC.4.13	with iron horns
MIC.4.13	and bronze hoofs.
MIC.4.13	Crush those nations
MIC.4.13	and bring their wealth to me,
MIC.4.13	the 
MIC.5.1	Jerusalem, enemy troops
MIC.5.1	have surrounded you;
MIC.5.1	they have struck Israel's ruler
MIC.5.1	in the face with a stick.
MIC.5.2	you are one of the smallest towns
MIC.5.2	in the nation of Judah.
MIC.5.2	But the 
MIC.5.2	one of your people
MIC.5.2	to rule the nation—
MIC.5.2	someone whose family
MIC.5.2	goes back to ancient times.
MIC.5.3	The 
MIC.5.3	only until this ruler is born,
MIC.5.3	and the rest of his family
MIC.5.3	returns to Israel.
MIC.5.4	Like a shepherd
MIC.5.4	taking care of his sheep,
MIC.5.4	this ruler will lead
MIC.5.4	and care for his people
MIC.5.4	by the power and glorious name
MIC.5.4	of the 
MIC.5.4	His people will live securely,
MIC.5.4	and the whole earth will know
MIC.5.4	his true greatness,
MIC.5.5	because he will bring peace.
MIC.5.5	Let Assyria attack our country
MIC.5.5	and our palaces.
MIC.5.5	We will counterattack,
MIC.5.5	led by a number of rulers
MIC.5.6	the nation of Assyria.
MIC.5.6	Yes, our leaders will rescue us,
MIC.5.6	if those Assyrians
MIC.5.6	dare to invade our land.
MIC.5.7	A few of Jacob's descendants
MIC.5.7	survived and are scattered
MIC.5.7	among the nations.
MIC.5.7	But the 
MIC.5.7	cover the earth like dew and rain
MIC.5.7	that refreshes the soil.
MIC.5.8	At present they are scattered,
MIC.5.8	but later they will attack,
MIC.5.8	as though they were fierce lions
MIC.5.8	pouncing on sheep.
MIC.5.8	Their enemies will be torn
MIC.5.8	to shreds,
MIC.5.8	with no one to save them;
MIC.5.9	they will be helpless,
MIC.5.9	completely destroyed.
MIC.5.10	The 
MIC.5.10	At that time I will wipe out
MIC.5.10	your cavalry and chariots,
MIC.5.11	as well as your cities
MIC.5.11	and your fortresses.
MIC.5.12	I will stop you
MIC.5.12	from telling fortunes
MIC.5.12	and practicing witchcraft.
MIC.5.13	You will no longer worship
MIC.5.13	the idols or stone images
MIC.5.13	you have made—
MIC.5.13	I will destroy them,
MIC.5.14	together with the sacred poles
MIC.5.14	and even your towns.
MIC.5.15	I will become furious
MIC.5.15	and take revenge on the nations
MIC.5.15	that refuse to obey me.
MIC.6.1	The 
MIC.6.1	Come and present your case
MIC.6.1	to the hills and mountains.
MIC.6.2	Israel, I am bringing charges
MIC.6.2	against you—
MIC.6.2	I call upon the mountains
MIC.6.2	and the earth's firm foundation
MIC.6.2	to be my witnesses.
MIC.6.3	My people, have I wronged you
MIC.6.3	in any way at all?
MIC.6.3	Please tell me.
MIC.6.4	where you were slaves.
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam
MIC.6.4	to be your leaders.
MIC.6.5	of King Balak of Moab
MIC.6.5	or what Balaam son of Beor
MIC.6.5	said to him.
MIC.6.5	Remember how I, the 
MIC.6.5	saved you many times
MIC.6.5	on your way from Acacia
MIC.6.5	to Gilgal.
MIC.6.6	What offering should I bring
MIC.6.6	when I bow down to worship
MIC.6.6	the 
MIC.6.6	Should I try to please him
MIC.6.6	by sacrificing
MIC.6.6	calves a year old?
MIC.6.7	Will thousands of sheep
MIC.6.7	or rivers of olive oil
MIC.6.7	make God satisfied with me?
MIC.6.7	Should I sacrifice to the 
MIC.6.7	my first-born child as payment
MIC.6.7	for my terrible sins?
MIC.6.8	The 
MIC.6.8	what is right
MIC.6.8	and what he demands:
MIC.6.8	“See that justice is done,
MIC.6.8	let mercy be your first concern,
MIC.6.8	and humbly obey your God.”
MIC.6.9	I am the 
MIC.6.9	and you are wise to respect
MIC.6.9	my power to punish.
MIC.6.9	So listen to my message
MIC.6.9	for the city of Jerusalem:
MIC.6.10	You store up stolen treasures
MIC.6.10	and use dishonest scales.
MIC.6.11	But I, the 
MIC.6.11	for cheating with weights
MIC.6.11	and with measures.
MIC.6.12	You rich people are violent,
MIC.6.12	and everyone tells lies.
MIC.6.13	Because of your sins,
MIC.6.13	I will wound you and leave you
MIC.6.13	ruined and defenseless.
MIC.6.14	You will eat,
MIC.6.14	but still be hungry;
MIC.6.14	you will store up goods,
MIC.6.14	but lose everything—
MIC.6.14	I, the 
MIC.6.14	be captured in war.
MIC.6.15	You won't harvest what you plant
MIC.6.15	or use the oil
MIC.6.15	from your olive trees
MIC.6.15	or drink the wine
MIC.6.15	from grapes you grow.
MIC.6.16	because you followed
MIC.6.16	the sinful example
MIC.6.16	of kings Omri and Ahab.
MIC.6.16	Now I will destroy you
MIC.6.16	and your property.
MIC.6.16	Then the people of every nation
MIC.6.16	will make fun and insult you.
MIC.7.1	I feel so empty inside—
MIC.7.1	like someone starving
MIC.7.1	for grapes or figs,
MIC.7.1	after the vines and trees
MIC.7.1	have all been picked clean.
MIC.7.2	No one is loyal to God;
MIC.7.2	no one does right.
MIC.7.2	Everyone is brutal
MIC.7.2	and eager to deceive
MIC.7.2	everyone else.
MIC.7.3	People cooperate to commit crime.
MIC.7.3	Judges and leaders demand bribes,
MIC.7.3	and rulers cheat in court.
MIC.7.4	The most honest of them
MIC.7.4	is worse than a thorn patch.
MIC.7.4	Your doom has come!
MIC.7.4	Lookouts sound the warning,
MIC.7.4	and everyone panics.
MIC.7.5	Don't trust anyone,
MIC.7.5	not even your best friend,
MIC.7.5	and be careful what you say
MIC.7.5	to the one you love.
MIC.7.6	their own fathers,
MIC.7.6	daughters rebel against
MIC.7.6	their own mothers,
MIC.7.6	and daughters-in-law despise
MIC.7.6	their mothers-in-law.
MIC.7.6	Your family is now your enemy.
MIC.7.7	But I trust the 
MIC.7.7	to save me,
MIC.7.7	and I will wait for him
MIC.7.7	to answer my prayer.
MIC.7.8	My enemies, don't be glad
MIC.7.8	because of my troubles!
MIC.7.8	I may have fallen,
MIC.7.8	but I will get up;
MIC.7.8	I may be sitting in the dark,
MIC.7.8	but the 
MIC.7.9	I have sinned against the 
MIC.7.9	And so I must endure his anger,
MIC.7.9	until he comes to my defense.
MIC.7.9	But I know that I will see him
MIC.7.9	making things right for me
MIC.7.9	and leading me to the light.
MIC.7.10	You, my enemies, said,
MIC.7.10	“The 
MIC.7.10	Now each of you
MIC.7.10	will be disgraced
MIC.7.10	and put to shame.
MIC.7.10	I will see you trampled
MIC.7.10	like mud in the street.
MIC.7.11	Towns of Judah, the day is coming
MIC.7.11	when your walls will be rebuilt,
MIC.7.11	and your boundaries enlarged.
MIC.7.12	People will flock to you
MIC.7.12	from Assyria and Egypt,
MIC.7.12	from Babylonia
MIC.7.12	and everywhere else.
MIC.7.13	Those nations will suffer disaster
MIC.7.13	because of what they did.
MIC.7.14	Lead your people, 
MIC.7.14	Come and be our shepherd.
MIC.7.14	Grasslands surround us,
MIC.7.14	but we live in a forest.
MIC.7.14	So lead us to Bashan and Gilead,
MIC.7.14	and let us find pasture
MIC.7.14	as we did long ago.
MIC.7.15	I, the 
MIC.7.15	just as I did when I led you
MIC.7.15	out of Egypt.
MIC.7.16	Nations will see this
MIC.7.16	and be ashamed because
MIC.7.16	of their helpless armies.
MIC.7.16	They will be in shock,
MIC.7.16	unable to speak or hear,
MIC.7.17	because of their fear of me,
MIC.7.17	your 
MIC.7.17	Then they will come trembling,
MIC.7.17	crawling out of their fortresses
MIC.7.17	like insects or snakes,
MIC.7.17	lapping up the dust.
MIC.7.18	Our God, no one is like you.
MIC.7.18	We are all that is left
MIC.7.18	of your chosen people,
MIC.7.18	and you freely forgive
MIC.7.18	our sin and guilt.
MIC.7.18	You don't stay angry forever;
MIC.7.18	you're glad to have pity
MIC.7.19	and pleased to be merciful.
MIC.7.19	You will trample on our sins
MIC.7.19	and throw them in the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will keep your word
MIC.7.20	and be faithful to Jacob
MIC.7.20	and to Abraham,
MIC.7.20	as you promised our ancestors
MIC.7.20	many years ago.
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.2	In his anger, he takes revenge
NAM.1.2	on his enemies.
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.3	yet patient;
NAM.1.3	he makes sure that the guilty
NAM.1.3	are always punished.
NAM.1.3	He can be seen in storms
NAM.1.3	and in whirlwinds;
NAM.1.3	clouds are the dust from his feet.
NAM.1.4	At the 
NAM.1.4	oceans and rivers dry up.
NAM.1.4	Bashan, Mount Carmel,
NAM.1.4	and Lebanon
NAM.1.4	and their flowers fade.
NAM.1.5	At the sight of the 
NAM.1.5	mountains and hills
NAM.1.5	tremble and melt;
NAM.1.5	the earth and its people
NAM.1.5	shudder and shake.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand the heat
NAM.1.6	of his furious anger?
NAM.1.6	It flashes out like fire
NAM.1.6	and shatters stones.
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.7	He protects those who trust him
NAM.1.7	in times of trouble.
NAM.1.8	But like a roaring flood,
NAM.1.8	the 
NAM.1.8	into dark places
NAM.1.8	and destroys them.
NAM.1.9	So don't plot against the 
NAM.1.9	He wipes out his enemies,
NAM.1.9	and they never revive.
NAM.1.10	They are like drunkards
NAM.1.10	overcome by wine,
NAM.1.10	or like twisted thornbushes
NAM.1.10	burning in a fire.
NAM.1.11	Assyria, one of your rulers
NAM.1.11	has made evil plans
NAM.1.11	against the 
NAM.1.12	But the 
NAM.1.12	no matter how strong you are,
NAM.1.12	you will be cut down!
NAM.1.12	My people Judah,
NAM.1.12	I have troubled you before,
NAM.1.12	but I won't do it again.
NAM.1.13	I'll snap your chains
NAM.1.13	and set you free
NAM.1.13	from the Assyrians.”
NAM.1.14	Assyria, this is what else
NAM.1.14	the 
NAM.1.14	“Your name will be forgotten.
NAM.1.14	I will destroy every idol
NAM.1.14	in your temple,
NAM.1.14	and I will send you to the grave,
NAM.1.14	because you are worthless.”
NAM.1.15	people of Judah!
NAM.1.15	Here comes a messenger
NAM.1.15	with good news of peace.
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your festivals.
NAM.1.15	Keep your promises to God.
NAM.1.15	Your evil enemies are destroyed
NAM.1.15	and will never again
NAM.1.15	invade your country.
NAM.2.1	Nineveh, someone is coming
NAM.2.1	to attack and scatter you.
NAM.2.1	Guard your fortresses!
NAM.2.1	Watch the road! Be brave!
NAM.2.1	Prepare for battle!
NAM.2.2	Judah and Israel are like trees
NAM.2.2	with branches broken
NAM.2.2	by their enemies.
NAM.2.2	But the 
NAM.2.2	their power and glory.
NAM.2.2	* 
NAM.2.3	Nineveh, on this day of attack,
NAM.2.3	your enemies' shields are red;
NAM.2.3	their uniforms are crimson.
NAM.2.4	Their horses
NAM.2.4	and their armored
NAM.2.4	dart around like lightning
NAM.2.4	or flaming torches.
NAM.2.5	An officer gives a command.
NAM.2.5	But his soldiers stumble,
NAM.2.5	as they hasten to build
NAM.2.5	a shelter to protect themselves
NAM.2.5	against rocks thrown down
NAM.2.5	from the city wall.
NAM.2.6	The river gates
NAM.2.6	and panic floods the palace.
NAM.2.7	Nineveh is disgraced.
NAM.2.7	The queen is dragged off.
NAM.2.7	Her servant women mourn;
NAM.2.7	they moan like doves,
NAM.2.7	and they beat their breasts
NAM.2.7	in sorrow.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pond
NAM.2.8	with leaking water.
NAM.2.8	Shouts of “Stop! Don't go!”
NAM.2.8	can be heard everywhere.
NAM.2.8	But everyone is leaving.
NAM.2.9	Enemy soldiers shout,
NAM.2.9	“The city is full of treasure
NAM.2.9	and all kinds of wealth.
NAM.2.9	Steal her silver! Grab her gold!”
NAM.2.10	Nineveh is doomed! Destroyed!
NAM.2.10	Her people tremble with fear;
NAM.2.10	their faces turn pale.
NAM.2.11	What happened to this city?
NAM.2.11	They were safer there
NAM.2.11	than powerful lions in a den,
NAM.2.11	with no one to disturb them.
NAM.2.12	These are the same lions
NAM.2.12	that ferociously attacked
NAM.2.12	their victims,
NAM.2.12	then dragged away the flesh
NAM.2.12	to feed their young.
NAM.2.13	The 
NAM.2.13	is against you, Nineveh.
NAM.2.13	God will burn your chariots
NAM.2.13	and send an army to kill
NAM.2.13	those young lions of yours.
NAM.2.13	You will never again
NAM.2.13	make victims of others
NAM.2.13	or send messengers to threaten
NAM.2.13	everyone on this earth.
NAM.3.1	Doom to the crime capital!
NAM.3.1	Nineveh, city of murder
NAM.3.1	and treachery,
NAM.3.2	here is your fate—
NAM.3.2	cracking whips,
NAM.3.2	churning wheels;
NAM.3.2	galloping horses,
NAM.3.2	roaring chariots;
NAM.3.3	cavalry attacking,
NAM.3.3	swords and spears flashing;
NAM.3.3	soldiers stumbling
NAM.3.3	over piles of dead bodies.
NAM.3.4	You were nothing more
NAM.3.4	than a prostitute
NAM.3.4	using your magical charms
NAM.3.4	and witchcraft
NAM.3.4	to attract and trap nations.
NAM.3.5	But I, the 
NAM.3.5	am now your enemy.
NAM.3.5	I will pull up your skirt
NAM.3.5	and let nations and kingdoms
NAM.3.5	stare at your nakedness.
NAM.3.6	I will cover you with garbage,
NAM.3.6	treat you like trash,
NAM.3.6	and rub you in the dirt.
NAM.3.7	Everyone who sees you
NAM.3.7	will turn away and shout,
NAM.3.7	“Nineveh is done for!
NAM.3.7	Is anyone willing to mourn
NAM.3.7	or to give her comfort?”
NAM.3.8	Nineveh, do you feel safer
NAM.3.8	than the city of Thebes?
NAM.3.8	The Nile River
NAM.3.8	was its wall of defense.
NAM.3.9	Thebes trusted the mighty power
NAM.3.9	of Ethiopia
NAM.3.9	the nations of Put
NAM.3.9	were her allies.
NAM.3.10	But she was captured and taken
NAM.3.10	to a foreign country.
NAM.3.10	Her children were murdered
NAM.3.10	at every street corner.
NAM.3.10	The members of her royal family
NAM.3.10	were auctioned off,
NAM.3.10	and her high officials
NAM.3.10	were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	Nineveh, now it's your turn!
NAM.3.11	You will get drunk and try to hide
NAM.3.11	from your enemy.
NAM.3.12	Your fortresses are fig trees
NAM.3.12	with ripe figs.
NAM.3.12	Merely shake the trees,
NAM.3.12	and fruit will fall
NAM.3.12	into every open mouth.
NAM.3.13	Your army is weak.
NAM.3.13	Fire has destroyed the crossbars
NAM.3.13	on your city gates;
NAM.3.13	now they stand wide open
NAM.3.13	to your enemy.
NAM.3.14	Your city is under attack.
NAM.3.14	Haul in extra water!
NAM.3.14	Strengthen your defenses!
NAM.3.14	Start making bricks!
NAM.3.14	Stir the mortar!
NAM.3.15	You will still go up in flames
NAM.3.15	and be cut down by swords
NAM.3.15	that will wipe you out like a field
NAM.3.15	attacked by grasshoppers.
NAM.3.15	So, go ahead and increase
NAM.3.15	like a swarm of locusts!
NAM.3.16	More merchants are in your city
NAM.3.16	than there are stars
NAM.3.16	in the sky—
NAM.3.16	but they are like locusts
NAM.3.16	that eat everything,
NAM.3.16	then fly away.
NAM.3.17	Your guards and your officials
NAM.3.17	are swarms of locusts.
NAM.3.17	On a chilly day
NAM.3.17	they settle on a fence,
NAM.3.17	but when the sun comes out,
NAM.3.17	they take off
NAM.3.17	to who-knows-where.
NAM.3.18	King of Assyria,
NAM.3.18	your officials and leaders
NAM.3.18	are sound asleep,
NAM.3.18	while your people are scattered
NAM.3.18	in the mountains.
NAM.3.18	Yes, your people are sheep
NAM.3.18	without a shepherd.
NAM.3.19	You're fatally wounded.
NAM.3.19	There's no hope for you.
NAM.3.19	But everyone claps
NAM.3.19	when they hear this news,
NAM.3.19	because your constant cruelty
NAM.3.19	has caused them pain.
HAB.1.1	I am Habakkuk the prophet. And this is the message
HAB.1.2	Our 
HAB.1.2	for your help
HAB.1.2	before you listen?
HAB.1.2	How long before you save us
HAB.1.2	from all this violence?
HAB.1.3	Why do you make me watch
HAB.1.3	such terrible injustice?
HAB.1.3	Why do you allow violence,
HAB.1.3	lawlessness, crime, and cruelty
HAB.1.3	to spread everywhere?
HAB.1.4	Laws cannot be enforced;
HAB.1.4	justice is always the loser;
HAB.1.4	criminals crowd out honest people
HAB.1.4	and twist the laws around.
HAB.1.5	at what's happening
HAB.1.5	among the nations!
HAB.1.5	Even if you were told,
HAB.1.5	you would never believe
HAB.1.5	what's taking place now.
HAB.1.6	They are fierce and cruel—
HAB.1.6	marching across the land,
HAB.1.6	conquering cities and towns.
HAB.1.7	How fearsome and frightening.
HAB.1.7	Their only laws and rules
HAB.1.7	are the ones they make up.
HAB.1.8	Their cavalry troops are faster
HAB.1.8	than leopards,
HAB.1.8	more ferocious than wolves
HAB.1.8	hunting at sunset,
HAB.1.8	and swifter than hungry eagles
HAB.1.8	suddenly swooping down.
HAB.1.9	They are eager to destroy,
HAB.1.9	and they gather captives
HAB.1.9	like handfuls of sand.
HAB.1.10	They make fun of rulers
HAB.1.10	and laugh at fortresses,
HAB.1.10	while building dirt mounds
HAB.1.10	so they can capture cities.
HAB.1.11	Then suddenly they disappear
HAB.1.11	like a gust of wind—
HAB.1.11	those sinful people who worship
HAB.1.11	their own strength.
HAB.1.12	Holy 
HAB.1.12	you are eternal,
HAB.1.12	and we
HAB.1.12	You are using those Babylonians
HAB.1.12	to judge and punish others.
HAB.1.13	But you can't stand sin or wrong.
HAB.1.13	So don't sit by in silence
HAB.1.13	while they gobble up people
HAB.1.13	who are better than they are.
HAB.1.14	The people you put on this earth
HAB.1.14	are like fish or reptiles
HAB.1.14	without a leader.
HAB.1.15	Then an enemy comes along
HAB.1.15	and takes them captive
HAB.1.15	with hooks and nets.
HAB.1.15	It makes him so happy
HAB.1.16	that he offers sacrifices
HAB.1.16	to his fishing nets,
HAB.1.16	because they make him rich
HAB.1.16	and provide choice foods.
HAB.1.17	Will he keep hauling in his nets
HAB.1.17	and destroying nations
HAB.1.17	without showing mercy?
HAB.2.1	While standing guard
HAB.2.1	on the watchtower,
HAB.2.1	I waited for the 
HAB.2.1	before explaining the reason
HAB.2.1	for my complaint.
HAB.2.2	Then the 
HAB.2.2	“I will give you my message
HAB.2.2	in the form of a vision.
HAB.2.2	Write it clearly enough
HAB.2.2	to be read at a glance.
HAB.2.3	my words will come true.
HAB.2.3	You can trust what I say
HAB.2.3	about the future.
HAB.2.3	It may take a long time,
HAB.2.3	but keep on waiting—
HAB.2.3	it will happen!
HAB.2.4	anyone who is proud.
HAB.2.4	Only those who live by faith
HAB.2.4	are acceptable to me.”
HAB.2.5	Wine
HAB.2.5	and arrogant people
HAB.2.5	are never satisfied.
HAB.2.5	They are no less greedy
HAB.2.5	than death itself—
HAB.2.5	they open their mouths as wide
HAB.2.5	as the world of the dead
HAB.2.5	and swallow everyone.
HAB.2.6	But they will be mocked
HAB.2.6	with these words:
HAB.2.6	You're doomed!
HAB.2.6	You stored up stolen goods
HAB.2.6	and cheated others
HAB.2.6	of what belonged to them.
HAB.2.7	But without warning,
HAB.2.7	those you owe
HAB.2.7	will demand payment.
HAB.2.7	Then you will become
HAB.2.7	a frightened victim.
HAB.2.8	You robbed cities and nations
HAB.2.8	everywhere on earth
HAB.2.8	and murdered their people.
HAB.2.8	Now those who survived
HAB.2.8	will be as cruel to you.
HAB.2.9	You're doomed!
HAB.2.9	You made your family rich
HAB.2.9	at the expense of others.
HAB.2.9	You even said to yourself,
HAB.2.9	“I'm above the law.”
HAB.2.10	But you will bring shame
HAB.2.10	on your family
HAB.2.10	and ruin to yourself
HAB.2.10	for what you did to others.
HAB.2.11	The very stones and wood
HAB.2.11	in your home
HAB.2.11	will testify against you.
HAB.2.12	You're doomed! You built a city
HAB.2.12	on crime and violence.
HAB.2.13	sends up in flames
HAB.2.13	what nations and people
HAB.2.13	work so hard to gain.
HAB.2.14	the land will be filled
HAB.2.14	with people who know
HAB.2.14	and honor the 
HAB.2.15	You're doomed!
HAB.2.15	You get your friends drunk,
HAB.2.15	just to see them naked.
HAB.2.16	Now you will be disgraced
HAB.2.16	instead of praised.
HAB.2.16	The 
HAB.2.16	and when others see you naked,
HAB.2.16	you will lose their respect.
HAB.2.17	You destroyed trees and animals
HAB.2.17	on Mount Lebanon;
HAB.2.17	you were ruthless to towns
HAB.2.17	and people everywhere.
HAB.2.17	Now you will be terrorized.
HAB.2.18	What is an idol worth?
HAB.2.18	It's merely a false god.
HAB.2.18	Why trust a speechless image
HAB.2.18	made from wood or metal
HAB.2.18	by human hands?
HAB.2.19	What can you learn from idols
HAB.2.19	covered with silver or gold?
HAB.2.19	They can't even breathe.
HAB.2.19	Pity anyone who says to an idol
HAB.2.19	of wood or stone,
HAB.2.19	“Get up and do something!”
HAB.2.20	Let all the world be silent—
HAB.2.20	the 
HAB.2.20	in his holy temple.
HAB.3.1	This is my prayer:
HAB.3.2	I know your reputation, 
HAB.3.2	and I am amazed
HAB.3.2	at what you have done.
HAB.3.2	Please turn from your anger
HAB.3.2	and be merciful;
HAB.3.2	do for us what you did
HAB.3.2	for our ancestors.
HAB.3.3	You are the same Holy God
HAB.3.3	who came from Teman
HAB.3.3	and Paran
HAB.3.3	The brightness of your glory
HAB.3.3	covered the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and your praises were heard
HAB.3.3	everywhere on earth.
HAB.3.4	Your glory shone like the sun,
HAB.3.4	and light flashed from your hands,
HAB.3.4	hiding your mighty power.
HAB.3.5	Dreadful diseases and plagues
HAB.3.5	marched in front
HAB.3.5	and followed behind.
HAB.3.6	When you stopped,
HAB.3.6	the earth shook;
HAB.3.6	when you stared,
HAB.3.6	nations trembled;
HAB.3.6	when you walked
HAB.3.6	along your ancient paths,
HAB.3.6	eternal mountains and hills
HAB.3.6	crumbled and collapsed.
HAB.3.7	The tents of desert tribes
HAB.3.7	in Cushan and Midian
HAB.3.7	were ripped apart.
HAB.3.8	Our 
HAB.3.8	with the monsters
HAB.3.8	of the deep?
HAB.3.8	You attacked in your chariot
HAB.3.8	and wiped them out.
HAB.3.9	Your arrows were ready
HAB.3.9	and obeyed your commands.
HAB.3.9	You split the earth apart
HAB.3.9	with rivers and streams;
HAB.3.10	mountains trembled
HAB.3.10	at the sight of you;
HAB.3.10	rain poured from the clouds;
HAB.3.10	ocean waves roared and rose.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still,
HAB.3.11	while your arrows and spears
HAB.3.11	flashed like lightning.
HAB.3.12	In your furious anger,
HAB.3.12	you trampled on nations
HAB.3.13	to rescue your people
HAB.3.13	and save your chosen one.
HAB.3.13	You crushed a nation's ruler
HAB.3.13	and stripped his evil kingdom
HAB.3.13	of its power.
HAB.3.14	His troops had come like a storm,
HAB.3.14	hoping to scatter us
HAB.3.14	and glad to gobble us up.
HAB.3.14	To them we were refugees
HAB.3.14	in hiding—
HAB.3.14	but you smashed their heads
HAB.3.14	with their own weapons.
HAB.3.15	Then your chariots churned
HAB.3.15	the waters of the sea.
HAB.3.16	When I heard this message,
HAB.3.16	I felt weak from fear,
HAB.3.16	and my lips quivered.
HAB.3.16	My bones seemed to melt,
HAB.3.16	and I stumbled around.
HAB.3.16	But I will patiently wait.
HAB.3.16	Someday those vicious enemies
HAB.3.16	will be struck by disaster.
HAB.3.17	Fig trees may no longer bloom,
HAB.3.17	or vineyards produce grapes;
HAB.3.17	olive trees may be fruitless,
HAB.3.17	and harvest time a failure;
HAB.3.17	sheep pens may be empty,
HAB.3.17	and cattle stalls vacant—
HAB.3.18	but I will still celebrate
HAB.3.18	because the 
HAB.3.18	is my Savior.
HAB.3.19	He makes my feet as sure
HAB.3.19	as those of a deer,
HAB.3.19	and he helps me stand
HAB.3.19	on the mountains.
HAB.3.19	To the music director:
HAB.3.19	Use stringed instruments.
ZEP.1.1	When Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah,
ZEP.1.2	I, the 
ZEP.1.2	to destroy everything
ZEP.1.2	on this earth—
ZEP.1.3	people and animals,
ZEP.1.3	birds and fish.
ZEP.1.3	Everyone who is evil
ZEP.1.3	will crash to the ground,
ZEP.1.3	and I will wipe out
ZEP.1.3	the entire human race.
ZEP.1.4	I will reach out to punish
ZEP.1.4	Judah and Jerusalem—
ZEP.1.4	nothing will remain
ZEP.1.4	of the god Baal;
ZEP.1.4	nothing will be remembered
ZEP.1.4	of his pagan priests.
ZEP.1.5	Not a trace will be found
ZEP.1.5	of those who worship stars
ZEP.1.5	from their rooftops,
ZEP.1.5	or bow down to the god Milcom,
ZEP.1.5	while claiming loyalty
ZEP.1.5	to me, the 
ZEP.1.6	Nothing will remain of anyone
ZEP.1.6	who has turned away
ZEP.1.6	and rejected me.
ZEP.1.7	Be silent! I am the 
ZEP.1.7	and the time is near.
ZEP.1.7	I am preparing
ZEP.1.7	to sacrifice my people
ZEP.1.7	and to invite my guests.
ZEP.1.8	On that day I will punish
ZEP.1.8	national leaders
ZEP.1.8	and sons of the king,
ZEP.1.8	along with all who follow
ZEP.1.8	foreign customs.
ZEP.1.9	I will punish worshipers
ZEP.1.9	of pagan gods
ZEP.1.9	and cruel palace officials
ZEP.1.9	who abuse their power.
ZEP.1.10	I, the 
ZEP.1.10	that on that day
ZEP.1.10	noisy crying will be heard
ZEP.1.10	from Fish Gate, New Town,
ZEP.1.10	and Upper Hills.
ZEP.1.11	Everyone in Lower Hollow
ZEP.1.11	will mourn loudly,
ZEP.1.11	because merchants
ZEP.1.11	and money changers
ZEP.1.11	will be wiped out.
ZEP.1.12	I'll search Jerusalem with lamps
ZEP.1.12	and punish those people
ZEP.1.12	who sit there unworried
ZEP.1.12	while thinking,
ZEP.1.12	“The 
ZEP.1.12	good or bad.”
ZEP.1.13	Their possessions will be taken,
ZEP.1.13	their homes left in ruins.
ZEP.1.13	They won't get to live
ZEP.1.13	in the houses they build,
ZEP.1.13	or drink wine from the grapes
ZEP.1.13	in their own vineyards.
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.14	is coming soon, very soon.
ZEP.1.14	On that terrible day,
ZEP.1.14	fearsome shouts of warriors
ZEP.1.14	will be heard everywhere.
ZEP.1.15	It will be a time of anger—
ZEP.1.15	of trouble and torment,
ZEP.1.15	of disaster and destruction,
ZEP.1.15	of darkness and despair,
ZEP.1.15	of storm clouds and shadows,
ZEP.1.16	of trumpet calls
ZEP.1.16	and battle cries
ZEP.1.16	against fortified cities
ZEP.1.16	and mighty fortresses.
ZEP.1.17	The 
ZEP.1.17	who has sinned against him,
ZEP.1.17	“I'll strike you blind!
ZEP.1.17	Then your blood and your insides
ZEP.1.17	will gush out like vomit.
ZEP.1.18	Not even your silver or gold
ZEP.1.18	can save you on that day
ZEP.1.18	when I, the 
ZEP.1.18	My anger will flare up
ZEP.1.18	like a furious fire
ZEP.1.18	scorching the earth
ZEP.1.18	and everyone on it.”
ZEP.2.1	You disgraceful nation,
ZEP.2.1	gather around,
ZEP.2.2	before it's too late.
ZEP.2.2	The 
ZEP.2.2	when his fierce anger
ZEP.2.2	will strike like a storm
ZEP.2.2	and sweep you away.
ZEP.2.3	If you humbly obey the 
ZEP.2.3	then come and worship him.
ZEP.2.3	If you do right and are humble,
ZEP.2.3	perhaps you will be safe
ZEP.2.3	on that day when the 
ZEP.2.3	turns loose his anger.
ZEP.2.4	will be deserted
ZEP.2.4	and left in ruins.
ZEP.2.4	Ashdod will be emptied
ZEP.2.4	in broad daylight,
ZEP.2.4	and Ekron
ZEP.2.5	To you people of Philistia
ZEP.2.5	who live along the coast,
ZEP.2.5	the 
ZEP.2.5	“I am now your enemy,
ZEP.2.5	and I'll wipe you out!”
ZEP.2.6	Your seacoast will be changed
ZEP.2.6	into pastureland
ZEP.2.6	and sheep pens.
ZEP.2.7	The 
ZEP.2.7	those survivors in Judah,
ZEP.2.7	and he will help them—
ZEP.2.7	his people will take your land
ZEP.2.7	to use for pasture.
ZEP.2.7	And when evening comes,
ZEP.2.7	they will rest
ZEP.2.7	in houses at Ashkelon.
ZEP.2.7	* 
ZEP.2.8	 The 
ZEP.2.8	the God of Israel, said:
ZEP.2.8	I've heard Moab and Ammon
ZEP.2.8	insult my people
ZEP.2.8	and threaten their nation.
ZEP.2.9	that Moab and Ammon will end up
ZEP.2.9	like Sodom and Gomorrah—
ZEP.2.9	covered with thornbushes
ZEP.2.9	and salt pits forever.
ZEP.2.9	Then my people who survive
ZEP.2.9	will take their land.
ZEP.2.10	This is how Moab and Ammon
ZEP.2.10	will at last be repaid
ZEP.2.10	for their pride—
ZEP.2.10	and for sneering at the nation
ZEP.2.10	that belongs to me,
ZEP.2.10	the 
ZEP.2.11	I will fiercely attack.
ZEP.2.11	Then every god on this earth
ZEP.2.11	will shrink to nothing,
ZEP.2.11	and everyone of every nation
ZEP.2.11	will bow down to me,
ZEP.2.11	right where they are.
ZEP.2.12	the sword of the 
ZEP.2.12	will slaughter you!
ZEP.2.13	to crush Assyria
ZEP.2.13	and overthrow Nineveh.
ZEP.2.14	Herds of wild animals
ZEP.2.14	will live in its rubble;
ZEP.2.14	all kinds of desert owls
ZEP.2.14	will perch on its stones
ZEP.2.14	and hoot in the windows.
ZEP.2.14	Noisy ravens will be heard
ZEP.2.14	inside its buildings,
ZEP.2.14	stripped bare of cedar.
ZEP.2.15	This is the glorious city
ZEP.2.15	that felt secure and said,
ZEP.2.15	“I am the only one!”
ZEP.2.15	Now it's merely ruins,
ZEP.2.15	a home for wild animals.
ZEP.2.15	Every passerby simply sneers
ZEP.2.15	and makes vulgar signs.
ZEP.3.1	Too bad for that disgusting,
ZEP.3.1	corrupt, and lawless city!
ZEP.3.2	Forever rebellious
ZEP.3.2	and rejecting correction,
ZEP.3.2	Jerusalem refuses to trust
ZEP.3.2	or obey the 
ZEP.3.3	Its officials are roaring lions,
ZEP.3.3	its judges are wolves;
ZEP.3.3	in the evening they attack,
ZEP.3.3	by morning nothing is left.
ZEP.3.4	Jerusalem's prophets are proud
ZEP.3.4	and not to be trusted.
ZEP.3.4	The priests have disgraced
ZEP.3.4	the place of worship
ZEP.3.4	and abused God's Law.
ZEP.3.5	All who do evil are shameless,
ZEP.3.5	but the 
ZEP.3.5	and is always fair.
ZEP.3.5	With the dawn of each day,
ZEP.3.5	God brings about justice.
ZEP.3.6	The 
ZEP.3.6	and left fortresses
ZEP.3.6	crumbling in the dirt.
ZEP.3.6	Their streets and towns
ZEP.3.6	were reduced to ruins
ZEP.3.6	and emptied of people.
ZEP.3.7	God felt certain that Jerusalem
ZEP.3.7	would learn to respect
ZEP.3.7	and obey him.
ZEP.3.7	Then he would hold back
ZEP.3.7	from punishing the city
ZEP.3.7	and not wipe it out.
ZEP.3.7	But everyone there was eager
ZEP.3.7	to start sinning again.
ZEP.3.8	The 
ZEP.3.8	Just wait for the day
ZEP.3.8	when I accuse you nations.
ZEP.3.8	I have decided on a day,
ZEP.3.8	when I will bring together
ZEP.3.8	every nation and kingdom
ZEP.3.8	and punish them all
ZEP.3.8	in my fiery anger.
ZEP.3.8	I will become furious
ZEP.3.8	and destroy the earth.
ZEP.3.9	I will purify each language
ZEP.3.9	and make those languages
ZEP.3.9	acceptable for praising me.
ZEP.3.9	Then, with hearts united,
ZEP.3.9	everyone will serve
ZEP.3.9	only me, the 
ZEP.3.10	From across the rivers
ZEP.3.10	of Ethiopia,
ZEP.3.10	my scattered people,
ZEP.3.10	my true worshipers,
ZEP.3.10	will bring offerings to me.
ZEP.3.11	When that time comes,
ZEP.3.11	you won't rebel against me
ZEP.3.11	and be put to shame.
ZEP.3.11	I'll do away with those
ZEP.3.11	who are proud and arrogant.
ZEP.3.11	Never will any of them
ZEP.3.11	strut around
ZEP.3.11	on my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	But I, the 
ZEP.3.12	any of your people
ZEP.3.12	who are truly humble
ZEP.3.12	and turn to me for safety.
ZEP.3.13	will live right
ZEP.3.13	and refuse to tell lies.
ZEP.3.13	They will eat and rest
ZEP.3.13	with nothing to fear.
ZEP.3.14	Everyone in Jerusalem and Judah,
ZEP.3.14	celebrate and shout
ZEP.3.14	with all your heart!
ZEP.3.15	Zion, your punishment is over.
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	to turn and retreat.
ZEP.3.15	Your 
ZEP.3.15	and stands at your side;
ZEP.3.15	you don't have to worry
ZEP.3.15	about any more troubles.
ZEP.3.16	Jerusalem, the time is coming,
ZEP.3.16	when it will be said to you:
ZEP.3.16	“Don't be discouraged
ZEP.3.16	or grow weak from fear!
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	wins victory after victory
ZEP.3.17	and is always with you.
ZEP.3.17	He celebrates and sings
ZEP.3.17	because of you,
ZEP.3.17	and he will refresh your life
ZEP.3.17	with his love.”
ZEP.3.18	The 
ZEP.3.18	Your sorrow has ended,
ZEP.3.18	and you can celebrate.
ZEP.3.19	I will punish those
ZEP.3.19	who mistreat you.
ZEP.3.19	I will bring together the lame
ZEP.3.19	and the outcasts,
ZEP.3.19	then they will be praised,
ZEP.3.19	instead of despised,
ZEP.3.19	in every country on earth.
ZEP.3.20	I will lead you home,
ZEP.3.20	and with your own eyes
ZEP.3.20	you will see me bless you
ZEP.3.20	with all you once owned.
ZEP.3.20	Then you will be famous
ZEP.3.20	everywhere on this earth.
ZEP.3.20	I, the 
HAG.1.1	So Haggai told Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua
HAG.1.2+HAG.1.3+HAG.1.4+HAG.1.5	that the 
HAG.1.2+HAG.1.3+HAG.1.4+HAG.1.5	You say this isn't the right time to build a temple for me. But is it right for you to live in expensive houses,
HAG.1.6	You harvest less than you plant, you never have enough to eat or drink, your clothes don't keep you warm, and your wages are stored in bags full of holes.
HAG.1.7	Think about what I have said! 
HAG.1.8	But first, go to the hills and get wood for my temple, so I can take pride in it and be worshiped there. 
HAG.1.9	You expected much, but received only a little. And when you brought it home, I made that little disappear. Why have I done this? It's because you hurry off to build your own houses, while my temple is still in ruins. 
HAG.1.10	That's also why the dew doesn't fall and your harvest fails. 
HAG.1.11	And so, at my command everything will become barren—your farmland and pastures, your vineyards and olive trees, your animals and you yourselves. All your hard work will be for nothing.
HAG.1.12	Zerubbabel and Joshua, together with the others who had returned from exile in Babylonia, obeyed the 
HAG.1.13	Haggai then told them that the 
HAG.1.14	So the 
HAG.1.15	And the work began on the twenty-fourth day of that same month.
HAG.2.1+HAG.2.2	On the twenty-first day of the next month,
HAG.2.4	But cheer up! Because I, the 
HAG.2.5	 just as I promised your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. Don't worry. My Spirit is
HAG.2.7	I will shake the nations, and their treasures
HAG.2.8	All silver and gold belong to me, 
HAG.2.9	and I promise that this new temple will be more glorious than the first one. I will also bless this city
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month,
HAG.2.11	to ask the priests for their opinion on the following matters:
HAG.2.12	Suppose meat ready to be sacrificed to God is being carried in the folds of someone's clothing, and the clothing rubs against some bread or stew or wine or olive oil or any other food. Would those foods that were touched then become acceptable for sacrifice?
HAG.2.12	“Of course not,” the priests answered.
HAG.2.13	“Of course they would,” the priests answered.
HAG.2.14	So the 
HAG.2.14	That's how it is with this entire nation. Everything you do and every sacrifice you offer is unacceptable to me. 
HAG.2.15	But from now on, things will get better. Before you started laying the foundation for the temple, 
HAG.2.16	you recalled what life was like in the past.
HAG.2.17	I made all of your hard work useless by sending mildew, mold, and hail—but you still did not return to me, your 
HAG.2.18	Today you have completed the foundation for my temple, so listen to what your future will be like. 
HAG.2.19	Although you have not yet harvested any grain, grapes, figs, pomegranates,
HAG.2.20	That same day the 
HAG.2.21	Tell Governor Zerubbabel of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth 
HAG.2.22	and wipe out kings and their kingdoms. I will overturn war chariots, and then cavalry troops will start slaughtering each other. 
HAG.2.23	But tell my servant Zerubbabel that I, the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia,
ZEC.1.2+ZEC.1.3	Israel, I, the 
ZEC.1.4	Don't be stubborn like your ancestors. They were warned by the earlier prophets
ZEC.1.5	Where are your ancestors now? Not even prophets live forever. 
ZEC.1.6	But my warnings and my words spoken by the prophets caught up with your ancestors. So they turned back to me and said, “
ZEC.1.9	An angel was there to explain things to me, and I asked, “Sir, who are these riders?”
ZEC.1.9	“I'll tell you,” the angel answered.
ZEC.1.10	At once, the man standing among the myrtle trees said, “These are the ones the 
ZEC.1.11	Then the riders spoke to the 
ZEC.1.12	At this, the angel said, “
ZEC.1.13	The 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel told me to announce:
ZEC.1.14	I, the 
ZEC.1.15	For a while I was angry at the nations, but now I am furious, because they have made things worse for Jerusalem and are not the least bit concerned. 
ZEC.1.16	And so, I will have pity on Jerusalem. The city will be completely rebuilt, and my temple will stand again. 
ZEC.1.17	I also promise that my towns will prosper—Jerusalem will once again be my chosen city, and I will comfort the people of Zion.
ZEC.1.18	Next, I saw four animal horns.
ZEC.1.19+ZEC.1.20+ZEC.1.21	The angel who was sent to explain was there, and so I asked, “What do these mean?”
ZEC.1.19+ZEC.1.20+ZEC.1.21	His answer was, “These horns are the nations that scattered the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem, and took away their freedom.”
ZEC.1.19+ZEC.1.20+ZEC.1.21	Then the 
ZEC.1.19+ZEC.1.20+ZEC.1.21	He replied, “They are going to terrify and crush those horns.”
ZEC.2.1	This time I saw someone holding a measuring line, 
ZEC.2.2	and I asked, “Where are you going?”
ZEC.2.2	“To measure Jerusalem,” was the answer. “To find out how wide and long it is.”
ZEC.2.3	The angel who had spoken to me came toward me, when another angel came up to him 
ZEC.2.4	and said, “Hurry! Tell that man with the measuring line that Jerusalem won't have any boundaries. It will be too full of people and animals even to have a wall. 
ZEC.2.5	The 
ZEC.2.6	The 
ZEC.2.7	Leave Babylonia and hurry back to Zion.”
ZEC.2.8	Then the glorious 
ZEC.2.8	Zion is as precious to the 
ZEC.2.9	And so, he will put you in the power of your slaves, and they will raid and rob you. Then you will know that I am a prophet of the 
ZEC.2.10	City of Zion, sing and celebrate! The 
ZEC.2.11	When he does, many nations will turn to him and become his people. At that time you will know that I am a prophet of the 
ZEC.2.12	Then Judah will be his part of the holy land, and Jerusalem will again be his chosen city.
ZEC.2.13	Everyone, be silent!
ZEC.2.13	The 
ZEC.2.13	and moving about
ZEC.2.13	in his holy place.
ZEC.3.2	 But the 
ZEC.3.3	Joshua's clothes were filthy. 
ZEC.3.4	So the angel told some of the people to remove Joshua's filthy clothes. Then he said to Joshua, “This means you are forgiven. Now I will dress you in priestly clothes.”
ZEC.3.5	I spoke up and said, “Also put a clean priestly turban on his head.” Then they dressed him in priestly clothes and put the turban on him, while the 
ZEC.3.6	After this, the angel encouraged Joshua by telling him that the 
ZEC.3.7	If you truly obey me, I will put you in charge of my temple, including the courtyard around it, and you will be allowed to speak at any time with the angels standing beside me.
ZEC.3.8	 Listen carefully, High Priest Joshua and all of you other priests. You are a sign of things to come, because I am going to bring my servant, the Chosen King.
ZEC.3.9	Joshua, I have placed in front of you a stone with seven sides.
ZEC.3.10	 Then each of you will live at peace and entertain your friends in your own vineyard and under your own fig trees.
ZEC.4.1	The angel who explained the visions woke me from what seemed like sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	Then he asked, “What do you see?”
ZEC.4.2	“A solid gold lampstand with an oil container above it,” I answered. “On the stand are seven lamps, each with seven flames. 
ZEC.4.3	 One olive tree is on the right side and another on the left of the oil container. 
ZEC.4.4	But, sir, what do these mean?”
ZEC.4.5	Then he asked, “Don't you know?”
ZEC.4.5	“No sir,” I replied.
ZEC.4.6	I am the 
ZEC.4.7	Zerubbabel, that mountain in front of you will be leveled to the ground. Then you will bring out the temple's most important stone and shout, “God has been very kind.”
ZEC.4.8	The 
ZEC.4.9	Zerubbabel laid the foundation for the temple, and he will complete it. Then everyone will know that you were sent by me, the 
ZEC.4.10	 Those who have made fun of this day of small beginnings will celebrate when they see Zerubbabel holding this important stone.
ZEC.4.10	Those seven lamps represent my eyes—the eyes of the 
ZEC.4.12	And what is the meaning of the two branches from which golden olive oil
ZEC.4.13	“Don't you know?” he asked.
ZEC.4.13	“No sir, I don't,” was my answer.
ZEC.4.14	Then he told me, “These branches are the two chosen leaders
ZEC.5.1	When I looked the next time, I saw a flying scroll,
ZEC.5.2	and the angel asked, “What do you see?”
ZEC.5.2	“A flying scroll,” I answered. “About nine meters long and four and a half meters wide.”
ZEC.5.3	Then he told me:
ZEC.5.3	This scroll puts a curse on everyone in the land who steals or tells lies. The writing on one side tells about the destruction of those who steal, while the writing on the other side tells about the destruction of those who lie.
ZEC.5.4	The 
ZEC.5.5	Now the angel who was there to explain the visions came over and said, “Look up and tell me what you see coming.”
ZEC.5.6	“I don't know what it is,” was my reply.
ZEC.5.6	“It's a big basket,” he said. “And it shows what everyone in the land has in mind.”
ZEC.5.7	The lead cover of the basket was opened, and in the basket was a woman. 
ZEC.5.8	“This woman represents evil,” the angel explained. Then he threw her back into the basket and slammed the heavy cover down tight.
ZEC.5.9	Right after this I saw two women coming through the sky with wings outstretched like a stork in the wind. Suddenly they lifted the basket into the air, 
ZEC.5.10	and I asked the angel, “Where are they taking the basket?”
ZEC.5.11	“To Babylonia,”
ZEC.6.1	Finally, I looked up and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains. 
ZEC.6.2	 The first chariot was pulled by red horses, and the second by black horses; 
ZEC.6.3	 the third chariot was pulled by white horses, and the fourth by spotted gray
ZEC.6.4	“Sir,” I asked the angel. “What do these stand for?”
ZEC.6.6	The chariot with black horses goes toward the north, the chariot with white horses goes toward the west,
ZEC.6.7	The horses came out eager to patrol the earth, and the angel told them, “Start patrolling the earth.”
ZEC.6.7	When they had gone on their way, 
ZEC.6.8	he shouted to me, “Those that have gone to the country in the north will do what the 
ZEC.6.9	The 
ZEC.6.10+ZEC.6.11	Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah have returned from Babylonia. Collect enough silver and gold from them to make a crown.
ZEC.6.12+ZEC.6.13	 Tell him that I, the 
ZEC.6.14	This crown will be kept in my temple as a reminder and will be taken care of by Heldai,
ZEC.6.15	When people from distant lands come and help build the temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	On the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month of the fourth year that Darius was king of Persia,
ZEC.7.2+ZEC.7.3	It happened after the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer with Regem-Melech and his men to ask the priests in the 
ZEC.7.4+ZEC.7.5	It was then that the 
ZEC.7.4+ZEC.7.5	For 70 years you have gone without eating during the fifth and seventh months of the year. But did you really do it for me? 
ZEC.7.6	And when you eat and drink, isn't it for your own enjoyment? 
ZEC.7.7	My message today is the same one I commanded the earlier prophets
ZEC.7.8+ZEC.7.9	So once again, I, the 
ZEC.7.10	Don't mistreat widows or orphans or foreigners or anyone who is poor, and stop making plans to hurt each other.”
ZEC.7.11+ZEC.7.12	But everyone who heard those prophets, stubbornly refused to obey. Instead, they turned their backs on everything my Spirit
ZEC.7.13	and said, “You people paid no attention when I called out to you, and now I'll pay no attention when you call out to me.”
ZEC.7.14	That's why I came with a whirlwind and scattered them among foreign nations, leaving their lovely country empty of people and in ruins.
ZEC.8.1	The 
ZEC.8.2	I love Zion so much that her enemies make me angry. 
ZEC.8.3	I will return to Jerusalem and live there on Mount Zion. Then Jerusalem will be known as my faithful city, and Zion will be known as my holy mountain.
ZEC.8.4	Very old people with walking sticks will once again sit around in Jerusalem, 
ZEC.8.5	while boys and girls play in the streets. 
ZEC.8.6	This may seem impossible for my people who are left, but it isn't impossible for me, the 
ZEC.8.7	I will save those who were taken to lands in the east and the west, 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them to live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, faithful to bring about justice.
ZEC.8.9	I am the 
ZEC.8.10	Before that time, neither people nor animals were rewarded for their work, and no one was safe anywhere, because I had turned them against each other.
ZEC.8.11	My people, only a few of you are left, and I promise not to punish you as I did before. 
ZEC.8.12	Instead, I will make sure that your crops are planted in peace and your vineyards are fruitful, that your fields are fertile, and the dew falls from the sky. 
ZEC.8.13	People of Judah and Israel, you have been a curse to the nations, but I will save you and make you a blessing to them. So don't be afraid or lose courage.
ZEC.8.14	When your ancestors made me angry, I decided to punish you with disasters, and I didn't hold back. 
ZEC.8.15	Now you no longer need to be afraid. I have decided to treat Jerusalem and Judah with kindness. 
ZEC.8.16	 But you must be truthful with each other, and in court you must give fair decisions that lead to peace. 
ZEC.8.17	Don't ever plan evil things against others or tell lies under oath. I, the 
ZEC.8.18	The 
ZEC.8.19	People of Judah, I, the 
ZEC.8.20	I tell you that people will come here from cities everywhere. 
ZEC.8.21	Those of one town will go to another and say, “We're going to ask the 
ZEC.8.22	Many people from strong nations will come to Jerusalem to worship me and to ask me to treat them with kindness. 
ZEC.8.23	When this happens, ten people from nations with different languages will grab a Jew by his clothes and say, “Let us go with you. We've heard that God is on your side.” I, the 
ZEC.9.1	from the 
ZEC.9.1	His eyes are on everyone,
ZEC.9.1	especially the tribes
ZEC.9.1	of Israel.
ZEC.9.1	So he pronounces judgment
ZEC.9.1	against the cities
ZEC.9.1	of Hadrach and Damascus.
ZEC.9.2	Judgment will also fall
ZEC.9.2	on the nearby city
ZEC.9.2	of Hamath,
ZEC.9.2	as well as on Tyre and Sidon,
ZEC.9.2	whose people are clever.
ZEC.9.3	Tyre has built a fortress
ZEC.9.3	and piled up silver and gold,
ZEC.9.3	as though they were dust
ZEC.9.3	or mud from the streets.
ZEC.9.4	Now the Lord will punish Tyre
ZEC.9.4	with poverty;
ZEC.9.4	he will sink its ships
ZEC.9.4	and send it up in flames.
ZEC.9.5	will tremble with fear;
ZEC.9.5	Ekron will lose all hope.
ZEC.9.5	Gaza's king will be killed,
ZEC.9.5	and Ashkelon emptied
ZEC.9.5	of its people.
ZEC.9.6	A mob of half-breeds
ZEC.9.6	will settle in Ashdod,
ZEC.9.6	and the Lord himself
ZEC.9.6	will rob Philistia of pride.
ZEC.9.7	No longer will the Philistines

ZEC.9.7	or any unclean food.
ZEC.9.7	They will become part
ZEC.9.7	of the people of our God
ZEC.9.7	from the tribe of Judah.
ZEC.9.7	And God will accept
ZEC.9.7	the people of Ekron,
ZEC.9.7	as he did the Jebusites.
ZEC.9.8	God says, “I will stand guard
ZEC.9.8	to protect my temple from those
ZEC.9.8	who come to attack.
ZEC.9.8	I know what's happening,
ZEC.9.8	and no one will mistreat
ZEC.9.8	my people ever again.”
ZEC.9.9	celebrate and shout!
ZEC.9.9	Your king has won a victory,
ZEC.9.9	and he is coming to you.
ZEC.9.9	He is humble
ZEC.9.9	and rides on a donkey;
ZEC.9.9	he comes on the colt
ZEC.9.9	of a donkey.
ZEC.9.10	war chariots and horses
ZEC.9.10	from Israel
ZEC.9.10	Bows that were made for battle
ZEC.9.10	will be broken.
ZEC.9.10	I will bring peace to nations,
ZEC.9.10	and your king will rule
ZEC.9.10	from sea to sea.
ZEC.9.10	His kingdom will reach
ZEC.9.10	from the Euphrates River
ZEC.9.10	across the earth.
ZEC.9.11	with you, my people,
ZEC.9.11	we sealed it with blood.
ZEC.9.11	Now some of you are captives
ZEC.9.11	in waterless pits,
ZEC.9.11	but I will come to your rescue
ZEC.9.12	and offer you hope.
ZEC.9.12	Return to your fortress,
ZEC.9.12	because today I will reward you
ZEC.9.12	with twice what you had.
ZEC.9.13	I will use Judah as my bow
ZEC.9.13	and Israel
ZEC.9.13	I will take the people of Zion
ZEC.9.13	as my sword
ZEC.9.13	and attack the Greeks.
ZEC.9.14	Like a cloud, the 
ZEC.9.14	will appear over his people,
ZEC.9.14	and his arrows will flash
ZEC.9.14	like lightning.
ZEC.9.14	God will sound his trumpet
ZEC.9.14	and attack in a whirlwind
ZEC.9.14	from the south.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	will protect his people,
ZEC.9.15	and they will trample down
ZEC.9.15	the sharpshooters
ZEC.9.15	and their slingshots.
ZEC.9.15	They will drink and get rowdy;
ZEC.9.15	they will be as full as a bowl
ZEC.9.15	at the time of sacrifice.
ZEC.9.16	The 
ZEC.9.16	on that day,
ZEC.9.16	because they are his people,
ZEC.9.16	and they will shine on his land
ZEC.9.16	like jewels in a crown.
ZEC.9.17	How lovely they will be.
ZEC.9.17	Young people will grow there
ZEC.9.17	like grain in a field
ZEC.9.17	or grapes in a vineyard.
ZEC.10.1	I, the 
ZEC.10.1	who sends storm clouds
ZEC.10.1	and showers of rain
ZEC.10.1	to make fields produce.
ZEC.10.1	So when the crops need rain,
ZEC.10.1	you should pray to me.
ZEC.10.2	and fortunetellers,
ZEC.10.2	or depend on the hope
ZEC.10.2	you receive from witchcraft
ZEC.10.2	and interpreters of dreams.
ZEC.10.2	But you have tried all of these,
ZEC.10.2	and now you are like sheep
ZEC.10.2	without a shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	I, the 
ZEC.10.3	am fiercely angry
ZEC.10.3	with you leaders,
ZEC.10.3	and I will punish you.
ZEC.10.3	I care for my people,
ZEC.10.3	the nation of Judah,
ZEC.10.3	and I will change
ZEC.10.3	this flock of sheep
ZEC.10.3	into charging war horses.
ZEC.10.4	From this flock will come leaders
ZEC.10.4	who will be strong
ZEC.10.4	like cornerstones and tent pegs
ZEC.10.4	and weapons of war.
ZEC.10.5	They will join in the fighting,
ZEC.10.5	and together they will trample
ZEC.10.5	their enemies like mud.
ZEC.10.5	They will fight,
ZEC.10.5	because I, the 
ZEC.10.5	will be on their side.
ZEC.10.5	And they will crush
ZEC.10.5	the enemy cavalry.
ZEC.10.6	I will strengthen
ZEC.10.6	the kingdoms of Judah
ZEC.10.6	and Israel.
ZEC.10.6	And I will show mercy
ZEC.10.6	because I am the 
ZEC.10.6	their God.
ZEC.10.6	I will answer their prayers
ZEC.10.6	and bring them home.
ZEC.10.6	Then it will seem as though
ZEC.10.6	I had never rejected them.
ZEC.10.7	Israel
ZEC.10.7	a tribe of warriors
ZEC.10.7	celebrating with wine.
ZEC.10.7	When their children see this,
ZEC.10.7	they will also be happy
ZEC.10.7	because of me, the 
ZEC.10.8	I will give a signal
ZEC.10.8	for them to come together
ZEC.10.8	because I have rescued them.
ZEC.10.8	And there will be as many
ZEC.10.8	as ever before.
ZEC.10.9	in distant countries,
ZEC.10.9	they won't forget me.
ZEC.10.9	Once their children are raised,
ZEC.10.9	they will return—
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them home
ZEC.10.10	from Egypt and Assyria,
ZEC.10.10	then let them settle
ZEC.10.10	as far as Gilead and Lebanon,
ZEC.10.10	until the land overflows
ZEC.10.10	with them.
ZEC.10.11	My people will go through
ZEC.10.11	an ocean of troubles,
ZEC.10.11	but I will overcome the waves
ZEC.10.11	and dry up the deepest part
ZEC.10.11	of the Nile.
ZEC.10.11	Assyria's great pride
ZEC.10.11	will be put down,
ZEC.10.11	and the power of Egypt
ZEC.10.11	will disappear.
ZEC.10.12	I'll strengthen my people
ZEC.10.12	because of who I am,
ZEC.10.12	and they will follow me.
ZEC.10.12	I, the 
ZEC.11.1	Lebanon, open your gates!
ZEC.11.1	Let the fire come in
ZEC.11.1	to destroy your cedar trees.
ZEC.11.2	Cry, you cypress trees!
ZEC.11.2	The glorious cedars have fallen
ZEC.11.2	and are rotting.
ZEC.11.2	Cry, you oak trees of Bashan!
ZEC.11.2	The dense forest
ZEC.11.2	has been chopped down.
ZEC.11.3	Listen! Shepherds are crying.
ZEC.11.3	Their glorious pastures
ZEC.11.3	have been ruined.
ZEC.11.3	Listen! Lions are roaring.
ZEC.11.3	The forests of the Jordan Valley
ZEC.11.3	are no more to be found.
ZEC.11.4	The 
ZEC.11.4	Tend those sheep doomed for slaughter! 
ZEC.11.5	The people who buy and butcher them go unpunished, while everyone who sells them says, “Praise the 
ZEC.11.6	Tend those sheep because I, the 
ZEC.11.7	So I became a shepherd of those sheep doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep dealers.
ZEC.11.8	In less than a month, I became impatient with three shepherds who didn't like me, and I got rid of them. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, “I refuse to be your shepherd. Let the sheep that are going to die, go on and die, and those that are going to be destroyed, go on and be destroyed. Then let the others eat one another alive.”
ZEC.11.10	On that same day, I broke the stick named “Mercy” to show that the 
ZEC.11.11	The sheep dealers who saw me knew at once that this was a message from the 
ZEC.11.12+ZEC.11.13	 I told them, “Pay me my wages, if you think you should; otherwise, forget it.” So they handed me my wages, a measly 30 pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.12+ZEC.11.13	Then the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke the stick named “Unity” and canceled the ties between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	Next, the 
ZEC.11.16	Once more I am going to let a worthless nobody rule the land—one who won't care for the strays or search for the young or heal the sick or feed the healthy. He will just dine on the fattest sheep, leaving nothing but a few bones.”
ZEC.11.17	You worthless shepherd,
ZEC.11.17	deserting the sheep!
ZEC.11.17	I hope a sword
ZEC.11.17	will cripple your arm
ZEC.11.17	and blind your right eye.
ZEC.12.1	This is a message from the 
ZEC.12.1	I am the 
ZEC.12.2	I have decided that Jerusalem will become a bowl of wine that makes the neighboring nations drunk. And when Jerusalem is attacked, Judah will also be attacked.
ZEC.12.3	But I will turn Jerusalem into a heavy stone that crushes anyone who tries to lift it.
ZEC.12.3	When all nations on earth surround Jerusalem, 
ZEC.12.4	I will blind every horse and make them panic, and every rider will be confused. But at the same time, I will watch over Judah. 
ZEC.12.5	Then every clan in Judah will realize that I, the 
ZEC.12.6	At that time I will let the clans of Judah be like a ball of fire in a wood pile or a fiery torch in a hay stack. Then Judah will send the surrounding nations up in smoke. And once again the city of Jerusalem will be filled with people.
ZEC.12.7	But I will first give victory to Judah, so the kingdom of David and the city of Jerusalem in all of their glory won't be thought of more highly than Judah itself. 
ZEC.12.8	I, the 
ZEC.12.9	I am determined to wipe out every nation that attacks Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.11	On that day the people of Jerusalem will mourn as much as everyone did for Hadad Rimmon
ZEC.12.12	Everyone of each family in the land will mourn, and the men will mourn separately from the women. This includes those from the family of David, and the families of Nathan, 
ZEC.12.13	Levi, Shimei,
ZEC.12.14	and all other families as well.
ZEC.13.1	In the future there will be a fountain, where David's descendants and the people of Jerusalem can wash away their sin and guilt.
ZEC.13.2	The 
ZEC.13.2	When that time comes, I will get rid of every idol in the country, and they will be forgotten forever. I will also do away with their prophets and those evil spirits that control them. 
ZEC.13.3	If any such prophets ever appear again, their own parents must warn them that they will die for telling lies in my name—the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	Those prophets will be ashamed of their so-called visions, and they won't deceive anyone by dressing like a true prophet. 
ZEC.13.5	Instead, they will say, “I'm no prophet. I've been a farmer all my life.”
ZEC.13.6	And if any of them are asked why they are wounded,
ZEC.13.7	My sword, wake up! Attack
ZEC.13.7	my shepherd and friend.
ZEC.13.7	Strike down the shepherd!
ZEC.13.7	Scatter the little sheep,
ZEC.13.7	and I will destroy them.
ZEC.13.8	Nowhere in the land
ZEC.13.8	will more than a third of them
ZEC.13.8	be left alive.
ZEC.13.9	Then I will purify them
ZEC.13.9	and put them to the test,
ZEC.13.9	just as gold and silver
ZEC.13.9	are purified and tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will pray in my name,
ZEC.13.9	and I will answer them.
ZEC.13.9	I will say, “You are my people,”
ZEC.13.9	and they will reply,
ZEC.13.9	“You, 
ZEC.14.1	The 
ZEC.14.2	But first, he will bring many nations to attack Jerusalem—homes will be robbed, women raped, and half of the population dragged off, though the others will be allowed to remain.
ZEC.14.3	The 
ZEC.14.4	He will take his stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, and the mountain will split in half, forming a wide valley that runs from east to west. 
ZEC.14.5	Then you people will escape from the 
ZEC.14.6	It will be a bright day that won't turn cloudy or cold.
ZEC.14.7	And the 
ZEC.14.9	Then there will be only one 
ZEC.14.12	Here is what the 
ZEC.14.13	The 
ZEC.14.14+ZEC.14.15	until even the people of Judah turn against those in Jerusalem.
ZEC.14.17	No rain will fall on the land of anyone in any country who refuses to go to Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18+ZEC.14.19	This horrible disaster will strike the Egyptians and everyone else who refuses to go there for the celebration.
ZEC.14.20+ZEC.14.21	At that time the words “Dedicated to the 
MAL.1.1	I am Malachi. And this is the message that the 
MAL.1.3	instead of Esau. And I turned Esau's hill country into a barren desert where jackals
MAL.1.4	Esau's descendants may say, “Although our nation Edom is in ruins, we will rebuild it.”
MAL.1.4	But I, the 
MAL.1.5	Israel, when you see this, you will shout, “The 
MAL.1.6	I, the 
MAL.1.7	You embarrass me by offering worthless food on my altar. Then you ask, “How have we embarrassed you?” You have done it by saying, “What's so great about the 
MAL.1.9	I am the 
MAL.1.10	I wish someone would lock the doors of my temple, so you would stop wasting time building fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you priests, and I refuse to accept any more of your offerings. 
MAL.1.11	From dawn until dusk my name is praised by every nation on this earth, as they burn incense and offer the proper sacrifices to me. 
MAL.1.12	But even you priests insult me by saying, “There's nothing special about the 
MAL.1.13	You get so disgusted that you even make vulgar signs at me.
MAL.1.14	Instead of offering the acceptable animals you have promised, you bring me those that are unhealthy. I will punish you for this, because I am the great King, the 
MAL.2.1	I, the 
MAL.2.2	You had better take seriously the need to honor my name. Otherwise, when you give a blessing, I will turn it into a curse. In fact, I have already done this, because you haven't taken to heart your duties as priests. 
MAL.2.3	I will punish your descendants and rub your faces in the manure from your animal sacrifices, and then be done with you.
MAL.2.5	 I blessed him with a full life, as I had promised, and he kept his part of the agreement by honoring me and respecting my name. 
MAL.2.6	He taught the truth and never told lies, and he led a lot of people to turn from sin, because he obeyed me and lived right.
MAL.2.7	You priests should be eager to spread knowledge, and everyone should come to you for instruction, because you speak for me, the 
MAL.2.8	But you have turned your backs on me. Your teachings have led others to do sinful things, and you have broken the agreement I made with your ancestor Levi. 
MAL.2.9	So I caused everyone to hate and despise you, because you disobeyed me and failed to treat all people alike.
MAL.2.10	Don't you know that we all have God as our Father? Didn't the one God create each of us? Then why do you cheat each other by breaking the agreement God made with your ancestors? 
MAL.2.11	You people in Judah and Jerusalem have been unfaithful to the 
MAL.2.12	I pray that the 
MAL.2.13	And what else are you doing? You cry noisily and flood the 
MAL.2.14	And why isn't God pleased? It's because he knows that each of you men has been unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young. You promised that she would be your partner, but now you have broken that promise. 
MAL.2.15	Didn't God create you and your wife to become like one person?
MAL.2.16	The 
MAL.2.17	You have worn out the 
MAL.2.17	You did it by saying, “The 
MAL.3.1	will send my messenger
MAL.3.1	to prepare the way for me.
MAL.3.1	Then suddenly the Lord
MAL.3.1	you are looking for

MAL.3.1	The messenger you desire
MAL.3.1	is coming with my promise,
MAL.3.1	and he is on his way.
MAL.3.3	The 
MAL.3.4	and the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem will please him, just as they did in the past.
MAL.3.5	The 
MAL.3.5	I'm now on my way to judge you. And I will quickly condemn all who practice witchcraft or cheat in marriage or tell lies in court or rob workers of their pay or mistreat widows and orphans or steal the property of foreigners or refuse to respect me.
MAL.3.7	even though you have ignored and disobeyed my laws ever since the time of your ancestors. But if you return to me, I will return to you.
MAL.3.7	And yet you ask, “How can we return?”
MAL.3.8	You people are robbing me, your God. And, here you are, asking, “How are we robbing you?”
MAL.3.8	You are robbing me of the offerings and of the ten percent that belongs to me.
MAL.3.9	That's why your whole nation is under a curse. 
MAL.3.10	 I am the 
MAL.3.11	I will also stop locusts
MAL.3.12	Everyone of every nation will talk about how I have blessed you and about your wonderful land. I, the 
MAL.3.13	You have said horrible things about me, and yet you ask, “What have we said?”
MAL.3.14	Here is what you have said: “It's foolish to serve the 
MAL.3.15	See how happy those arrogant people are. Everyone who does wrong is successful, and when they put God to the test, they always get away with it.”
MAL.3.16	All those who truly respected the 
MAL.3.17	Then the 
MAL.3.17	You people are precious to me, and when I come to bring justice, I will protect you, just as parents protect an obedient child. 
MAL.3.18	Then everyone will once again see the difference between those who obey me by doing right and those who reject me by doing wrong.
MAL.4.1	The day of judgment is certain to come. And it will be like a red-hot furnace with flames that burn up proud and sinful people, as though they were straw. Not a branch or a root will be left. I, the 
MAL.4.2	But for you that honor my name, victory will shine like the sun with healing in its rays, and you will jump around like calves at play. 
MAL.4.3	When I come to bring justice, you will trample those who are evil, as though they were ashes under your feet. I, the 
MAL.4.4	Don't ever forget the laws and teachings I gave my servant Moses on Mount Sinai.
MAL.4.6	He will lead children and parents to love each other more, so that when I come, I won't bring destruction to the land.
TOB.1.1	My name is Tobit, and this book tells my story. I belong to the Asiel clan of the tribe of Naphtali, and my ancestors include my father Tobiel, my grandfather Hananiel, and then Aduel, Gabael, and Raphael. 
TOB.1.2+TOB.1.3	 My hometown is Thisbe in Galilee. Thisbe is south of the town of Kedesh in Naphtali, and it is northwest of Hazor and north of Phogor. But when Shalmaneser
TOB.1.2+TOB.1.3	All my life, I have been honest and done what is right. And even after we were brought here to Nineveh, I still gave help to my relatives and other Jews, whenever they were in need.
TOB.1.4	When I was a young man in Israel, my tribe had already rejected the descendants of David
TOB.1.5	 But my relatives and everyone else in my tribe went to the town of Dan and offered sacrifices to the idol that King Jeroboam
TOB.1.7	 I would always take these offerings to the temple and give them to the priests at the altar. And I would always bring to Jerusalem the tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates,
TOB.1.8	When I was young, my father died and left me as an orphan. So it was my grandmother
TOB.1.9	When I was old enough, I married a woman from my own tribe,
TOB.1.10	Later, after we were led away to Assyria as prisoners, we went to live in the city of Nineveh.
TOB.1.11	But I decided to eat only what was allowed by the Law of Moses. 
TOB.1.12	Obeying God was the most important thing in my life. 
TOB.1.13	That's why God Most High made King Shalmaneser so pleased with me. Shalmaneser even put me in charge of buying all the supplies for his palace, 
TOB.1.14	and I held that position for the rest of his life. I used to travel to Media
TOB.1.15	Later, after Shalmaneser died and his son Sennacherib
TOB.1.16	While Shalmaneser was king, I often helped my relatives and other Jews when they were in need. 
TOB.1.17	 I gave them food when they were hungry and clothes when they had none. And whenever I saw the dead body of an Israelite tossed outside Nineveh's city wall,
TOB.1.18	King Sennacherib had invaded Judah and insulted God, the King of Heaven. So God punished him and his army, forcing him to run for his life. Sennacherib was angry, and he killed many Israelites when he got back to Assyria. But I secretly took the bodies away and buried them, and when Sennacherib looked for them, they were gone.
TOB.1.19	Someone in Nineveh went to the king and told him that I had secretly buried the bodies. And when I found out that the king knew what I had done and wanted me hunted down and killed, I was afraid and ran away. 
TOB.1.20	Then the king seized everything I owned—all I had left were my wife Anna and my son Tobias.
TOB.1.21	About 40 days later, Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons. They ran away to the Ararat mountains, and Sennacherib's other son Esarhaddon
TOB.1.22	My nephew Ahikar had been in charge of the accounting department and the treasury under Sennacherib, and he had also been responsible for Sennacherib's official ring
TOB.2.1	That year at the Harvest Festival,
TOB.2.2	But so much food was put on the table that I said to Tobias, “Son, many other Israelites were brought to Nineveh as captives. Go out and find someone who is poor and very loyal to God. Bring him here to share this meal with us. We will wait until you get back.”
TOB.2.3	Tobias went out to look for some Israelites who were poor. But he returned alone and said, “Father!”
TOB.2.3	“What's the matter?” I asked.
TOB.2.3	“An Israelite has been murdered!” Tobias answered. “He was strangled, then his body was thrown down and left lying in the street.”
TOB.2.4	We had not started eating, and so I jumped up from the table and went to the street where the body was. I brought it back to my own home and left it in one of the rooms, because I could not bury it until after dark.
TOB.2.5	 Then I washed myself and ate the festival meal, but I was very sad. 
TOB.2.6	 I remembered that the prophet Amos had said, “Your festivals and joyful singing will turn into sorrow,” and 
TOB.2.7	I began crying.
TOB.2.7	Later, after the sun had set, I went out and dug a grave and buried the body. 
TOB.2.8	My neighbors made fun of me and said to each other, “Tobit had to go into hiding once, when the king tried to have him arrested and put to death for burying people like this one. You would think Tobit would be afraid to do the same thing again.”
TOB.2.9	That night after I washed, I went into my courtyard and lay down next to the wall. The night was so hot that I wanted to sleep under the open sky. 
TOB.2.10	I didn't know that some sparrows were perched on the wall above me. Their fresh droppings fell right into my eyes, and a film of white spots started covering the clear part of my eyes.
TOB.2.10	I went to doctors and looked for a cure, but the more medicine they smeared on my eyes, the worse the white spots became, until at last I could not see a thing and was completely blind for four years. All my relatives felt sorry for me, and for two of those years, Ahikar gave me money to live on, but then he had to move to Elymais.
TOB.2.11+TOB.2.12	After Ahikar left Nineveh, my wife worked at home. She would weave a piece of cloth, and when it was finished, she would send it to the owners of the weaving business, and they would pay her. Then, on the seventh day of the month of Dystrus,
TOB.2.13	When she came back, the goat was going, “baa, baa.” So I yelled at her and said, “Where did you get that goat? You must have stolen it! Take it back to its owner. We shouldn't eat something that is stolen—it just wouldn't be right.”
TOB.2.14	She replied, “That goat was given to me as a gift along with the usual payment for my work!”
TOB.2.14	But I didn't believe her, and my face was red with anger as I told her to return the goat to its owners.
TOB.2.14	She answered, “Tobit, why have you changed so much? You used to be so kind, and, as everyone knows, you always did the right thing!”
TOB.3.1	My heart was filled with sorrow, and as I groaned and wept, I began praying:
TOB.3.2	You, Lord, rule the world
TOB.3.2	with honesty, justice,
TOB.3.2	and mercy.
TOB.3.3	Please be kind and forgive me,
TOB.3.3	especially for those sins
TOB.3.3	I didn't mean to commit.
TOB.3.3	And don't make me suffer
TOB.3.3	for the sins of my ancestors.
TOB.3.4	They disobeyed your commands,
TOB.3.4	and so you let us be robbed,
TOB.3.4	or killed,
TOB.3.4	or laughed at and insulted,
TOB.3.4	while being led away as captives
TOB.3.4	all over the world.
TOB.3.5	We didn't obey your commands;
TOB.3.5	we weren't faithful to you.
TOB.3.5	And so, you were right
TOB.3.5	to punish me many times.
TOB.3.6	Do whatever you want with me!
TOB.3.6	Take away my life.
TOB.3.6	Send my body to the grave,
TOB.3.6	and set me free
TOB.3.6	from life on earth.
TOB.3.6	I would rather die
TOB.3.6	than to live in such suffering
TOB.3.6	and great sorrow,
TOB.3.6	listening to insults
TOB.3.6	I don't deserve.
TOB.3.6	Set me free; take me away
TOB.3.6	to my eternal place.
TOB.3.6	But please, Lord,
TOB.3.6	don't turn your back on me.
TOB.3.7	That same day, in the city of Ecbatana in Media,
TOB.3.8	Sarah had gone through seven wedding ceremonies with seven different husbands, but each time, before she and her new husband had gone to bed on their wedding night, he was killed by the demon Asmodeus. That's why the servant had told her, “You've already been married seven times, and each of those times you have killed your husband before he could give you a son.
TOB.3.9	So why do you strike at us because your husbands have died? Just go where they are! We hope you never have any children!”
TOB.3.10	Sarah's heart was heavy with sorrow, and she was crying as she went to an upstairs room in her father's house, where she planned to hang herself. But after thinking about it, she decided:
TOB.3.10	No, I won't kill myself. Everyone would talk about my father behind his back. They would tell each other how he had only one child and that he loved her very much, and yet she had so many troubles that she hanged herself. My father would never get over his sorrow if I committed suicide. But I can't stand to listen to these insults any longer, so I will ask the Lord to take my life.
TOB.3.11	Sarah stretched out her arms toward a window and prayed:
TOB.3.11	I praise you, Lord,
TOB.3.11	for your mercy.
TOB.3.11	I pray that all your creation
TOB.3.11	will honor your name forever.
TOB.3.12	Now in prayer I look to you
TOB.3.13	and ask you to release me
TOB.3.13	from this life
TOB.3.13	and free me from these insults.
TOB.3.13	* 
TOB.3.14	You know I haven't disgraced
TOB.3.14	my father's name, or mine,
TOB.3.14	by committing the sin
TOB.3.14	of sleeping with a man
TOB.3.14	who wasn't my husband.
TOB.3.15	I have married seven men,
TOB.3.15	but all of them died.
TOB.3.15	I am an only child,
TOB.3.15	living far from my homeland.
TOB.3.15	There are no relatives here
TOB.3.15	who could marry me,
TOB.3.15	so we could have a child
TOB.3.15	to carry on the family line.
TOB.3.15	I have no reason to live, Lord.
TOB.3.15	But if you won't take my life,
TOB.3.15	at least stop people
TOB.3.15	from insulting me.
TOB.3.16	Sarah and I were praying to God at exactly the same time, and he decided 
TOB.3.17	 to send the angel Raphael to heal both of us. God told Raphael to get rid of the white covering from my eyes, so I could see again. And he told Raphael to free Sarah from the demon Asmodeus and arrange for her to marry Tobias, my son. And of course, Tobias had the right to marry her, since he was Sarah's closest relative.
TOB.3.17	As I was leaving my courtyard and going back inside my house, Sarah was coming down from the upstairs room.
TOB.4.1	Later that day, I remembered the silver coins I had left with Gabael in the town of Rages in Media. 
TOB.4.2	I said to myself, “Since I have prayed that I will die soon, I had better call in my son Tobias and explain to him about the silver coins.” 
TOB.4.3	So I called for Tobias and said:
TOB.4.3	My son, when I die, make sure I have a proper burial. Always respect your mother and do whatever she asks. Don't ever neglect her or cause her any sorrow. 
TOB.4.4	Remember, she risked her life to give birth to you! And when she dies, bury her next to me.
TOB.4.5	Honor the Lord and follow his teachings as long as you live. Always do what is right and refuse to do wrong. 
TOB.4.6	People who are honest are always successful. And if people do what is right 
TOB.4.7	 but
TOB.4.8	If you are rich, give generously to the poor. On the other hand, if you don't have much money, don't be afraid to give them at least a little. 
TOB.4.9	If you help the poor, then later, when you are in need, others will help you. 
TOB.4.10	Giving to the poor will keep you from going down into the dark world of the dead. 
TOB.4.11	Helping the poor is one of the best offerings you can give to God Most High.
TOB.4.12	My son, don't sleep with any woman except your wife and don't marry a foreigner. Some of our ancestors were prophets, so keep our family line pure and choose a woman from our own tribe. Remember that our ancestors Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all married their own relatives. God blessed their families with children and gave the land of Israel to their descendants. 
TOB.4.13	Have love in your heart for the people of your own nation. Don't be proud and think you are too good to marry an Israelite woman. Pride like that will confuse and destroy you, just as laziness will make you poor and starving.
TOB.4.14	Don't ever fail to pay your hired workers at the end of the day. Serve God, and you will be rewarded. Have self-control in everything you do. 
TOB.4.15	 Don't treat others in ways that you would not want to be treated. Don't be a heavy drinker or ever get drunk. 
TOB.4.16	Provide food and clothes for the poor. Give your extra money to those in need, and do it cheerfully! 
TOB.4.17	Honor the memory of good people, but not of the wicked. 
TOB.4.18	Show respect for the wise and never reject good advice. 
TOB.4.19	Always praise the Lord God and pray for his guidance, so you will be successful in whatever you do. No other nations have understanding, but the Lord can either make them wise or bring them to ruin.
TOB.4.19	My son, be sure to keep in mind everything I have told you to do.
TOB.4.20	Now I need to tell you that I once left 120,000 silver coins
TOB.4.21	 We have become poor, but don't be afraid. You will be rich if you show the proper respect for the Lord our God. So obey him and run from sin.
TOB.5.1	Tobias replied, “Father, I will do everything you have told me. 
TOB.5.2	But how can I possibly get the money? I don't know Gabael, and he doesn't know me! What can I do to prove I am your son, so he will let me have the money? And I don't even know the way to Media.”
TOB.5.3	I answered, “Twenty years ago Gabael and I signed an agreement that we cut in half. I kept one half and left the other with the coins. Find someone you can trust, and we will hire him to travel there and back with you. But be sure to get that money!”
TOB.5.5	Tobias asked, “Who are you?”
TOB.5.5	He answered, “I am an Israelite, just like you, and I have come here, looking for work.”
TOB.5.5	Tobias asked, “Do you know the way to the country of Media?”
TOB.5.6	“Of course!” he replied. “I've been there many times, and I know all the roads. I always stay with our relative Gabael in Rages, which is in the mountains. It takes about two days to get there from Ecbatana in the valley.”
TOB.5.7	Tobias said, “I want to hire you to go to Media with me. Please wait here until I tell my father.”
TOB.5.8	“All right,” he answered. “I'll wait, but don't take too long.”
TOB.5.9	When Tobias returned home, he said to me, “Father, I have found an Israelite, and he is one of our relatives!”
TOB.5.9	“Ask him to come here,” I replied. “I want to know something about his family and tribe, so I can decide if he can be trusted to go with you to Rages.”
TOB.5.10	Tobias invited the young man to come in and meet me, and I immediately greeted him. The young man replied, “Sir, I hope all goes well for you.”
TOB.5.10	“How can anything go well for me?” I answered. “I am as blind as a dead man in the dark! In fact, I may as well be dead, because I hear people, but I can't see them.”
TOB.5.10	The young man told me, “Cheer up! God will soon heal you.”
TOB.5.10	Then I said, “My son Tobias wants to go to Media. And I will pay you, if you can go along and show him the way.”
TOB.5.10	He replied, “Yes, I can. I've been there many times, and I know all the roads through the valleys and across the mountains.”
TOB.5.11	Then I said, “Tell me, my friend, what family and tribe are you from?”
TOB.5.12	“Why do you want to know?” the young man asked.
TOB.5.12	I answered, “I just want to know for certain who your father is and what your name is.”
TOB.5.13	The young man said, “My name is Azariah, and I am the son of Hananiah, a great man who was
TOB.5.14	I replied:
TOB.5.14	Then you are welcome here, my brother, and I pray that God will protect you. Please don't be upset with me; I had to find out for certain what family you are from. You really are one of our relatives, and you come from a good family. I knew Hananiah and his brother Nathan, the sons of Shemeliah. Hananiah was a great man! He and Nathan used to go to Jerusalem with me to worship, and they never worshiped other gods. Yes, you come from a very good family, and you are most welcome in our home! 
TOB.5.15	Now then, if you will go to Media with my son, I will pay you one silver coin for each day, as well as all your expenses and those of my son. 
TOB.5.16	 Plus, I will give you a bonus.
TOB.5.16	The young man answered, “Don't worry, I'll go! And when we return, we will be just as healthy as we are now, because the roads aren't dangerous.”
TOB.5.17	I replied, “I pray for God to bless you, my brother!”
TOB.5.17	Then I turned to my son and said, “Get whatever supplies you will need, then start on the journey with your friend. I pray that God in heaven will watch over you until you return, and that his angel will travel with the two of you and keep you safe.”
TOB.5.17	Before Tobias left, he kissed his mother and me goodbye, and I said, “Have a safe trip.” 
TOB.5.18	But his mother started crying and said to me, “Tobit, why are you sending my son away like this? He is the only person we can depend on, and he is always here to help us. 
TOB.5.19	I don't care about the money! Forget it, then our son won't have to risk his life. 
TOB.5.20	The Lord has blessed us with life, and that should be enough for us.”
TOB.5.21+TOB.5.22	I replied, “Don't be afraid, dear. You'll see—our son Tobias will come home just as healthy as he is now. Stop worrying! A good angel will go along, and Tobias will come home safely and bring the money with him.”
TOB.6.1	So she stopped crying.
TOB.6.1	Tobias and the angel left for Rages, 
TOB.6.2	with Tobias's dog
TOB.6.3	and Tobias went down to wash his feet. Suddenly a big fish jumped out of the water and tried to swallow one of his feet. Tobias let out a scream, 
TOB.6.4	but the angel said, “Quick—grab the fish!” So Tobias grabbed it and dragged it up on the river bank.
TOB.6.5	The angel said, “Cut it open and take out its heart, liver, and gall bladder, because these can be used for medicine. But throw the rest of its insides away.” 
TOB.6.6	Tobias obeyed the angel. Then he cooked and ate some of the fish and salted the rest to keep it from spoiling. And the next morning, the two of them again set out on their journey.
TOB.6.6	When they were getting near Media, 
TOB.6.7	Tobias asked the angel, “Azariah, how can these parts from that fish be used as medicine?”
TOB.6.8	The angel said, “If a demon is causing sickness or trouble for a man or a woman, take the heart and liver and burn them nearby. The smoke will stop the demon from bothering that person ever again. 
TOB.6.9	And if someone has white spots covering their eyes and cannot see, you can rub the gall bladder on their eyes and blow on the white spots, and that person will be able to see again.”
TOB.6.10	Tobias and Raphael had reached Media and were on their way to Ecbatana, 
TOB.6.11	when Raphael said, “Tobias, listen to me.”
TOB.6.11	“I'm listening,” Tobias answered.
TOB.6.11	Then Raphael said:
TOB.6.11	Tonight we will stay in the home of your relative Raguel. He has a daughter named Sarah, 
TOB.6.12	and she is his only child. You are her closest relative, and so you have the right to marry her and to inherit whatever her father leaves. He is a good man, and she is sensible, courageous, and very beautiful. 
TOB.6.13	Now listen carefully. Raguel knows you have the right to marry his daughter and that the Law of Moses teaches he must be put to death, if he lets any other man marry her. So tonight I will make the wedding arrangements with him, and you can take Sarah home as your bride when we return from Rages.
TOB.6.14	Tobias answered:
TOB.6.14	I have heard that she has already been married seven times, but each of the men died before going to bed with her. The rumor is that a demon killed them. 
TOB.6.15	It doesn't harm her; it just kills anyone who tries to marry her. I am an only child, and if I were killed by that demon, my parents would have great sorrow and be left with no one to bury them.
TOB.6.16	Raphael then said:
TOB.6.16	Don't you remember that your father told you to marry someone from his side of the family? So agree to marry Sarah, because I know that tonight she can be your bride. You don't have to worry about the demon if you pay close attention to my instructions. 
TOB.6.17	Before you enter the bedroom with Sarah, put some of the liver and heart of the fish on the burning incense. It will give off such a bad odor 
TOB.6.18	that the demon will leave and never return.
TOB.6.18	Then, before the two of you go to bed, you must stand up and pray that the Lord of Heaven will be merciful and watch over you. Don't worry! Even before the time of creation, God had already chosen Sarah to be your wife. You will save her from disgrace, and she will return to your home with you. I promise that the two of you will have sons, and you will love them very much. So don't argue with me!
TOB.6.18	As soon as Tobias learned that Sarah was related to him on his father's side of the family, he fell deeply in love with her.
TOB.7.1	When they entered the city of Ecbatana, Tobias said, “Azariah, take me straight to Raguel's home.” He did, and they found Raguel sitting beside the gate that led into his yard. They greeted him, and he answered, “I hope you are happy and healthy. Welcome to my home; please come in.”
TOB.7.2	Raguel turned to his wife Edna and said, “Doesn't this young man remind you of my relative Tobit?”
TOB.7.3	Edna asked Tobias and Raphael, “So, our new friends, where do you come from?”
TOB.7.3	They answered, “We are from the tribe of Naphtali, and we live in exile in Nineveh.”
TOB.7.4	“Do you know our relative Tobit?” Edna asked.
TOB.7.4	“Yes, we do,” they answered.
TOB.7.4	“Is he well?” she asked.
TOB.7.5	“He is alive and well,” they replied. Then Tobias added, “And he is my father!”
TOB.7.7	Raguel said, “I pray that God will bless you. Your father Tobit is a generous and honest man. It's a terrible shame that someone so good has become blind.” Then Raguel hugged Tobias and cried some more. 
TOB.7.8	Raguel's wife Edna and his daughter Sarah were also crying for Tobit. 
TOB.7.9	Then Raguel killed one of his sheep, so its meat could be prepared for dinner, and he made Tobias and Raphael feel welcome in his home.
TOB.7.9	After they had bathed and were eating dinner, Tobias whispered to Raphael, “Ask him to let me marry Sarah!”
TOB.7.10	Raguel overheard Tobias and said, “Eat and drink and have a good time. No one except you has the right to marry my daughter Sarah. You are my closest relative, and so I would not be allowed to let anyone else marry her. However, there are a few things I must tell you. 
TOB.7.11	I have already let Sarah marry seven of my relatives, and each one of them died when he went into the bedroom to sleep with her. So now, Tobias, eat and drink, and the Lord will help you.”
TOB.7.11	But Tobias replied, “I won't eat or drink anything until you make this marriage official.”
TOB.7.11	“Then I will make it official right now!” Raguel said. “Tobias, I give my daughter Sarah to you as your wife according to the laws in the Book of Moses. God himself wanted you to marry her, and from this moment you will forever be husband and wife. I pray that the Lord of Heaven will bless the two of you tonight, and that he will be merciful and give you peace.”
TOB.7.12	Raguel sent for his daughter, and when she came, he took her by the hand and led her over to Tobias. Then he said, “Tobias, Sarah is now your wife in keeping with the laws and teachings of the Book of Moses. Make sure that she arrives unharmed at your father's home, and I will pray that the God of Heaven will keep you safe as you travel.”
TOB.7.13	Raguel asked his wife Edna to bring him something to write on, and he wrote out a contract stating that Sarah was married to Tobias according to the Law of Moses. 
TOB.7.14	Then they all ate and drank.
TOB.7.15	Afterwards, Raguel said, “Edna, please get the other bedroom ready and take Sarah there.” 
TOB.7.16	So Edna made the bed and brought Sarah to the room. Edna wept for her daughter, then she wiped away the tears and said, “Don't worry, Sarah! Cheer up, because the God of Heaven will soon turn your sorrow into joy.” Then Edna left.
TOB.8.1	When everyone had finished eating and drinking, they decided it was time to go to bed, and they brought Tobias to the bedroom. 
TOB.8.2	Then Tobias remembered what Raphael had told him about the liver and the heart of the fish. So he took them out of the bag where he had kept them, and he put them on the burning incense. 
TOB.8.3	 The terrible odor made the demon go all the way to Egypt, where Raphael captured him and immediately tied him up so tightly that he couldn't move.
TOB.8.4	After Sarah's parents had left and the bedroom door was shut, Tobias stood up and said, “Sarah, my darling, please get up. Let's pray that the Lord will be merciful and watch over us.” 
TOB.8.5	 So she got up, and they begged the Lord to keep them safe. Tobias began by praying:
TOB.8.5	“God of our ancestors,
TOB.8.5	we praise your name;
TOB.8.5	all future generations
TOB.8.5	will praise you as well.
TOB.8.5	Heaven and the rest of creation
TOB.8.5	should always praise you.
TOB.8.6	‘It isn't good for the man
TOB.8.6	to live alone.
TOB.8.6	So we will make
TOB.8.6	a suitable partner for him,
TOB.8.6	someone like himself.’
TOB.8.6	Then you gave him Eve—
TOB.8.6	the perfect companion—
TOB.8.6	and they were the source
TOB.8.6	of the whole human race.
TOB.8.7	“I have married
TOB.8.7	this relative of mine—
TOB.8.7	not because of lust,
TOB.8.7	but because of love.
TOB.8.7	Please be kind and bless us
TOB.8.7	with a long life together.”
TOB.8.8	Tobias and Sarah both said, “Amen!” 
TOB.8.9	and then went to sleep for the night.
TOB.8.9	Later that night, Raguel woke up his servants and took them outside, where they dug a grave. 
TOB.8.10	He told them, “If Tobias dies and our neighbors find out, they will make fun of us and insult us.” 
TOB.8.11	When they had finished digging the grave, Raguel went into the house. He woke up his wife 
TOB.8.12	and told her, “Send one of the young servant women into the room to see if Tobias is still alive. If he is dead, then we can bury him now and no one will know about it.”
TOB.8.13	Edna lit a lamp and gave it to a servant, then she opened the door and sent her inside. Tobias and Sarah were both sound asleep. 
TOB.8.14	The servant came back out and told Raguel and Edna that Tobias was still alive, and that nothing bad had happened to him. 
TOB.8.15	They praised the God of Heaven, and Raguel
TOB.8.15	“Our God, you are worthy
TOB.8.15	to be praised for all time
TOB.8.15	with words that come
TOB.8.15	from hearts that are pure.
TOB.8.16	I offer my praise, because you
TOB.8.16	have given me happiness—
TOB.8.16	I expected a tragedy,
TOB.8.16	but it did not happen.
TOB.8.16	You had mercy on us
TOB.8.17	and on Sarah and Tobias,
TOB.8.17	the only children
TOB.8.17	of their parents.
TOB.8.17	Be merciful to these young people!
TOB.8.17	Keep them safe and bless them
TOB.8.17	with happiness.”
TOB.8.18	Then Raguel told his servants to fill in the grave before sunrise.
TOB.8.19	Raguel went to his wife and told her to bake a lot of bread. Then he went out to his herd of livestock and brought back two bulls and four rams, and he gave orders for his servants to slaughter them. And so, everyone began preparing for a big celebration.
TOB.8.20	Please stay
TOB.8.21	When you leave, you can take half of everything I own and return safely to your father. Then, whenever my wife Edna and I die, you can have the other half as well. Don't worry about a thing, Tobias. From now on, you will be a son to us, and we will care for you as much as we do for our daughter Sarah, your wife.
TOB.9.1	Tobias went to Raphael and said:
TOB.9.2+TOB.9.3+TOB.9.4	Azariah, my friend, you know that my father has been counting the days it should take us to go to Rages and back, and if we are even one day late, he will be worried sick. You heard how Raguel has made a solemn promise that I must stay,
TOB.9.5	Raphael took four servants and two camels to the town of Rages in Media, where he stayed with Gabael. Raphael gave him the agreement and told him how Tobit's son Tobias had recently married and had invited him to the wedding celebration. Gabael went and got the bags of silver coins and counted them as he gave them to Raphael. All the bags were there, and none of them had been opened. Raphael and Gabael loaded the bags onto the camels,
TOB.9.6	and early the next morning, the two men got up and went to the wedding celebration at Raguel's home in Ecbatana. Tobias was eating
TOB.9.6	Gabael started weeping and said, “You are honest and good, just like your father Tobit. And he was such a generous man! Now I pray that God will bless you from heaven, and also that he will bless your wife and her parents. I praise God, Tobias, because you are just like your father.”
TOB.10.1	“I knew how long it should take Tobias to travel to the town of Rages and back, and I counted each day. But when the time had gone by, 
TOB.10.2+TOB.10.3	I became so worried, that at last I wondered out loud, ‘What could be keeping Tobias? Maybe Gabael is dead, and there is no one else to give him the money.’ ”
TOB.10.4	Anna replied, “I'm sure it's my son who is dead!” Then she started weeping and cried out, 
TOB.10.5	“I've never known such sorrow! My son made my eyes sparkle. Why did I ever let him go?”
TOB.10.6	“But I kept trying to encourage her by saying, ‘Now my darling, don't cry. There's no need to worry—I'm sure Tobias is all right. After all, the man who went with him is a relative of ours, and he can be trusted. Something unexpected must have delayed them. Tobias will be home soon, so you don't need to worry or even talk about it anymore.’ ”
TOB.10.7	“You're the one who should stop talking!” she answered. “Don't try to hide the truth from me. I know my son is dead.”
TOB.10.7	Each morning Anna hurried out and started watching the road, hoping to see our son, and no one could change her mind. Then at sunset, she would come back inside and weep bitterly all night long, without getting a wink of sleep.
TOB.10.7	Raguel had promised his daughter a wedding celebration of 14 days. And at the end of those two weeks, Tobias went to him and said, “Soon after I arrived here, I told you my father was in bad health. I am sure that by now, both he and my mother must think I am dead and that they will never see me again. So please let me return home.”
TOB.10.8	But Raguel replied, “Stay with us, my son, and I will send someone to tell your father the news about you.”
TOB.10.9	“Sir, I beg you,” Tobias answered, “please let me return home!”
TOB.10.10	So Raguel immediately agreed to let Tobias leave with Sarah, and he gave Tobias half of everything he owned, including his slaves, his oxen and sheep, his donkeys and camels, and his clothing, money, and household things. 
TOB.10.11	Then, before sending the two of them away with his blessing, he hugged Tobias and said, “Goodbye, my son. I hope you don't have any trouble along the way. And I now ask the Lord to make you and your wife successful and to bless you with children. I pray that I will see them before I die.”
TOB.10.12	After this, Raguel kissed Sarah and said, “My daughter, you must now go to live with
TOB.10.12	Then Raguel's wife Edna said, “Tobias, my son, I pray that the Lord will let you and Sarah return here before I die, so I may see my grandchildren. And, with God as my witness, I place my daughter Sarah in your care. Please don't ever cause her any sorrow. My son, I am your mother, and Sarah is your dear wife. I pray that God will always bless our family. Now I wish you a safe journey.” Then she kissed them both and said goodbye.
TOB.10.13	As Tobias was leaving, he was so happy that he shouted:
TOB.10.13	“I praise the Lord
TOB.10.13	of heaven and earth,
TOB.10.13	the King of all creation,
TOB.10.13	who made my trip successful.
TOB.10.13	Raguel and Edna,
TOB.10.13	I will show you proper respect
TOB.10.13	for as long as I live.”
TOB.10.13	Then he told them goodbye.
TOB.11.1	When Tobias and the angel Raphael came near the town of Kaserin, not far from Nineveh, Raphael said, 
TOB.11.2	“Tobias, you know the condition your father was in when we left. 
TOB.11.3	So why don't you and I run on ahead of your wife Sarah and get things ready at the house?” 
TOB.11.4	Then as the two of them ran along, followed by Tobias's dog,
TOB.11.5	Meanwhile, Anna was sitting beside the road, just staring. 
TOB.11.6	When she saw Tobias coming, she called out to her husband, “Our son is coming down the road! And that man is with him.”
TOB.11.7	Before they got there, Raphael said to Tobias, “Your father's eyes will be healed. 
TOB.11.8	Just smear the gall bladder of the fish on his eyes, and the film-like stuff that is covering them will shrink and peel off. Then your father will be able to see again.”
TOB.11.9	Anna ran to Tobias and hugged him. Then she said, “Now that I have seen you, my son, I can die in peace.” And she began crying.
TOB.11.10	I jumped up and went stumbling through the gate leading out to the road. Tobias hurried toward me, 
TOB.11.11+TOB.11.12	 carrying the gall bladder. He breathed on my eyes and said, “Don't worry!” He immediately steadied me and started rubbing the gall bladder on my eyes. 
TOB.11.13	Then, with both hands, he began at the corners of my eyes and peeled away the stuff that had made me blind.
TOB.11.13	I hugged Tobias 
TOB.11.14	and started crying, then I said, “I can see you, my son! Now life is worth living again.”
TOB.11.14	“Praise God and his great name!
TOB.11.14	Praise his holy angels!
TOB.11.14	I pray for God to be with us!
TOB.11.14	Praise his angels forever.
TOB.11.15	He caused me great suffering,
TOB.11.15	but now I see my son Tobias!”
TOB.11.15	I kept on celebrating and praising God as loud as I could.
TOB.11.15	After a while, Tobias told me how successful his travels had been—not only had he recovered the money, but he had married Sarah, who was near the gate of Nineveh at that very moment.
TOB.11.16	I started walking toward the city gate, still celebrating and praising God. But those who saw me hurrying along were amazed that no one was leading me. 
TOB.11.17	So I told everyone that God had been merciful and had healed my eyes. And when I saw Sarah, I gave her my blessing and said, “My daughter, we welcome you into our family! I praise God for bringing you to us, and I ask him to bless your parents and my son and you. Our home is your home, and I pray God will bless you with health and happiness in this place. Welcome!”
TOB.11.17	On that same day, every Jew in Nineveh joined in the celebration, 
TOB.11.18	and my nephews Ahikar
TOB.12.1	After the wedding celebration, I called in Tobias and said, “My son, it's time to pay the man who went with you, and he deserves a bonus.”
TOB.12.2	Tobias answered, “How much should I give him? We could give him half of what I brought back, and we would still have plenty for ourselves. 
TOB.12.3	After all, he got me back home safely, he healed my wife, he brought back the silver coins to you, and he healed you. So how much should I give him as a bonus?”
TOB.12.4	“My son,” I replied, “he deserves to get half of everything he brought back.”
TOB.12.5	Tobias called in Raphael and said, “You have earned half of everything you brought back. And now it's time for us to say goodbye.”
TOB.12.6	Then Raphael spoke to Tobias and me in private and said:
TOB.12.6	“Be sure to praise and honor God by telling everyone the good things he has done for you. Celebrate God's name with praises and with songs, and don't ever hesitate to tell others about him. 
TOB.12.7	Don't tell anyone the secrets of a king, but honor God by letting others know what he has done for you.
TOB.12.7	“If you do what is right, nothing bad will happen to you. 
TOB.12.8	 It is good to pray sincerely. And it is better to be honest and generous to the poor than to be wealthy, but dishonest. You are better off giving to the poor than getting lots of gold, 
TOB.12.9	 because giving to the poor saves you from death and washes away every sin. People who are generous to the poor will have a full life, 
TOB.12.10	but people who sin and are dishonest are actually harming themselves.”
TOB.12.11	Raphael said to Tobias and me:
TOB.12.11	“Now I will tell you the whole truth about everything that has happened. In fact, I have already hinted at it when I said, ‘Don't tell anyone the secrets of a king, but honor God by letting others know what he has done for you.’ 
TOB.12.12	 Tobit, when you and Sarah prayed, I was the one who presented your prayers to the glorious God, and when you buried the dead, I told God what you had done. 
TOB.12.13	When you left the banquet to bury that man who had been murdered, 
TOB.12.14	God sent me to test you, and he also sent me to heal you and to help your daughter-in-law Sarah. 
TOB.12.15	 I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand in the presence of the glorious God.”
TOB.12.16	Tobias and I were so terribly frightened that we fell face down. 
TOB.12.17	But Raphael said:
TOB.12.17	“Don't worry! Just remember to always praise God. 
TOB.12.18	Don't give me the credit; it was God who did all of this. That's why you must sing praises to God every day. 
TOB.12.19	When you thought you saw me eating and drinking, it only seemed that way. 
TOB.12.20	So praise God and thank him for as long as you live. Now I will return to the one who sent me, and I command you to write down everything that has happened to you. Then Raphael went up into heaven.”
TOB.12.21	Tobias and I stood up, but we could no longer see Raphael. 
TOB.12.22	Then we began singing praises to God because of the great things he had done, especially for sending the angel to us.
TOB.13.1	I said:
TOB.13.1	I will praise the eternal God,
TOB.13.1	who rules forever.
TOB.13.2	God punishes and shows mercy;
TOB.13.2	he can send people down
TOB.13.2	to the world of the dead,
TOB.13.2	or rescue them
TOB.13.2	from great destruction.
TOB.13.2	No one can escape his power.
TOB.13.3	People of Israel,
TOB.13.3	God scattered you
TOB.13.3	among the nations,
TOB.13.3	so tell them about him.
TOB.13.4	And while everyone listens,
TOB.13.4	you should praise him,
TOB.13.4	because he will forever be
TOB.13.4	our Lord and God and Father.
TOB.13.5	He will punish you if you sin,
TOB.13.5	but then he will have mercy
TOB.13.5	and gather you
TOB.13.5	where you are scattered.
TOB.13.6	If you turn to God
TOB.13.6	with all your heart
TOB.13.6	and are faithful to him,
TOB.13.6	he will turn to you once again;
TOB.13.6	no longer will he refuse
TOB.13.6	to help you.
TOB.13.6	Shout praises to him,
TOB.13.6	because he has been so kind
TOB.13.6	and faithful to you,
TOB.13.6	and he will rule as king forever!
TOB.13.6	I must live far from my country,
TOB.13.6	but I will still praise God
TOB.13.6	and tell this nation of sinners
TOB.13.6	how great and powerful he is.
TOB.13.6	I will say, “Turn from your sins,
TOB.13.6	and obey God.
TOB.13.6	Who knows?
TOB.13.6	Maybe God will be kind
TOB.13.6	and have mercy on you.”
TOB.13.7	I will praise my God,
TOB.13.7	the King of Heaven,
TOB.13.7	and celebrate his greatness.
TOB.13.8	Praise him, people of Jerusalem.
TOB.13.9	because you have sinned,
TOB.13.9	but if you obey him,
TOB.13.9	he will again be kind to you.
TOB.13.10	The Lord is good, so praise him
TOB.13.10	and honor his kingdom;
TOB.13.10	then he will again allow you
TOB.13.10	to set up his sacred tent
TOB.13.10	and celebrate there.
TOB.13.10	He will cheer up your exiles
TOB.13.10	and always show his love
TOB.13.10	to those who are suffering.
TOB.13.11	Jerusalem, you will give light
TOB.13.11	to the whole world,
TOB.13.11	and people will come to you
TOB.13.11	from faraway nations,
TOB.13.11	bringing gifts for your holy God,
TOB.13.11	the King of Heaven.
TOB.13.11	One generation after another
TOB.13.11	will celebrate in you,
TOB.13.11	the city God has chosen.
TOB.13.12	God will put a curse
TOB.13.12	on those who insult you,
TOB.13.12	and on those who capture you
TOB.13.12	and tear down your walls,
TOB.13.12	destroy your towers,
TOB.13.12	and burn your homes.
TOB.13.12	But he will bless anyone
TOB.13.12	who shows respect for you.
TOB.13.13	Celebrate, because the Lord
TOB.13.13	will gather together those
TOB.13.13	who are faithful to him,
TOB.13.13	and he will bless them
TOB.13.13	for all time.
TOB.13.14	He will bless those
TOB.13.14	who love you, Jerusalem—
TOB.13.14	those who are happy
TOB.13.14	when you have peace,
TOB.13.14	and who are sad
TOB.13.14	when you have trouble.
TOB.13.14	They will celebrate with you
TOB.13.14	and see your joy forever.
TOB.13.15	I praise the Lord,
TOB.13.15	the Great King,
TOB.13.16	because, Jerusalem,
TOB.13.16	you will be rebuilt,
TOB.13.16	and you will be his home
TOB.13.16	for all time.
TOB.13.16	I will be glad
TOB.13.16	if one of my descendants
TOB.13.16	can see your glory
TOB.13.16	and praise the King of Heaven.
TOB.13.16	Your gates will be made
TOB.13.16	of sapphires and emeralds,
TOB.13.16	and your walls will be covered
TOB.13.16	with other jewels.
TOB.13.16	Your towers will be of gold
TOB.13.16	all the way to the top.
TOB.13.16	The streets within you
TOB.13.16	will be paved with rubies
TOB.13.16	and jewels from Ophir.
TOB.13.17	Your gates will sing with joy,
TOB.13.17	and your houses will shout,
TOB.13.17	“Praise the Lord!
TOB.13.17	Praise the God of Israel!”
TOB.13.17	And God's people will praise
TOB.13.17	his holy name forever.
TOB.14.1	That is how I ended my song of praise.
TOB.14.1	Tobit died peacefully at the age of 112 and was honored at his burial in Nineveh. 
TOB.14.2	He was 62 when he became blind, and after his sight was restored, he was once again wealthy and generous to the poor. He was always praising God and telling others about God's power.
TOB.14.3	Just before Tobit died, he called in his son and said:
TOB.14.3	Tobias, take your children 
TOB.14.4	 and go to Media! I believe what God said when he told the prophet Nahum what will happen to Nineveh and Assyria. And time after time, God gave messages to other prophets in Israel, telling them what will happen. Every message they spoke will come true at the right time. You will be safe in Media, but not here in Assyria or in Babylonia.
TOB.14.4	Our relatives, the people of Israel, will be taken from that good land and scattered in other countries. The whole land of Israel, including the cities of Samaria and Jerusalem, will be deserted. Even God's temple will suffer and lie in ashes for a while. 
TOB.14.5	Then God will have mercy on Israel again, and he will return them to their own land. They will rebuild the temple, but it won't be as glorious a building, until the time that all of God's promises come true. And when that happens, God will bring Israel back from their exile, and they will rebuild Jerusalem into a truly glorious city. God's temple will also be rebuilt there, just as the prophets have said.
TOB.14.6	All the Gentiles on earth will stop worshiping idols, because idols only deceive people and lead them away from the truth. The Gentiles will then turn to God and worship only him. 
TOB.14.7	They will praise and obey the eternal God.
TOB.14.7	God will protect those Israelites who are truly loyal to him, and at that time, he will gather them together and bring them back to Jerusalem. God will give them the land he once gave to Abraham, and they will live in safety there forever.
TOB.14.8+TOB.14.9	Now, my son and my grandchildren, I give you these commands: Worship and obey the Lord. Be faithful and do what pleases him. Tell your own children to do right and to be generous to the poor. Always think about God, and don't just pretend to praise God—praise him with all your strength.
TOB.14.8+TOB.14.9	My son, you must leave Nineveh 
TOB.14.10	on the same day your mother dies and you bury her beside me. Don't even spend that night here. Nineveh is a very evil place, and its people aren't even ashamed that they are so dishonest. Just look at what Nadab did—he tried to kill Ahikar,
TOB.14.11	So, my children, you can see that God will protect you if you give to the poor; but when you do what is evil, you will be killed. And now, my life is slipping away.
TOB.14.11	They helped Tobit lie down on his bed, and when he died, they buried him with honor.
TOB.14.12	Some time later, Tobias's mother Anna died, and he buried her beside his father. Then Tobias and his wife Sarah moved to the city of Ecbatana in Media, where he lived with his father-in-law Raguel and his mother-in-law Edna. 
TOB.14.13	He treated them with great respect and took care of them until they died; then he buried them. Tobias inherited all Raguel's property, in addition to what had belonged to his own father Tobit.
TOB.14.13	Everyone respected Tobias, 
TOB.14.14	and he died at the age of 117. 
TOB.14.15	 But he lived long enough to hear that Nineveh had been destroyed, and to see its people being led as prisoners into Media by Cyaxares,
JDT.1.1	During the years that King Nebuchadnezzar ruled Assyria from the capital city of Nineveh,
JDT.1.1	In the twelfth year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule, 
JDT.1.2	Arphaxad began fortifying Ecbatana by building a wall around it that was over 31 meters high and 22 meters thick. The wall was made out of cut stones, each one of them 1.3 meters wide and 2.6 meters long. 
JDT.1.3	Beside each gate into the city, he built a tower 44.5 meters tall with a base that was 27 meters wide. 
JDT.1.4	Each gate had an opening 31 meters high and 18 meters wide—big enough for his powerful army to march out in rows on its way into battle.
JDT.1.5	In that same year, Nebuchadnezzar went to war against Arphaxad in the large valley near the city of Ragau.
JDT.1.6	Many other nations sent their armies to help Nebuchadnezzar fight Arphaxad, including those from the mountains south of Ecbatana, those living along the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Hydaspes Rivers,
JDT.1.7	Nebuchadnezzar sent messengers to ask the people of nearby regions and cities to join him in this battle. His messengers went to the Persians and to regions west of Assyria, including Cilicia, Damascus, Lebanon, and Anti-Lebanon. They also went to the people who lived along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea 
JDT.1.8	and to those living in the regions of Carmel, Gilead, northern Galilee, and Jezreel Valley. 
JDT.1.9	Nebuchadnezzar even asked the people from the city of Samaria and its nearby towns, as well as those from Jerusalem, Bethany, Chelous, Kadesh, and those living as far west as the Nile River. His messengers went all the way to the Egyptian region of Goshen, including the cities of Tahpanhes, Raamses, 
JDT.1.10	Tanis, and Memphis, until they reached the border of Ethiopia.
JDT.1.11	But all of these people ignored Nebuchadnezzar's message and refused to be his allies in his battle against Arphaxad. None of them thought Nebuchadnezzar was someone to fear, and so they sent his messengers back, empty-handed and embarrassed.
JDT.1.12	Nebuchadnezzar was so angry that he swore he would give up his entire kingdom, if he did not kill everyone who had refused to help him—all the people of Cilicia, Damascus, Syria, Moab, Ammon, Judea, and Egypt, as far as the coasts of the two seas.
JDT.1.13	In the seventeenth year of his rule, Nebuchadnezzar led his army into battle against Arphaxad. It was a complete victory for Nebuchadnezzar! He defeated all of Arphaxad's troops, including his entire cavalry and all his chariots. 
JDT.1.14	After Nebuchadnezzar had captured every town in Media, he attacked the capital city of Ecbatana. He destroyed its guard towers, then stole everything of value from the marketplace and turned the proud city into a pile of ruins. 
JDT.1.15	He also captured Arphaxad in the mountains near Ragau and killed him with spears.
JDT.1.16	After that, Nebuchadnezzar and his large army returned to Nineveh with everything they had taken. Then they rested and celebrated for four months.
JDT.2.1	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule, on the twenty-second day of the first month,
JDT.2.2	Nebuchadnezzar called together his highest officials and respected leaders, then explained that some nations had refused to be his allies.
JDT.2.3	and every one of his officials agreed it must be done.
JDT.2.4	After that meeting, King Nebuchadnezzar of Assyria
JDT.2.5	I am Nebuchadnezzar, the great king, the ruler of the earth! I want you to choose 120,000 foot soldiers and 12,000 cavalry troops—all of them brave and experienced in war. 
JDT.2.6	Then attack the nations of the west,
JDT.2.7	Tell those nations that I am prepared to attack, and so they have no choice but to surrender.
JDT.2.8	The valleys and gorges will be filled with wounded people, and the land will be flooded, because dead bodies will block every stream and river. 
JDT.2.9	Then I will capture everyone left alive and scatter them all over the earth.
JDT.2.10	Holofernes, I want you to go ahead of me and take over their land. Keep control of the nations that surrender to you, and when I arrive, I will punish them myself. 
JDT.2.11	But destroy those nations that refuse to surrender. Show them no mercy and command your troops to take their possessions. 
JDT.2.12	As surely as I rule this powerful kingdom, I will keep my solemn promise to punish those nations. 
JDT.2.13	I am your king, so don't disobey any of my commands. Go and follow every order I have given you.
JDT.2.14	Holofernes left and called together all the commanders and officers of the Assyrian army. 
JDT.2.15	Just as Nebuchadnezzar had ordered, he chose 120,000 of the best foot soldiers and 12,000 cavalry troops who were experts with bows and arrows. 
JDT.2.16	Holofernes prepared this army for war. 
JDT.2.17	He took enough camels, donkeys, and mules to carry all the equipment, and he also took a large number of sheep, oxen, and goats for food. 
JDT.2.18	Each soldier was given plenty food and water and was paid a huge amount of gold and silver from the royal treasury.
JDT.2.19	Holofernes and his army marched out with chariots, cavalry, and foot soldiers to invade the western nations, while King Nebuchadnezzar stayed in Nineveh. 
JDT.2.20	 Holofernes had more troops than could be counted; they were like a swarm of locusts or like grains of sand on the seashore.
JDT.2.21	They left Nineveh, and after they had marched three days, they reached the valley around the city of Bectileth, where they set up camp across from the city, near the mountains north of Cilicia. 
JDT.2.22	From there, Holofernes led his entire army of soldiers and chariots into the foothills. 
JDT.2.23	He completely destroyed the nations of Libya and Lydia, then took everything from the Rassisites and the Ishmaelites living on the edge of the desert south of Chellean.
JDT.2.24	Holofernes and his army crossed
JDT.2.25	He took over the territory of Cilicia, killing everyone who tried to resist him. Then he went as far as the southern border of Japheth, near Arabia. 
JDT.2.26	After his army had surrounded the Midianites, he burned down their tents and slaughtered their sheep. 
JDT.2.27	Next, he led his army into the valley around Damascus. It was during the wheat harvest, and so he first burned all the wheat fields, then he slaughtered the sheep and goats. He raided the towns and tore up the countryside, killing all the young men.
JDT.2.28	Everyone living along the Mediterranean Sea was terrified of Holofernes, including those in the cities of Tyre, Sidon, Sur, Ocina, Jamnia, Azotus, and Ascalon.
JDT.3.1	So they sent messengers to Holofernes to say: 
JDT.3.2	“We are servants of the great King Nebuchadnezzar. We surrender to you, General Holofernes. Do to us whatever you want. 
JDT.3.3	Our buildings, our land, our wheat fields, our livestock, and our tents are yours. 
JDT.3.4	Every town belongs to you. Treat us as you please, because we are your slaves.”
JDT.3.5	After Holofernes had listened to their message, 
JDT.3.6	he led his army to the Mediterranean coast, where he stationed guards in every walled city and took the best men from these cities as soldiers.
JDT.3.7	The people in these cities and in the surrounding countryside welcomed Holofernes by wearing flowers around their necks and playing tambourines and dancing. 
JDT.3.8	 But when Holofernes arrived, he tore down all their places of worship
JDT.3.9	Holofernes then marched into Jezreel Valley, not far from the city of Dothan, which is in sight of the hills in Judea. 
JDT.3.10	He set up camp between the cities of Geba and Scythopolis, and stayed there a month while he gathered the supplies his army needed.
JDT.4.1	The Israelites living in Judea heard that General Holofernes of the Assyrian army had destroyed the places of worship in the surrounding nations and that he had stolen everything of value. 
JDT.4.2	They were terrified because he was coming to do the same thing to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord their God. 
JDT.4.3	The people had just returned from Babylonia, where they had lived as captives. And they had only recently rededicated the temple, the altar, and the sacred utensils, after they had been made unfit for worshiping the Lord.
JDT.4.4	So the Israelites warned the people living in the territory of Samaria, including the towns of Kona, Beth-Horon, Belmain, Jericho, Choba, and Aesora, and those living in the valley near Salem.
JDT.4.5	Since their fields had already been harvested, they immediately began preparing for war by setting up defenses in the hill country, by fortifying the towns there, and by storing up food.
JDT.4.6	Joakim the high priest was in Jerusalem at the time. He wrote to the people living in Bethulia and Betomesthaim,
JDT.4.7	Joakim wrote, “Set up defenses at once in the mountain passes that lead into Judea. They are wide enough for only two people to use at a time, so you'll easily stop enemy troops from invading.”
JDT.4.8	The Israelites obeyed Joakim and the other leaders of Israel who were meeting together in Jerusalem.
JDT.4.9	All the men of Israel prayed sincerely and went without eating to show their sorrow. 
JDT.4.10	 Then everyone in the country wrapped sackcloth
JDT.4.11	Every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem went to the temple and bowed low to the ground. They put ashes on their heads and spread out sackcloth in front of the temple 
JDT.4.12	and covered the altar with it. Then the men prayed aloud to the Lord their God, asking him not to let their wives and children be captured and taken away or to let their towns be destroyed. They begged him not to give foreigners the pleasure of taking over the temple and polluting the place of worship. 
JDT.4.13	 The Lord heard their prayers and saw how much they were suffering.
JDT.4.13	For several days, the people of Judea and Jerusalem stayed there at the temple of the Lord All-Powerful and went without eating. 
JDT.4.14	 Joakim the high priest and the priests who served in the temple wore sackcloth as they offered the daily sacrifices to please the Lord,
JDT.4.15	They also sprinkled ashes on their turbans and prayed aloud, asking the Lord to have mercy on the entire nation of Israel.
JDT.5.1	General Holofernes of the Assyrian army heard that the Israelites had prepared for war by setting up defenses in the mountain passes, by fortifying the hills, and by blocking paths through the valleys. 
JDT.5.2	He was furious! So he called together the leaders of the Moabites, the army commanders of the Ammonites, and the rulers of the nations along the Mediterranean coast. 
JDT.5.3	He said to them:
JDT.5.3	I want to know about these people who have settled in the hills of Canaan. You also live in Canaan, so tell me what cities they control, how large their army is, and what makes them powerful. Tell me who their king is and who commands their army. 
JDT.5.4	And find out why they're the only nation in the west that refuses to surrender to me!
JDT.5.5	Achior the Ammonite leader answered:
JDT.5.5	Sir, I am your loyal servant. Please listen as I tell you about the people who live up in the hill country near your army camp. I will be completely honest.
JDT.5.6	These Israelites are really descendants of the Babylonians.
JDT.5.7+JDT.5.8	But the Israelites refused to follow the customs of their ancestors or to worship the Babylonian gods. Instead, they started worshiping another God, the God of Heaven. The Babylonians immediately forced the Israelites to leave their country, and they settled in Mesopotamia and lived there a long time. 
JDT.5.9	 Later, their God told them to leave Mesopotamia and settle in Canaan, where they became very rich and owned a lot of gold and silver and livestock.
JDT.5.11	 The king of Egypt disgraced them by making them his slaves and by mistreating them and forcing them to make bricks. 
JDT.5.12	 But the Israelites prayed to their God, and he severely punished the whole nation of Egypt. So the Egyptians made the Israelites leave. 
JDT.5.13	 The God of the Israelites then caused the Red Sea
JDT.5.14	 He later led them to Mount Sinai and Kadesh-Barnea.
JDT.5.14	Along the way, the Israelites forced out everyone who was living in the desert,
JDT.5.15	 and they settled in the land belonging to the Amorites. They also wiped out the people in the region of Heshbon before crossing the Jordan River and taking control of the entire hill country of Canaan. 
JDT.5.16	There they forced out the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Shechemites, and the Gergesites. The Israelites have lived in Canaan ever since.
JDT.5.18	But as soon as they ignored his teachings, he let them be defeated by enemy after enemy, until finally they were taken away as captives to a foreign nation. The temple of their God was destroyed, and their cities were taken over by enemies.
JDT.5.19	But now the Israelites have started worshiping their God again, and they have returned home from the places where they were scattered. The Israelites are living in Jerusalem, where their temple again stands, and in the hill country where no other people have settled.
JDT.5.20	Sir, if we find out that these Israelites have started disobeying their God again, we can attack and defeat them, even if they have accidentally sinned against him. 
JDT.5.21	But if they are innocent, you should leave them alone. Their God will defend them, and every nation in the world would laugh at us.
JDT.5.22	When Achior finished speaking, the people standing around the tent started complaining. The commanders of Holofernes' army, together with the Moabites and the people from the Mediterranean coast, demanded that Achior be beaten to death. 
JDT.5.23	They said, “We aren't afraid of those weak Israelites! They don't have the strength to fight. 
JDT.5.24	Let's attack them, General Holofernes! Your powerful army will easily defeat them.”
JDT.6.1	The noise from the crowd of people died down. Then General Holofernes of the Assyrian army said to Achior
JDT.6.2	Achior, who do you think you are, coming here with your hired soldiers from Ephraim?
JDT.6.3	We are Nebuchadnezzar's servants, and we will defeat them as if their entire army were only one soldier. They won't stand a chance against our powerful cavalry. 
JDT.6.4	We will destroy them completely. The hills of Israel will be covered with their blood, and the valleys will be filled with their dead bodies. The Israelites will disappear from the earth, and not a trace of them will be left. This is the command of King Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of the whole earth, and everything he said will happen.
JDT.6.5	Achior, you're nothing but a hired soldier from Ammon, and you have insulted the nation of Assyria. You will not see me again until I return from taking revenge on those people who escaped from Egypt. 
JDT.6.6	Then my troops will put you to death, and you will die like one of the Israelites.
JDT.6.7	Or better yet, my men will take you into their hill country and leave you in one of their towns, 
JDT.6.8	where you will die with them. 
JDT.6.9	Don't look so upset, Achior. After all, you're the one who believes the Israelites can't be defeated. Just remember that I will do everything I have said!
JDT.6.10	The servants who waited on General Holofernes were there in his tent. So he ordered them to take Achior to the Israelite town of Bethulia and hand him over to its people. 
JDT.6.11	The servants obeyed and led Achior from the Assyrian camp, through the valley, and into the hill country, until they got to the springs of water just below Bethulia.
JDT.6.12	When the men of Bethulia saw the Assyrians coming with Achior, they grabbed their weapons and ran to the top of the hill where the town was built. They were able to stop the Assyrians from getting any closer by using slings to throw stones at them. 
JDT.6.13	The Assyrians had to hide among the foothills around Bethulia, and so they tied up Achior and left him at the bottom of the hill. Then they returned to their camp.
JDT.6.14	Some time later, the Israelites came down the hill and untied Achior, then led him back to Bethulia. They took him to the town officials, 
JDT.6.15	who at the time were Uzziah, Chabris, and Charmis.
JDT.6.16	They called together the other leaders of Bethulia, while all the young men and women ran to join them. Achior was then brought in, and Uzziah asked him exactly what had happened.
JDT.6.17	Achior said that he had been at the meeting between Holofernes and the commanders of the Assyrian army, and he repeated everything he had heard. Then he told the crowd what Holofernes himself had promised to do to the Israelites.
JDT.6.18	When the people of Bethulia heard this, they got on their knees and prayed, 
JDT.6.19	“Our Lord God of heaven, these arrogant enemies have completely insulted us. Have pity and be kind to us, because we are your people.”
JDT.6.20	Then they encouraged Achior for what he had done and praised him very much. 
JDT.6.21	Uzziah took him to his own house, where he held a feast for all the town leaders. They prayed to the God of Israel all night long and asked him to help them.
JDT.7.1	The next day, Holofernes commanded his entire army, together with his allies, to march toward the town of Bethulia and take control of the mountain passes leading there, then to attack the Israelites. 
JDT.7.2	His army was very large—170,000 foot soldiers and 12,000 cavalry troops, not counting the soldiers who carried the supplies. So they marched out 
JDT.7.3	and set up camp by the spring in the valley near Bethulia. The camp covered an area that stretched from Dothan to Balbaim, and from Bethulia to Cyamon, a town facing Jezreel Valley.
JDT.7.4	When the Israelites saw how many Assyrians were ready to attack, they were terrified and said to one another, “That army will wipe out everything in sight, including the mountains and the valleys.” 
JDT.7.5	 Although the Israelites were afraid, they immediately grabbed their weapons and lit the signal fires in the watchtowers, ready to stand guard all night long.
JDT.7.6	The next day, Holofernes led his cavalry troops to a place where the Israelites in Bethulia could see them. 
JDT.7.7	He inspected every road into the town and found the sources of its water supply. He posted soldiers to guard these springs, then returned to camp.
JDT.7.8	All the commanders of the Edomite and Moabite armies, together with the commanders of the troops from the Mediterranean coast, came to Holofernes and said:
JDT.7.9	Sir, listen to our advice, and we promise that your troops will not be defeated. 
JDT.7.10	These Israelites count on the mountains and hills around them to keep them safe, even more than they count on their weapons. That's because the mountains are very steep and difficult to climb. 
JDT.7.11	So, General Holofernes, if you attack Bethulia as you would usually attack a town, many of your soldiers will be killed. 
JDT.7.12	Instead, order your troops to stay in camp. And command the soldiers you posted at the springs to guard them carefully, 
JDT.7.13	because that's the only place the people of Bethulia can go for water. They will soon be so thirsty that they will have to surrender.
JDT.7.13	Meanwhile, we will lead our armies to the tops of the nearby foothills and set up camp. We will make sure that no one leaves Bethulia. 
JDT.7.14	Every man, woman, and child in the town will starve to death, and the streets will be filled with dead bodies, even before your army attacks. 
JDT.7.15	That's how you can pay them back for rebelling and refusing to surrender peacefully.
JDT.7.16	Holofernes and his officials liked what the commanders said, and so he gave orders to carry out their plan at once. 
JDT.7.17	Part of the Ammonite
JDT.7.18	The Edomite army and the rest of the Ammonite troops marched into the hills and set up camp opposite the town of Dothan. They also sent some men southeast toward Egrebeh, which is near Chusi, a town on the Mochmur Creek. The rest of the Assyrian army set up camp in the valley. Their army was so large that tents and supplies covered the entire countryside.
JDT.7.19	The Israelites lost all hope, when they realized they were surrounded and had no way to escape. So they cried out to the Lord their God for help.
JDT.7.20	The entire Assyrian army, including the foot soldiers, the cavalry, and the soldiers in chariots, had surrounded Bethulia. And after 34 days, the town's water supply was almost gone— 
JDT.7.21	every well and cistern was drying up. So each day, drinking water was carefully measured out to make sure everyone had some water to drink. Finally, there was not enough left to go around. 
JDT.7.22	The children were getting weak, and all over town young men and women were fainting from thirst. No one had enough strength to survive much longer.
JDT.7.23	Then every person in Bethulia, both young and old, gathered around Uzziah and the other town leaders and shouted:
JDT.7.24	This is all your fault! You decided not to surrender peacefully to the Assyrians. We pray that God will punish you for the trouble you've caused. 
JDT.7.25	We are completely helpless, because God has let their powerful army surround us. And now we are exhausted and dying of thirst.
JDT.7.26	Tell the Assyrians you have decided to surrender. Let Holofernes and his troops have our town and take everything we own. 
JDT.7.27	We would rather be taken captives and become slaves than to die here. At least then we wouldn't have to watch our children and wives die slow and painful deaths. 
JDT.7.28	We are begging you to surrender today.
JDT.7.29	Everyone then began crying loudly and praying to the Lord God. 
JDT.7.30	But Uzziah said to them, “Be brave, my friends! Let's wait five more days to see if the Lord our God will have pity on us. I'm sure he won't let us die. 
JDT.7.31	If he doesn't help us in five days, I will do what you have said.”
JDT.7.32	Uzziah then ordered the men to go back to their guard posts on the town walls and in the watchtowers, and he told the women and children to return home. Everyone in Bethulia was still very upset and hopeless.
JDT.8.1+JDT.8.2	A widow named Judith lived in Bethulia and knew everything that was happening. She was the daughter of Merari and the granddaughter of Ox. Her ancestors included Joseph, Oziel, Elkiah, Ananias, Gideon, Raphain, Ahitub, Elijah, Hilkiah, Eliab, Nathanael, Salamiel, Sarasadai, and Israel.
JDT.8.1+JDT.8.2	Judith and her husband Manasseh had belonged to the same tribe and clan, and he had died during a barley harvest. 
JDT.8.3	He had stood a long time in the hot sun, supervising his workers, and he became so hot that he went to bed, where he later died. Manasseh was buried in his family burial place in a field between the towns of Dothan and Balamon, near his hometown of Bethulia.
JDT.8.4	Judith had now been a widow for three years and four months, 
JDT.8.5	 and she had moved into a small shelter she had made on the roof of her house. She wore widow's clothes and wrapped pieces of sackcloth
JDT.8.6	To show her sorrow, Judith went without eating, although she did eat on those days when it was commanded by God's Law: on each Sabbath and the day before it, on each New Moon Festival and the day before it, as well as on every joyous festival the Israelites celebrated.
JDT.8.7	Judith was very beautiful. And she was also very rich, because her husband had left her a lot of gold and silver, as well as male and female slaves, property, and livestock. 
JDT.8.8	Judith faithfully worshiped God, and no one ever said anything bad about her.
JDT.8.9	Judith heard that the people of Bethulia were weak from a shortage of water and that they had blamed Uzziah
JDT.8.10	So at once Judith sent her most trusted servant woman
JDT.8.11	When they arrived, she said:
JDT.8.11	I realize that you are the leaders of Bethulia, but please listen to me. What you said to the people today was wrong. You should not have promised them that you would surrender to the Assyrians, if the Lord God doesn't help us within the next few days. This promise was even made in God's name. 
JDT.8.12	 You have no right to test God like that, and you certainly have no business trying to control the lives of people. God is in control of that. 
JDT.8.13	You are testing the Lord All-Powerful! You can never 
JDT.8.14	 know what goes on in a person's heart or learn what someone else is thinking. How do you expect to know what God is thinking or what he is planning? The only thing you're doing is making him angry. 
JDT.8.15	Even if God does refuse to help us within the next five days, he still has the power to rescue us anytime he chooses. Or he may decide to let our enemies defeat us. 
JDT.8.16	Don't put limits on what the Lord our God can do. God is not a mere human. He cannot be threatened or forced into doing something. 
JDT.8.17	All we can do is pray for his help and wait for him to rescue us from our enemies. It is up to God to answer us when he chooses.
JDT.8.18	It's true that many of our ancestors worshiped gods made by human hands. Yet none of us alive today has ever sinned like that. 
JDT.8.19	Enemies violently abused and killed our ancestors because they worshiped these gods. 
JDT.8.20	But since we worship only the Lord God, I pray that he will not reject us or any of our people.
JDT.8.21	If our town is captured, then before long all of Judea will fall and our temple in Jerusalem will be in ruins. And if the temple becomes an unfit place for worship, God will make us pay with our lives. 
JDT.8.22	He will punish us for the slaughter of our people and for the destruction and capture of the land he gave us as our own. We will be slaves to other nations, and they will insult and make fun of us. 
JDT.8.23	They will never honor us if we are their slaves. We will only be disgraced—the Lord our God will certainly see to that.
JDT.8.24	Our people are depending on us. In fact, the future of the altar and the temple is in our hands. And so, my friends, let's show our people that we haven't given up hope. 
JDT.8.25	Even though things are difficult, we should thank the Lord our God. He is testing us to see how faithful we are, just as he tested our ancestors long ago. 
JDT.8.26	 Do you remember how the Lord tested Abraham and Isaac or what happened to Jacob while he was taking care of his uncle Laban's sheep in Mesopotamia? 
JDT.8.27	The Lord isn't testing our faithfulness to him as severely as he tested the faith of our ancestors, and he isn't taking revenge on us. These hard times were sent as a warning.
JDT.8.28	Uzziah replied:
JDT.8.28	Judith, everything you have said is true, and no one would disagree. 
JDT.8.29	And this is certainly not the first time you have spoken so wisely. Even as a child, you showed good sense, and the people of Bethulia have always known how wise and fair your decisions are. 
JDT.8.30	But everyone in town is dying of thirst, and they begged us until we finally made them a solemn promise that we can't break. 
JDT.8.31	You faithfully worship the Lord God, so pray for us all and ask him to send enough rain to fill our wells. Once we have drinking water, our strength will return.
JDT.8.32	Judith said to the three town leaders:
JDT.8.32	I'm going to do something—something that will never be forgotten. 
JDT.8.33	The Lord will use me to rescue the people of Israel before the day you agreed to surrender to the Assyrians.
JDT.8.33	I want the three of you to stand guard at the town gate tonight, so that my servant woman and I can leave safely. 
JDT.8.34	Don't try to figure out what I'm doing. I will tell you everything after I have finished.
JDT.8.35	Uzziah and the others replied, “This sounds good to us! We pray that the Lord God will help you take revenge on our enemies.”
JDT.8.36	The three men left Judith's rooftop shelter and took their positions at the gate.
JDT.9.1	Judith put ashes on her head and removed her robe, uncovering the pieces of sackcloth
JDT.9.3	That's why you let their rulers be killed in the very bed where they raped Dinah.
JDT.9.4	Their wives were raped, and their children were carried off to become slaves. Dinah's relatives were furious and were eager to take revenge on the foreigners who had disgraced their family, and so they called on you for help. That's why you let the Israelites carry off the wealth of those foreigners.
JDT.9.4	Lord God, I am a widow. Please listen to my prayer. 
JDT.9.5	I know you caused all of these things to happen, and everything else as well. You control what is happening now and what will take place in the future, 
JDT.9.6	because everything happens according to your plan. You always know ahead of time what you will do and what decisions you will make.
JDT.9.7	The Assyrian troops that are now attacking us are more powerful than ever. They are constantly bragging about their strong cavalry and mighty soldiers who trust in swords, shields, bows, and slings to win their wars. They don't realize that you are the Lord, a warrior who always wins. 
JDT.9.8	 So, in your anger, use your strength to completely destroy their army. Those Assyrians plan to disgrace the temple where you are worshiped and to chop off the corners of your altar with their swords.
JDT.9.9	You've seen how arrogant those Assyrians are. Destroy them in your anger, and give me, a widow, the strength to do what I have planned. 
JDT.9.10	Use my deceit to slaughter the Assyrian rulers and their slaves, and let my strength crush their pride. 
JDT.9.11	Your power doesn't depend on mighty armies. You are a God who cares for and protects the weak and helpless, and you rescue those who have given up hope. 
JDT.9.12	You are the ruler of everything in heaven and on earth, and you created all rivers and oceans. And you are the God my ancestors worshiped, so please hear my sincere prayer. 
JDT.9.13	 Help me carry out my deceitful plan to wound and kill our enemies, who have plotted evil against your agreement with us and your holy temple, and against Mount Zion and the land you have given your people. 
JDT.9.14	Let every tribe in your nation of Israel know for certain that you are God All-Powerful and that you alone protect Israel.
JDT.10.1	After Judith finished praying to the God of Israel, 
JDT.10.2	she got up and called for her servant woman. Then Judith left her rooftop shelter and went down into her house, where she stayed on Sabbath days and during religious festivals. 
JDT.10.3	After taking off her widow's clothes and the pieces of sackcloth, she took a bath. She put on expensive perfume, then brushed her hair and put on a fancy headband. Judith dressed in the beautiful clothes she had worn for celebrations when her husband Manasseh was alive. 
JDT.10.4	She put on sandals and all kinds of jewelry, including rings and earrings, as well as bracelets for her ankles and wrists. Judith made sure she was beautiful enough to get the attention of every man who saw her.
JDT.10.5	Judith gave her servant a leather bottle of wine and a small jar of olive oil, then filled a bag with roasted grain, dried figs, and her best bread.
JDT.10.6	Together the two women left the house and walked to the gate of Bethulia, where they found Uzziah, the town leader, with Chabris and Charmis, the other two leaders. 
JDT.10.7	When these men saw Judith dressed this way and wearing make-up, they were amazed at her beauty, and said, 
JDT.10.8	“We will be praying that the God of our ancestors will help you carry out your plans, so that the people of Israel will be blessed and the city of Jerusalem will be honored.”
JDT.10.8	Judith bowed in prayer, 
JDT.10.9	then replied, “Tell someone to open the town gate, so that I can do all these things.”
JDT.10.9	They told some young men to open the gate, 
JDT.10.10	and Judith and her servant walked down the hill and into the valley. The young men watched them until they were out of sight.
JDT.10.11	As Judith and her servant woman were walking through the valley near Bethulia, they were seen by a group of Assyrian soldiers patrolling the area. 
JDT.10.12	The soldiers arrested Judith and asked, “What nationality are you? Tell us where you're coming from and where you're going.”
JDT.10.12	She said, “I am a Hebrew from Bethulia. But I am running away, because your army is about to completely wipe out my hometown! 
JDT.10.13	I'm on my way to tell General Holofernes how to invade the hill country of Israel and capture every town, without letting any of his soldiers be captured or killed.”
JDT.10.14	The men noticed that Judith was very beautiful. So after she finished talking, they said, 
JDT.10.15	“You have saved your life by being eager to talk to General Holofernes. Some of us will take you to his tent and arrange for you to see him. 
JDT.10.16	When you meet him, don't be afraid. Tell him exactly what you told us, and he will be kind to you.”
JDT.10.17	One hundred men were assigned to take Judith and her servant to the tent of Holofernes. 
JDT.10.18	Soon everyone in the Assyrian camp wanted to see Judith. Soldiers gathered around her as she stood outside the tent, waiting to see Holofernes. 
JDT.10.19	She was so beautiful that they stared at her and said to each other, “If every Israelite woman is this lovely, no one would want to destroy their nation. We need to be sure to kill all the Israelite men, so that they won't be able to use their beautiful women to trick and defeat the whole world.”
JDT.10.20	The bodyguards and servants with General Holofernes came out of his tent and led Judith inside. 
JDT.10.21	Holofernes was lying on his bed under a mosquito net made of purple thread and decorated with gold and emeralds and other precious stones.
JDT.10.22	When Holofernes was told that Judith was there, he walked out to the front part of his tent, with servants carrying silver lamps in front of him. 
JDT.10.23	As Judith came forward to meet Holofernes, he and his servants could hardly believe she was so beautiful. Judith bowed low to the ground to honor him, but his servants helped her to her feet.
JDT.11.1	Holofernes said to Judith:
JDT.11.1	Don't be afraid! You have nothing to worry about. I have never harmed anyone who chooses to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of the whole earth. 
JDT.11.2	I wouldn't even be attacking your people in the hill country if they had surrendered to me. They insulted me by resisting, and so all this violence is their own fault. 
JDT.11.3	Now that you're safe, tell me why you left them and came to our side. It doesn't really matter, though—we will protect you for as long as you want to stay. So don't be afraid! Your life won't be in danger tonight or at any other time. 
JDT.11.4	No one will ever try to harm you, and you will be treated very well, just as if you were one of King Nebuchadnezzar's own personal servants.
JDT.11.5	Judith answered:
JDT.11.5	Sir, I am your servant. Please listen to what I have to say. It will be the truth, 
JDT.11.6	and if you follow my advice, God will use you to carry out the great plans he has in mind. 
JDT.11.7	 I swear to you by the life of King Nebuchadnezzar himself, the ruler of the earth, that you have brought every living creature under his control. People of all nations serve him because of what you've done, and wild animals and livestock and birds will live under the control of Nebuchadnezzar and his family forever.
JDT.11.8	My people have heard how wise and talented you are. In fact, the whole world realizes that you are the bravest and most clever army commander in the Assyrian kingdom.
JDT.11.9	The people of Bethulia kept Achior alive, and he told us everything he said at the meeting with you. 
JDT.11.10	Sir, you should take seriously what he told you, because everything he said is true. No enemy can conquer or defeat our nation of Israel, unless we are guilty of sinning against our God.
JDT.11.11	But you can defeat the Israelites, just as you have planned, because they are about to make our God furious by sinning against him. And when that happens, they will certainly die. 
JDT.11.12	They are almost out of food and water, so they have decided to slaughter their livestock and eat foods that God has forbidden them to eat. 
JDT.11.13	 They're going to eat the offerings that have been dedicated to God and have been set aside for the priests who serve him in the Jerusalem temple. These offerings include the first harvests of wheat and ten percent of their wine and olive oil. Only the priests are supposed to touch these things, 
JDT.11.14	but even the people of Jerusalem have already broken that law. So my own people in Bethulia have sent messengers to ask the religious leaders in Jerusalem if the same thing could be done here. 
JDT.11.15	On the same day that these messengers return with the news, the people in Bethulia will begin eating these foods. That's when you will be able to defeat them.
JDT.11.16	As soon as I realized what was happening, I hurried away from Bethulia. God has sent me here to help you do things that will shock everyone in the world. I am your servant, 
JDT.11.17	but I am still a faithful worshiper of the God of Heaven. I will stay here in this camp, and each night I will go into the valley to pray to God, and he will tell me when the Israelites have sinned. 
JDT.11.18	Then I will immediately tell you, so you can lead your army into battle. The Israelites won't have a chance to defend themselves. 
JDT.11.19	After that victory, I will lead you through Judea until we reach Jerusalem, where I will crown you king in front of everyone. You will rule them as if they were sheep without a shepherd. Not even a dog will growl and oppose you.
JDT.11.19	God has told me these things will happen, and he sent me to tell you as well.
JDT.11.20	Holofernes and his servants liked what Judith had said. They were so amazed at her wisdom that they said to each other, 
JDT.11.21	“She must be the wisest and most beautiful woman in all the world!”
JDT.11.22	Holofernes told Judith, “God was right in sending you to tell us these things, so that we can defeat the people who have dishonored King Nebuchadnezzar. 
JDT.11.23	Not only are you beautiful, you also speak wisely. So I promise that if you do everything you have said here today, I will worship your God as my own. And you will live in King Nebuchadnezzar's palace and be famous throughout the world.”
JDT.12.1	Holofernes commanded his servants to lead Judith to the table that had been set with his silver dinnerware and to serve her some of his own special food and wine. 
JDT.12.2	 But Judith said, “God's Law will not allow me to eat your food, so I brought enough of my own.”
JDT.12.3	Holofernes replied, “But what if you run out of your food supply? There aren't any of your people in this camp, and we won't be able to get you more food.”
JDT.12.4	Judith answered, “Sir, as surely as you live, I have plenty of food to last until the Lord has finished using me to do what he has planned.”
JDT.12.5	After that, Holofernes' servants took Judith to her tent, where she went to sleep. Then just before dawn, she got up 
JDT.12.6	and sent a message to Holofernes, asking if she could go into the valley to pray. 
JDT.12.7	Holofernes ordered his guards to let Judith leave the camp.
JDT.12.7	The same thing happened for the next three days: Judith went into the valley near Bethulia each night and washed herself in the spring water. 
JDT.12.8	After bathing, she prayed to the Lord God of Israel and asked him to show her the best way to rescue the Israelites. 
JDT.12.9	Judith then returned to her tent, completely clean, and stayed there until it was time for her evening meal.
JDT.12.10	On Judith's fourth day in the Assyrian camp, Holofernes held a banquet for only his personal servants—none of his military officers were invited. 
JDT.12.11	Bagoas was the servant in charge of his personal business, and Holofernes said to him, “Since you are the one taking care of the Hebrew woman, I want you to talk her into coming to the banquet, so she can eat and drink with us. 
JDT.12.12	It would be a shame not to sleep with such a beautiful woman. I'm sure she would laugh at us, if I didn't at least try to talk her into it.”
JDT.12.13	Bagoas left and went to see Judith. He said, “You are such a beautiful woman that General Holofernes has invited you to his tent to drink wine with him. You will be his honored guest and will be treated like the Assyrian women who serve in King Nebuchadnezzar's palace.”
JDT.12.14	Judith answered, “It would be foolish to refuse such an invitation. I will gladly go to his tent, and I will remember this night for as long as I live.”
JDT.12.15	At once, Judith put on her finest clothes. Her servant woman then went to Holofernes' tent and placed at his feet the piece of lambskin that Bagoas had given Judith to sit on while she ate.
JDT.12.16	Judith then entered the tent and sat down on the lambskin. Holofernes was very excited to be with Judith and wanted to sleep with her right away. In fact, he had been waiting for this opportunity since he first saw her. 
JDT.12.17	He said, “Have some wine, Judith. Enjoy yourself!”
JDT.12.18	She replied, “I'd love to, sir. This is the happiest day of my life.” 
JDT.12.19	But Judith ate and drank only what her own servant had brought for her. 
JDT.12.20	Holofernes was enjoying being with Judith so much, that he drank more wine at one meal than he ever had in any one day of his whole life.
JDT.13.1	When it was late in the evening, the servants hurried out. Then Bagoas left and closed Holofernes' tent from the outside and ordered the servants to stay out. The meal had lasted such a long time that all the servants were exhausted and went straight to bed.
JDT.13.2	Judith was alone with Holofernes in his tent, but he was so drunk that he was sound asleep on his bed.
JDT.13.3	Judith's servant woman was standing outside the tent, because Judith had asked her to wait there until it was time for Judith to pray. Judith had also told Bagoas that she would be leaving camp, just as she had done the past three nights.
JDT.13.4	Now that all the servants and guests had gone home, Judith walked over and stood by the bed and whispered, “Lord God All-Powerful, help me with what I'm about to do, so that Jerusalem will be honored. 
JDT.13.5	It is now the time for you to rescue your people Israel and carry out my plan to defeat the enemies who are attacking us.”
JDT.13.6	She walked to the bedpost nearest Holofernes' head and took down his sword that was hanging there. 
JDT.13.7	She moved closer to him and grabbed him by his hair, while praying, “Lord God of Israel, give me the strength to do this!” 
JDT.13.8	Then she struck him two times in the neck with the sword as hard as she could and cut off his head. 
JDT.13.9	She rolled his body off the bed and ripped down the mosquito net from the bedposts. Judith then left the tent and handed the head to her servant, 
JDT.13.10	who put it in the bag used for carrying food.
JDT.13.10	Judith and her servant woman left the Assyrian camp, just as they always did when they went to pray. They walked across the valley and up the hill to the town of Bethulia.
JDT.13.10	As they got closer, 
JDT.13.11	Judith called out to the guards on duty, “Open the gate! Open the gate! Our powerful God of Israel has shown his strength today by defeating our enemies.”
JDT.13.12	Some of the men of Bethulia recognized Judith's voice, and they ran to the gate and called the town leaders. 
JDT.13.13	Then all the people of Bethulia, both young and old, hurried to the gate—no one could believe that Judith had returned safely. They opened the gate and greeted Judith and her servant woman. Someone started a bonfire, and everyone gathered around the two women.
JDT.13.14	Judith said, “Shout praises to God for showing mercy to the people of Israel! He helped me destroy our enemies this very night.”
JDT.13.15	She then reached into the bag and pulled out the head and shouted:
JDT.13.15	This is the head of General Holofernes of the Assyrian army, and here is the mosquito net that covered his bed. The Lord used a woman to kill Holofernes while he lay there drunk. 
JDT.13.16	My beauty tricked him and led to his death, but as surely as the Lord lives, Holofernes never touched me. I was not disgraced, because the Lord protected me at all times.
JDT.13.17	Everyone was truly amazed. They bowed down and worshiped God by saying, “We praise you, our God. You have disgraced our enemies today.”
JDT.13.18	God Most High deserves our praise, because he has blessed you more than any other woman on earth. The same God who created heaven and earth has helped you cut off the head of our enemy's leader. 
JDT.13.19	When people tell what mighty things God has done today, they will remember how you trusted him. 
JDT.13.20	I pray that God will honor you for what you have done. May he bless you forever, because you were faithful to him and risked your own life to save our nation from ruin.
JDT.13.20	All the people agreed with Uzziah and replied, “Amen.”
JDT.14.1	Judith said:
JDT.14.1	Listen to this plan, my friends. Take the head of Holofernes and hang it from the top of the town wall. 
JDT.14.2	Then as soon as the sun comes up tomorrow morning, all of you strong men choose a leader for yourselves. Take your weapons and march out of town, as if you were going into the valley to attack the Assyrian guards on duty there. 
JDT.14.3	When they see you, they will grab their weapons and run back to their camp and wake up their officers, who will rush to the tent of General Holofernes. They will panic when they find his dead body, and the entire Assyrian army will run from you in terror. 
JDT.14.4	Then you and everyone else in Israel will kill them as they run away.
JDT.14.5	But before you do any of this, bring Achior the Ammonite here. I want him to see the head of the man who insulted the nation of Israel and who sent him to Bethulia to be killed along with the rest of us.
JDT.14.6	Achior was brought from Uzziah's house, and when he saw the head of Holofernes in the hands of one of the men, he fainted and collapsed on the ground. 
JDT.14.7	Achior was helped to his feet, and at once he bowed down to show his respect for Judith. He said, “Every family in Judea thanks you, and I pray that all nations will shake with fear when your name is mentioned. 
JDT.14.8	Please tell me how you did it.”
JDT.14.8	Judith told Achior and the crowd everything that had happened from the day she left Bethulia until she returned. 
JDT.14.9	As soon as she finished her story, the people of the town celebrated with shouts of joy.
JDT.14.10	After Achior had listened to what the God of Israel had done, he completely put his faith in God. Then he was circumcised and became an Israelite. And from that day on, he and his descendants worshiped God.
JDT.14.11	Early the next morning, the Israelites hung the head of Holofernes on the town wall. The men armed themselves with weapons, then went out in groups and stood on the hills around Bethulia.
JDT.14.12	As soon as the Assyrian guards saw what was happening, they reported it to their commanders, who made sure every Assyrian officer was alerted. 
JDT.14.13	The highest-ranking officers went to Holofernes' tent and said to Bagoas, “You need to wake General Holofernes and tell him those Israelites had the nerve to march out of Bethulia to attack us. They may think we can be defeated, but we will wipe out every one of them.”
JDT.14.14	So Bagoas went inside and shook the curtain that separated Holofernes' bedroom from the rest of the tent. Bagoas waited, because he thought Judith was still with Holofernes. 
JDT.14.15	No one answered, and so Bagoas opened the curtain and walked in. He saw the headless body of Holofernes lying on the floor, 
JDT.14.16	and he began moaning and crying and tearing his clothes in sorrow. 
JDT.14.17	Bagoas ran quickly to Judith's tent and saw that it was empty. Then he ran back out and shouted to the officers, 
JDT.14.18	“We've been tricked. King Nebuchadnezzar's entire kingdom has been disgraced by one woman. Look! There's Holofernes lying dead on the ground—and his head is gone!”
JDT.14.19	As soon as the Assyrian officers learned what had happened, they tore their uniforms in sorrow. Loud crying and moaning was heard everywhere in camp.
JDT.15.1	When the Assyrian soldiers heard their officers crying, they were terrified 
JDT.15.2	and started trembling with fear. They ran out of camp in every direction, not waiting for anyone, and tried to escape in the valley and the nearby mountains. 
JDT.15.3	The soldiers who had camped in the hills around Bethulia also ran away in fear.
JDT.15.3	Just then, the Israelite troops attacked.
JDT.15.4	At the same time, Uzziah sent messengers to the towns of Betomasthaim, Choba, Kola, and other towns in Israel to tell everyone what was happening and to ask them to join in the attack. 
JDT.15.5	When the people in these towns received the message, they came and helped attack the Assyrians. The Israelites chased their enemies as far as Choba, and along the way they killed many of them. The people of Jerusalem and southern Judea also heard the news and joined in the attack.
JDT.15.5	Meanwhile, the people living in the regions of Gilead and Galilee blocked the retreating Assyrians, killing many of them and chasing the others into the region of Damascus.
JDT.15.6	The rest of the people of Bethulia entered the Assyrian camp and carried off most of the valuable possessions. 
JDT.15.7	When the Israelite soldiers returned from battle, they took everything else. The amount of things taken from the Assyrians was so large that the people shared the wealth with their neighbors in the surrounding towns and villages.
JDT.15.8	Joakim the high priest and the other leaders of Israel came from Jerusalem to see what wonderful things the Lord had done for Israel. They also wanted to meet and congratulate Judith. 
JDT.15.9	When they arrived in Bethulia, they said, “Judith, you are the pride of Jerusalem and the hero of our nation Israel. 
JDT.15.10	You alone won this victory for Israel. The Lord God All-Powerful is certainly pleased with you, and we pray that he will bless you forever.”
JDT.15.10	All the people agreed and said, “Amen.”
JDT.15.11	For 30 days, the Israelites carried off the wealth of the Assyrian camp. They gave Judith the tent of Holofernes and everything in it, including his silver dinnerware, his bowls, his couches, and the rest of his furniture. She loaded down her mule and filled her carts with these things.
JDT.15.12	All the women of Israel came to meet and sing praises to Judith; many of them also danced in her honor. Judith took leaf-covered branches and gave one to every woman who was there with her, 
JDT.15.13	and they all wore wreaths of olive leaves on their heads. Judith led the women in joyful dancing, with the men following behind, waving their weapons in the air and wearing strings of flowers and singing songs of praise.
JDT.15.14	Judith began singing a song of praise to God, and the crowd joined in the singing.
JDT.16.1	Judith sang:
JDT.16.1	Shout praises to my Lord God;
JDT.16.1	play tambourines and cymbals.
JDT.16.1	Sing a new song of praise
JDT.16.1	and pray for his help.
JDT.16.2	The Lord God is a warrior
JDT.16.2	who rescued me from my enemy.
JDT.16.2	God wins every battle
JDT.16.2	and camps among his people.
JDT.16.3	The Assyrians marched down
JDT.16.3	from the mountains in the north.
JDT.16.3	Thousands of soldiers blocked
JDT.16.3	the rivers and streams;
JDT.16.3	cavalry troops covered
JDT.16.3	the mountain like a blanket.
JDT.16.4	They threatened to burn our land
JDT.16.4	and slaughter our young men,
JDT.16.4	to kill our babies
JDT.16.4	to capture our children,
JDT.16.4	and to carry off
JDT.16.4	all of our young women.
JDT.16.5	But the Lord All-Powerful
JDT.16.5	fooled the Assyrians
JDT.16.5	and used a woman
JDT.16.5	to wipe them out.
JDT.16.6	The mighty Assyrian leader
JDT.16.6	wasn't killed by young men
JDT.16.6	or cruel warriors
JDT.16.6	I, Judith the daughter of Merari,
JDT.16.6	used my charm
JDT.16.6	to strike him dead.
JDT.16.7	I put aside my widow's clothes
JDT.16.7	and won a victory
JDT.16.7	for troubled Israel.
JDT.16.7	I put on perfume 
JDT.16.8	and placed
JDT.16.8	a fancy headband in my hair,
JDT.16.8	and I dressed in linen
JDT.16.8	to attract and fool him.
JDT.16.9	He liked my sandals
JDT.16.9	and thought I was lovely;
JDT.16.9	then I took his own sword
JDT.16.9	and cut off his head.
JDT.16.10	My courage shocked the Persians
JDT.16.10	and stunned the Medes.
JDT.16.11	Our weak and abused people
JDT.16.11	let out shouts of victory,
JDT.16.11	while the Assyrians
JDT.16.11	trembled in fear and ran.
JDT.16.12	Though our ancestors were slaves,
JDT.16.12	we, the Lord's mighty army,
JDT.16.12	attacked and killed
JDT.16.12	enemy troops.
JDT.16.13	to the Lord our God;
JDT.16.13	he is glorious and all-powerful,
JDT.16.13	and his strength never fails.
JDT.16.14	Let all living creatures
JDT.16.14	worship the Lord.
JDT.16.14	By his word, he gave them life;
JDT.16.14	his breath created them.
JDT.16.14	Nothing can oppose
JDT.16.14	the Lord's command.
JDT.16.15	Mountains and oceans
JDT.16.15	shake with fear,
JDT.16.15	and rocks melt like wax,
JDT.16.15	when the Lord approaches.
JDT.16.15	But he shows mercy to all
JDT.16.15	who are faithful to him.
JDT.16.16	to obey the Lord
JDT.16.16	than to offer
JDT.16.16	sweet-smelling sacrifices
JDT.16.16	or the fat of choice meat.
JDT.16.17	All nations that oppose Israel
JDT.16.17	will fall into ruin;
JDT.16.17	the Lord All-Powerful
JDT.16.17	will punish them
JDT.16.17	on the day of judgment.
JDT.16.17	Fire and worms
JDT.16.17	will destroy their bodies,
JDT.16.17	and they will always
JDT.16.17	groan in pain.
JDT.16.18	When the crowd reached Jerusalem, they immediately got ready to worship God by going through the ceremonies to make themselves clean. Then they offered the required sacrifices to please God,
JDT.16.19	Judith brought along all of Holofernes' possessions that the people had given her, and she dedicated them to God. She also gave the mosquito net from the bed of Holofernes as a special offering to keep a promise.
JDT.16.20	Judith stayed in Jerusalem for three months, while she and the people celebrated at the temple.
JDT.16.21	After the victory celebration, everyone went back home, and Judith returned to her place in Bethulia. She was famous everywhere in Israel for as long as she lived. 
JDT.16.22	Although a lot of men asked to marry her, she always refused and never remarried after her husband Manasseh died. 
JDT.16.23+JDT.16.24	Judith became more famous as time went by, and she continued to live in the house Manasseh had left her.
JDT.16.23+JDT.16.24	Some time before Judith died, she divided her possessions and property among her own closest relatives, as well as those of her husband, and she allowed her servant woman to go free.
JDT.16.23+JDT.16.24	Judith died in Bethulia at the age of 105. She was buried beside her husband in their family tomb, and everyone in Israel mourned her death for seven days.
JDT.16.25	As long as Judith was alive, and for many years after her death, no enemy nation terrorized the people of Israel.
ESG.1_1.1+ESG.1_1.2+ESG.1_1.3	[2-4] 
ESG.1_1.1+ESG.1_1.2+ESG.1_1.3	In Mordecai's dream, 
ESG.1_1.4	[5] there was confusion and unrest all over the world. He heard crashing thunder, and the earth shook with an earthquake 
ESG.1_1.5	[6] as two huge dragons went toward each other, ready to fight. They roared, 
ESG.1_1.6	[7] and every nation on earth prepared to go to war against God's people. 
ESG.1_1.7	[8] It was a dark and hopeless time; the world was full of suffering and hardship and conflict.
ESG.1_1.8	[9] God's people were afraid of the disaster that was about to strike them, and they were sure they were going to be killed. 
ESG.1_1.9	[10] But when they cried out to God for help, a tiny stream suddenly became a mighty river, 
ESG.1_1.10	[11] and the sun rose and shone brightly. God's people were given power, and they destroyed those who had oppressed them.
ESG.1_1.11	[12] Mordecai woke up, but he knew that in his dream he had seen what God was planning to do. And so, Mordecai thought about his dream all day, trying to understand exactly what it meant.
ESG.1_2.12	[1] That night,
ESG.1_2.13	[2] Mordecai overheard them talking, and as he listened carefully, he realized they were planning to murder King Artaxerxes.
ESG.1_2.13	Mordecai warned Artaxerxes about the plot to kill him. 
ESG.1_2.14	[3] The two officers confessed when Artaxerxes questioned them, and so he gave orders for them to be put to death. 
ESG.1_2.15	[4] He also ordered that a report of these events be written in his records, and Mordecai also wrote down what had happened. 
ESG.1_2.16	[5] Artaxerxes appointed Mordecai to a position
ESG.1_2.17	[6] Haman son of Hammedatha
ESG.1_3.18+ESG.1_3.19+ESG.1_3.20	[1-3] 
ESG.1_3.18+ESG.1_3.19+ESG.1_3.20	During the third year of his rule, King Artaxerxes paid for a festival and asked a special group known as the Friends of the King to come. He also invited a large number of people from his own empire and from other nations. The rulers of the Persian provinces came, and so did many important people from the province of Media. 
ESG.1_3.21	[4] For 180 days Artaxerxes showed off his wealth and spent a lot of money to impress his guests with the celebrations.
ESG.1_3.22	[5] After this festival,
ESG.1_3.23	[6] The palace had been decorated with cotton and linen curtains tied back with purple linen cords. These cords were attached to gold and silver square pegs on columns, which were made of marble and other stones. Couches of gold and silver were arranged on pavement that had all kinds of designs made from emeralds, mother-of-pearl, and marble. These couches were covered with see-through cloth woven with designs of different colors, and around each couch were roses.
ESG.1_3.24	[7] The wine cups were made of gold and silver, and the king had put on display one small cup that was decorated with rubies worth over 1,000 tons of silver. There was plenty of the king's favorite sweet wine, 
ESG.1_3.25	[8] and he had told everyone, “Drink all you want!” Then he told his servants, “Keep our cups full.”
ESG.1_3.26	[9] Meanwhile, in another part of the palace, Queen Vashti
ESG.1_3.27	[10] By the seventh day of the party, King Artaxerxes was really feeling happy, and he told his seven personal servants Haman,
ESG.1_3.28	[11] to bring Vashti to him. Artaxerxes wanted to place the crown on her head again, to show everyone she was the queen. He also wanted to show his governors and the people from different countries just how beautiful she really was.
ESG.1_3.29	[12] But Vashti did not go back with the servants—she refused to obey the king! Artaxerxes was furious because she had embarrassed him, 
ESG.1_3.30	[13] and he said to his friends,
ESG.1_3.31	[14] Arkesaeus, Sarsathaeus, and Malesear went up to the king. They were his highest officials as well as being governors of the Persians and Medes, and they were always given the seats closest to the king. 
ESG.1_3.32	[15] They said, “You sent your servants with a command for Queen Vashti. But since she refused to obey you, the law says she must be punished.”
ESG.1_3.33+ESG.1_3.34	[16-17] Then Muchaeus, another official, told the king and the governors:
ESG.1_3.33+ESG.1_3.34	King Artaxerxes has told us what Queen Vashti said and how she refused to obey him. She humiliated the king, and soon all his governors and officials will be humiliated too. 
ESG.1_3.35	[18] We are governors of the Persians and Medes, but when our wives hear what the queen said to the king, our wives will dare to insult us in the same way.
ESG.1_3.36	[19] Your Majesty, if you agree, you should make a law that Vashti is never to be with you again. Put it in writing, according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, so that it cannot be changed. And find some other woman who is more suited to be queen than Vashti.
ESG.1_3.37	[20] Finally, make sure everyone in your kingdom is told what you have decided to do. Then each wife will honor her husband, whether he is rich or poor.
ESG.1_3.38	[21] Artaxerxes and his officials liked what Muchaeus had said, 
ESG.1_3.39	[22] and Artaxerxes sent a copy of the law to all of his provinces. Each copy was written in the language of the province to which it was sent, and it said that every husband must be respected by his family.
ESG.2.1	After a while, King Artaxerxes got over being angry. He stopped being lonely for Vashti, and he forgot about all the things he had said about her when he divorced her. 
ESG.2.2	Then his personal servants said:
ESG.2.2	Your Majesty, a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women who have good reputations 
ESG.2.3	and are virgins. You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives here in the capital city of Susa. Your servant who is in charge of your wives can be in charge of the young women and make sure they are given beauty creams and whatever else they need. 
ESG.2.4	Choose the woman who pleases you the most and make her your queen instead of Vashti.
ESG.2.4	Artaxerxes liked these suggestions, and he followed them.
ESG.2.5	At this time a Jew named Mordecai
ESG.2.6	 Mordecai
ESG.2.7	Mordecai's uncle Aminadab had a daughter named Esther. But Aminadab and his wife had died, and so Mordecai had raised his cousin Esther as his own daughter. She had grown into a beautiful young woman, 
ESG.2.8	and when the king's command was sent out, she was taken to the palace along with the many young women who had been brought to Susa. She and the others were placed in the care of Gai, who was in charge of all the king's wives. 
ESG.2.9	Esther was Gai's favorite, and he began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven maids from the king's palace. Esther and her servants were treated better than the other women.
ESG.2.10	Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone she was a Jew, and she obeyed him. 
ESG.2.11	He was anxious to find out what would happen to her. So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard at the building where the women lived.
ESG.2.12	Each of the young women was given beauty treatments for a whole year before going to King Artaxerxes. The first six months her skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh, and the last six months it was treated with beauty cream mixed with spices. 
ESG.2.13	Then she spent one night alone with Artaxerxes. He sent a servant to bring her to the palace 
ESG.2.14	in the evening. The next morning she went to the place where the king's wives stayed after being with him. There the king's servant Gai was in charge of them, and only the ones that the king asked for by name could go back to him.
ESG.2.15+ESG.2.16	Esther's turn
ESG.2.17	and even Artaxerxes liked her better than any of the other young women he had seen. In fact, he fell in love with her and placed the queen's crown on her head. 
ESG.2.18	Then he gave a seven-day drinking party to celebrate his marriage to Esther, and he made a law that for a certain length of time, no one in his kingdom would have to pay any taxes.
ESG.2.19	At this time, Mordecai was serving as one of the king's officials. 
ESG.2.20	He had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew, but he had also told her to continue worshiping God and obeying his commands, just as she had done when she was living in Mordecai's home. Esther obeyed Mordecai and did not change her way of life.
ESG.2.21	The king's two chief bodyguards were angry that Mordecai had been promoted, and they decided to murder the king. 
ESG.2.22	But when Mordecai found out about their plot, he warned Esther, and she told the king.
ESG.2.23	King Artaxerxes questioned the two men to make sure they were guilty, then he had them hanged. He also had someone write up a report praising Mordecai for the kindness he had shown, and the report was placed in the royal library.
ESG.3.1	Later, King Artaxerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha
ESG.3.2	The king ordered all of his officials to bow down to Haman, and all of them obeyed except Mordecai. 
ESG.3.3	The other officials went to Mordecai and asked, “Why are you ignoring what the king said?” 
ESG.3.4	They spoke to Mordecai like this for several days, but he told them he was a Jew and would not bow down to Haman. The other officials went to Haman and told him that Mordecai was Jewish and refused to do what the king said.
ESG.3.5	Haman was furious when he learned that Mordecai refused to bow down to him, 
ESG.3.6	and he started planning how to get rid of all the Jews in the kingdom. 
ESG.3.7	It was now the twelfth year that Artaxerxes was king, and Haman decided
ESG.3.8	Then Haman went to King Artaxerxes and said, “Your Majesty, the people from a certain nation are scattered throughout your kingdom. Their customs are different from ours, and they refuse to obey your laws. You would be better off to get rid of them. 
ESG.3.9	If you give orders for all of them to be killed, I will pay over 340 tons of silver to your treasury.”
ESG.3.10	Artaxerxes handed his royal ring to Haman, so the law against the Jews could be made official.
ESG.3.11	Then the king said, “Do what you want with those people! And you can keep their money.”
ESG.3.12	On the thirteenth day of the first month,
ESG.3.13	Then messengers would deliver the copies of the letter, which said that on a certain day in Adar, the twelfth month, the people were to get rid of all the Jews and take their property.
ESG.3_1.14	[1] This is a copy of the letter:
ESG.3_1.14	From Artaxerxes, the Great King, to the governors and officials of my 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia.
ESG.3_1.15	[2] I rule many nations, and I am the most powerful king in the world. But I have never used my power in a proud or arrogant way. Instead, I have always been reasonable and kind to the people in my kingdom. I know they want peace, and so I have decided to make every part of my kingdom peaceful and safe for travel.
ESG.3_1.16+ESG.3_1.17	[3-4] 
ESG.3_1.18	[5] In fact, they seem to be the only people who always go against everyone else and insist on following their own strange customs. They don't like the way I rule, and they commit every horrible crime they can to keep my kingdom from being peaceful.
ESG.3_1.19	[6] Haman, my highest and most honored official, has written letters telling what these people are like. So I have made a law that all of them—even the women and children—must be put to death without mercy on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar
ESG.3_1.20	[7] They have worked against us for a long time, and so on this one day, we will use violence to send them down to the world of the dead. Then our kingdom will be peaceful and free from trouble forever.
ESG.3_2.21	[14] Copies of this letter were displayed publicly in each province, so that every nation would be ready for that day. 
ESG.3_2.22	[15] Copies were quickly posted in Susa, but no one in the city could figure out what was going on. Meanwhile, Artaxerxes and Haman got drunk together.
ESG.4.1	Mordecai learned what had happened, and he tore his clothes in sorrow and put on clothes made of sackcloth.
ESG.4.2	But he could go only as far as the palace gate, because no one wearing sackcloth or sprinkled with ashes was allowed inside the palace courtyard.
ESG.4.3	In every province, wherever the king's orders had been read, the Jews cried bitterly and mourned; they put on sackcloth and sprinkled themselves with ashes.
ESG.4.4	When Esther's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing, she was terribly upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear instead of the sackcloth. But he refused. 
ESG.4.5+ESG.4.6	Then Esther called in her personal servant Hachratheus and sent him to find out exactly what was the matter with Mordecai.
ESG.4.7	Mordecai told Hachratheus everything that had happened, and especially how Haman had promised to put over 340 tons of silver into the king's treasury if all the Jews were killed. 
ESG.4.8	Mordecai handed Hachratheus a copy of the orders posted in Susa for the murder of the Jews, then he said:
ESG.4.8	Hachratheus, after you show these orders to Esther and explain what they mean, ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people, the Jews! Then give her this message from me: “Esther, remember that I raised you and that you were once an ordinary person just as we are. And now Haman, the king's highest official, has lied about us, and we have been condemned to die. Beg the Lord for help, then speak to the king for us and save us from death.”
ESG.4.9	Hachratheus went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said. 
ESG.4.10	Esther answered, “Tell Mordecai 
ESG.4.11	that there is a law about going into the inner courtyard to see the king. Everyone in the kingdom knows that if you go in without being invited by him, the penalty is death. The only thing that can save you is for him to hold out his golden scepter
ESG.4.12	When Hachratheus told Mordecai everything Esther had said, 
ESG.4.13	Mordecai told him to go back to Esther and say, “Esther, if all the Jews are going to be killed, don't think that you will escape. 
ESG.4.14	If you refuse to help us, we will find help and protection from someone else, but you and your family will be wiped out. It could be that you were made queen just for a time like this!”
ESG.4.15	Esther sent Hachratheus
ESG.4.16	“Hurry and bring together all the Jews in Susa. Tell them to go without eating for my sake. Don't eat or drink for three days and nights, and my servant girls and I will do the same. Then I will break the law and go in to see the king, even if it means I must die!”
ESG.4.17	Mordecai left and did everything Esther had told him to do.
ESG.4_1.18	[8] 
ESG.4_1.19	[9] Mordecai said:
ESG.4_1.19	Our Lord, you are King and Ruler of the whole earth, and so no one can stop you when you decide to save Israel. 
ESG.4_1.20	[10] You are the Creator of heaven and earth and of all the amazing things on earth as well. 
ESG.4_1.21	[11] Everything obeys your commands, and no one can stand against you.
ESG.4_1.22	[12] Since you know everything, you know that I wasn't being proud or arrogant or vain when I have refused to bow down to that arrogant Haman. 
ESG.4_1.23	[13] I would even kiss the soles of his feet if that would save Israel. 
ESG.4_1.24	[14] But you are my God, and that's why I refused to honor a human the way I honor you. I don't want to sound arrogant, but I won't bow down to anyone except you.
ESG.4_1.25+ESG.4_1.26	[15-16] 
ESG.4_1.27	[17] Answer my prayer and have mercy on us. Turn our sadness into celebration. Let us live, and we will sing praises to your name; we honor you, so please don't let death silence our voices.
ESG.4_1.28	[18] All the Israelites wept bitterly, because they could see they were going to die.
ESG.4_2.29	[1] Queen Esther was worried and upset, and she realized that only the Lord could save her people from being killed. 
ESG.4_2.30	[2] So she took off her beautiful royal robes and put on clothes that showed it was a time of suffering and death. She put ashes and dirt
ESG.4_2.31	[3] Then she prayed to the Lord God of Israel:
ESG.4_2.31	You, Lord, are the only King we have. And no one except you can help me now, because I'm all alone, 
ESG.4_2.32	[4] and I've decided to risk my life.
ESG.4_2.33	[5] Ever since I was born, those who belong to my family's tribe have told me that long ago you chose our ancestors to become Israel, your own special people. You have always kept your promises to us. 
ESG.4_2.34	[6] But we sinned against you, Lord, and you let our enemies conquer us 
ESG.4_2.35	[7] because we had worshiped their gods. You were right to punish us this way.
ESG.4_2.36	[8] But our enemies weren't satisfied just to keep us in bitter slavery. Now they have made an agreement with their idols 
ESG.4_2.37	[9] to kill all of us, your special people. And if they get rid of us, your promises to us will be meaningless. We will no longer be able to praise you, and we won't be able to worship you and offer sacrifices in your temple. 
ESG.4_2.38	[10] Then the nations will praise their idols and forever give honor to a mere earthly king.
ESG.4_2.39	[11] Please, Lord, don't hand over your royal power
ESG.4_2.40	[12] You are king of the gods and are above every other ruler, so show your power and rescue us in this time of great danger. Give me courage 
ESG.4_2.41	[13] and the right words to say to the king,
ESG.4_2.42	[14] 
ESG.4_2.43+ESG.4_2.44	[15-16] You know all things—you know how much I hate being the queen of this evil country. I hate the honor that the people give me, and wearing my crown when I go out in public is the same as wearing a blood-soaked rag placed around my head. That's why I refuse to wear it in my own living quarters. And you also know that I even hate to sleep with my husband the king, because he isn't one of your people and isn't circumcised. 
ESG.4_2.45	[17] I am your servant, Lord, and I have never eaten at the same table as Haman, and I have never attended the king's banquets or drunk wine that had been offered to other gods.
ESG.4_2.46	[18] You are the Lord God that Abraham worshiped, and only you have given me any joy since I was brought here.
ESG.4_2.47	[19] We have little hope left. But you, Lord, have power over everything, so please hear our prayers and rescue us from those who are evil. And help me not to be afraid.
ESG.5_1.1	Esther prayed for three days,
ESG.5_1.2	When Esther finished getting ready, she was beautiful. She prayed once more to God, the Savior who watches over all things, and she left with her two favorite servant girls. 
ESG.5_1.3	One of them helped her walk, 
ESG.5_1.4	and the other followed right behind and kept her long robes from dragging on the floor. 
ESG.5_1.5	Esther's beauty was perfect. Her face was glowing with happiness, as though she knew the king loved her. However, in her heart she felt paralyzed by fear.
ESG.5_1.6	Finally Esther passed through the last doorway and into the throne room, where she stopped in front of King Artaxerxes. He was seated there, wearing majestic royal robes that were covered with jewels and gold—a terrifying sight.
ESG.5_1.7	The king looked up, and his face was burning with royal anger. Queen Esther went pale! She fainted and fell right on top of her servant,
ESG.5_1.8	Then God changed the king's anger into concern for Esther, and the king jumped up and ran over to her. He took Esther in his arms, holding her until she came to. Then he comforted her and gently said, 
ESG.5_1.9	“Esther, what's wrong? Don't be afraid! I'm your husband,
ESG.5_1.10	so that law about being put to death doesn't apply to you; it only applies to our people.
ESG.5_1.11+ESG.5_1.12	Still holding her in his arms, the king touched Esther's neck with his golden scepter
ESG.5_1.13	Esther replied, “Your Majesty, when I saw you, it was like seeing one of God's angels. I was struck with fear of your royal splendor. 
ESG.5_1.14	My king, your power is amazing, but your face is full of kindness.” 
ESG.5_1.15	Then Esther fainted and fell again.
ESG.5_1.16	The king was worried and upset, and all his servants came and helped Esther.
ESG.5_2.17	[3] 
ESG.5_2.18	[4] Esther answered, “Your Majesty, today is special to me. Please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today.”
ESG.5_2.19	[5] The king said to his servants, “Hurry and get Haman, so we can accept Esther's invitation.”
ESG.5_2.19	The king and Haman went to the dinner that Esther had spoken about, 
ESG.5_2.20	[6] and while they were drinking wine, the king asked, “What can I do for you, Queen Esther? I will do whatever you ask.”
ESG.5_2.21+ESG.5_2.22	[7-8] Esther replied, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me, please bring Haman again tomorrow, and I will prepare another dinner just like this one.”
ESG.5_2.23	[9] Haman was feeling great as he left the king, but when he saw Mordecai the Jew in the palace courtyard, Haman became furious.
ESG.5_2.24	[10] When Haman got home, he called together his friends and his wife Zosara 
ESG.5_2.25	[11] and started bragging about his great wealth. Then he told them the many ways the king had honored him and how the king had promoted him so that he was now the highest royal official. 
ESG.5_2.26	[12] Finally, Haman said, “And today, I was the only person, besides the king himself, that the queen invited to dinner. I have even been invited back for dinner again tomorrow. 
ESG.5_2.27	[13] But none of this makes me happy, as long as I see that Jew Mordecai in the palace courtyard.”
ESG.5_2.28	[14] Then Haman's wife Zosara and his friends said, “Build a tower about 22 meters high, and tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai there! Then later, you can have dinner with the king and enjoy yourself.”
ESG.5_2.28	This seemed like a good idea to Haman, and he gave orders for the tower to be built.
ESG.6.1	That night, the Lord did not let King Artaxerxes get any sleep. So he called in his secretary
ESG.6.2	They came across the report of how Mordecai had saved the king's life by telling him about the two guards who planned to kill him. 
ESG.6.3+ESG.6.4	Artaxerxes asked his servants, “What did we do to reward Mordecai for his kindness?”
ESG.6.3+ESG.6.4	“Your Majesty,” they answered, “you haven't done anything for him.”
ESG.6.3+ESG.6.4	Just then, Haman came into the palace courtyard to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the tower he had built. The king saw him and said, “Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?”
ESG.6.5	The king's servants answered, “Your Majesty, it is Haman.”
ESG.6.5	“Tell him to come in,” the king commanded.
ESG.6.6	“Tell me, Haman,” the king said, “what should I do for a man I want to honor?”
ESG.6.6	Haman thought, “The king must be asking how I want to be honored!” 
ESG.6.7	So he replied, “Your Majesty, if you wish to honor a man, 
ESG.6.8	order your servants to bring out one of your own fine linen robes and one of your own horses. 
ESG.6.9	Have one of your most honored friends put the robe on this man you like so well. Then the man will ride your horse and be led through the city streets, while someone shouts, ‘This is how the king honors a man!’ ”
ESG.6.10	“That's a great idea!” the king exclaimed. “I want to honor Mordecai the Jew, who is on duty in the palace courtyard. Do just what you have said, and don't forget a thing.”
ESG.6.11	Haman got the king's robe. He put it on Mordecai and helped him get on the king's horse. Then, as he led Mordecai through the city streets, Haman shouted, “This is how the king honors a man.”
ESG.6.12	Afterwards, Mordecai went back to the palace courtyard, and Haman turned around and went home, hiding his face in shame. 
ESG.6.13	He told his wife Zosara and his friends what had happened, and they replied, “Since Mordecai is a Jew, this is only the beginning of your troubles! You are doomed, and there's nothing you can do about it, because the living God is helping him.”
ESG.6.14	They were still talking when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
ESG.7.1	King Artaxerxes and Haman dined with Queen Esther 
ESG.7.2	on that second day. And while they were drinking wine, Artaxerxes said, “Esther, my queen, what can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom!”
ESG.7.3	Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me, you can save me and my people. 
ESG.7.4	I have learned that all of us, even our children, have been sold, so that we can be robbed and made slaves or killed. We have an enemy in your court who is not worthy to serve you.”
ESG.7.5	“Who would dare to do such a thing?” the king asked.
ESG.7.6	Esther replied, “That evil Haman is the one out to get us!”
ESG.7.6	Haman was terrified as he sat there in front of the king and the queen.
ESG.7.7	The king got up from the table and went into the palace garden.
ESG.7.7	Haman started begging Queen Esther for mercy, because he knew he was in trouble. 
ESG.7.8	He even threw himself on her couch to plead with her. Just then the king came in from the garden and shouted, “He's even trying to rape my wife in my own house!”
ESG.7.8	Haman knew he was doomed.
ESG.7.9	Then Bugathan, one of the king's personal servants, said, “Your Majesty, Haman built a tower 22 meters high beside his house, so he could hang Mordecai on it. And Mordecai is the one who spoke up and saved your life.”
ESG.7.9	“Hang Haman from his own tower!” the king said. 
ESG.7.10	And immediately, Haman was hanged on the tower he had built to hang Mordecai. Afterward, the king calmed down.
ESG.8.1	Before the end of the day, King Artaxerxes gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was related to her, and the king had Mordecai brought in. 
ESG.8.2	The king gave Mordecai the royal ring that Haman had worn, and Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
ESG.8.3	Once again, Esther went to speak to the king. This time she fell down at his feet and begged him to do something about the horrible things that Haman had planned for the Jews. 
ESG.8.4	The king held out his golden scepter
ESG.8.5	Then she said, “Your Majesty, Haman sent letters demanding that all the Jews in your kingdom be killed. Please send out a command that Haman's letters are not to be obeyed. 
ESG.8.6	I can't bear to see my own people destroyed, and if everyone from my nation is killed, I will be too.”
ESG.8.7	The king replied, “Esther, Haman attacked the Jews, and so I gave orders for Haman to be hanged from his own wooden tower, and I have given you his property. Tell me what more you want me to do. 
ESG.8.8	 Better yet, I give you and Mordecai permission to send out letters in my name. Write whatever you think is best. Be sure to use my ring to seal the letters, because once my commands are written down and sealed with my ring, they cannot be changed.”
ESG.8.9	That same year, on the twenty-third day of Nisan,
ESG.8.10	The letters were written at the king's command and were sealed with his ring, then they were delivered by messengers. 
ESG.8.11+ESG.8.12	In the letters, King Artaxerxes commanded the Jews of every city in his kingdom to obey their own laws. And on the thirteenth day of Adar,
ESG.8_1.13	[1] This is a copy of the letter:
ESG.8_1.13	From Artaxerxes, the Great King, to the governors of my 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia, and to everyone who is loyal to me. I send you my greetings.
ESG.8_1.14	[2] People often become proud when I show kindness and honor them. 
ESG.8_1.15	[3] Their success makes them arrogant, and they try to harm other people in my kingdom. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they plot against me, although I have always been good to them. 
ESG.8_1.16	[4] They refuse to be grateful, and they believe all the flattering things they are told by those who hate what is good. These people think that God won't punish them, even though he hates evil and can see everything they do.
ESG.8_1.17+ESG.8_1.18	[5-6] A king who wants to be good to his people will often let his friends be officials in his government, because he trusts them to give good advice and to do right. But when they are evil, they tell lies and persuade the king to kill innocent people or to do other horrible things that can never be made right. 
ESG.8_1.19	[7] When we look at historical records passed down to us, we see how much evil can be done when high officials are unworthy of their positions and use their power in a destructive way. But we can see this even more clearly by looking at what has just happened here in our own kingdom.
ESG.8_1.20	[8] From now on, I am going to concentrate on making my kingdom a place where everyone can find safety and peace. 
ESG.8_1.21	[9] I will change the way I rule, and when I make decisions, I will be fair to everyone.
ESG.8_1.22+ESG.8_1.23	[10-11] As for Haman son of Hammedatha, he wasn't even a Persian—he was from Macedonia!
ESG.8_1.22+ESG.8_1.23	But Haman was never kind to anyone. 
ESG.8_1.24	[12] He was full of pride, and so he plotted to kill me and take over my kingdom. 
ESG.8_1.25	[13] His evil plans included tricking me into ordering that all the Jews were to be killed, including Mordecai, who saved my life and who is always doing good things for me. Queen Esther is also Jewish, which means that Haman would have killed her too, even though she shares my royal rule and has never done anything wrong. 
ESG.8_1.26	[14] Haman thought that if he could have all the Jews killed, I would have no one to support me, and then he could take over the Persian Empire and give it to the Macedonians.
ESG.8_1.27	[15] The Jews were sentenced to death by this man who deserved to be under a curse. But I have found that Jews are not criminals at all. Instead, they live their lives according to laws that are fair to everyone. 
ESG.8_1.28	[16] And the Jews are the children of the highest and greatest God, the living God, who has guided my ancestors and me in ruling Persia the best way possible.
ESG.8_1.29	[17] So, it is best for you to ignore the letters sent by Haman, 
ESG.8_1.30	[18] since he and his whole family have now been hanged at the city gate of Susa. God rules the world and was quick to punish Haman as he deserved.
ESG.8_1.31	[19] A copy of this letter is to be put on public display in every town.
ESG.8_1.31	You must allow the Jews to live by their own laws. 
ESG.8_1.32	[20] And since the thirteenth day of the month of Adar
ESG.8_1.33	[21] God rules all things, and he has decided to make the thirteenth of Adar a day when his chosen people will celebrate, instead of being killed.
ESG.8_1.34	[22] Place this special day on the list of festivals to be celebrated in your province. 
ESG.8_1.35	[23] This day will always remind us and all other loyal Persians how we were saved. It will also remind everyone that those who plot against us will be destroyed.
ESG.8_1.36	[24] I will be furious with any city or province that disobeys my instructions, and I will send my army to destroy it with fire. No one will be able to travel there, and even the wild animals and birds will hate to be anywhere near it.
ESG.8_2.37	[13] Copies of this letter are to be put on public display everywhere in the kingdom, so that all the Jews will be prepared to fight their enemies on the thirteenth of Adar.
ESG.8_2.38	[14] The king ordered his messengers to take their horses and deliver the letters as quickly as possible to every province, and he also had copies of the letter put on display in Susa.
ESG.8_2.39	[15] Mordecai left the palace wearing one of the king's robes, as well as a strip of purple linen cloth around his turban, and a gold crown. The people of Susa started cheering when they saw him.
ESG.8_2.40	[16] The Jews no longer felt doomed; instead, they were full of joy. 
ESG.8_2.41	[17] Copies of the letter were displayed in public in every city and province, and Jews all over the kingdom held parties to celebrate. Many Gentiles accepted the Jewish religion and were circumcised, because they were afraid of the Jews.
ESG.9.3	The rulers, the royal officials, and the governors of the provinces were afraid of Mordecai and showed respect for all the Jews. 
ESG.9.4+ESG.9.5	Mordecai was well known throughout the kingdom because of the letters the king had sent.
ESG.9.6+ESG.9.7+ESG.9.8+ESG.9.9+ESG.9.10	The Jews killed 500 men
ESG.9.11	That same day, someone reported to the king how many people the Jews had killed in Susa. 
ESG.9.12	The king said to Esther, “The Jews have killed 500 men
ESG.9.13	Esther answered, “Please let the Jews do the same tomorrow as they have done today, and let them hang the bodies of Haman's ten sons.”
ESG.9.14	The king gave the orders to allow the Jews to fight a second day, and he had the bodies of Haman's sons handed over to the Jews of Susa, so they could hang them. 
ESG.9.15	Then on the next day, Adar fourteenth, the Jews of the city got together and killed 300 more men,
ESG.9.16+ESG.9.17	On Adar thirteenth the Jews in the provinces had come together to defend themselves. They killed 15,000 of their enemies but took nothing that belonged to the ones they killed. Then on Adar fourteenth these Jews rested and celebrated their victory.
ESG.9.18	On the fourteenth, the Jews in Susa were still defending themselves, and so they celebrated on the fifteenth. 
ESG.9.19	That's why the Jews who live in small villages or on farms now observe this holiday on Adar fourteenth, while the Jews that live in the large cities observe it on the fifteenth. It is a joyful holiday that they celebrate by sending gifts of food to each other.
ESG.9.20	Mordecai wrote a book reporting everything that had happened, and he sent copies of it to the Jews everywhere in the kingdom of Artaxerxes. 
ESG.9.21	He also sent a letter that said:
ESG.9.21	Celebrate on both the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar,
ESG.9.22	the days when we Jews defeated our enemies. Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy, a time when celebration took the place of grief. Celebrate during the whole month of Adar by having weddings and parties and sending gifts of food to your neighbors and to the poor.
ESG.9.23	The Jews welcomed Mordecai's report 
ESG.9.24	 of how Haman son of Hammedatha, the Macedonian, had fought against them. Mordecai also told how Haman had used small pieces of wood or bone, called lots,
ESG.9.25	Then he went to the king to ask him to hang Mordecai. But Haman became the victim of his own plot, and he and his sons were all hanged instead. 
ESG.9.26+ESG.9.27+ESG.9.28	Mordecai's letter said that the Jews must celebrate for two days because of what had happened to them. And so the Jews made an agreement that they, their descendants, and everyone who accepted their religion in the future would always celebrate these two days to remind themselves of everything that had happened. They would celebrate, no matter what family they belonged to or where they lived.
ESG.9.26+ESG.9.27+ESG.9.28	This time of celebration came to be known as “Purim,” which is the name in Hebrew for the lots that Haman had used.
ESG.9.29+ESG.9.30	Esther
ESG.9.31	Mordecai and Queen Esther used their own authority to make Purim an official Jewish festival. Then they promised that for as long as they had health and strength, they would both do their best to make sure every Jew celebrated Purim.
ESG.9.32	Esther even had a law made, so that the Jews would never forget to celebrate it.
ESG.10.1	King Artaxerxes made everyone in his kingdom pay taxes, even those in lands across the sea. 
ESG.10.2	The record books of the kings of Persia and Media tell how strong and brave he was, and they also describe the wealth and glory of his kingdom. 
ESG.10.3	Next to the king himself, Mordecai was the highest official in the kingdom. The Jews all loved and honored him because he helped them in many ways.
ESG.10.4+ESG.10.5	Mordecai said:
ESG.10.4+ESG.10.5	I remember that I had a dream
ESG.10.6	In the dream I had, I saw a tiny stream become a mighty river, then I watched the sun rise and give its light. The river stood for Esther, because the king married her and crowned her queen. 
ESG.10.7	Haman and I were the two dragons. 
ESG.10.8	And just as I dreamed, the other nations came together to destroy the Jews. 
ESG.10.9	Our people cried out to the Lord God for help, and he performed miracles and saved us from all the evil things that were going to happen. No one had ever seen such powerful miracles before.
ESG.10.10	Long ago God chose us to be his people, but he rejected the other nations. 
ESG.10.11	Then, when those nations were against us, God had to decide between us and them. 
ESG.10.12	God remembered that we were his people, and he decided that we were in the right. 
ESG.10.13	And so from now on, we Jews must observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
ESG.10_1.14	[1] In the fourth year that Ptolemy and Cleopatra ruled Egypt,
WIS.1.1	should love justice;
WIS.1.1	you should do what is right
WIS.1.1	and keep the Lord in mind.
WIS.1.2	The Lord will answer your prayers,
WIS.1.2	if you trust and don't doubt.
WIS.1.3	Our deceitful thoughts
WIS.1.3	separate us from God,
WIS.1.3	and by putting God to the test,
WIS.1.3	we make fools of ourselves,
WIS.1.4	because Wisdom
WIS.1.4	with deceitful slaves of sin.
WIS.1.5	A pure mind and self-control
WIS.1.5	won't let you be deceitful;
WIS.1.5	you will reject foolish thoughts
WIS.1.5	and hate injustice.
WIS.1.6	Although Wisdom is friendly,
WIS.1.6	she will still hold you guilty
WIS.1.6	if you speak evil of God.
WIS.1.6	Even words spoken in secret
WIS.1.6	and our most private thoughts
WIS.1.6	are known to God,
WIS.1.7	because the Spirit of the Lord
WIS.1.7	is everywhere in this world.
WIS.1.7	His Spirit holds it all together
WIS.1.7	and hears every word.
WIS.1.8	And so liars will be judged
WIS.1.8	and then punished—
WIS.1.9	their evil plans and deeds
WIS.1.9	will be discovered,
WIS.1.9	then reported to the Lord,
WIS.1.9	and they will be sentenced.
WIS.1.10	Nothing can escape being heard,
WIS.1.10	not even a faint grumble.
WIS.1.11	So stop all useless complaining
WIS.1.11	and fault-finding.
WIS.1.11	Even a faint whisper
WIS.1.11	can cause a problem,
WIS.1.11	and lies are deadly.
WIS.1.12	Don't invite death
WIS.1.12	and destruction
WIS.1.12	by living like a fool.
WIS.1.13	and when we die,
WIS.1.13	it doesn't make him glad.
WIS.1.14	God created all creatures
WIS.1.14	with life that continues.
WIS.1.14	All living beings
WIS.1.14	should keep on living
WIS.1.14	untouched by deadly poison,
WIS.1.14	because the Kingdom of Death
WIS.1.14	doesn't rule this world,
WIS.1.15	and justice lives forever.
WIS.1.16	of evil people
WIS.1.16	are an invitation to death.
WIS.1.16	They think of death
WIS.1.16	as friendly and desirable—
WIS.1.16	they are partners with death,
WIS.1.16	just as they deserve.
WIS.2.1	Their foolish minds lead them
WIS.2.1	to say to each other:
WIS.2.1	“Life is short and sad—
WIS.2.1	the end is certain to come,
WIS.2.1	and no one escapes the grave.
WIS.2.2	Only by chance were we born,
WIS.2.2	and after we are gone,
WIS.2.2	everything will be
WIS.2.2	as though we had never been.
WIS.2.2	Our breath is merely smoke,
WIS.2.2	and reason is a spark
WIS.2.2	from the beat of our hearts.
WIS.2.3	When that beating ends,
WIS.2.3	our bodies turn to dust,
WIS.2.3	and our spirits vanish
WIS.2.3	into thin air.
WIS.2.4	In time we will be forgotten
WIS.2.4	and so will our deeds.
WIS.2.4	Life disappears like a cloud;
WIS.2.4	it melts away like mist
WIS.2.4	in the heat of the sun.
WIS.2.5	Time fades away like a shadow,
WIS.2.5	and no one returns from death.
WIS.2.6	especially while you're young.
WIS.2.7	Drink the very best wine,
WIS.2.7	wear expensive perfume,
WIS.2.7	and enjoy the spring flowers.
WIS.2.8	Decorate your head with rosebuds
WIS.2.8	before they wilt.
WIS.2.9	Do your share of celebrating!
WIS.2.9	Party always and everywhere—
WIS.2.9	that's what life is all about.
WIS.2.10	Abuse the poor and the honest!
WIS.2.10	And do the same to widows
WIS.2.10	and old people.
WIS.2.11	After all, might is right,
WIS.2.11	and weakness is useless.
WIS.2.12	Get them out of the way.
WIS.2.12	All they do is condemn you
WIS.2.12	for breaking the law and doing
WIS.2.12	what we know is wrong.
WIS.2.13	They claim to know the Lord God
WIS.2.13	and to be his children.
WIS.2.14	That's why they criticize
WIS.2.14	your very thoughts.
WIS.2.15	“Just looking at good people
WIS.2.15	is a heavy burden—
WIS.2.15	their lifestyle is so different;
WIS.2.15	in fact, it's strange.
WIS.2.16	They think you're trash,
WIS.2.16	and they won't have anything
WIS.2.16	to do with you.
WIS.2.16	They claim God is their Father
WIS.2.16	and that he will reward them.
WIS.2.17	“So test what they say
WIS.2.17	by watching them die.
WIS.2.18	If those so-called good people
WIS.2.18	really are God's children,
WIS.2.18	he will look after them.
WIS.2.19	We will insult and torture them
WIS.2.19	to find out how gentle
WIS.2.19	and patient they are.
WIS.2.20	We will sentence them
WIS.2.20	to a shameful death—
WIS.2.20	after all, they have said
WIS.2.20	that they will be protected.”
WIS.2.21	That's the reasoning of those
WIS.2.21	who are evil, and they are
WIS.2.21	both blind and foolish.
WIS.2.22	They don't understand
WIS.2.22	what God has in mind,
WIS.2.22	and they don't know the reward
WIS.2.22	for living right.
WIS.2.23	just as he himself does.
WIS.2.24	But death entered the world
WIS.2.24	because the devil was jealous,
WIS.2.24	and so all his followers die.
WIS.3.1	The souls of those
WIS.3.1	who have pleased God
WIS.3.1	are safe in his hands
WIS.3.1	and protected from pain.
WIS.3.2	are those people dead
WIS.3.2	and their death considered
WIS.3.2	a disaster 
WIS.3.3	or a destruction.
WIS.3.3	In fact, they are at peace
WIS.3.4	and destined never to die,
WIS.3.4	though others may have thought
WIS.3.4	they were being punished.
WIS.3.5	because God tested them
WIS.3.5	for a while
WIS.3.5	and found them worthy
WIS.3.5	of being his children.
WIS.3.6	God tested them like gold
WIS.3.6	in a fiery furnace,
WIS.3.6	and he accepted them
WIS.3.6	like a pleasing sacrifice.
WIS.3.7	When God shows them mercy,
WIS.3.7	they will be like shining sparks
WIS.3.7	setting weeds on fire.
WIS.3.8	The Lord will rule them forever
WIS.3.8	and let them rule over nations.
WIS.3.9	All of God's faithful people
WIS.3.9	will understand truth
WIS.3.9	and live with him in love,
WIS.3.9	because God is kind and merciful
WIS.3.9	to those he chooses
WIS.3.9	to be his holy people.
WIS.3.10	The wicked will be punished,
WIS.3.10	as their evil thoughts deserve.
WIS.3.10	They rebelled against the Lord
WIS.3.10	and abused his people.
WIS.3.11	They are terribly miserable,
WIS.3.11	because they reject wisdom
WIS.3.11	and sound advice.
WIS.3.11	Their future is hopeless,
WIS.3.11	and everything they do
WIS.3.11	is completely useless.
WIS.3.12	Their wives are foolish;
WIS.3.12	their children are evil
WIS.3.13	and under God's curse.
WIS.3.13	A wife who remains faithful
WIS.3.13	will be given children
WIS.3.13	at a time that God decides.
WIS.3.14	Men who remain faithful to God
WIS.3.14	and do good deeds
WIS.3.14	will receive special blessings
WIS.3.14	and be given honored positions
WIS.3.14	in the temple of the Lord,
WIS.3.14	even though they may be unable
WIS.3.14	to have children.
WIS.3.15	Remember that good deeds
WIS.3.15	are easily recognized—
WIS.3.15	they are like fruit on a vine
WIS.3.15	that has wisdom as its roots.
WIS.3.16	But children born to persons
WIS.3.16	who have committed
WIS.3.16	some terrible sexual sin
WIS.3.16	will die before they grow up.
WIS.3.17	Even if they live a long time,
WIS.3.17	they won't be respected.
WIS.3.18	And if they die in their youth,
WIS.3.18	they will be without hope
WIS.3.18	on the day of judgment,
WIS.3.19	because misery is the reward
WIS.3.19	for doing evil.
WIS.4.1	than having children—
WIS.4.1	both God and people
WIS.4.1	will always remember you
WIS.4.1	and the good you have done.
WIS.4.2	People imitate
WIS.4.2	and they miss it
WIS.4.2	when it is gone.
WIS.4.2	Goodness always triumphs;
WIS.4.2	it receives the highest honors
WIS.4.2	because it is unselfish.
WIS.4.3	But all of the many children
WIS.4.3	born to sinners
WIS.4.3	will be useless and helpless
WIS.4.3	like trees without roots.
WIS.4.4	They may blossom for a while,
WIS.4.4	but they will be swept away
WIS.4.4	in a gust of wind.
WIS.4.5	Their branches will be broken
WIS.4.5	before they mature,
WIS.4.5	and the fruit they produce
WIS.4.5	will be worthless.
WIS.4.6	When God judges the world,
WIS.4.6	these children will be witnesses
WIS.4.6	against their sinful parents.
WIS.4.7	Good people may die early,
WIS.4.7	but they will be at rest.
WIS.4.8	True respect isn't gained
WIS.4.8	merely by growing old—
WIS.4.9	people are honored because of
WIS.4.9	their wisdom and goodness.
WIS.4.10	and who pleased him,
WIS.4.10	was living among sinners.
WIS.4.10	But God took him away
WIS.4.11	to protect his mind and soul
WIS.4.11	from the influence of evil.
WIS.4.12	Even the most innocent person
WIS.4.12	can be deceived and destroyed
WIS.4.12	by sinful thoughts.
WIS.4.13	But Enoch loved the Lord;
WIS.4.13	he became mature in a few years
WIS.4.14	and pleased the Lord.
WIS.4.14	So he quickly took Enoch away
WIS.4.14	to protect him from evil.
WIS.4.15	Others failed to understand
WIS.4.15	that this is how
WIS.4.15	God shows kindness and mercy
WIS.4.15	and protects his holy people.
WIS.4.16	Good people may die young,
WIS.4.16	but they shame those sinners
WIS.4.16	who live a long time.
WIS.4.17	Sinners fail to understand
WIS.4.17	why God gives them a long life
WIS.4.17	and lets the wise die young.
WIS.4.18	When they see this happen,
WIS.4.18	they simply sneer.
WIS.4.18	But God will laugh at them
WIS.4.18	because their dead bodies
WIS.4.18	will be forever disgusting
WIS.4.18	to the rest of the dead.
WIS.4.19	God will throw them speechless
WIS.4.19	to the ground, and they will be
WIS.4.19	like buildings that crumble.
WIS.4.19	They will suffer and rot,
WIS.4.19	then be forgotten.
WIS.4.20	Sinners will be horrified
WIS.4.20	when they are condemned
WIS.4.20	by their evil deeds.
WIS.5.1	But all who have pleased God
WIS.5.1	will stand with confidence
WIS.5.1	in the presence of those
WIS.5.1	who abused them and made fun
WIS.5.1	of the good they did.
WIS.5.2	When those evil ones see
WIS.5.2	how God has saved his people,
WIS.5.2	they will tremble with fear
WIS.5.2	and be completely amazed.
WIS.5.3	They will groan and say
WIS.5.3	to each other,
WIS.5.3	“We should have turned from sin!
WIS.5.4	We were fools to sneer
WIS.5.4	at those people,
WIS.5.4	but we thought they were fools
WIS.5.4	who had died in disgrace.
WIS.5.5	Why are they God's children?
WIS.5.5	Why are they his holy people?
WIS.5.6	“So we were the ones
WIS.5.6	who turned from truth
WIS.5.6	and rejected the light
WIS.5.6	from those good people.
WIS.5.7	We refused to follow the Lord!
WIS.5.7	Instead we were lawless
WIS.5.7	and followed a desert road
WIS.5.7	that led us to destruction.
WIS.5.8	All of our pride and wealth
WIS.5.8	has proved to be useless.
WIS.5.9	“Everything we treasured
WIS.5.9	has vanished like a shadow
WIS.5.9	or a hastily spoken word,
WIS.5.9	* 
WIS.5.10	or like the wake of a ship
WIS.5.10	on ocean waves,
WIS.5.11	or like the flight of a bird
WIS.5.11	through the air,
WIS.5.12	or like the unknown path
WIS.5.12	of an arrow on its way
WIS.5.12	to the target.
WIS.5.13	As soon as we were born,
WIS.5.13	we began to disappear
WIS.5.13	because we followed only evil
WIS.5.13	and left behind no traces
WIS.5.13	of anything good.”
WIS.5.14	Sinners have no more hope
WIS.5.14	than dust in the wind,
WIS.5.14	or frost in the heat of the sun,
WIS.5.14	or smoke in a breeze.
WIS.5.14	They are remembered no longer
WIS.5.14	than an overnight guest.
WIS.5.15	The Lord Most High
WIS.5.15	takes care of his people;
WIS.5.15	he will reward them,
WIS.5.15	and they will live forever.
WIS.5.16	The Lord will protect them
WIS.5.16	with his powerful right arm,
WIS.5.16	and he will bless them
WIS.5.16	with a glorious crown.
WIS.5.17	for the Lord, and he will equip
WIS.5.17	all creation to fight
WIS.5.17	and punish his enemies.
WIS.5.18	The Lord will protect his chest
WIS.5.18	with deeds of fairness,
WIS.5.18	and for a helmet he will wear
WIS.5.18	equal justice for all.
WIS.5.19	Holiness will be his strong shield,
WIS.5.20	and fierce anger will be
WIS.5.20	his sharp sword.
WIS.5.20	All creation will join with him
WIS.5.20	in fighting his crazy enemies.
WIS.5.21	Arrows of lightning will leap
WIS.5.21	from behind the clouds
WIS.5.21	and never miss their target.
WIS.5.22	Fearsome hailstones will strike
WIS.5.22	the Lord's enemies,
WIS.5.22	while ocean waves and rivers
WIS.5.22	roll over them like a flood.
WIS.5.23	Then a mighty windstorm
WIS.5.23	will sweep them away—
WIS.5.23	because lawlessness and evil
WIS.5.23	bring ruin to the whole earth
WIS.5.23	and to every kingdom.
WIS.6.1	Now listen and learn,
WIS.6.1	you kings and judges!
WIS.6.2	Listen, all of you rulers,
WIS.6.2	who control many nations.
WIS.6.3	from the Lord Most High,
WIS.6.3	and he will judge your deeds
WIS.6.3	and your thoughts.
WIS.6.4	Although you were his servants,
WIS.6.4	you disobeyed him
WIS.6.4	and ruled unjustly.
WIS.6.5	So now the Lord will punish you
WIS.6.5	both quickly and harshly
WIS.6.5	because you are in power.
WIS.6.6	God forgives ordinary people,
WIS.6.6	but severely punishes
WIS.6.6	the high and the mighty.
WIS.6.7	The Lord created everyone—
WIS.6.7	the powerful and the weak.
WIS.6.7	God has no favorites;
WIS.6.7	he isn't afraid of anyone,
WIS.6.8	and he requires rulers
WIS.6.8	to answer for what they do.
WIS.6.9	I am speaking to you rulers,
WIS.6.9	so that you will have wisdom
WIS.6.9	and not sin against God.
WIS.6.10	If you want to belong
WIS.6.10	to the Lord's holy people
WIS.6.10	and to defend yourself
WIS.6.10	on the day of judgment,
WIS.6.11	then eagerly desire to learn
WIS.6.11	all that I am teaching.
WIS.6.12	Wisdom
WIS.6.12	and never fades.
WIS.6.12	She is easily recognized
WIS.6.12	by those who love her
WIS.6.12	and look for her.
WIS.6.13	Wisdom wants to be known
WIS.6.13	by those who desire her.
WIS.6.14	If you get up early
WIS.6.14	to look for wisdom
WIS.6.14	you find her at your door.
WIS.6.15	Just thinking about Wisdom
WIS.6.15	leads to full understanding,
WIS.6.15	and caring about Wisdom
WIS.6.15	will soon set you free
WIS.6.15	from all other cares.
WIS.6.16	Wisdom searches eagerly
WIS.6.16	for those who are seeking,
WIS.6.16	and she lets them find her
WIS.6.16	in all of their thoughts.
WIS.6.17	If you really want Wisdom,
WIS.6.17	then fall in love with her
WIS.6.17	and desire to learn.
WIS.6.18	If you truly love Wisdom,
WIS.6.18	you will obey her laws;
WIS.6.18	then you will be sure
WIS.6.18	of life after death.
WIS.6.19	And just as life after death
WIS.6.19	will bring you near to God,
WIS.6.20	the desire for Wisdom
WIS.6.20	will protect your kingdom.
WIS.6.21	So if you want to rule
WIS.6.21	for a long time,
WIS.6.21	you must respect Wisdom.
WIS.6.22	I will now tell you clearly
WIS.6.22	the full truth about her
WIS.6.22	from the very beginning.
WIS.6.23	I won't be jealous or conceal
WIS.6.23	anything I know—
WIS.6.23	that isn't the way of Wisdom.
WIS.6.24	The only hope for the world
WIS.6.24	is for many of us to be wise;
WIS.6.24	indeed, a wise ruler
WIS.6.24	gives security to a nation.
WIS.6.25	So be guided by my teachings,
WIS.6.25	and you will be successful.
WIS.7.1	I am destined to die.
WIS.7.1	I too am a descendant
WIS.7.1	of that man who was made
WIS.7.1	from the soil of the earth.
WIS.7.1	And my body took shape
WIS.7.1	inside my mother's womb.
WIS.7.2	For ten months I was there,
WIS.7.2	growing in her blood
WIS.7.2	from seed left by my father
WIS.7.2	as they were making love.
WIS.7.3	And when I was born,
WIS.7.3	I breathed the same air as others
WIS.7.3	and touched the same earth.
WIS.7.3	Like all other children,
WIS.7.3	my first sound was a cry.
WIS.7.4	I was nursed with love
WIS.7.4	and dressed in baby clothes.
WIS.7.5	No rulers have their beginning
WIS.7.5	any differently—
WIS.7.6	all enter life in the same way
WIS.7.6	and leave in the same way.
WIS.7.7	and for understanding,
WIS.7.7	and my prayer was answered.
WIS.7.8	Nothing compares with Wisdom!
WIS.7.8	And so I chose her
WIS.7.8	over power and wealth.
WIS.7.9	In comparison with Wisdom,
WIS.7.9	precious gems are nothing;
WIS.7.9	gold is merely sand,
WIS.7.9	and silver is simply clay.
WIS.7.10	I preferred Wisdom more than
WIS.7.10	a healthy and handsome body;
WIS.7.10	the brightest light grows dim
WIS.7.10	when compared with her.
WIS.7.11	Wisdom brought me wealth
WIS.7.11	and everything good.
WIS.7.12	I was pleased with all
WIS.7.12	that she brought me,
WIS.7.12	though I failed to realize
WIS.7.12	that Wisdom was the source.
WIS.7.13	I sincerely studied,
WIS.7.13	then freely shared the riches
WIS.7.13	I learned from Wisdom.
WIS.7.14	Wisdom's treasures never end.
WIS.7.14	God approves of her,
WIS.7.14	and those who gain Wisdom
WIS.7.14	are friends of God.
WIS.7.15	I pray that God will help me
WIS.7.15	to say the right thing
WIS.7.15	and to have thoughts
WIS.7.15	worthy of his gifts to me.
WIS.7.15	God shows Wisdom the way
WIS.7.15	and instructs wise people.
WIS.7.16	Our lives and our words,
WIS.7.16	our understanding and skills
WIS.7.16	are all in the hands of God.
WIS.7.17	From God came my knowledge
WIS.7.17	about the universe
WIS.7.17	and how its parts work;
WIS.7.18	about the way a calendar
WIS.7.18	is determined;
WIS.7.18	about the movement of the sun
WIS.7.18	and the changing seasons;
WIS.7.19	about the way the years
WIS.7.19	come and go on schedule;
WIS.7.19	about the groups of stars
WIS.7.20	and the way animals behave,
WIS.7.20	both tame and wild;
WIS.7.20	about the motion of the wind
WIS.7.20	and the thoughts of humans;
WIS.7.20	about all kinds of plants
WIS.7.20	and the value of roots.
WIS.7.21	I learned hidden mysteries
WIS.7.21	and things known to all,
WIS.7.22	because I was taught by Wisdom,
WIS.7.22	who made everything.
WIS.7.22	Wisdom is both intelligent
WIS.7.22	and holy.
WIS.7.22	Though one of a kind,
WIS.7.22	she appears in many forms
WIS.7.22	and is a spiritual being
WIS.7.22	that moves freely about.
WIS.7.22	Wisdom is clear and pure,
WIS.7.22	spotless and innocent,
WIS.7.22	and she loves goodness.
WIS.7.22	Wisdom is sharp and victorious,
WIS.7.23	generous, helpful, dependable,
WIS.7.23	and she never worries.
WIS.7.23	Wisdom is all-powerful;
WIS.7.23	she sees everything
WIS.7.23	and is ever present
WIS.7.23	with those who are intelligent,
WIS.7.23	pure, and truly spiritual.
WIS.7.24	Wisdom moves more easily
WIS.7.24	than anything else
WIS.7.24	and is so pure that she is
WIS.7.24	everywhere at once.
WIS.7.25	Wisdom is the breath
WIS.7.25	of God's power,
WIS.7.25	the true reflection of the glory
WIS.7.25	of God All-Powerful,
WIS.7.25	and so she cannot be touched
WIS.7.25	by anything impure.
WIS.7.26	Wisdom is like a mirror
WIS.7.26	reflecting the eternal light
WIS.7.26	of God's deeds and goodness.
WIS.7.27	Though Wisdom is and remains
WIS.7.27	only one being,
WIS.7.27	she can do anything
WIS.7.27	and she renews all things.
WIS.7.27	In each generation she enters
WIS.7.27	the souls of the faithful,
WIS.7.27	making them into prophets
WIS.7.27	and friends of God,
WIS.7.28	since God's favorite people
WIS.7.28	are those who live with her.
WIS.7.29	Wisdom is more beautiful than
WIS.7.29	the sun and the stars.
WIS.7.29	She is far superior to daylight,
WIS.7.30	because it turns to darkness,
WIS.7.30	but she cannot be changed
WIS.7.30	by the power of evil.
WIS.8.1	Wisdom rules the universe
WIS.8.1	and keeps it in order.
WIS.8.2	I have loved and searched
WIS.8.2	for Wisdom.
WIS.8.2	I was charmed by her beauty
WIS.8.2	and wanted her for my bride.
WIS.8.3	The Lord God of all loves her,
WIS.8.3	and her glorious origin
WIS.8.3	becomes even more glorious,
WIS.8.3	because she lives with God.
WIS.8.4	and works together with him.
WIS.8.5	Wisdom is more desirable
WIS.8.5	than wealth— she makes
WIS.8.5	everything run smoothly.
WIS.8.6	Wisdom is more useful
WIS.8.6	than knowledge—she designed
WIS.8.6	everything that is.
WIS.8.7	learn from her,
WIS.8.7	the source of all goodness:
WIS.8.7	of justice and courage,
WIS.8.7	understanding and self-control;
WIS.8.7	all the important things
WIS.8.7	that help us live our lives.
WIS.8.8	Do you desire wide experience?
WIS.8.8	Wisdom knows what has happened
WIS.8.8	and predicts the future;
WIS.8.8	she knows the meaning of words
WIS.8.8	and the answers to riddles.
WIS.8.8	Wisdom knows in advance
WIS.8.8	the miracles God will work
WIS.8.8	and all that will take place.
WIS.8.9	So I decided to bring Wisdom
WIS.8.9	home to live with me—
WIS.8.9	she will offer good advice,
WIS.8.9	as well as comfort in times
WIS.8.9	of suffering and grief.
WIS.8.10	She will bring me great honor
WIS.8.10	from advisors and many others,
WIS.8.10	even though I am young.
WIS.8.11	I will have sound judgment
WIS.8.11	and be admired by rulers.
WIS.8.12	They will wait for my opinion,
WIS.8.12	then listen when I speak,
WIS.8.12	and they will be amazed
WIS.8.12	at my marvelous speeches.
WIS.8.13	Because of Wisdom,
WIS.8.13	my name will live on forever.
WIS.8.14	I will rule many nations
WIS.8.15	and be a hero in battle;
WIS.8.15	oppressive rulers will tremble
WIS.8.15	at the mention of my name.
WIS.8.16	With Wisdom as my friend,
WIS.8.16	I will live happily and at peace,
WIS.8.16	with no bitter regrets.
WIS.8.17	I thought deeply about Wisdom
WIS.8.17	and all that she offered—
WIS.8.17	unending life 
WIS.8.18	and perfect joy
WIS.8.18	because of her friendship;
WIS.8.18	wealth and understanding
WIS.8.18	because of her companionship;
WIS.8.18	and fame because of her words.
WIS.8.18	So I searched for Wisdom.
WIS.8.19	I was an intelligent child,
WIS.8.19	born with a good soul—
WIS.8.20	rather, since my soul was good,
WIS.8.20	it entered a perfect body.
WIS.8.21	I had the insight to realize
WIS.8.21	Wisdom is the gift of God,
WIS.8.21	and so with all my heart
WIS.8.21	I prayed for Wisdom.
WIS.9.1	of my ancestors,
WIS.9.1	you created everything
WIS.9.1	by your word.
WIS.9.2	And by your Wisdom,
WIS.9.2	you let us humans rule
WIS.9.2	all other creatures.
WIS.9.3	We are to be honest and fair
WIS.9.3	in every decision,
WIS.9.4	so share with me the Wisdom
WIS.9.4	that sits beside your throne,
WIS.9.4	and let me be a child of yours.
WIS.9.5	My mother was your servant,
WIS.9.5	and so am I—a mere human
WIS.9.5	whose life is short.
WIS.9.5	I understand only a little
WIS.9.5	about laws and judgments,
WIS.9.6	because even a perfect human
WIS.9.6	is really nothing
WIS.9.6	without Wisdom from you.
WIS.9.7	You have chosen me to rule
WIS.9.7	and judge your people,
WIS.9.8	and here, on your holy mountain
WIS.9.8	in the city where you live,
WIS.9.8	you have commanded me to build
WIS.9.8	an altar and a temple,
WIS.9.8	just like that sacred temple
WIS.9.8	you made at the beginning.
WIS.9.9	Wisdom has always been with you.
WIS.9.9	She knows your mighty deeds,
WIS.9.9	and she was there
WIS.9.9	when you created the world.
WIS.9.9	Wisdom knows what pleases you,
WIS.9.9	and she knows what is right
WIS.9.9	according to your commands.
WIS.9.10	So from your glorious and holy
WIS.9.10	throne in the heavens,
WIS.9.10	please send Wisdom
WIS.9.10	to work beside me and teach me
WIS.9.10	what is pleasing to you.
WIS.9.11	Wisdom will guide me
WIS.9.11	in all that I do,
WIS.9.11	and her glory will guard me,
WIS.9.11	because she knows everything.
WIS.9.12	Then you will approve my actions,
WIS.9.12	and I will rule your people
WIS.9.12	with fairness,
WIS.9.12	which will show that I am worthy
WIS.9.12	to succeed my father as king.
WIS.9.13	No one can know what you,
WIS.9.13	the Lord God,
WIS.9.13	demand of us humans—
WIS.9.14	our reasoning is faulty,
WIS.9.14	and our schemes often fail,
WIS.9.15	because our mortal bodies
WIS.9.15	are merely earthly tents
WIS.9.15	that burden down our souls
WIS.9.15	and our anxious minds.
WIS.9.16	We struggle and know so little
WIS.9.16	about things here on earth.
WIS.9.16	How could we possibly learn
WIS.9.16	about things in heaven?
WIS.9.17	Who has known your thoughts
WIS.9.17	before you gave them Wisdom
WIS.9.17	and your Holy Spirit?
WIS.9.18	Then they found the right path;
WIS.9.18	they learned what pleased you
WIS.9.18	and were saved by Wisdom.
WIS.10.2	and gave him the power to rule everything.
WIS.10.7	The evidence of their evil can still be seen—the smoke that keeps rising from the desert, those trees with fruit that never ripens, and the pillar of salt that stands as a witness to Lot's wife, who refused to believe. 
WIS.10.8	By rejecting Wisdom, these people became blind to what was right, and so they left a permanent witness to their foolishness. 
WIS.10.9	But she protected those who were obedient to her.
WIS.10.11	Wisdom even stood by him and made him rich when he was being mistreated by people who were jealous of him. 
WIS.10.12	She protected him from enemies who were waiting to attack, and when he wrestled with an angel, she let him learn that obeying you, our God, is what makes a person really powerful.
WIS.10.14	where he was a prisoner, and she stayed with him until he was given authority over those who had been in charge of him. Wisdom proved that his accusers were wrong and brought him honor that will last forever.
WIS.10.16	She did this by entering the soul of your servant Moses and opposing cruel kings with her amazing miracles. 
WIS.10.17	Wisdom rewarded those holy people for their hardships and guided them in a wonderful way, providing shade for them during the day and starlight at night. 
WIS.10.18	She brought them safely through the Red Sea,
WIS.10.19	but she drowned their enemies and washed their bodies up on the shore. 
WIS.10.20	So your obedient people took the possessions of those ungodly people. Then they sang praises to your holy name and praised you for protecting them, 
WIS.10.21	because Wisdom healed those who could not talk and helped infants to speak clearly.
WIS.11.2	They went through a desert where no one lived and camped in places where no one had ever been. 
WIS.11.3	They defeated their enemies, 
WIS.11.4	and when they were thirsty and prayed for your help, you made water flow from a solid rock.
WIS.11.5	Our Lord, your people were helped by the same disasters that were used to punish their enemies. 
WIS.11.6	You turned the ever-flowing Nile River into filthy blood 
WIS.11.7	to punish the Egyptians for ordering the Hebrew children to be killed, then you surprised everyone by providing your people with more than enough water to satisfy their thirst. 
WIS.11.8+WIS.11.9	You mercifully let your people go thirsty for a while to show how severely you would punish their ungodly enemies in your anger. 
WIS.11.10	 You corrected your people like parents correcting their children as a warning, but you punished the others like a harsh king condemning a criminal.
WIS.11.11	All the Egyptians suffered—those who lived near your people and those who lived far away. 
WIS.11.12	In fact, they suffered at the time of these disasters and again whenever they remembered what had happened. 
WIS.11.13	And when the Egyptians learned that your people had benefited from these troubles, they realized that you, Lord, had done it all. 
WIS.11.14	Earlier they had made fun of Moses, who had been placed outside to die when he was a baby, but now they were amazed at him, because they suffered from thirst much more severely than your people.
WIS.11.16	and to teach them that sin brings its own punishment. 
WIS.11.17	With your own mighty arm, you made the world out of something that had no form, and so you could have sent a lot of bears or ferocious lions. 
WIS.11.18	Or you could have created savage beasts just to punish them—beasts that breathe out fire and smoke and shoot sparks from their eyes, 
WIS.11.19	killing people not only by the injuries they cause but by their very appearance. 
WIS.11.20	In fact, you could have wiped out the Egyptians with a single breath, while you were scattering them with your power and treating them as they deserved. But you do everything fairly and according to the laws of nature that you created.
WIS.11.21	You always have the strength to do what you want, and no one can oppose you. 
WIS.11.22	In your sight, the universe is merely a grain of sand that tips a balance scale or a drop of dew in the early morning. 
WIS.11.23	You can do anything, and yet you patiently show mercy to everyone, so that they will turn from their sins. 
WIS.11.24	In all creation there is nothing you don't love; otherwise, you would not have created everything. 
WIS.11.25	Nothing would have lasted, unless you had wanted it to. 
WIS.11.26	All living creatures belong to you, and you love them all,
WIS.12.1	because your eternal spirit is in each of them. 
WIS.12.2	That's why you correct us for our sins a little at a time, as a reminder and a warning for us to turn from sin and have faith in you, our Lord.
WIS.12.4	You hated them because of their horrible deeds—they practiced magic and did vulgar things when they worshiped their gods; 
WIS.12.5	they mercilessly sacrificed children and ate human flesh and blood. They were members of pagan cults 
WIS.12.6	and murdered their own helpless children. That's why you decided to let our ancestors destroy them, 
WIS.12.7	so that your most precious land would accept a group of people worthy to be your servants.
WIS.12.9	You did this, even though you could have let your own people destroy that evil nation, or you could have wiped them out all at once with fierce animals or with one harsh word. 
WIS.12.10	 Although you knew that they were sinful by nature and that they would never give up their evil thoughts, you still punished them little by little, giving them time to turn back to you. 
WIS.12.11	They were under your curse from the beginning, and though you were not afraid of anyone, you let them go unpunished.
WIS.12.12	All of us are merely human, and we cannot question what you have done, nor can we refuse to let you punish us. No one would dare to blame you for destroying those nations you created or dare to defend the guilty in your court of law. 
WIS.12.13	You alone are God, and you care for all creation.
WIS.12.14	and no kings or rulers can accuse you of wrongly punishing anyone. 
WIS.12.15	You are always perfectly fair, and you would never punish innocent people. 
WIS.12.16	You do what is right because you have the strength to do so, and your great power makes you merciful to everyone.
WIS.12.17	When anyone doubts your strength, you show how strong you are, and you correct anyone who understands and still doubts. 
WIS.12.18	Although you have power to do all things, you are gentle when you judge us, and you rule us with great patience.
WIS.12.19	Our God, by the things you have done, you have given your people a wonderful hope and have taught them to live right and be kind because you have let them turn from evil. 
WIS.12.20	The enemies of your people deserved death, but you patiently gave them time to give up their sins, before punishing them. 
WIS.12.21	You did severely punish your people, even though you had made wonderful promises and agreements with them. 
WIS.12.22	Yes, we were punished! But our enemies were punished 10,000 times worse, so that when we judge others, we will remember your kindness, and when we are being judged, we can expect mercy.
WIS.12.23	The Egyptians foolishly lived a sinful life, but you punished them by using those disgusting creatures they worshiped. 
WIS.12.24	In fact, they had gone so far from the truth that they were like senseless children, worshiping the most worthless animals. 
WIS.12.25	And so you made them look like stupid children, when you punished them. 
WIS.12.26	Those who failed to take this warning seriously then received from you the punishment they deserved. 
WIS.12.27	While they were being punished because of the creatures they had worshiped, they became angry with those creatures and finally realized that you are the only true God, even though they had always refused to worship you. All this explains why they were punished so terribly.
WIS.13.1	You are the living God. And only those who are fools by birth could look at your creation and not learn about you. But instead, some people worshiped the things you created, 
WIS.13.2	such as fire and wind, and storms and stars, and rivers and planets. Those fools believed these things were the gods that ruled the world, 
WIS.13.3	because they were so beautiful.
WIS.13.3	But you are the Lord, as well as the source of all beauty, so let those fools know how much more beautiful you are than any of these things. 
WIS.13.4	And if anyone is amazed at the mighty power of nature, then they should realize that the Creator is even more powerful. 
WIS.13.5	Indeed, the power and beauty of nature should convince us that their Creator is even more powerful and beautiful.
WIS.13.6	On the other hand, these people are not entirely to blame for taking the wrong path in their desire to know and to find you. 
WIS.13.7	It is to be expected that while searching, they would learn to trust the beautiful things they were seeing. 
WIS.13.8	However, this is no excuse, 
WIS.13.9	because if they possessed the ability to examine the universe, why did it take them so long to find you, the Lord of the universe?
WIS.13.11	A woodcutter may saw down a small tree, then peel off the bark and skillfully make something worthwhile from the wood. 
WIS.13.12	Some of the leftover wood may be used for a cooking fire, 
WIS.13.13	while a crooked and knotty piece may be carefully carved into the shape of a human 
WIS.13.14	or of some useless animal, before being painted red to cover all its flaws.
WIS.13.15	A special shelf is made on the wall, and the idol is fastened to the shelf with metal nails 
WIS.13.16	to keep it from falling, because the one who made it realizes that it is merely a helpless idol. 
WIS.13.17	Then—without shame—its maker prays to this lifeless idol for help with finances, marriage, or family. 
WIS.13.18	Its maker asks for good health from something weak, for life from something dead, for guidance from something without experience, for a safe journey from something that cannot walk, 
WIS.13.19	and for wealth and success from something that cannot move its hands.
WIS.14.1	Sailors preparing to travel across dangerous waters will pray for safety to a flimsy piece of wood, less sturdy than their ship. 
WIS.14.2	Shipmakers use their own wisdom to build a ship that will make them rich. 
WIS.14.3	But, our Father, you are the one who guides it safely through the sea 
WIS.14.4	to show that you alone can protect inexperienced travelers from danger. 
WIS.14.5	By your wisdom you created the laws of nature, and so people trust even the smallest splinter of wood to bring them safely to land. 
WIS.14.6+WIS.14.7	 When this world was still young, you sent a flood to destroy giants, while at the same time you gave hope for a generation of good people by letting their ancestors find safety in a boat made of wood
WIS.14.8	Idols are under your curse because those perishable things are called gods, and their makers are under your curse for having made them. 
WIS.14.9	In fact, you hate evil people as much as you hate the evil they produce, 
WIS.14.10	and you will equally punish evildoers together with their deeds. 
WIS.14.11	You will destroy those horrible pagan idols, because they were made from part of your creation and have become a trap for foolish people.
WIS.14.12	Our God, the idea of making an idol was itself the first step toward being unfaithful to you. 
WIS.14.13	Idols were not here in the beginning, and they won't be around forever. 
WIS.14.14	They resulted from human pride, and so you have plans for them to end quickly.
WIS.14.15	For example, a father made an idol to look like his child who had suddenly died, and the dead child then became an object of worship by later generations, who followed mysterious and secret ceremonies. 
WIS.14.16	Over the years, such godless ceremonies became customs and then laws, as rulers commanded idols of themselves to be carved and worshiped. 
WIS.14.17	And when people lived far from their rulers, they tried to make idols that looked like their rulers, so that they could honor and flatter those rulers as if they were there with them.
WIS.14.18+WIS.14.19	In fact, some people who did not know what their rulers looked like were led to worship them, because of the skill and the tireless efforts of those who made beautiful idols to please their rulers. 
WIS.14.20	Finally, many people started worshiping their earthly rulers as gods. 
WIS.14.21	As a result, idolatry became a hidden trap for those who were suffering or were under the authority of rulers, and they called these idols gods, although you alone are God.
WIS.14.22	Not only are such people ignorant about you, but this ignorance makes them terrible enemies of each other, even while they think they are living at peace. 
WIS.14.23	They kill their children as sacrifices and conduct secret ceremonies, they follow strange customs and act like wild people, 
WIS.14.24	they are immoral and cause great pain by being unfaithful in marriage, and they are deceitful murderers. 
WIS.14.25	Violence, murder, robbery, deceit, corruption, dishonesty, riots, and lying are everywhere. 
WIS.14.26	No one knows right from wrong or shows gratitude or cares about anyone else; all of them are sexual perverts or share weird marriage unions or are otherwise completely disgusting.
WIS.14.27	The worship of worthless
WIS.14.28	Their worshipers act crazy, or give false messages in the name of God, or live sinful lives. They never speak the truth, and they tell lies in court 
WIS.14.29	because they trust in these lifeless idols and don't expect to be punished. 
WIS.14.30	But they will be punished for worshiping idols instead of you, the Holy God, and for disgracing you with their deceitful lies. 
WIS.14.31	Sinners don't receive help from the idols they worship, but the penalty for their sins follows them in hot pursuit.
WIS.15.1	You, our God,
WIS.15.1	are gentle and trustworthy,
WIS.15.1	patiently ruling the universe
WIS.15.1	with mercy.
WIS.15.2	We know your mighty power,
WIS.15.2	and so we remain your people,
WIS.15.2	even if we sin.
WIS.15.2	But knowing we are yours
WIS.15.2	will keep us from sin.
WIS.15.3	Nothing is more fitting
WIS.15.3	than knowing you
WIS.15.3	and realizing that your power
WIS.15.3	is the way to endless life.
WIS.15.4	We have not been misled
WIS.15.4	by wicked artists,
WIS.15.4	who made bright-colored idols
WIS.15.5	to encourage fools to worship
WIS.15.5	those lifeless images.
WIS.15.6	Those who make or worship
WIS.15.6	idols as objects of hope
WIS.15.6	will get what they deserve
WIS.15.6	for loving such evil things.
WIS.15.7	Potters form ordinary dishes and special dishes from the same lump of clay, and only the potters decide which ones will be ordinary or special. 
WIS.15.8	Then—wasting their energy—these potters form a useless idol from the same clay. And not long ago, these potters themselves were made from the soil and will soon turn back into soil, just like all other humans, when it is time to return our borrowed souls.
WIS.15.9	But these potters don't care that we all must die or that life is short. They consider it a wonderful thing to mold false gods, and all they care about is competing with others, who make idols out of gold or silver or copper. 
WIS.15.10	The heart of such workers is made of ashes, their hope is worth no more than dirt, and their lives are of less value than clay, 
WIS.15.11	because they don't know you, the God who formed their bodies, then filled them with a lively soul and breathed into them a living spirit. 
WIS.15.12	They think of life as a meaningless game or as a festival for making money, because they believe that we should try to get rich in every way possible, even by dishonesty. 
WIS.15.13	More than anyone else, these people realize that they are sinning when they make dishes and idols from the same clay.
WIS.15.14	Our God, those Egyptians who abused your people were the most foolish of all and were more pitiful than infants. 
WIS.15.15	This is because they believed their pagan idols really were gods—those images that could neither see nor breathe nor hear nor use their hands or feet. 
WIS.15.16	They were made by some human whose soul was borrowed, and none of us can make a god that is our equal. 
WIS.15.17	In fact, we humans are mortal ourselves, and any idol we make with our own evil hands is less than we are and is completely lifeless.
WIS.15.18	Those Egyptians worshiped snakes, the lowest form of animal life, 
WIS.15.19	a form of life so ugly that you did not even give it your blessing.
WIS.16.1	You were right to punish the Egyptians by sending snakes to attack those worshipers of snakes. 
WIS.16.2	 But you did not punish your own people. Instead, you treated them with kindness and sent tasty quails for them to eat and enjoy. 
WIS.16.3	You did these things, so that when those Egyptians were hungry, they would feel sick and lose their appetites, because they would have to eat the horrible meat of snakes. However, after suffering for a while, your own people enjoyed the best of foods. 
WIS.16.4	In this way, those who had been oppressed could watch their oppressors suffer cruel punishment.
WIS.16.6	because you did this merely as a warning. Then you told them to make a metal snake, so that they would be rescued and remember to obey your Law. 
WIS.16.7	Everyone who looked at the metal snake was saved, not because of the snake itself, but because of you, the Savior of all people.
WIS.16.8	By doing this, you proved to our enemies that you alone can protect people from harm, 
WIS.16.9	because many of them got what they deserved, when they died from the bites of locusts and flies. 
WIS.16.10	But you were merciful to your children and healed them from poisonous snake bites, 
WIS.16.11	so that they would remember your teachings and never forget your kindness.
WIS.16.12	Medicine isn't what healed them. Only your word can heal, 
WIS.16.13	because you rule both life and death and possess the power to give life or to take it away. 
WIS.16.14	It's easy enough for us humans to kill another in anger, but we don't have the power to bring back a departed spirit or to set a soul free from the world of the dead.
WIS.16.15	No one can escape from you, our God. 
WIS.16.16	And when those evil Egyptians rejected you and tried to escape, you punished them with your mighty arm and wiped them out with rainstorms, hailstones, and fiery lightning. 
WIS.16.17	Although water is used to put out a fire, an amazing thing happened—the water made the fire even more destructive, because nature itself protects good people.
WIS.16.18	One time you kept the fire under control, so that it would not destroy the frogs and flies that were sent to punish those pagans and to let them know you were the one doing all of this. 
WIS.16.19	But at another time, you let it burn out of control—even in water—to wipe out the crops in that evil country.
WIS.16.21	Your care for your people was as sweet as this bread that everyone enjoyed so much. 
WIS.16.22	And though the bread was frail as snowflakes, it did not melt in the fiery flames that your enemies saw destroying their crops during the hailstorm. 
WIS.16.23	Contrary to nature, the fire did not spread to the crops of your people.
WIS.16.24	All of creation serves you, its Creator, and uses its power to punish those who are evil and to show kindness to those who trust in you. 
WIS.16.25	And so on that occasion, the forces of the universe changed the way they work, in order to serve your purpose by answering the prayers 
WIS.16.26	of your precious children. This was also your way of teaching them not to depend upon their crops, but rather to depend upon your word, since it takes care of those who trust you. 
WIS.16.27	Even the manna that survived the fire then melted in the warmth of the sun. 
WIS.16.28	This shows that we must rise before dawn to pray to you, 
WIS.16.29	because if we are ungrateful, our hope will melt like frost and flow away like dirty water.
WIS.17.1	Your decisions are difficult to explain, and people who have not been taught have followed the wrong path. 
WIS.17.2	For example, those lawless Egyptians thought that your chosen people were under their power. But they themselves became prisoners in their very own homes for a long, dark night, because they were not under the protection of your eternal care. 
WIS.17.3+WIS.17.4	 They thought that you had forgotten and that their secret sins were hidden behind a curtain of darkness, when gruesome creatures seemed to appear. Nowhere in their homes were they safe from the fear of terrifying noises and the frightening faces of gloomy ghosts. 
WIS.17.5	On that miserable night, the darkness was so thick that neither flaming lamps nor bright stars could be seen. 
WIS.17.6	And when lightning flashed, the fearsome sight was worse than the darkness.
WIS.17.7	The Egyptians had depended on their magical powers and had boasted about their great wisdom, but all of this proved useless. 
WIS.17.8	There were some who said they could cure the fears and worries of sick minds, but they themselves became sick with foolish fear. 
WIS.17.9	Even if nothing else frightened them, they were terrified by the sounds of wild animals outside and by hissing snakes. 
WIS.17.10	They were so frightened that they refused to open their eyes. But keeping them closed did not relieve their fears, 
WIS.17.11	because evil people are cowards condemned by their own consciences, and whatever they fear becomes even more frightening.
WIS.17.12	Fear takes over when people stop reasoning. 
WIS.17.13	They no longer think straight, and their only hope is to deny the real source of their problems. 
WIS.17.14	Night itself is powerless, since it comes from the powerless world of the dead. And yet the Egyptians slept restlessly on that night, 
WIS.17.15	because of the horrible and unexpected nightmares brought on by the surrender of their souls to the forces of evil. 
WIS.17.16+WIS.17.17	Every one of the Egyptians—including farmers and shepherds—fell prisoner to the fear of a darkness that was more difficult to escape than iron chains. 
WIS.17.18+WIS.17.19	The slightest noise made them paralyzed with fear—the songs of birds in the trees, the rhythm of rushing water, the surprising crash of a rock, the hoofbeats of animals jumping about, the roar of lions, or even an echo in the mountains.
WIS.17.20	Everywhere else in the world, everyone went about their own business in broad daylight, 
WIS.17.21	while these Egyptians were covered with a heavy blanket of darkness like the darkness of death that would soon capture them. But the trouble they brought upon themselves was an even heavier burden than the darkness.
WIS.18.2	The Egyptians were thankful that the people they had abused were not abusing them in return, and so they begged your chosen people for forgiveness.
WIS.18.3	Then, with a flaming fire at night and with the warmth of the sun during the day, you guided your people through places they had never traveled before. 
WIS.18.4	Their enemies deserved to be prisoners of absolute darkness, because they had imprisoned your children, who would bring the light of your Law to the world.
WIS.18.5	The Egyptians wanted to kill the newborn sons of your chosen people, but Moses was rescued and survived. Then you decided to punish the Egyptians by killing their first-born sons and by drowning their army in the sea. 
WIS.18.6	However, the night before our ancestors left Egypt, you warned them of what would happen. So they were able to celebrate, knowing that you would keep your promise 
WIS.18.7	to rescue your obedient people and to destroy their enemies, just as they knew you would.
WIS.18.8	By these same events you punished your enemies and rewarded us, your chosen people. 
WIS.18.9	At this time also, the wonderful ancestors of our holy nation secretly offered sacrifices to you, and all of them agreed to obey your Law, so that together they would share in the same blessings and dangers. Already they were singing hymns of praise to you,
WIS.18.10	while their enemies cried bitter tears and made mournful sounds over the death of their children. 
WIS.18.11	Every family suffered the same punishment, whether they were slaves or slave owners, ordinary people or royalty. 
WIS.18.12	In one brief moment, the dearest child in each family died, leaving not even enough people to bury the dead. 
WIS.18.13	 The Egyptians had been deceived by displays of magic. However, after the death of their first-born sons, they realized that we were the children of God.
WIS.18.15	your mighty word came down from your royal throne in heaven to attack a doomed land. Your word was like a fierce warrior 
WIS.18.16	carrying a sharp sword and ready to obey your every command by killing people everywhere. When he stood on the earth, his head touched the sky. 
WIS.18.17+WIS.18.18+WIS.18.19	Many of the Egyptians died a dreadful death that night, but not before nightmares and terrifying dreams showed them why they were being punished.
WIS.18.21	Then a good man by the name of Aaron came to their rescue by using prayer and incense as a shield to protect your people from punishment for their sins, because he was a priest. So he stood up against your anger and ended the disaster. 
WIS.18.22	He did not convince the crowd and end their suffering by his own strength or by weapons—he did it by reminding them of the wonderful agreements you had made with our ancestors.
WIS.18.23	Piles of dead bodies were everywhere when Aaron succeeded in turning away your anger, and in keeping others from being struck down. 
WIS.18.24	 And his long robe symbolized the entire universe, while the four rows of precious stones on his breastpiece stood for our glorious ancestors, and his turban
WIS.18.25	At the sight of these, the death angel retreated in fear. A little of your anger was enough.
WIS.19.1	You remained angry with those worthless Egyptians and kept punishing them without mercy, because you already knew 
WIS.19.2	how they would change their minds and chase your people, after hurriedly setting them free. 
WIS.19.3	As a matter of fact, they made this foolish decision even before they had finished mourning for their dead. Then they started pursuing those very people they had begged and even forced to leave. 
WIS.19.4	They were urged on by the destruction they deserved, and it made them forget what had already happened, so that they would be fully punished 
WIS.19.5	by dying an unusual death and so that your people would have an amazing journey.
WIS.19.6	At your command the laws of nature were changed
WIS.19.7	A cloud guided them, and dry land appeared like a field of grass in the middle of the Red Sea,
WIS.19.8	so that your people could see wonderful miracles and pass safely through under your protection. 
WIS.19.9	They were like horses on an open range or like lambs leaping around, as they praised you for saving them. 
WIS.19.10	And they still remembered what had happened in Egypt—the land was covered with gnats instead of animals, and the rivers were filled with frogs instead of fish. 
WIS.19.11	Later, when they were starving in the desert and begged for something delicious to eat, you provided them with a special kind of bird, 
WIS.19.12	by sending quails from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea.
WIS.19.13	Those sinful Egyptians had a terrible hatred for strangers, and so you punished them horribly, but not without first warning them with violent thunderstorms. 
WIS.19.14+WIS.19.15+WIS.19.16	 Years earlier, the people of Sodom had refused to welcome strangers, and they were punished for what they did. But these Egyptians did much worse. They first welcomed our ancestors with a glorious celebration, and then after we had helped their nation, they made slaves of us, even though we were citizens like everyone else. 
WIS.19.17	Those people of Sodom were struck blind, just as they reached the door of the home of that good man Lot, and they had to feel their way back through the darkness to their own homes. In the same way, these Egyptians were covered with deep darkness.
WIS.19.18	Different tunes can be played on the same harp, though the strings remain the same. And this is similar to what happened in those days, as can be seen from the following examples. 
WIS.19.19	Land animals became sea creatures, and sea creatures became land animals; 
WIS.19.20	fire kept burning, even when it was covered with water, 
WIS.19.21	and yet its flames did not destroy the flesh of humans or melt that delicate and dainty food called manna
WIS.19.22	Our Lord, you have always
WIS.19.22	greatly honored your people.
WIS.19.22	You have never failed
WIS.19.22	to help them at any time
WIS.19.22	or in any place.
SIR.1_2.1	and his Wisdom lasts forever.
SIR.1_2.2	And who but the Lord
SIR.1_2.2	can count the raindrops
SIR.1_2.2	or the days in eternity
SIR.1_2.2	or the sand on the seashore?
SIR.1_2.3	And who else can measure
SIR.1_2.3	the height of heaven
SIR.1_2.3	or the width of the earth
SIR.1_2.3	or the depth of the sea?
SIR.1_2.4	The Lord created Wisdom
SIR.1_2.4	long before anything else.
SIR.1_2.5	The Wisdom in God's commands
SIR.1_2.5	flows from his word in heaven
SIR.1_2.5	like streams from a spring.
SIR.1_2.6	Who can understand
SIR.1_2.6	the deep thoughts of Wisdom
SIR.1_2.6	or how clever she
SIR.1_2.7	Can anyone be taught
SIR.1_2.7	all of her knowledge?
SIR.1_2.7	Can anyone understand
SIR.1_2.7	how much she has learned?
SIR.1_2.8	Only the Lord is that wise;
SIR.1_2.8	he is fearsome and majestic
SIR.1_2.8	as he rules from his throne.
SIR.1_2.9	and watched her grow,
SIR.1_2.9	then he gave her
SIR.1_2.9	to his creation—
SIR.1_2.10	to every living thing—
SIR.1_2.10	but especially to those people
SIR.1_2.10	who love him.
SIR.1_2.11	If you fear the Lord,
SIR.1_2.11	you will be proud
SIR.1_2.11	of the honors you receive,
SIR.1_2.11	and you will wear happiness
SIR.1_2.11	like a crown.
SIR.1_2.12	And if you fear him,
SIR.1_2.12	your life will be long
SIR.1_2.12	and filled with joy.
SIR.1_2.13	You will die happy,
SIR.1_2.13	blessed by the Lord
SIR.1_2.13	on the day of your death.
SIR.1_2.14	Respect and obey the Lord—
SIR.1_2.14	that's where Wisdom begins,
SIR.1_2.14	and she will stay
SIR.1_2.14	with faithful people
SIR.1_2.14	from the day of their birth.
SIR.1_2.15	She has lived among us humans
SIR.1_2.15	since the beginning of time,
SIR.1_2.15	and she will never desert
SIR.1_2.15	our descendants.
SIR.1_2.16	Respect and obey the Lord—
SIR.1_2.16	this is complete Wisdom.
SIR.1_2.16	Be drunk on the wine
SIR.1_2.16	of Wisdom,
SIR.1_2.17	and your barns
SIR.1_2.17	with the harvest she brings.
SIR.1_2.18	Wisdom will give you
SIR.1_2.18	respect for the Lord,
SIR.1_2.18	to be worn like a crown
SIR.1_2.18	woven from the flowers
SIR.1_2.18	of peace and good health.
SIR.1_2.19	Hold on to Wisdom,
SIR.1_2.19	and she will honor you
SIR.1_2.19	by sending knowledge
SIR.1_2.19	and complete understanding
SIR.1_2.19	like showers of rain.
SIR.1_2.20	at its root is respect
SIR.1_2.20	for the Lord,
SIR.1_2.20	and its branches represent
SIR.1_2.20	a long lifetime.
SIR.1_2.21	Fear of the Lord
SIR.1_2.21	forces sin and anger
SIR.1_2.21	out of your life.
SIR.1_2.22	It is never right to be angry
SIR.1_2.22	without a good reason,
SIR.1_2.22	because anger will start you
SIR.1_2.22	down the path to disaster.
SIR.1_2.23	Just be patient and stay calm
SIR.1_2.23	until your anger fades.
SIR.1_2.24	Then when the time is right
SIR.1_2.24	you can speak,
SIR.1_2.24	and others will tell
SIR.1_2.24	of your good sense.
SIR.1_2.25	Wisdom collects wise sayings,
SIR.1_2.25	but faithfulness to God
SIR.1_2.25	is disgusting to a sinner.
SIR.1_2.26	If you want lots of Wisdom
SIR.1_2.26	from the Lord,
SIR.1_2.26	then obey his commands.
SIR.1_2.27	Respect and obey the Lord,
SIR.1_2.27	and you will learn Wisdom;
SIR.1_2.27	be faithful and humble,
SIR.1_2.27	and he will be pleased.
SIR.1_2.28	Faithfully obey the Lord
SIR.1_2.28	and worship him
SIR.1_2.28	with all your heart.
SIR.1_2.29	Others are watching you,
SIR.1_2.29	so be careful—
SIR.1_2.29	don't say one thing
SIR.1_2.29	and then do something else.
SIR.1_2.30	If you boast and then fail,
SIR.1_2.30	you will be disgraced.
SIR.1_2.30	And if you only pretend
SIR.1_2.30	to worship the Lord,
SIR.1_2.30	he will bring you down
SIR.1_2.30	and show everyone
SIR.1_2.30	that you are a fake.
SIR.2.1	Students, if you decide
SIR.2.1	to worship and obey the Lord,
SIR.2.1	be ready to face problems.
SIR.2.2	Have firm self-control
SIR.2.2	and don't act too quickly
SIR.2.2	if trouble strikes.
SIR.2.3	Don't turn from the Lord,
SIR.2.3	but be faithful;
SIR.2.3	that's the way to succeed.
SIR.2.4	Accept everything that happens.
SIR.2.4	Be patient if others
SIR.2.4	humiliate you—
SIR.2.5	as a furnace tests gold.
SIR.2.6	The Lord will give his help,
SIR.2.6	if you depend only on him
SIR.2.6	and do right.
SIR.2.7	If you fear the Lord
SIR.2.7	and are patient,
SIR.2.7	he will show you mercy.
SIR.2.7	But if you turn away,
SIR.2.7	you will fall.
SIR.2.8	Put your trust in him,
SIR.2.8	and he will reward you.
SIR.2.9	Don't give up hoping
SIR.2.9	for good things, like mercy
SIR.2.9	and a life full of joy.
SIR.2.10	Look at past generations—
SIR.2.10	did the Lord desert those people
SIR.2.10	who trusted and feared him?
SIR.2.10	Or did he fail to answer those
SIR.2.10	who asked him for help?
SIR.2.11	The Lord is kind
SIR.2.11	and shows mercy
SIR.2.11	by forgiving our sins
SIR.2.11	and rescuing us from trouble.
SIR.2.12	But the Lord will send trouble
SIR.2.12	if you don't have the courage
SIR.2.12	to be faithful
SIR.2.12	and to stay away from sin.
SIR.2.13	If you are too afraid
SIR.2.13	to put your trust in him,
SIR.2.13	he will not protect you
SIR.2.13	when problems come.
SIR.2.14	And if you give up,
SIR.2.14	you will be in for trouble
SIR.2.14	when the Lord decides
SIR.2.14	to judge your life.
SIR.2.14	* 
SIR.2.15	 If you love the Lord
SIR.2.15	and respect him,
SIR.2.15	you will obey his commands.
SIR.2.16	You will try to please him
SIR.2.16	and to be completely faithful
SIR.2.16	to his Law.
SIR.2.17	If you fear the Lord,
SIR.2.17	you will prepare yourself
SIR.2.17	to worship him
SIR.2.17	with humility.
SIR.2.18	We pray, Lord, that you
SIR.2.18	will decide our future.
SIR.2.18	You are as merciful
SIR.2.18	as you are majestic,
SIR.2.18	so don't leave our fate
SIR.2.18	in human hands.
SIR.3.1	Students, I have been
SIR.3.1	like a father to you,
SIR.3.1	and you will be safe
SIR.3.1	if you do what I say.
SIR.3.2	The Lord has told children
SIR.3.2	to honor and obey
SIR.3.2	their parents.
SIR.3.3	If you honor your father,
SIR.3.3	your sins will be forgiven;
SIR.3.4	show respect to your mother,
SIR.3.4	and you will be truly rich.
SIR.3.5	Honor your father—
SIR.3.5	then your own children
SIR.3.5	will make you happy,
SIR.3.5	and God will hear them
SIR.3.5	when they pray.
SIR.3.6	If you want to live a long time,
SIR.3.6	then you must obey the Lord
SIR.3.6	by respecting your parents;
SIR.3.7	serve them as if you
SIR.3.7	were their slave.
SIR.3.8	with respect
SIR.3.8	and do what he asks,
SIR.3.8	he will bless you,
SIR.3.9	and your own family
SIR.3.9	will have success.
SIR.3.9	But if your mother
SIR.3.9	places a curse on you,
SIR.3.9	your family will face ruin.
SIR.3.10	You cannot get respect
SIR.3.10	by disgracing your parents.
SIR.3.11	What brings honor to them
SIR.3.11	also brings honor to you.
SIR.3.12	Help your father
SIR.3.12	as he grows old;
SIR.3.12	try not to upset him.
SIR.3.13	And when you are strong,
SIR.3.13	but his mind is fading,
SIR.3.13	don't make fun—
SIR.3.13	instead, be patient.
SIR.3.14	God sees your kindness,
SIR.3.14	and right away,
SIR.3.14	some of your sins
SIR.3.14	will be forgiven.
SIR.3.15	And if you later have troubles
SIR.3.15	because of your sins,
SIR.3.15	they will all melt away
SIR.3.15	in the warmth of your kindness,
SIR.3.15	like frost in the sunshine.
SIR.3.16	But abandoning your father
SIR.3.16	or making your mother angry
SIR.3.16	is as bad as cursing the Lord,
SIR.3.16	and so he will curse you.
SIR.3.17	Students, be humble
SIR.3.17	in your work,
SIR.3.17	and you will be loved
SIR.3.17	by God's people.
SIR.3.18	the more humble you must be
SIR.3.18	if you want the Lord
SIR.3.18	to be kind to you.
SIR.3.19	Many people are important
SIR.3.19	and famous,
SIR.3.19	but God gives his secrets
SIR.3.19	only to the humble.
SIR.3.20	God is extremely powerful,
SIR.3.20	and he will accept praise only
SIR.3.20	from those who are not proud.
SIR.3.21	Don't try to learn things
SIR.3.21	you cannot understand.
SIR.3.22	and don't worry about secrets
SIR.3.22	God keeps to himself.
SIR.3.23	He has already shown you
SIR.3.23	matters beyond understanding,
SIR.3.23	and anything more
SIR.3.23	is none of your business.
SIR.3.24	Proud thoughts have led many
SIR.3.24	to turn from following God,
SIR.3.24	and evil ideas have ruined
SIR.3.24	the way they think.
SIR.3.25	Without eyes, you cannot see,
SIR.3.25	and without gaining knowledge
SIR.3.25	you can never get wisdom.
SIR.3.26	If you are stubborn,
SIR.3.26	you will end up in trouble,
SIR.3.26	and if you love danger,
SIR.3.26	it will kill you someday.
SIR.3.27	Those who are stubborn
SIR.3.27	are burdened with suffering,
SIR.3.27	and sinners carry
SIR.3.27	a heavy load of sins.
SIR.3.28	Evil has taken root
SIR.3.28	inside the arrogant,
SIR.3.28	and so when disaster strikes,
SIR.3.28	they cannot be rescued.
SIR.3.29	The wise always try to listen,
SIR.3.29	and they will pay attention
SIR.3.29	to a wise saying.
SIR.3.30	Money given to the poor
SIR.3.30	brings forgiveness for sins,
SIR.3.30	just as water
SIR.3.30	puts out a fire.
SIR.3.31	If you think that in the future
SIR.3.31	you might ever need help,
SIR.3.31	then repay other people now
SIR.3.31	when they do favors for you.
SIR.4.1	Students, if the poor
SIR.4.1	work for you,
SIR.4.1	don't cheat on their wages,
SIR.4.1	but pay them right away.
SIR.4.2	Don't disappoint the hungry
SIR.4.2	or upset the needy.
SIR.4.3	And if they are upset already,
SIR.4.3	don't make things worse
SIR.4.3	by being slow in giving them
SIR.4.3	what they need.
SIR.4.4	When people ask for help,
SIR.4.4	don't turn them down;
SIR.4.4	and if others are in need,
SIR.4.4	don't turn away.
SIR.4.5	If you pretend not to notice,
SIR.4.5	they will have good reason
SIR.4.5	to curse you.
SIR.4.6	And if their curses flow
SIR.4.6	from hearts you made bitter,
SIR.4.6	God, the Creator, will hear them
SIR.4.6	and do what they ask.
SIR.4.7	Be friendly to everyone
SIR.4.7	in the community
SIR.4.7	and show proper respect
SIR.4.7	to the town leaders.
SIR.4.8	When the poor greet you,
SIR.4.8	be polite and greet them
SIR.4.8	in return.
SIR.4.9	Rescue everyone
SIR.4.9	who suffers from injustice;
SIR.4.9	have the courage
SIR.4.9	to make the right decisions;
SIR.4.10	provide for orphans and widows,
SIR.4.10	as if they were your own
SIR.4.10	children or wife.
SIR.4.10	Then you will be a true child
SIR.4.10	of God Most High,
SIR.4.10	and he will love you more
SIR.4.10	than your own mother does.
SIR.4.11	If you study Wisdom,
SIR.4.11	you will become her child,
SIR.4.11	and she will help you
SIR.4.11	be successful.
SIR.4.12	If you love life
SIR.4.12	and want to find happiness,
SIR.4.12	love Wisdom enough
SIR.4.12	to get up early and study.
SIR.4.13	Hold tightly to her—
SIR.4.13	you will receive glory,
SIR.4.13	and the Lord will bless
SIR.4.13	everyone around you.
SIR.4.14	To obey her is to worship
SIR.4.14	the Holy Lord God,
SIR.4.14	and if you love Wisdom,
SIR.4.14	the Lord will love you.
SIR.4.15	Pay attention and obey Wisdom;
SIR.4.15	you will live in safety
SIR.4.15	and even rule nations.
SIR.4.16	Remain faithful to her,
SIR.4.16	and she will belong to you
SIR.4.16	and your descendants.
SIR.4.17	At first, Wisdom will test you
SIR.4.17	with her commands,
SIR.4.17	and you will walk in fear
SIR.4.17	along twisting pathways.
SIR.4.17	Her discipline
SIR.4.17	will bring suffering
SIR.4.17	until you are truly faithful.
SIR.4.18	But then she will return
SIR.4.18	straight to you,
SIR.4.18	bringing happiness
SIR.4.18	and telling her secrets.
SIR.4.19	But if you wander away,
SIR.4.19	she will let you go off
SIR.4.19	to your doom.
SIR.4.20	Be on your guard against evil,
SIR.4.20	but use every opportunity
SIR.4.20	for doing good.
SIR.4.20	And don't be ashamed
SIR.4.20	of who you are.
SIR.4.21	To be ashamed of your sins
SIR.4.21	leads to forgiveness
SIR.4.21	and honor,
SIR.4.21	but some other kinds of shame
SIR.4.21	are sins themselves.
SIR.4.22	If you play favorites
SIR.4.22	or let bullies push you around,
SIR.4.22	you will get hurt.
SIR.4.23	If you can make things right
SIR.4.23	by speaking up, then do so.
SIR.4.23	Don't let the opinions of others
SIR.4.23	make you hide your wisdom.
SIR.4.24	If your wisdom and knowledge
SIR.4.24	are to make any difference,
SIR.4.24	you will have to speak.
SIR.4.25	Don't ever try
SIR.4.25	to make the truth seem false,
SIR.4.25	but always be humble
SIR.4.25	about things you don't know.
SIR.4.26	Don't try to hide your sins
SIR.4.26	from God—
SIR.4.26	it would be easier
SIR.4.26	to stop a river from flowing.
SIR.4.27	Never promise to obey a fool,
SIR.4.27	and don't play favorites
SIR.4.27	while a ruler is watching.
SIR.4.28	And even if you risk your life
SIR.4.28	fighting for truth,
SIR.4.28	the Lord God will be there,
SIR.4.28	fighting by your side.
SIR.4.29	Don't be arrogant
SIR.4.29	in what you say,
SIR.4.29	or slow and weak
SIR.4.29	in what you do.
SIR.4.30	When you are at home,
SIR.4.30	don't be fierce as a lion
SIR.4.30	or suspicious of servants.
SIR.4.31	when it's time to receive,
SIR.4.31	then close your fist
SIR.4.31	when it's time to give.
SIR.5.1	Don't trust your wealth
SIR.5.1	and say,
SIR.5.1	“I don't need anyone's help.
SIR.5.2	I'm strong and smart enough
SIR.5.2	to get anything I want,
SIR.5.3	and no one has the power
SIR.5.3	to make me obey.”
SIR.5.3	Talk like that,
SIR.5.3	and God will punish you!
SIR.5.4	but God didn't punish me.”
SIR.5.4	God was being patient.
SIR.5.5	Never be so sure
SIR.5.5	of his forgiveness
SIR.5.5	that you keep on sinning
SIR.5.6	and say, “God is very kind,
SIR.5.6	and he will forgive me
SIR.5.6	even though I sin a lot.”
SIR.5.6	Yes, God is kind,
SIR.5.6	but he also gets angry
SIR.5.6	and punishes sinners.
SIR.5.7	Turn back to the Lord now—
SIR.5.7	don't wait until tomorrow.
SIR.5.7	If he gets angry,
SIR.5.7	he will quickly punish you
SIR.5.7	with death.
SIR.5.8	And wealth gained by cheating
SIR.5.8	won't save you from disaster.
SIR.5.9	Not every wind is good
SIR.5.9	for blowing away husks
SIR.5.9	from threshed grain.
SIR.5.9	And not every path leads
SIR.5.9	where you want to go.
SIR.5.9	But sinners will say anything
SIR.5.9	to get what they want.
SIR.5.10	Stand up for what you believe,
SIR.5.10	and don't change what you say
SIR.5.10	from one time to the next.
SIR.5.11	Be willing to listen to anyone,
SIR.5.11	but think before you answer.
SIR.5.12	Then speak up, if you know
SIR.5.12	what to say;
SIR.5.12	and if not, just keep quiet.
SIR.5.13	Your words can bring you honor,
SIR.5.13	but they can also cause
SIR.5.13	your ruin and disgrace.
SIR.5.14	When you speak,
SIR.5.14	don't tear others down
SIR.5.14	or try to make them say
SIR.5.14	something wrong.
SIR.5.14	You would receive
SIR.5.14	severe punishment,
SIR.5.14	far worse than the shame
SIR.5.14	felt by thieves.
SIR.5.15	So don't make big mistakes,
SIR.5.15	or even little ones,
SIR.6.1	that turn you into an enemy
SIR.6.1	instead of a friend.
SIR.6.1	A reputation for being dishonest
SIR.6.1	will bring you nothing
SIR.6.1	but shame and insults.
SIR.6.2	Don't fall under the power
SIR.6.2	of evil desires.
SIR.6.2	They are burning flames
SIR.6.2	that will destroy you,
SIR.6.3	and you will be left to wither,
SIR.6.3	like a tree with burned leaves
SIR.6.3	and scorched fruit.
SIR.6.4	Evil desires will destroy you,
SIR.6.4	and your enemies will laugh.
SIR.6.5	If you speak pleasantly
SIR.6.5	and politely,
SIR.6.5	you will make friends
SIR.6.5	and be welcome anywhere.
SIR.6.6	Be friendly with everyone,
SIR.6.6	but only listen to advice
SIR.6.6	from those few you can trust.
SIR.6.7	Make sure they are true friends
SIR.6.7	before you trust them,
SIR.6.8	because some will be friendly
SIR.6.8	when everything is fine,
SIR.6.8	but they won't help
SIR.6.8	when you have trouble.
SIR.6.9	If you argue with other friends,
SIR.6.9	they will become enemies
SIR.6.9	and tell about the argument
SIR.6.9	so you will look bad.
SIR.6.10	Still others will come to dinner
SIR.6.10	but not to help
SIR.6.10	if you have trouble.
SIR.6.11	In good times,
SIR.6.11	they will be so close,
SIR.6.11	that your servants
SIR.6.11	will have to obey them.
SIR.6.12	But if you lose your wealth,
SIR.6.12	they will disappear.
SIR.6.13	Keep your distance
SIR.6.13	from enemies
SIR.6.13	and don't be fooled
SIR.6.13	by false friends.
SIR.6.13	* 
SIR.6.14	Loyal friends will protect you
SIR.6.14	with all their strength
SIR.6.15	and are worth more
SIR.6.15	than any other treasure.
SIR.6.15	* 
SIR.6.16	They are even like medicine
SIR.6.16	that can save your life.
SIR.6.16	And here's how you can have
SIR.6.16	such loyal friends:
SIR.6.17	obey the Lord and choose friends
SIR.6.17	who also obey him.
SIR.6.18	Students, be disciplined
SIR.6.18	and learn Wisdom
SIR.6.18	when you are young,
SIR.6.18	and as your hair turns gray,
SIR.6.18	she will never desert you.
SIR.6.19	It's like plowing a little
SIR.6.19	and planting a few seeds—
SIR.6.19	then a short time later
SIR.6.19	eating food from the harvest.
SIR.6.20	But to those who are fools
SIR.6.20	or have no discipline,
SIR.6.20	the job will seem too great,
SIR.6.20	and they will give up.
SIR.6.21	When Wisdom tests them,
SIR.6.21	they will toss her aside,
SIR.6.21	as if she were a stone
SIR.6.21	too heavy to carry.
SIR.6.22	Wisdom is hidden
SIR.6.22	from most people,
SIR.6.22	just as her name suggests.
SIR.6.23	Pay attention, students—
SIR.6.23	don't reject my advice.
SIR.6.24	Become a slave to Wisdom,
SIR.6.24	with her chains fastened
SIR.6.24	around your neck and feet.
SIR.6.25	Carry her on your shoulders
SIR.6.25	and don't let those chains
SIR.6.25	make you angry.
SIR.6.26	Make up your mind to follow
SIR.6.26	and stay close to Wisdom
SIR.6.26	wherever she goes.
SIR.6.27	Search, and you will find her;
SIR.6.27	once she is yours,
SIR.6.27	hold her tightly.
SIR.6.28	Then she will give you
SIR.6.28	a peaceful and happy life.
SIR.6.29	Her chains on your feet
SIR.6.29	will become your protection,
SIR.6.29	and those on your neck
SIR.6.29	will turn into a royal robe,
SIR.6.30	decorated with gold jewelry
SIR.6.30	and tied with a purple cord.
SIR.6.31	You will wear Wisdom
SIR.6.31	like a beautiful robe
SIR.6.31	or like a crown
SIR.6.31	at a victory celebration.
SIR.6.32	Students, you are able
SIR.6.32	to discipline yourself
SIR.6.32	and learn Wisdom—
SIR.6.32	just put your mind to it!
SIR.6.33	Do you love to listen?
SIR.6.33	That's all it really takes
SIR.6.33	to gain Wisdom.
SIR.6.34	Spend time with older people
SIR.6.34	and stay close to those
SIR.6.34	who are wise.
SIR.6.35	When godly people speak,
SIR.6.35	pay attention, and memorize
SIR.6.35	every wise saying you hear.
SIR.6.36	If you know smart people,
SIR.6.36	visit them whenever you can,
SIR.6.36	until their welcome mat
SIR.6.36	wears thin from your feet.
SIR.6.37	God's laws and commands,
SIR.6.37	and he will strengthen your mind
SIR.6.37	with the Wisdom you want.
SIR.7.1	If you don't do evil,
SIR.7.1	then evil cannot harm you.
SIR.7.2	Always be fair with others,
SIR.7.2	and injustice will stay
SIR.7.2	away from you.
SIR.7.3	But those who farm
SIR.7.3	the fields of injustice,
SIR.7.3	will harvest seven times more
SIR.7.3	than they plant.
SIR.7.4	Don't ask the Lord
SIR.7.4	to make you a leader,
SIR.7.4	and don't ask the king
SIR.7.4	to give you honor.
SIR.7.5	Don't try to impress the Lord
SIR.7.5	with your goodness,
SIR.7.5	or to show off your wisdom
SIR.7.5	in front of the king.
SIR.7.6	Don't seek to be a judge
SIR.7.6	unless you have the strength
SIR.7.6	to do away with injustice.
SIR.7.6	And if you don't have courage
SIR.7.6	to stand up to the powerful,
SIR.7.6	you will ruin your good name.
SIR.7.7	Don't disgrace yourself
SIR.7.7	by sinning
SIR.7.7	against your community.
SIR.7.8	You won't escape punishment
SIR.7.8	if you commit a sin even once,
SIR.7.8	much less twice.
SIR.7.9	And do not think
SIR.7.9	that God Most High
SIR.7.9	will pardon you,
SIR.7.9	just because you have offered
SIR.7.9	a lot of sacrifices.
SIR.7.10	Don't let anything
SIR.7.10	discourage you from praying
SIR.7.10	or giving to the poor.
SIR.7.11	God can take away your success
SIR.7.11	as easily as he gave it,
SIR.7.11	so do not make fun of anyone
SIR.7.11	who is bitter from suffering.
SIR.7.12	Do not tell lies to a relative
SIR.7.12	or a friend 
SIR.7.13	or anyone else.
SIR.7.13	No good ever comes
SIR.7.13	from telling lies.
SIR.7.14	In a town council meeting,
SIR.7.14	don't talk too much.
SIR.7.14	And in your prayers,
SIR.7.14	don't repeat the same things
SIR.7.14	over and over again.
SIR.7.15	Enjoy all kinds of hard work,
SIR.7.15	especially farming, because
SIR.7.15	God Most High created it.
SIR.7.16	Do not join others in sinning—
SIR.7.16	just think of how quickly
SIR.7.16	God can punish.
SIR.7.17	So be as humble as you can,
SIR.7.17	because those who are ungodly
SIR.7.17	will be eaten by worms
SIR.7.17	and burned by fire.
SIR.7.18	Don't betray a friend for money
SIR.7.18	or a relative for pure gold.
SIR.7.19	If your wife is wise and good
SIR.7.19	and gracious,
SIR.7.19	she is more valuable than gold,
SIR.7.19	so do not divorce her.
SIR.7.20	If your workers or slaves
SIR.7.20	work hard and well,
SIR.7.20	don't mistreat them.
SIR.7.21	love them as much
SIR.7.21	as you love yourself
SIR.7.21	and set them free
SIR.7.21	when you are supposed to.
SIR.7.22	If you have cattle,
SIR.7.22	give them good care
SIR.7.22	and keep them as long
SIR.7.22	as they bring you a profit.
SIR.7.23	While your children are young,
SIR.7.23	teach them to obey you.
SIR.7.24	Do not let a daughter
SIR.7.24	always have her own way,
SIR.7.24	but protect her from men.
SIR.7.25	Finding a husband for her
SIR.7.25	is important, but be certain
SIR.7.25	to find one who is wise.
SIR.7.26	Don't divorce your wife
SIR.7.26	if she pleases you,
SIR.7.26	but if you can't stand her,
SIR.7.26	then don't trust her.
SIR.7.27	with all your heart
SIR.7.27	and remember that your birth
SIR.7.27	gave your mother great pain.
SIR.7.28	How can you ever repay them
SIR.7.28	for the gift of life?
SIR.7.29	Fear the Lord
SIR.7.29	with all that you are,
SIR.7.29	and respect his priests.
SIR.7.30	Put all your strength
SIR.7.30	into loving your Creator
SIR.7.30	and be sure that his servants
SIR.7.30	make a good living.
SIR.7.31	Fear the Lord
SIR.7.31	and honor his priests
SIR.7.31	with what he has commanded.
SIR.7.31	Bring them the first part
SIR.7.31	of your harvest
SIR.7.31	and the sacrifice
SIR.7.31	to make things right.
SIR.7.31	Give them the shoulders
SIR.7.31	from other sacrifices
SIR.7.31	and all offerings and holy food
SIR.7.31	dedicated to the Lord.
SIR.7.32	The Lord will give you
SIR.7.32	complete success,
SIR.7.32	if you give to the poor.
SIR.7.33	So be generous to everyone,
SIR.7.33	especially to those
SIR.7.33	whose loved ones have died.
SIR.7.34	Go to see them
SIR.7.34	and weep as they mourn.
SIR.7.35	If you visit the sick,
SIR.7.35	everyone will love you.
SIR.7.36	You can keep from sinning
SIR.7.36	by always reminding yourself
SIR.7.36	that you will someday die.
SIR.8.1	Don't fight those in power
SIR.8.1	if you have no chance to win.
SIR.8.2	Don't argue with those
SIR.8.2	who have plenty of gold—
SIR.8.2	they will drag you down
SIR.8.2	by bribing others
SIR.8.2	or by persuading the king
SIR.8.2	to see things their way.
SIR.8.3	And arguing with those
SIR.8.3	who talk too much
SIR.8.3	is like piling more wood
SIR.8.3	on a fire.
SIR.8.4	Don't laugh at those
SIR.8.4	who are crude,
SIR.8.4	unless you want to hear them
SIR.8.4	insult your ancestors.
SIR.8.5	If people are trying
SIR.8.5	to stop committing sins,
SIR.8.5	don't make them feel guilty;
SIR.8.5	remember that we all deserve
SIR.8.5	to be punished for our sins.
SIR.8.6	Don't dishonor old people—
SIR.8.6	the rest of us
SIR.8.6	are getting older too.
SIR.8.7	Never be happy
SIR.8.7	when someone dies.
SIR.8.7	Remember, all of us
SIR.8.7	must die someday.
SIR.8.8	When wise people speak,
SIR.8.8	pay attention, then study
SIR.8.8	what they have said.
SIR.8.8	You will learn discipline
SIR.8.8	and how to serve
SIR.8.8	those in power.
SIR.8.9	Listen when old people tell you
SIR.8.9	what they learned
SIR.8.9	from their ancestors.
SIR.8.9	Then you will understand
SIR.8.9	how to give the best answer
SIR.8.9	when one is needed.
SIR.8.10	Don't encourage sinners to sin;
SIR.8.10	they might blaze up like a fire
SIR.8.10	and you would get burned.
SIR.8.11	Don't argue with the arrogant—
SIR.8.11	they will try to turn
SIR.8.11	your own words against you.
SIR.8.12	Never lend to someone
SIR.8.12	who is stronger than you;
SIR.8.12	if you make such a loan,
SIR.8.12	don't count on being repaid.
SIR.8.13	Don't ever guarantee a loan
SIR.8.13	for more than you can afford,
SIR.8.13	and don't be surprised
SIR.8.13	if you have to repay
SIR.8.13	a loan you guaranteed.
SIR.8.14	Never sue judges—
SIR.8.14	their influence is so great
SIR.8.14	that they will always win.
SIR.8.15	Don't travel with those
SIR.8.15	who like danger.
SIR.8.15	They will do what they please
SIR.8.15	and cause you problems,
SIR.8.15	and their foolishness
SIR.8.15	might get you killed.
SIR.8.16	Don't start a fight
SIR.8.16	with hot-tempered people.
SIR.8.16	They don't care who they kill,
SIR.8.16	so don't travel with them
SIR.8.16	along deserted roads,
SIR.8.16	where you would be helpless
SIR.8.16	if they attacked.
SIR.8.17	Fools can't keep a secret,
SIR.8.17	so don't ask them for advice.
SIR.8.18	And when strangers are around
SIR.8.18	don't do anything
SIR.8.18	that you want kept secret—
SIR.8.18	you never know
SIR.8.18	who they might tell.
SIR.8.19	Do not discuss with just anyone
SIR.8.19	what you really think,
SIR.8.19	and don't let others
SIR.8.19	do favors for you.
SIR.9.1	but don't act jealous—
SIR.9.1	that will only invite her
SIR.9.1	to hurt you.
SIR.9.2	If you let yourself fall
SIR.9.2	under the spell of a woman,
SIR.9.2	she will walk all over you.
SIR.9.3	You had best stay away
SIR.9.3	from an immoral woman,
SIR.9.3	or you will be caught
SIR.9.3	in her traps.
SIR.9.4	Do not spend too much time
SIR.9.4	with a woman who sings
SIR.9.4	to entertain men—
SIR.9.4	she can use many tricks
SIR.9.4	to take control of you.
SIR.9.5	at a virgin—
SIR.9.5	if you talk her into having sex,
SIR.9.5	you will have to pay a fine
SIR.9.5	and marry her.
SIR.9.6	Don't let yourself be controlled
SIR.9.6	by a desire for prostitutes,
SIR.9.6	or you will lose everything
SIR.9.6	that you inherited.
SIR.9.7	So don't look for them;
SIR.9.7	stay off the lonely streets
SIR.9.7	where they are found.
SIR.9.8	Don't stare at a married woman
SIR.9.8	with a beautiful figure.
SIR.9.8	A woman's beauty
SIR.9.8	can set men on fire
SIR.9.8	and has led many astray.
SIR.9.9	Never have dinner or drinks
SIR.9.9	with someone else's wife.
SIR.9.9	To fall in love with her
SIR.9.9	is to fall to your death.
SIR.9.10	Don't desert old friends—
SIR.9.10	like bottles of aged wine,
SIR.9.10	they bring cheer
SIR.9.10	more than new ones.
SIR.9.11	Don't be jealous of sinners
SIR.9.11	who receive praise;
SIR.9.11	you never can tell
SIR.9.11	how their life will end.
SIR.9.12	Don't look for happiness
SIR.9.12	where ungodly people do.
SIR.9.12	You know they won't always
SIR.9.12	get away with their sins.
SIR.9.13	Stay away from those
SIR.9.13	who are able to kill you,
SIR.9.13	and you won't live in fear
SIR.9.13	of death.
SIR.9.13	To be near them is to walk
SIR.9.13	through a field full of traps
SIR.9.13	or across a ledge
SIR.9.13	high on the city walls—
SIR.9.13	make one false step
SIR.9.13	and your life is over.
SIR.9.14	Do your best to know
SIR.9.14	your close neighbors,
SIR.9.14	but only ask the wise ones
SIR.9.14	for advice.
SIR.9.15	Speak with the wise
SIR.9.15	about the Law
SIR.9.15	of God Most High.
SIR.9.16	Ask godly people over for dinner
SIR.9.16	and be proud
SIR.9.16	that you fear the Lord.
SIR.9.17	Craftsmen receive praise
SIR.9.17	if their work shows skill,
SIR.9.17	and the leaders of a nation
SIR.9.17	will be honored
SIR.9.17	for wise words.
SIR.9.18	But loud, reckless leaders
SIR.9.18	are hated and feared.
SIR.10.1	A wise judge teaches the laws
SIR.10.1	to the people,
SIR.10.1	and a smart ruler
SIR.10.1	gets things organized.
SIR.10.2	The people of a town
SIR.10.2	and its lower officials
SIR.10.2	usually follow the example
SIR.10.2	set by the judges and rulers.
SIR.10.3	A stupid king
SIR.10.3	destroys his nation,
SIR.10.3	but a city grows
SIR.10.3	if its leaders can rule well.
SIR.10.4	The Lord controls
SIR.10.4	all authorities on earth,
SIR.10.4	and he appoints the best rulers
SIR.10.4	for each situation and time.
SIR.10.5	God alone gives the success
SIR.10.5	that brings honor to those
SIR.10.5	who write the laws.
SIR.10.6	When neighbors harm you,
SIR.10.6	don't be angry or proud.
SIR.10.7	The Lord and all people
SIR.10.7	hate pride and become angry
SIR.10.7	with injustice.
SIR.10.8	A wealthy and arrogant nation
SIR.10.8	that fails to show justice
SIR.10.8	will soon be conquered.
SIR.10.9	Why are we humans so proud?
SIR.10.9	We are only dust and ashes,
SIR.10.9	and we easily lose
SIR.10.9	our health and strength.
SIR.10.10	A long illness mocks the skill
SIR.10.10	of physicians,
SIR.10.10	and even a king
SIR.10.10	can die without warning.
SIR.10.11	Then after our death,
SIR.10.11	our bodies are eaten
SIR.10.11	by wild animals and maggots
SIR.10.11	and worms.
SIR.10.12	We humans start to be arrogant
SIR.10.12	when our hearts turn away
SIR.10.12	from the Lord our Creator.
SIR.10.13	Sins are the source of pride,
SIR.10.13	and if we hold on to it,
SIR.10.13	our lives will be flooded
SIR.10.13	with more disgusting sins.
SIR.10.13	So the Lord destroys
SIR.10.13	by punishing them with disasters
SIR.10.13	they never dreamed possible.
SIR.10.14	replacing them with
SIR.10.14	the humble.
SIR.10.15	When God decides to give land
SIR.10.15	to a humble nation,
SIR.10.15	he pulls up others by the roots
SIR.10.16	and plows through their fields
SIR.10.16	until nothing remains.
SIR.10.17	The Lord destroys some of them
SIR.10.17	so completely, that no one
SIR.10.17	remembers they ever lived.
SIR.10.18	When the Lord created humans,
SIR.10.18	he did not intend for us
SIR.10.18	to be proud and angry.
SIR.10.19	We deserve honor
SIR.10.19	only when we fear the Lord,
SIR.10.19	but we should not be honored
SIR.10.19	if we break his laws.
SIR.10.20	A family should give honor
SIR.10.20	to its leader,
SIR.10.20	but God honors all
SIR.10.20	who fear him.
SIR.10.21	He accepts them,
SIR.10.21	but he rejects those
SIR.10.21	who are proud and stubborn.
SIR.10.22	Fearing the Lord is something
SIR.10.22	to be proud of—
SIR.10.22	whether you are poor,
SIR.10.22	or rich and famous,
SIR.10.22	a Jew, or a Gentile.
SIR.10.23	Don't look down on those
SIR.10.23	who are wise but poor,
SIR.10.23	and don't honor sinners.
SIR.10.24	Honor always comes to judges
SIR.10.24	and people in power,
SIR.10.24	but anyone who fears the Lord
SIR.10.24	is even more deserving.
SIR.10.25	So if you are smart,
SIR.10.25	you will understand
SIR.10.25	when you see a master
SIR.10.25	serving a wise servant.
SIR.10.26	Don't spend your time thinking
SIR.10.26	of ways to avoid work,
SIR.10.26	and don't pretend to be well off
SIR.10.26	if you are short of money.
SIR.10.27	It's better to work
SIR.10.27	and have more than enough
SIR.10.27	than to boast and go hungry.
SIR.10.28	Students, be humble
SIR.10.28	but remember to have
SIR.10.28	proper self-esteem.
SIR.10.29	Who will think you are innocent
SIR.10.29	if you call yourself guilty?
SIR.10.29	And who will give you honor
SIR.10.29	if you refuse
SIR.10.29	to respect yourself?
SIR.10.30	The poor receive honor
SIR.10.30	if they are educated,
SIR.10.30	while the wealthy are praised
SIR.10.30	because they have money.
SIR.10.31	So when the poor become rich
SIR.10.31	they will be praised more,
SIR.10.31	but the disgrace of the wealthy
SIR.10.31	will become much worse
SIR.10.31	if they lose their money.
SIR.11.1	Those in power
SIR.11.1	always make room
SIR.11.1	for someone wise and humble.
SIR.11.2	Do not praise or despise anyone
SIR.11.2	on the basis of their looks.
SIR.11.3	The honeybee is very small,
SIR.11.3	but it makes
SIR.11.3	the sweetest food.
SIR.11.4	Don't boast about your clothes
SIR.11.4	or act important
SIR.11.4	when you are honored.
SIR.11.4	Only the Lord does things
SIR.11.4	truly worthy of praise,
SIR.11.4	but he keeps them hidden
SIR.11.4	from our sight.
SIR.11.5	Kings often lose their power
SIR.11.5	to those who had seemed
SIR.11.5	to be nobodies,
SIR.11.6	while honored rulers
SIR.11.6	are captured and disgraced.
SIR.11.7	Find out the truth
SIR.11.7	before you criticize.
SIR.11.8	Don't interrupt others—
SIR.11.8	hear them out,
SIR.11.8	then give your answer.
SIR.11.9	If it's none of your business,
SIR.11.9	then don't argue with them,
SIR.11.9	and stay away from sinners
SIR.11.9	when they discuss what to do.
SIR.11.10	Students, don't let yourself
SIR.11.10	become too busy.
SIR.11.10	If you do, you will sin
SIR.11.10	and not find success
SIR.11.10	or escape trouble.
SIR.11.11	Some people work all day long
SIR.11.11	as hard as they can,
SIR.11.11	but they keep getting poorer.
SIR.11.12	Others are poor and weak;
SIR.11.12	they work slowly
SIR.11.12	and always need help.
SIR.11.12	But the Lord shows kindness
SIR.11.13	and to everyone's surprise,
SIR.11.13	he lifts them from poverty
SIR.11.13	and gives them honor.
SIR.11.14	All things, whether good or bad,
SIR.11.14	come from the Lord.
SIR.11.14	He gives life and riches
SIR.11.14	or takes them away.
SIR.11.15	The Lord gives wisdom
SIR.11.15	by teaching us
SIR.11.15	to understand his Law.
SIR.11.15	He helps us love each other
SIR.11.15	and do right.
SIR.11.16	Sinners are dishonest
SIR.11.16	and live in darkness,
SIR.11.16	proud of their evil
SIR.11.16	from the day they are born,
SIR.11.16	and so evil will stay with them
SIR.11.16	until the day they die.
SIR.11.17	But the Lord gives success
SIR.11.17	to his faithful people
SIR.11.17	and blesses them with gifts
SIR.11.17	that last forever.
SIR.11.18	if you work hard
SIR.11.18	and never spend any money.
SIR.11.18	But then what?
SIR.11.19	When you finally retire
SIR.11.19	to enjoy what you own,
SIR.11.19	you soon may die,
SIR.11.19	and then your wealth
SIR.11.19	will belong to others.
SIR.11.20	When you agree to do work,
SIR.11.20	stay busy and don't quit.
SIR.11.21	Don't be surprised
SIR.11.21	at what sinners do;
SIR.11.21	trust the Lord and keep working,
SIR.11.21	because he can make you rich
SIR.11.21	in a moment's time.
SIR.11.22	Suddenly, he will reward you
SIR.11.22	and bless you with prosperity,
SIR.11.22	if you are faithful to him.
SIR.11.22	* 
SIR.11.23	So don't say, “I already have
SIR.11.23	everything I need—
SIR.11.23	what more could the Lord
SIR.11.23	do for me?
SIR.11.24	Nothing can harm me now!”
SIR.11.25	When people are well off,
SIR.11.25	they never mention
SIR.11.25	how needy they once were,
SIR.11.25	and when they have trouble,
SIR.11.25	the good times are forgotten.
SIR.11.26	But at the end of life,
SIR.11.26	the Lord will pay us back
SIR.11.26	for what we have done.
SIR.11.27	Pleasant memories fade
SIR.11.27	after an hour of pain,
SIR.11.27	but the way that you lived
SIR.11.27	is made clear by how you die
SIR.11.28	and by what kind of children
SIR.11.28	you leave behind.
SIR.11.28	So don't praise anyone
SIR.11.28	until they are dead.
SIR.11.29	Don't let just anyone
SIR.11.29	come to your house.
SIR.11.29	Dishonest people will trick you,
SIR.11.30	as bird hunters use decoys
SIR.11.30	to trap quails.
SIR.11.30	They watch you like spies,
SIR.11.30	waiting for some mistake
SIR.11.31	or for a chance
SIR.11.31	to make your good deeds
SIR.11.31	seem evil.
SIR.11.32	One spark can start a fire,
SIR.11.32	and one sinner's evil plan
SIR.11.32	can end in murder.
SIR.11.33	Watch out for the schemes
SIR.11.33	of those who do evil,
SIR.11.33	or they may ruin
SIR.11.33	your good name.
SIR.11.34	And if you let foreigners
SIR.11.34	come to live in your home,
SIR.11.34	they will cause trouble
SIR.11.34	and persuade you to accept
SIR.11.34	their customs and gods.
SIR.12.1	who deserve it,
SIR.12.1	and they will thank you.
SIR.12.2	Be kind to the godly,
SIR.12.2	and they—or God Most High—
SIR.12.2	will reward you.
SIR.12.3	But you will have no success
SIR.12.3	if you keep doing evil
SIR.12.3	and refuse to give
SIR.12.3	to the poor.
SIR.12.3	* 
SIR.12.4	Help those who are humble
SIR.12.4	and faithful to God,
SIR.12.5	but don't help the ungodly.
SIR.12.5	If you give food to sinners,
SIR.12.5	they will become strong
SIR.12.5	and overpower you.
SIR.12.5	Do a good deed for them,
SIR.12.5	and they will reward you
SIR.12.5	by wronging you twice.
SIR.12.6	But God Most High
SIR.12.6	hates ungodly sinners
SIR.12.6	and will punish them.
SIR.12.7	Yes, give to good people,
SIR.12.7	not to sinners.
SIR.12.8	In hard times you will discover
SIR.12.8	your true friends
SIR.12.8	and your real enemies.
SIR.12.9	Even your enemies act friendly
SIR.12.9	when you are well off,
SIR.12.9	but only true friends stay
SIR.12.9	when trouble strikes.
SIR.12.10	Never trust your enemies—
SIR.12.10	their evil will attack you
SIR.12.10	like rust 
SIR.12.11	eating away
SIR.12.11	at an unpolished mirror.
SIR.12.11	So be on guard against them,
SIR.12.11	even if they bow down
SIR.12.11	and act humble.
SIR.12.12	Don't make them your partners,
SIR.12.12	or they will push you aside
SIR.12.12	and take over.
SIR.12.12	Then you will know I was right,
SIR.12.12	and you will feel the sting
SIR.12.12	of my words.
SIR.12.13	If you try to charm snakes
SIR.12.13	or to tame wild animals,
SIR.12.13	who will take pity
SIR.12.13	when you get bitten?
SIR.12.14	In the same way,
SIR.12.14	no one will take pity
SIR.12.14	if you are friendly with sinners
SIR.12.14	and start sinning yourself.
SIR.12.15	Enemies act loyal for a while,
SIR.12.15	but they won't stand by you
SIR.12.15	when you need help.
SIR.12.16	They tell you how much
SIR.12.16	they want to be your friends,
SIR.12.16	all the while plotting
SIR.12.16	to put you in your grave.
SIR.12.16	They weep when you are sad,
SIR.12.16	but they will try to kill you
SIR.12.16	the first chance they get.
SIR.12.17	If you are struck by disaster,
SIR.12.17	they pretend to help
SIR.12.17	but pull you down instead.
SIR.12.18	Then they laugh and sneer,
SIR.12.18	making vulgar hand signs,
SIR.12.18	showing what kind of friends
SIR.12.18	they really are.
SIR.13.1	Can you stay humble
SIR.13.1	if your friends are proud?
SIR.13.1	Only if you can handle tar
SIR.13.1	and stay clean!
SIR.13.2	And watch out if your friends
SIR.13.2	are rich and powerful.
SIR.13.2	You cannot match their strength,
SIR.13.2	and you might be crushed,
SIR.13.2	just like a clay jar
SIR.13.2	struck by an iron pan.
SIR.13.3	The rich oppress
SIR.13.3	and insult the poor,
SIR.13.3	then demand an apology!
SIR.13.4	The rich will try to use you,
SIR.13.4	but if you need help,
SIR.13.4	don't bother to ask.
SIR.13.5	When they come to visit you,
SIR.13.5	they will soak up
SIR.13.5	what little you have.
SIR.13.6	If they need your help,
SIR.13.6	they smile and act kind
SIR.13.6	and even ask how they
SIR.13.6	can be of service.
SIR.13.6	But don't be fooled—
SIR.13.6	it's all lies!
SIR.13.7	They will invite you to dinner,
SIR.13.7	but in the long run you'll pay
SIR.13.7	three times what it cost.
SIR.13.7	And when you have nothing left,
SIR.13.7	they will laugh and sneer
SIR.13.7	and keep their distance.
SIR.13.8	So be smart and careful,
SIR.13.8	not deceived and humiliated.
SIR.13.9	Important people
SIR.13.9	will want you around,
SIR.13.9	if you don't try too hard
SIR.13.9	to be their friend.
SIR.13.10	Push yourself on them,
SIR.13.10	and you will face rejection;
SIR.13.10	act cold, and they will forget
SIR.13.10	that you are alive.
SIR.13.11	Don't try to be their equal
SIR.13.11	or trust them when they
SIR.13.11	have long talks with you.
SIR.13.11	They are smiling,
SIR.13.11	but you are being tested.
SIR.13.12	Those who tell secrets are cruel
SIR.13.12	and would just as soon hurt you
SIR.13.12	or send you to prison.
SIR.13.13	Be careful! Don't risk disaster
SIR.13.13	by sharing your secrets.
SIR.13.14	Wake up and pay attention!
SIR.13.14	Every day of your life,
SIR.13.14	love the Lord and pray
SIR.13.14	that he will protect you.
SIR.13.14	* 
SIR.13.15	Animals and people
SIR.13.16	love their own kind.
SIR.13.17	Wolves and lambs
SIR.13.17	have about as much in common
SIR.13.17	as sinners and God's people.
SIR.13.18	Hyenas and dogs
SIR.13.18	are natural enemies,
SIR.13.18	just like the poor
SIR.13.18	and the rich.
SIR.13.19	Desert lions will always feast
SIR.13.19	on wild donkeys,
SIR.13.19	and the rich will gobble up
SIR.13.19	the needy.
SIR.13.20	The rich and proud
SIR.13.20	consider the poor and humble
SIR.13.20	to be disgusting.
SIR.13.21	When the rich start to stumble
SIR.13.21	their friends lend a hand,
SIR.13.21	but let the poor fall down,
SIR.13.21	and their friends pretend
SIR.13.21	not to know them.
SIR.13.22	When the rich are in trouble,
SIR.13.22	many will offer to help
SIR.13.22	and will even make excuses
SIR.13.22	when the rich insult them.
SIR.13.22	But let the poor get in trouble,
SIR.13.22	and all they get is criticism,
SIR.13.22	even if they speak wisely.
SIR.13.23	When the rich speak,
SIR.13.23	everyone listens
SIR.13.23	with great respect.
SIR.13.23	But if the poor speak,
SIR.13.23	everyone asks, “Just who
SIR.13.23	do they think they are?”
SIR.13.23	And if the poor start to trip,
SIR.13.23	people give them a push.
SIR.13.24	It's good to have wealth
SIR.13.24	if you got it honestly,
SIR.13.24	but don't be ungodly and claim
SIR.13.24	that being poor is evil.
SIR.13.25	With one look at your face
SIR.13.25	anyone can see
SIR.13.25	if you are happy or sad.
SIR.13.26	A smile shows you are happy,
SIR.13.26	and a tired look may mean
SIR.13.26	you have been trying too hard
SIR.13.26	to think up a proverb.
SIR.14.1	You will be happiest
SIR.14.1	if you keep from sinning
SIR.14.1	and saying stupid things,
SIR.14.2	and if you have no reason
SIR.14.2	to feel guilty
SIR.14.2	and have not given up hope.
SIR.14.2	* 
SIR.14.3	What's the use of being rich
SIR.14.3	if you don't enjoy
SIR.14.3	spending money on yourself?
SIR.14.4	Are you just saving it
SIR.14.4	so others can live in luxury
SIR.14.4	after you are dead and gone?
SIR.14.5	Those who refuse to enjoy
SIR.14.5	a few things money can buy,
SIR.14.5	probably won't give much
SIR.14.5	to someone in need.
SIR.14.6	They spend nothing,
SIR.14.6	and punish themselves
SIR.14.6	with the greatest misery.
SIR.14.6	* 
SIR.14.7	If they do a good deed,
SIR.14.7	it is only by accident,
SIR.14.7	and the end of their life
SIR.14.7	shows how evil they were:
SIR.14.8	they pretended not to notice
SIR.14.8	others in need;
SIR.14.9	they were never happy
SIR.14.9	with their own fair share;
SIR.14.9	and by taking
SIR.14.9	what belonged to others,
SIR.14.9	their souls shriveled away.
SIR.14.10	They wouldn't even give
SIR.14.10	their families enough to eat!
SIR.14.11	Be good to yourself
SIR.14.11	according to what you have
SIR.14.11	and be generous in your giving
SIR.14.11	to the Lord.
SIR.14.12	You cannot know the time
SIR.14.12	for you to die,
SIR.14.12	and when it arrives,
SIR.14.12	death will not wait,
SIR.14.13	so now is the time
SIR.14.13	to help your friends
SIR.14.13	with generous gifts.
SIR.14.14	Every day, you should enjoy
SIR.14.14	the good things you want,
SIR.14.15	because after you are gone,
SIR.14.15	others will divide up everything
SIR.14.15	you worked so hard to get.
SIR.14.16	Give and accept gifts,
SIR.14.16	and treat yourself well,
SIR.14.16	because there is nothing good
SIR.14.16	in the world of the dead.
SIR.14.17	Every living creature wears out
SIR.14.17	like old clothes
SIR.14.17	and obeys the ancient law
SIR.14.17	that says, “You will die.”
SIR.14.18	Generations pass away,
SIR.14.18	and others are born
SIR.14.18	to take their place,
SIR.14.18	just as new leaves
SIR.14.18	on a tall tree
SIR.14.18	replace those that fall.
SIR.14.19	Everything you ever made
SIR.14.19	will someday turn to dust,
SIR.14.19	then even the memory of you
SIR.14.19	will disappear.
SIR.14.20	who learn how to reason
SIR.14.20	by thinking about her.
SIR.14.21	They consider
SIR.14.21	what Wisdom has done
SIR.14.21	and the secrets she knows.
SIR.14.22	They wait for her
SIR.14.22	like hunters along a path,
SIR.14.22	then they follow her 
SIR.14.23	home,
SIR.14.23	where they peek
SIR.14.23	through the windows
SIR.14.23	and listen at the door.
SIR.14.23	* 
SIR.14.24	They set up camp
SIR.14.24	so close to her house,
SIR.14.24	that their tent pegs
SIR.14.24	are hammered into its walls.
SIR.14.25	There is no better place to live
SIR.14.25	than in her home—
SIR.14.26	like a shade tree, she protects
SIR.14.26	the children of her followers
SIR.14.27	from the heat,
SIR.14.27	and they live in a place
SIR.14.27	of great beauty.
SIR.15.1	If you fear the Lord
SIR.15.1	and obey his Law,
SIR.15.1	you will find Wisdom
SIR.15.1	when you search.
SIR.15.2	She will care for you
SIR.15.2	like your own mother
SIR.15.2	and welcome you, as a bride
SIR.15.2	welcomes her husband.
SIR.15.3	And instead of something
SIR.15.3	to eat and drink,
SIR.15.3	she will give you wisdom
SIR.15.3	and understanding.
SIR.15.4	You can depend on her
SIR.15.4	to keep you from disgrace.
SIR.15.5	She will tell you what to say,
SIR.15.5	and you will be honored
SIR.15.5	because of your wise speeches
SIR.15.5	in town meetings.
SIR.15.6	Your life will be happy,
SIR.15.6	and you will be remembered
SIR.15.6	for all time.
SIR.15.7	But fools and sinners
SIR.15.7	will never find Wisdom.
SIR.15.8	She won't come near the proud
SIR.15.8	or enter the mind of a liar.
SIR.15.9	That's why the Lord
SIR.15.9	refuses to accept praise
SIR.15.9	from sinners.
SIR.15.10	Only the wise can offer
SIR.15.10	acceptable praise.
SIR.15.11	that he forced you to sin.
SIR.15.12	And he doesn't like sinners,
SIR.15.12	so don't claim he tempted you
SIR.15.12	to become one.
SIR.15.13	The Lord and all who fear him
SIR.15.13	hate disgusting sins.
SIR.15.14	The Lord created us humans,
SIR.15.14	and from the very beginning,
SIR.15.14	he gave us the ability
SIR.15.14	to choose how we will live.
SIR.15.15	You are able to obey his Law
SIR.15.15	if you really want to,
SIR.15.15	and you can please him
SIR.15.15	by being faithful.
SIR.15.15	* 
SIR.15.16	Life and death are as different
SIR.15.16	as fire and water,
SIR.15.17	and the Lord will give you
SIR.15.17	whichever you choose.
SIR.15.18	The Lord is extremely wise
SIR.15.18	and tremendously powerful.
SIR.15.18	He can see all things—
SIR.15.19	every deed that we do—
SIR.15.19	and if we fear him,
SIR.15.19	he will watch over us.
SIR.15.20	He has neither commanded
SIR.15.20	nor given permission for anyone
SIR.15.20	to be evil or to sin.
SIR.16.1	Ungodly children are worthless
SIR.16.1	and are nothing to desire
SIR.16.1	or to celebrate.
SIR.16.2	You can have lots of children,
SIR.16.2	but they will bring joy
SIR.16.2	only if they fear the Lord.
SIR.16.3	Having lots of ungodly children
SIR.16.3	won't help you in old age—
SIR.16.3	you will outlive them all.
SIR.16.3	One good child,
SIR.16.3	or even no children at all,
SIR.16.3	is better than a thousand
SIR.16.3	who are ungodly.
SIR.16.4	A family that disobeys the law
SIR.16.4	can make a city a ghost town,
SIR.16.4	but one smart person can fill
SIR.16.4	an empty city with people.
SIR.16.5	Here are but a few
SIR.16.5	of the important things
SIR.16.5	I have seen and heard:
SIR.16.6	If a small group of sinners
SIR.16.6	sets the Lord's anger ablaze,
SIR.16.6	then it will be worse by far
SIR.16.6	if a whole nation is sinful.
SIR.16.7	to forgive the mighty giants
SIR.16.7	who rebelled against him.
SIR.16.8	And he so hated the arrogance
SIR.16.8	of the people of Sodom,
SIR.16.8	that he destroyed them.
SIR.16.9	They were doomed
SIR.16.9	because of their sins,
SIR.16.9	and the Lord showed no mercy
SIR.16.9	as he swept them away.
SIR.16.10	Nor did he have pity
SIR.16.10	on six hundred thousand
SIR.16.10	stubborn Assyrian soldiers
SIR.16.10	who attacked his people.
SIR.16.11	Even if only one person
SIR.16.11	refused to obey the Lord,
SIR.16.11	I would be surprised if he
SIR.16.11	did not punish that one.
SIR.16.11	The Lord loves to show mercy
SIR.16.11	and to use his mighty power
SIR.16.11	to forgive his people,
SIR.16.11	but when his anger overflows
SIR.16.11	against sinners,
SIR.16.12	he uses that same power
SIR.16.12	to punish them.
SIR.16.12	Everyone will receive
SIR.16.12	either mercy or punishment
SIR.16.12	as each deserves.
SIR.16.13	The Lord refuses to let sinners
SIR.16.13	profit from their crimes,
SIR.16.13	and he will reward his people
SIR.16.13	if they patiently wait.
SIR.16.14	He remembers every good deed
SIR.16.14	and gives everyone
SIR.16.14	what they deserve.
SIR.16.15	The Lord wanted everyone
SIR.16.15	to know his mighty power,
SIR.16.15	so he put a stubborn heart
SIR.16.15	in the king of Egypt.
SIR.16.16	But the Lord also wants everyone
SIR.16.16	to know about his mercy,
SIR.16.16	so he separated those
SIR.16.16	who have his light
SIR.16.16	from those who remain
SIR.16.16	in darkness.
SIR.16.17	Never say to yourself,
SIR.16.17	“The Lord cannot see me.
SIR.16.17	He doesn't even know my name.
SIR.16.17	There are just too many people
SIR.16.17	for him to keep me in mind.
SIR.16.18	One glance from him
SIR.16.18	causes quaking and shaking
SIR.16.18	in the earth and the sky,
SIR.16.18	in the highest heaven
SIR.16.18	and the deepest sea,
SIR.16.19	in the mountains
SIR.16.19	and the foundations
SIR.16.19	of the earth.
SIR.16.20	But no human can understand
SIR.16.20	how his mighty power works.
SIR.16.21	Most of what God does
SIR.16.21	cannot be seen,
SIR.16.21	just like the wind
SIR.16.21	in a violent storm.
SIR.16.22	So who will tell him
SIR.16.22	when I do what is right?
SIR.16.22	And who has the patience
SIR.16.22	to wait for him
SIR.16.22	to keep his promises?”
SIR.16.23	That is how fools speak—
SIR.16.23	they cannot think straight
SIR.16.23	and have no understanding.
SIR.16.24	Listen, students;
SIR.16.24	pay attention,
SIR.16.24	and you will learn.
SIR.16.25	I will train you and tell you
SIR.16.25	exactly what I know.
SIR.16.26	In the beginning, when the Lord
SIR.16.26	created the world,
SIR.16.26	he gave each thing
SIR.16.26	its proper place.
SIR.16.27	He designed the forces of nature
SIR.16.27	to last for all time—
SIR.16.27	they never tire or get hungry
SIR.16.27	or stop working.
SIR.16.28	They don't get in the way
SIR.16.28	of each other,
SIR.16.28	and they will never
SIR.16.28	disobey him.
SIR.16.29	After God created the earth,
SIR.16.29	he looked it over
SIR.16.29	and filled it with creatures
SIR.16.29	that were good;
SIR.16.30	animals of all kinds
SIR.16.30	covered the ground,
SIR.16.30	and when they die,
SIR.16.30	they return to it.
SIR.17.1	from the soil,
SIR.17.1	and he makes us return there
SIR.17.1	when we die.
SIR.17.2	Our lives are short,
SIR.17.2	but the Lord has given us
SIR.17.2	power to rule the earth.
SIR.17.3	We were made to be like him
SIR.17.3	and were given power
SIR.17.3	much like his own.
SIR.17.4	He let us rule all animals
SIR.17.4	and made them afraid of us.
SIR.17.5	We were given the five senses
SIR.17.5	of sight and hearing,
SIR.17.5	taste, touch, and smell;
SIR.17.5	and we were also given
SIR.17.5	the ability to think
SIR.17.5	and to interpret
SIR.17.5	what our senses tell us.
SIR.17.6	He gave us tongues for speaking,
SIR.17.6	eyes for seeing,
SIR.17.6	and minds for thinking
SIR.17.6	and for making choices.
SIR.17.7	with knowledge and Wisdom
SIR.17.7	that come from the Lord,
SIR.17.7	and we understand the difference
SIR.17.7	between right and wrong.
SIR.17.8	The Lord made us fear him
SIR.17.8	so that we would know
SIR.17.8	his mighty power.
SIR.17.9	Now we will tell others
SIR.17.9	about his powerful deeds
SIR.17.10	and praise his holy name.
SIR.17.10	* 
SIR.17.11	The Lord gave to our ancestors
SIR.17.11	laws that bring knowledge
SIR.17.11	and life,
SIR.17.12	and his agreement with them
SIR.17.12	will last forever.
SIR.17.13	Our ancestors saw
SIR.17.13	the glorious power of the Lord
SIR.17.13	and heard his mighty voice
SIR.17.14	warning them about injustice
SIR.17.14	and commanding them how
SIR.17.14	to treat each other.
SIR.17.15	The Lord watches us and knows
SIR.17.15	our every deed.
SIR.17.16	Most people do wrong
SIR.17.16	from an early age
SIR.17.16	and have a cruel heart
SIR.17.16	that they cannot change.
SIR.17.17	The Lord placed rulers
SIR.17.17	over all the nations,
SIR.17.17	but he himself rules Israel.
SIR.17.18	He raised our people Israel
SIR.17.18	as his own first-born child,
SIR.17.18	with loving care,
SIR.17.18	but also with discipline.
SIR.17.19	He can see our actions
SIR.17.19	as easily as we see the sun.
SIR.17.20	That's the reason
SIR.17.20	we can't hide our sins—
SIR.17.20	he can see them all.
SIR.17.21	But he knows what we are like,
SIR.17.21	and so he shows mercy
SIR.17.21	and never deserts us.
SIR.17.22	The Lord values
SIR.17.22	our gifts to the poor
SIR.17.22	as much as we value fine jewelry
SIR.17.22	or a most prized possession.
SIR.17.23	Later, he will punish the wicked
SIR.17.23	as they deserve,
SIR.17.24	but he accepts all those
SIR.17.24	who turn from sinning,
SIR.17.24	and he encourages everyone
SIR.17.24	whose hope is slipping away.
SIR.17.25	to the Lord;
SIR.17.25	your punishment will be less
SIR.17.25	if you pray to him.
SIR.17.26	So turn back to the Lord
SIR.17.26	and hate what he hates.
SIR.17.27	can thank the Lord—
SIR.17.27	no one in the world of the dead
SIR.17.27	can praise him;
SIR.17.28	they no longer exist
SIR.17.28	and cannot offer thanks.
SIR.17.28	But those who are alive
SIR.17.28	and healthy
SIR.17.28	can still sing praises to him.
SIR.17.29	The Lord will show great mercy
SIR.17.29	and forgive all of your sins
SIR.17.29	if you turn back to him.
SIR.17.30	But we cannot live forever;
SIR.17.30	we are human and find it hard
SIR.17.30	to turn to God.
SIR.17.31	If a thick dark cloud can hide
SIR.17.31	the bright rays of the sun,
SIR.17.31	then evil can just as easily
SIR.17.31	darken our minds.
SIR.17.32	We are merely dust and ashes,
SIR.17.32	but God commands the armies
SIR.17.32	of the highest heaven.
SIR.18.1	The Lord, who lives forever,
SIR.18.1	created all things,
SIR.18.2	and he alone
SIR.18.2	is always faithful.
SIR.18.2	He is the only true God;
SIR.18.3	one signal from his hand
SIR.18.3	and the universe obeys.
SIR.18.3	The Lord, its mighty King,
SIR.18.3	decides what we
SIR.18.3	are allowed to use,
SIR.18.3	and what he will keep
SIR.18.3	for himself alone.
SIR.18.4	We cannot understand
SIR.18.4	or tell other people
SIR.18.4	what God's power has done,
SIR.18.5	because we cannot measure it
SIR.18.5	or count the times
SIR.18.5	he has shown us mercy.
SIR.18.6	Nor can we make that number
SIR.18.6	larger or smaller.
SIR.18.6	We just stand in amazement
SIR.18.6	at the things he has done,
SIR.18.7	and at the end of a lifetime
SIR.18.7	of studying them,
SIR.18.7	we are still confused.
SIR.18.8	As for us humans, what are we?
SIR.18.8	Do we have any purpose?
SIR.18.8	What is good for us
SIR.18.8	and what is bad?
SIR.18.9	Few of us live a hundred years,
SIR.18.10	which is a very short time
SIR.18.10	when compared to forever,
SIR.18.10	like a drop of ocean water
SIR.18.10	or a grain of sand
SIR.18.10	along a beach.
SIR.18.11	That's why the Lord
SIR.18.11	patiently shows us mercy,
SIR.18.11	time after time.
SIR.18.12	He is eager to forgive,
SIR.18.12	because he knows that we
SIR.18.12	are condemned to die.
SIR.18.13	We show mercy to our friends,
SIR.18.13	but the Lord has mercy
SIR.18.13	on everyone.
SIR.18.13	He corrects and disciplines
SIR.18.13	and teaches us,
SIR.18.13	and leads us back to him
SIR.18.13	like a shepherd
SIR.18.13	leading a flock of sheep.
SIR.18.14	If we pay attention
SIR.18.14	when he corrects us,
SIR.18.14	and if we study his laws,
SIR.18.14	he will be merciful.
SIR.18.15	Students, be careful
SIR.18.15	not to ruin a gift
SIR.18.15	by criticizing the person
SIR.18.15	you give it to.
SIR.18.16	Like a refreshing dew
SIR.18.16	in the heat of summer,
SIR.18.16	saying the right thing
SIR.18.16	can mean more than giving
SIR.18.17	even a generous gift.
SIR.18.17	But a truly gracious person
SIR.18.17	will be ready with both.
SIR.18.18	So don't be a fool.
SIR.18.18	People's eyes will sparkle,
SIR.18.18	if your generosity is sincere
SIR.18.18	and you speak with kindness.
SIR.18.19	Know what you're talking about
SIR.18.19	before you start speaking
SIR.18.19	and look after your health
SIR.18.19	before it fails.
SIR.18.20	If you turn from sin now—
SIR.18.20	before you are judged—
SIR.18.20	you will find forgiveness.
SIR.18.21	Be humble and show that you
SIR.18.21	have turned from sin,
SIR.18.21	and you won't be punished
SIR.18.21	with illness.
SIR.18.22	If you promise the Lord a gift,
SIR.18.22	give it now.
SIR.18.22	Don't wait until you are dying
SIR.18.22	to keep your promise,
SIR.18.23	and don't make promises to him
SIR.18.23	unless you are ready
SIR.18.23	to keep them.
SIR.18.23	Don't test the Lord's patience.
SIR.18.24	When your time comes to die
SIR.18.24	and face him as judge,
SIR.18.24	if he is angry, he will refuse
SIR.18.24	to even look at you.
SIR.18.25	If you have grown wealthy
SIR.18.25	and have plenty of food,
SIR.18.25	remember when you yourself
SIR.18.25	were poor and hungry.
SIR.18.26	Between sunrise and sunset
SIR.18.26	is plenty of time for the Lord
SIR.18.26	to turn everything around.
SIR.18.27	The wise are always careful,
SIR.18.27	and they make sure to do right
SIR.18.27	when others are sinning.
SIR.18.28	Smart people recognize Wisdom,
SIR.18.28	and they praise everyone
SIR.18.28	who finds her.
SIR.18.29	If you study the writings
SIR.18.29	of the wise,
SIR.18.29	you will learn enough Wisdom
SIR.18.29	to share with others.
SIR.18.30	Control your desires;
SIR.18.30	don't let them control you.
SIR.18.31	If you allow yourself to enjoy
SIR.18.31	everything you want,
SIR.18.31	you will look like a fool,
SIR.18.31	and your enemies will laugh.
SIR.18.32	Do not live in luxury
SIR.18.32	that you cannot afford,
SIR.18.32	or you will become poor.
SIR.18.33	If you have nothing,
SIR.18.33	don't borrow money
SIR.18.33	to give a banquet.
SIR.19.1	A worker who is always drunk
SIR.19.1	will never get rich,
SIR.19.1	and people who are careless
SIR.19.1	with small things
SIR.19.1	will gradually slip
SIR.19.1	into poverty.
SIR.19.2	Even a wise man can be deceived
SIR.19.2	by wine and women,
SIR.19.2	and men who visit prostitutes
SIR.19.2	are taking terrible risks.
SIR.19.3	Death will come suddenly,
SIR.19.3	then their bodies will rot
SIR.19.3	and be eaten by worms.
SIR.19.4	If you trust people too quickly,
SIR.19.4	you aren't very smart.
SIR.19.4	If you sin, you harm yourself.
SIR.19.5	And if you are happy about evil,
SIR.19.5	you will be judged guilty.
SIR.19.6	Trouble doesn't stay
SIR.19.6	where gossip is hated.
SIR.19.7	It doesn't cost you a thing
SIR.19.7	to forget a rumor.
SIR.19.8	So don't tell it to your enemies
SIR.19.8	or even your friends,
SIR.19.8	unless you would be doing wrong
SIR.19.8	by not speaking up.
SIR.19.9	People may be listening
SIR.19.9	and watching,
SIR.19.9	and if you repeat gossip,
SIR.19.9	they might start hating you.
SIR.19.10	Treat rumors as secrets
SIR.19.10	to be kept until you die;
SIR.19.10	they can even make you feel
SIR.19.10	as though you might explode,
SIR.19.10	but be brave—you won't.
SIR.19.11	It's harder for a fool
SIR.19.11	not to repeat gossip,
SIR.19.11	than for a woman in labor
SIR.19.11	not to give birth
SIR.19.12	or a soldier to ignore an arrow
SIR.19.12	sticking out of his leg.
SIR.19.12	* 
SIR.19.13	Talk to friends or neighbors
SIR.19.13	if you hear that they
SIR.19.13	have wronged you
SIR.19.13	or said something to harm
SIR.19.13	your reputation.
SIR.19.14	If they didn't do it,
SIR.19.14	you will find out,
SIR.19.14	and if they did,
SIR.19.14	they won't do it again.
SIR.19.15	Talk to them and get the truth,
SIR.19.15	because you should not believe
SIR.19.15	everything you hear.
SIR.19.16	We are all guilty
SIR.19.16	of saying things
SIR.19.16	that we didn't really mean.
SIR.19.17	So don't threaten your friends
SIR.19.17	before you talk with them,
SIR.19.17	and always obey the Law
SIR.19.17	of God Most High.
SIR.19.18	he will accept you,
SIR.19.18	and if you are wise,
SIR.19.18	he will give you his love.
SIR.19.19	If you learn and follow
SIR.19.19	the Lord's commands,
SIR.19.19	you will please him,
SIR.19.19	and he will allow you to eat
SIR.19.19	fruit from the tree
SIR.19.19	that lets you live forever.
SIR.19.20	Fearing the Lord
SIR.19.20	and obeying his Law
SIR.19.20	are really the same
SIR.19.20	as having wisdom.
SIR.19.21	If slaves refuse to do
SIR.19.21	what they are told,
SIR.19.21	their master will be angry
SIR.19.21	even if they later obey.
SIR.19.22	Sin isn't the source of Wisdom,
SIR.19.22	and so sinners cannot give
SIR.19.22	good advice.
SIR.19.23	Some people are clever
SIR.19.23	in doing disgusting things;
SIR.19.23	others are fools only because
SIR.19.23	they never learned wisdom.
SIR.19.24	It is better to fear the Lord
SIR.19.24	and not be so intelligent,
SIR.19.24	than to be very smart
SIR.19.24	and to break his Law.
SIR.19.25	Some people are highly skilled
SIR.19.25	at being unfair
SIR.19.25	and can even twist your kindness
SIR.19.25	to help them win
SIR.19.25	their case in court.
SIR.19.26	Some dishonest people
SIR.19.26	act like they are mourning,
SIR.19.27	hiding their faces from you
SIR.19.27	and pretending not to listen.
SIR.19.27	But they will use your words
SIR.19.27	to take advantage of you
SIR.19.27	when no one is looking.
SIR.19.28	They may not be able
SIR.19.28	to do so now,
SIR.19.28	but they will wrong you
SIR.19.28	the first chance they get.
SIR.19.29	Merely by looking at people
SIR.19.29	you know what they are like.
SIR.19.29	And the first time you meet,
SIR.19.29	you can tell if someone
SIR.19.29	has good sense
SIR.19.30	by what they wear
SIR.19.30	and how they walk or laugh.
SIR.20.1	If you are smart,
SIR.20.1	you will know
SIR.20.1	when to keep quiet
SIR.20.1	and when to criticize.
SIR.20.2	It is better to speak up
SIR.20.2	than to let anger
SIR.20.2	eat away at you.
SIR.20.3	When you are wrong, admit it,
SIR.20.3	and you will save yourself
SIR.20.3	a lot of trouble.
SIR.20.4	If a man is unable to have sex,
SIR.20.4	he can't be forced to do so;
SIR.20.4	but it seems harder to force
SIR.20.4	some people to do right.
SIR.20.5	People who talk too much
SIR.20.5	are not well liked,
SIR.20.5	but people who keep quiet
SIR.20.5	are often considered wise.
SIR.20.6	Their silence may just mean
SIR.20.6	they have nothing to say.
SIR.20.6	Or it may mean they are waiting
SIR.20.6	for the right time to speak,
SIR.20.7	and that is true wisdom.
SIR.20.7	But fools who always talk
SIR.20.7	about themselves
SIR.20.7	are never quiet.
SIR.20.8	They are disgusting,
SIR.20.8	and others who grab for power
SIR.20.8	also earn our hatred.
SIR.20.9	Sometimes our troubles
SIR.20.9	end up helping us,
SIR.20.9	and other times, good luck
SIR.20.9	turns out to be bad.
SIR.20.10	Often a gift
SIR.20.10	isn't really helpful,
SIR.20.10	and when some people give,
SIR.20.10	they expect to be repaid
SIR.20.10	twice what the gift is worth.
SIR.20.11	If you search for glory
SIR.20.11	you may lose what you have,
SIR.20.11	but success can come to those
SIR.20.11	who had humble beginnings.
SIR.20.12	What seems to be a bargain
SIR.20.12	may cost you seven times
SIR.20.12	what it is worth.
SIR.20.13	People love to hear
SIR.20.13	wise people speak.
SIR.20.13	But fools, though polite,
SIR.20.13	are still fools,
SIR.20.14	and you would be better off
SIR.20.14	without gifts from them,
SIR.20.14	because they will expect you
SIR.20.14	to give even more in return.
SIR.20.15	A small gift, they think,
SIR.20.15	gives them the right
SIR.20.15	to criticize—loudly.
SIR.20.15	Today, they make a loan;
SIR.20.15	tomorrow, they ask
SIR.20.15	for their money back.
SIR.20.15	I cannot stand people like this!
SIR.20.16	Fools think they have no friends
SIR.20.16	and that no one appreciates
SIR.20.16	their good deeds.
SIR.20.16	They invite you over for a meal
SIR.20.16	but believe that you will later
SIR.20.16	say bad things about them.
SIR.20.17	They deserve to be mocked,
SIR.20.17	and few people
SIR.20.17	will pass up the chance.
SIR.20.18	It is better to slip and fall
SIR.20.18	than to suffer a slip
SIR.20.18	of the tongue.
SIR.20.18	And something that small
SIR.20.18	can bring sudden disaster
SIR.20.18	to those who are evil.
SIR.20.19	A rude person is disgusting,
SIR.20.19	just like the dirty stories
SIR.20.19	ignorant people tell.
SIR.20.20	Everyone ignores a proverb
SIR.20.20	repeated by a fool,
SIR.20.20	because fools never choose
SIR.20.20	the right one.
SIR.20.21	You may be too poor
SIR.20.21	to commit some sins,
SIR.20.21	but you can sleep at night
SIR.20.21	with a clear conscience.
SIR.20.22	Have a little self-respect
SIR.20.22	and don't act like a fool,
SIR.20.22	or you may risk disaster.
SIR.20.23	Broken promises turn friends
SIR.20.23	into enemies,
SIR.20.23	so do not make promises
SIR.20.23	that you cannot keep.
SIR.20.24	The ignorant are always lying,
SIR.20.24	not knowing that telling a lie
SIR.20.24	leaves an ugly scar.
SIR.20.25	Liars are worse than thieves,
SIR.20.25	but both are on the road
SIR.20.25	to destruction.
SIR.20.26	Telling lies brings disgrace
SIR.20.26	and shame that never ends.
SIR.20.27	If you are wise
SIR.20.27	and want to succeed,
SIR.20.27	you will try to please
SIR.20.27	those in power.
SIR.20.28	If you plow and plant,
SIR.20.28	you will harvest a crop,
SIR.20.28	and if you please the powerful,
SIR.20.28	they will overlook
SIR.20.28	your mistakes.
SIR.20.29	Favors and gifts keep the wise
SIR.20.29	from seeing the truth
SIR.20.29	and muzzle the mouths of those
SIR.20.29	who criticize.
SIR.20.29	* 
SIR.20.30	Wisdom kept secret
SIR.20.30	and wealth never used
SIR.20.30	do not help anybody,
SIR.20.31	but a fool does best
SIR.20.31	to keep foolishness hidden.
SIR.21.1	Students, if you
SIR.21.1	are sinning, stop.
SIR.21.1	Ask God to forgive you.
SIR.21.2	Sin is a deadly snake
SIR.21.2	with lion's fangs.
SIR.21.2	Stay away! If you come close
SIR.21.2	you will be bitten.
SIR.21.3	Lawlessness kills
SIR.21.3	like a sword with two edges
SIR.21.3	swung this way and that.
SIR.21.4	If you are too shy
SIR.21.4	or proud and arrogant,
SIR.21.4	you can lose your wealth
SIR.21.4	and even your home.
SIR.21.5	go straight to God's ear,
SIR.21.5	and he quickly answers.
SIR.21.6	If you hate correction,
SIR.21.6	you will become a sinner,
SIR.21.6	but if you take it to heart,
SIR.21.6	you will obey the Lord.
SIR.21.7	Good speakers can be famous,
SIR.21.7	but people with common sense
SIR.21.7	will catch every mistake.
SIR.21.8	Borrowing to build your house
SIR.21.8	is like gathering stones
SIR.21.8	to mark your own grave.
SIR.21.9	A meeting of evil people
SIR.21.9	is a bundle of straw,
SIR.21.9	where a small flame
SIR.21.9	ends in a blazing fire.
SIR.21.10	For a sinner, the road of life
SIR.21.10	is smooth, but it slopes down
SIR.21.10	to the world of the dead.
SIR.21.11	Fear the Lord in every way,
SIR.21.11	and you will become wise;
SIR.21.11	Control your thoughts,
SIR.21.11	and you can obey his Law.
SIR.21.12	You have to be smart to learn,
SIR.21.12	but some kinds of smartness
SIR.21.12	only make other people bitter.
SIR.21.13	The knowledge of the wise
SIR.21.13	is an overflowing river,
SIR.21.13	and their advice
SIR.21.13	is a life-giving spring.
SIR.21.14	The mind of a fool
SIR.21.14	is a leaking jar
SIR.21.14	that holds nothing for long.
SIR.21.15	When the wise hear a proverb,
SIR.21.15	they give it praise
SIR.21.15	and add more to it;
SIR.21.15	but fools merely laugh
SIR.21.15	and forget it.
SIR.21.16	Listening to a fool is tiring,
SIR.21.16	like carrying a heavy backpack
SIR.21.16	on a journey,
SIR.21.16	but listening to someone smart
SIR.21.16	is refreshing.
SIR.21.17	In a town meeting, people look
SIR.21.17	for some common sense,
SIR.21.17	and when they hear it,
SIR.21.17	they will think about
SIR.21.17	what was said.
SIR.21.18	Knowledge means nothing
SIR.21.18	to ignorant fools,
SIR.21.18	and wisdom is useless
SIR.21.18	as a burned-down house.
SIR.21.19	Fools think learning puts chains
SIR.21.19	on their hands and feet,
SIR.21.20	and they laugh at it loudly.
SIR.21.20	But smart people just smile,
SIR.21.21	because they know that learning
SIR.21.21	is a golden bracelet.
SIR.21.22	Fools will push past you
SIR.21.22	into your home,
SIR.21.22	but the wise will wait
SIR.21.22	at your door.
SIR.21.22	* 
SIR.21.23	They are polite and will not try
SIR.21.23	to see inside
SIR.21.23	or to hear what is going on,
SIR.21.24	because that would be rude
SIR.21.24	and shameful.
SIR.21.25	Some people won't stop talking
SIR.21.25	about things that are none
SIR.21.25	of their business.
SIR.21.25	But sensible people
SIR.21.25	weigh each word
SIR.21.25	before it is spoken.
SIR.21.26	In a fool, the mind thinks
SIR.21.26	only after the mouth speaks,
SIR.21.26	but in a wise person,
SIR.21.26	the mind controls the mouth.
SIR.21.27	The ungodly fall under any curse
SIR.21.27	that they try to place
SIR.21.27	on their enemies.
SIR.21.28	If you spread gossip,
SIR.21.28	your character will be ruined
SIR.21.28	and your neighbors
SIR.21.28	will hate you.
SIR.22.1	Lazy people
SIR.22.1	are like stones
SIR.22.1	that everyone spits on,
SIR.22.2	or a pile of manure
SIR.22.2	that you have to walk around.
SIR.22.2	If you touch them,
SIR.22.2	you want to wash your hands.
SIR.22.3	A father is ashamed if his son
SIR.22.3	isn't well behaved,
SIR.22.3	and a disobedient daughter
SIR.22.3	is even worse.
SIR.22.4	If a daughter is sensible
SIR.22.4	she will get a good husband,
SIR.22.4	but a shameless girl
SIR.22.4	only brings her father pain.
SIR.22.5	If a woman insults her father
SIR.22.5	and her husband,
SIR.22.5	they will be disgraced
SIR.22.5	and in return
SIR.22.5	will humiliate her.
SIR.22.6	Picking the wrong time
SIR.22.6	to criticize your children
SIR.22.6	is like playing happy music
SIR.22.6	at a funeral,
SIR.22.6	but punishment and correction
SIR.22.6	are always wise.
SIR.22.7	Bring up your children well
SIR.22.7	and no one will guess
SIR.22.7	you were poor as a child.
SIR.22.8	But rude and arrogant children
SIR.22.8	are a disgrace
SIR.22.8	to a good family.
SIR.22.9	Just try to wake someone
SIR.22.9	from deep sleep,
SIR.22.9	to fix shattered pottery,
SIR.22.9	or to teach fools!
SIR.22.10	Tell them a story,
SIR.22.10	and they will doze off;
SIR.22.10	and afterwards, they will ask,
SIR.22.10	“So what's your point?”
SIR.22.11	Mourn for the dead,
SIR.22.11	who rest in darkness,
SIR.22.11	but weep even more for fools,
SIR.22.11	doomed to live
SIR.22.11	in the darkness of stupidity.
SIR.22.12	you mourn seven days,
SIR.22.12	but you mourn for ungodly fools
SIR.22.12	until the day they die.
SIR.22.13	To avoid lots of problems
SIR.22.13	and have a peaceful life,
SIR.22.13	stay away from stupid people
SIR.22.13	and do not talk to them.
SIR.22.13	When a wet dog shakes itself,
SIR.22.13	water flies everywhere,
SIR.22.13	but humans who have no sense
SIR.22.13	splatter everyone nearby
SIR.22.13	with troubles.
SIR.22.14	A fool is a heavier burden
SIR.22.14	than a load of lead,
SIR.22.15	or a bag of sand or salt,
SIR.22.15	or a lump of iron ore.
SIR.22.16	An earthquake cannot loosen
SIR.22.16	a wooden beam set firmly
SIR.22.16	in the walls of a building,
SIR.22.16	and no crisis can shake you up
SIR.22.16	if you have prepared your mind
SIR.22.16	and decided what you must do.
SIR.22.17	A mind that thinks
SIR.22.17	and reasons well
SIR.22.17	is like a smooth wall
SIR.22.17	decorated with carvings.
SIR.22.18	But foolish cowards
SIR.22.18	will not stand firm
SIR.22.18	when fearsome disaster hits,
SIR.22.18	just as small rocks are blown
SIR.22.18	from the top of a vineyard wall
SIR.22.18	by the wind.
SIR.22.19	Poke someone in the eye
SIR.22.19	and they will shed tears;
SIR.22.19	but wound their heart
SIR.22.19	and they will show deep pain.
SIR.22.20	You can throw stones
SIR.22.20	to frighten birds away,
SIR.22.20	and you can end a friendship
SIR.22.20	by tossing insults.
SIR.22.21	Threaten a friend with a sword,
SIR.22.21	and you can still hope
SIR.22.21	the friendship will heal.
SIR.22.22	And you can argue with friends
SIR.22.22	and later, win them back.
SIR.22.22	But if you are arrogant
SIR.22.22	and insult them,
SIR.22.22	if you tell their secrets
SIR.22.22	or harm them
SIR.22.22	when they trusted you,
SIR.22.22	they will be gone for good.
SIR.22.23	Earn the trust of your neighbors
SIR.22.23	when they are poor,
SIR.22.23	and if they become wealthy
SIR.22.23	you can celebrate with them.
SIR.22.23	Be a true friend
SIR.22.23	when they have troubles,
SIR.22.23	and later they will share
SIR.22.23	their inheritance with you.
SIR.22.24	When you smell smoke
SIR.22.24	you will soon see flames,
SIR.22.24	and when you hear insults,
SIR.22.24	you will soon see murder.
SIR.22.25	I will never be ashamed
SIR.22.25	to protect my friends,
SIR.22.25	and I will always be there
SIR.22.25	when I am needed.
SIR.22.26	But if they turn and harm me,
SIR.22.26	all who find out
SIR.22.26	will be on their guard
SIR.22.26	against them.
SIR.22.27	Our Lord, help me to be careful
SIR.22.27	in everything I say,
SIR.22.27	so that my mouth
SIR.22.27	will not be my downfall.
SIR.23.1	You are my Father
SIR.23.1	and rule my life—
SIR.23.1	don't let my mouth
SIR.23.1	control my destiny
SIR.23.1	and bring me down.
SIR.23.2	Please send wisdom
SIR.23.2	to whip my thoughts
SIR.23.2	and train my mind,
SIR.23.2	to tell me when I have sinned,
SIR.23.2	and to correct me
SIR.23.2	when I am wrong.
SIR.23.3	Otherwise, I will sin more often
SIR.23.3	and make more mistakes,
SIR.23.3	allowing my enemies
SIR.23.3	to destroy me and celebrate.
SIR.23.4	Our Lord, you are God;
SIR.23.4	you gave me life.
SIR.23.4	Don't let me look with arrogance
SIR.23.4	at other people.
SIR.23.5	Help me not to want things
SIR.23.5	that are not rightfully mine.
SIR.23.6	And don't let me be controlled
SIR.23.6	by shameless desires
SIR.23.6	for food or sex
SIR.23.6	or anything else.
SIR.23.7	Students, if you listen to me
SIR.23.7	and control what you say,
SIR.23.7	your words cannot trap you.
SIR.23.8	Sinners are caught
SIR.23.8	when they talk too much,
SIR.23.8	and the arrogant are tripped up
SIR.23.8	because they insult others.
SIR.23.9	of using God's name
SIR.23.9	when you make promises.
SIR.23.10	Every time you do this,
SIR.23.10	God starts watching you closely
SIR.23.10	as a master watches a slave,
SIR.23.10	and he will notice all your sins
SIR.23.10	and punish you for them.
SIR.23.11	The wicked make promises
SIR.23.11	with God as their witness,
SIR.23.11	but when a promise is broken,
SIR.23.11	they just explain
SIR.23.11	that it was made by mistake.
SIR.23.11	Or they forget it on purpose,
SIR.23.11	which means that they
SIR.23.11	are twice as guilty.
SIR.23.11	And if they lied in God's name,
SIR.23.11	they will not be forgiven
SIR.23.11	and their family is doomed.
SIR.23.11	* 
SIR.23.12	Vulgar talk is sinful
SIR.23.12	and deadly.
SIR.23.12	Godly people do not enjoy sin,
SIR.23.12	so they don't use evil words,
SIR.23.12	and I pray that none
SIR.23.12	will ever be heard in Israel.
SIR.23.13	Avoid sin
SIR.23.13	by training your mouth
SIR.23.13	not to use bad language,
SIR.23.14	and always remember
SIR.23.14	your parents will be honored
SIR.23.14	if you behave properly.
SIR.23.14	Then when you meet
SIR.23.14	with important people,
SIR.23.14	you won't get excited
SIR.23.14	and start talking like a fool
SIR.23.14	and end up wishing
SIR.23.14	you had never been born.
SIR.23.15	As long as you are in the habit
SIR.23.15	of insulting others,
SIR.23.15	you will always be a fool.
SIR.23.16	Three kinds of sinners
SIR.23.16	bring down God's anger:
SIR.23.16	first are those who always burn
SIR.23.16	with desire for sex.
SIR.23.16	Their desire is a flame
SIR.23.16	that must burn itself out.
SIR.23.16	Next are those
SIR.23.16	who won't stop having sex
SIR.23.16	with a near relative.
SIR.23.16	God will send fire
SIR.23.16	to destroy them!
SIR.23.17	Last are those who have sex
SIR.23.17	with anyone they can
SIR.23.17	and will do so
SIR.23.17	until they die.
SIR.23.18	A man unfaithful to his wife
SIR.23.18	says to himself,
SIR.23.18	“It's dark outside,
SIR.23.18	and no one can see me here
SIR.23.18	inside the house.
SIR.23.18	Why worry, anyway?
SIR.23.18	God will forgive me.”
SIR.23.19	People like that are only afraid
SIR.23.19	of being seen by others
SIR.23.19	and forget that God's eyes shine
SIR.23.19	ten thousand times brighter
SIR.23.19	than the sun.
SIR.23.19	He can see every hidden place
SIR.23.19	in our lives.
SIR.23.20	He knew all things
SIR.23.20	before he created them,
SIR.23.20	just as he knows them now.
SIR.23.21	So unfaithful husbands
SIR.23.21	will be caught
SIR.23.21	when they suspect nothing
SIR.23.21	and will be punished
SIR.23.21	in the city streets.
SIR.23.22	If an unfaithful wife
SIR.23.22	has a child by another man,
SIR.23.22	she will be punished.
SIR.23.23	She has broken God's Law
SIR.23.23	and sinned against her husband
SIR.23.23	by having sex with another man
SIR.23.23	and giving birth to his child.
SIR.23.24	She will be put on trial
SIR.23.24	in a town meeting,
SIR.23.24	and she will be punished.
SIR.23.24	Even her children will suffer,
SIR.23.25	because they will be rejected
SIR.23.25	by the people of the town.
SIR.23.26	Her shame will never be erased,
SIR.23.26	and people will curse
SIR.23.26	when they remember her.
SIR.23.27	But they will be reminded
SIR.23.27	that it is always best
SIR.23.27	to fear the Lord
SIR.23.27	and obey his commands.
SIR.24.1	Wisdom sings her own praise
SIR.24.1	and tells her greatness
SIR.24.2	to those who worship the Lord
SIR.24.2	and to the Lord's armies
SIR.24.2	in heaven.
SIR.24.3	And this is what she says:
SIR.24.3	I came from the mouth
SIR.24.3	of God Most High
SIR.24.3	and like a mist I moved
SIR.24.3	over the earth.
SIR.24.4	and my throne was a cloud.
SIR.24.5	Only I could travel
SIR.24.5	around the horizon
SIR.24.5	and walk in ocean depths.
SIR.24.6	I ruled every nation,
SIR.24.6	the land, and the sea.
SIR.24.7	But where could I find
SIR.24.7	a place to settle down?
SIR.24.7	In what nation should I live?
SIR.24.8	Then the Creator of the world
SIR.24.8	gave me a command
SIR.24.8	telling me to set up my tent
SIR.24.8	among the descendants of Jacob,
SIR.24.8	the people of Israel.
SIR.24.9	He created me ages ago,
SIR.24.9	before time began,
SIR.24.9	and I will never die.
SIR.24.10	I served in his sacred tent,
SIR.24.10	and later in the temple
SIR.24.10	in Zion.
SIR.24.11	He gave me a resting place
SIR.24.11	in Jerusalem, the city he loves,
SIR.24.11	and this is where I rule.
SIR.24.12	Here, I put down roots
SIR.24.12	among the glorious people
SIR.24.12	who belong to the Lord.
SIR.24.13	I grew tall, like a cedar tree
SIR.24.13	in Lebanon
SIR.24.13	or a cypress on Mount Hermon;
SIR.24.14	like a palm tree at En-Gedi,
SIR.24.14	or the roses in Jericho;
SIR.24.14	like a beautiful olive tree
SIR.24.14	in a field,
SIR.24.14	or like an evergreen.
SIR.24.15	My perfume smelled sweet
SIR.24.15	like the spices cinnamon and cane
SIR.24.15	mixed with fine myrrh,
SIR.24.15	or like smoke in the sacred tent
SIR.24.15	from the incense of galbanum,
SIR.24.15	onycha, and stacte.
SIR.24.16	I spread out my branches,
SIR.24.16	beautiful and graceful,
SIR.24.16	like a giant oak,
SIR.24.17	and like a grapevine,
SIR.24.17	they grew buds and blossoms,
SIR.24.17	and finally clusters of rich,
SIR.24.17	sweet fruit.
SIR.24.18	Beautiful love is my child,
SIR.24.18	and so are fear and knowledge
SIR.24.18	and hope that trusts God,
SIR.24.18	and he gives me and my children
SIR.24.18	to his own people.
SIR.24.19	So come, if you want,
SIR.24.19	and enjoy my fruit
SIR.24.19	until you are full.
SIR.24.20	I am sweeter than honey
SIR.24.20	straight from the honeycomb,
SIR.24.20	and the sweet taste will remain
SIR.24.20	even when you have finished.
SIR.24.21	But the more of me
SIR.24.21	that you eat and drink,
SIR.24.21	the more you will want.
SIR.24.22	Obey me and let me work
SIR.24.22	in your life,
SIR.24.22	and you will never sin
SIR.24.22	or be disgraced.
SIR.24.23	The wisdom of God Most High
SIR.24.23	is the Book of the Law
SIR.24.23	of Moses,
SIR.24.23	the agreement God made
SIR.24.23	with our ancestors
SIR.24.23	and gives to each new generation
SIR.24.23	as an inheritance.
SIR.24.24	Always stay close
SIR.24.24	to the Lord All-Powerful, and he
SIR.24.24	will give you strength.
SIR.24.24	The Lord is the only true God—
SIR.24.24	he alone can rescue.
SIR.24.24	* 
SIR.24.25	God's wisdom and understanding
SIR.24.25	overflow from his Law
SIR.24.25	just as in early springtime,
SIR.24.25	the Tigris and Pishon Rivers,
SIR.24.26	the Euphrates and the Jordan,
SIR.24.26	overflow their banks.
SIR.24.27	God's teachings flood the land
SIR.24.27	like the Nile River
SIR.24.27	in early fall.
SIR.24.28	The first human did not know
SIR.24.28	Wisdom very well,
SIR.24.28	nor will the last one,
SIR.24.29	because her thoughts
SIR.24.29	are wider than the ocean,
SIR.24.29	and her advice is deeper
SIR.24.29	than the sea.
SIR.24.30	I thought of myself
SIR.24.30	as a small canal
SIR.24.30	from the river of God's Wisdom
SIR.24.30	to my garden,
SIR.24.31	bringing water for my flowers
SIR.24.31	and fruit trees.
SIR.24.31	But soon this canal
SIR.24.31	became wide as a river
SIR.24.31	and then as the sea.
SIR.24.32	And so, I will teach wisdom
SIR.24.32	and make it shine like sunrise,
SIR.24.32	clearly seen from far away.
SIR.24.33	My words flow quickly,
SIR.24.33	and like a prophet
SIR.24.33	I will leave them
SIR.24.33	for generations not yet born.
SIR.24.34	You see, my work hasn't been
SIR.24.34	for myself alone,
SIR.24.34	but for everyone who desires
SIR.24.34	to find Wisdom.
SIR.25.1	Three things
SIR.25.1	make me happy
SIR.25.1	and are beautiful to the Lord
SIR.25.1	and to humans:
SIR.25.1	a family that agrees,
SIR.25.1	neighbors who are friends,
SIR.25.1	and a happy marriage.
SIR.25.2	But I hate three kinds of people
SIR.25.2	and the way they live:
SIR.25.2	the poor that brag,
SIR.25.2	the rich that tell lies,
SIR.25.2	and the old that are foolish
SIR.25.2	and unfaithful in marriage.
SIR.25.3	If you don't start learning
SIR.25.3	when you are young,
SIR.25.3	you will have no wisdom
SIR.25.3	when you grow old.
SIR.25.4	Good sense and sound advice
SIR.25.4	are beautiful in those
SIR.25.4	whose hair is now gray.
SIR.25.5	Wisdom and understanding
SIR.25.5	are just right for the old
SIR.25.5	and honorable.
SIR.25.6	They have seen so many things,
SIR.25.6	but they only boast
SIR.25.6	that they fear the Lord.
SIR.25.7	Ten kinds of people
SIR.25.7	can be called truly happy:
SIR.25.7	those who enjoy their children,
SIR.25.7	and those who live long enough
SIR.25.7	to see their enemies fall;
SIR.25.8	men who have sensible wives,
SIR.25.8	farmers that do not hitch
SIR.25.8	a donkey and an ox
SIR.25.8	to one plow,
SIR.25.8	people who don't sin
SIR.25.8	by what they say,
SIR.25.8	and servants whose masters
SIR.25.8	have as much ability
SIR.25.8	as the servants do;
SIR.25.9	people with common sense,
SIR.25.9	and those who speak to others
SIR.25.9	who are really listening.
SIR.25.9	* 
SIR.25.10	The person who finds wisdom
SIR.25.10	finds great happiness,
SIR.25.10	but happiest of all is the one
SIR.25.10	who fears the Lord,
SIR.25.11	because fearing him
SIR.25.11	is more important
SIR.25.11	than anything else.
SIR.25.12	And it is the first step
SIR.25.12	in loving him,
SIR.25.12	just as having faith
SIR.25.12	is the first step in becoming
SIR.25.12	one of his followers.
SIR.25.13	The breaking of your heart
SIR.25.13	by an evil woman
SIR.25.13	is the most painful
SIR.25.13	of all injuries.
SIR.25.14	No suffering seems worse
SIR.25.14	than when an enemy hates you
SIR.25.14	and takes revenge,
SIR.25.15	but a woman's anger is strongest,
SIR.25.15	just as snakes have
SIR.25.15	the strongest poison.
SIR.25.16	I would be happier to live
SIR.25.16	with a lion and a dragon
SIR.25.16	than to be married
SIR.25.16	to an evil woman.
SIR.25.17	An evil woman's face is changed
SIR.25.17	into something dark,
SIR.25.17	like the face of a bear.
SIR.25.18	Her husband is depressed,
SIR.25.18	sighing bitterly
SIR.25.18	even among his friends.
SIR.25.19	The sins of men are small
SIR.25.19	compared to those of women,
SIR.25.19	and I pray that women who sin
SIR.25.19	will be severely punished.
SIR.25.20	It is easier for an old person
SIR.25.20	to climb a hill of sand
SIR.25.20	than for a quiet man to live
SIR.25.20	with a chattering wife.
SIR.25.21	Do not be taken captive
SIR.25.21	by the beauty of a woman,
SIR.25.21	and don't desire her wealth.
SIR.25.22	When the wife's possessions
SIR.25.22	support the family,
SIR.25.22	their home will be filled
SIR.25.22	with anger, insults,
SIR.25.22	and shame.
SIR.25.23	An evil wife brings no happiness
SIR.25.23	to her husband;
SIR.25.23	instead, she makes him sad
SIR.25.23	and depressed;
SIR.25.23	she breaks his heart,
SIR.25.23	and he is afraid
SIR.25.23	to make any decisions.
SIR.25.24	Sin began with the first woman,
SIR.25.24	and because of her
SIR.25.24	we all must die.
SIR.25.25	Do not let water leak
SIR.25.25	from your storage jars,
SIR.25.25	and if your wife is evil,
SIR.25.25	don't let her talk in public.
SIR.25.26	If she will not obey you,
SIR.25.26	then get a divorce.
SIR.26.1	A man who is married
SIR.26.1	to a good woman
SIR.26.1	is happy, and he will live
SIR.26.1	twice as long.
SIR.26.2	If a wife has courage,
SIR.26.2	her husband will find happiness
SIR.26.2	and live a peaceful life.
SIR.26.3	A good wife is the best gift
SIR.26.3	given by the Lord
SIR.26.3	to those men who fear him,
SIR.26.4	and whether such a man
SIR.26.4	is rich or poor,
SIR.26.4	the smile on his face
SIR.26.4	comes from a happy heart.
SIR.26.5	I am always extra careful
SIR.26.5	when I hear ugly gossip
SIR.26.5	being repeated in the city,
SIR.26.5	or when a mob comes together,
SIR.26.5	or when the innocent
SIR.26.5	are falsely accused.
SIR.26.5	I would rather die than be part
SIR.26.5	of those three things.
SIR.26.5	But a fourth is even worse:
SIR.26.6	to have two wives,
SIR.26.6	with one of them being jealous
SIR.26.6	of the other.
SIR.26.6	She can only bring heartache
SIR.26.6	and sorrow,
SIR.26.6	as her words cut the family
SIR.26.6	to pieces.
SIR.26.7	To marry an evil woman
SIR.26.7	is to hold a scorpion
SIR.26.7	in your hand,
SIR.26.7	or to wear an ox-yoke
SIR.26.7	that rubs your shoulders raw.
SIR.26.8	When a wife gets drunk
SIR.26.8	she can be unfaithful,
SIR.26.8	and then her husband's anger
SIR.26.8	will explode.
SIR.26.9	You know a wife is unfaithful
SIR.26.9	if her eyes have a look
SIR.26.9	of invitation.
SIR.26.9	* 
SIR.26.10	If your daughter is rebellious
SIR.26.10	and wants her own way,
SIR.26.10	watch her closely
SIR.26.11	and don't be surprised
SIR.26.11	if she sins against you
SIR.26.11	the first chance she gets.
SIR.26.12	She will try to have sex
SIR.26.12	with every man she sees,
SIR.26.12	just as thirsty travelers
SIR.26.12	will drink any water
SIR.26.12	they can find.
SIR.26.13	A gracious wife is pleasing
SIR.26.13	to her husband,
SIR.26.13	and her cooking skills
SIR.26.13	keep him fat.
SIR.26.14	Her silence is a gift
SIR.26.14	from the Lord,
SIR.26.14	and her self-control
SIR.26.14	is without price.
SIR.26.15	Her modesty is the crown
SIR.26.15	on all her graces;
SIR.26.15	her faithfulness to her husband
SIR.26.15	has value beyond measure.
SIR.26.16	She has organized her home,
SIR.26.16	and her beauty there
SIR.26.16	is like the sun as it rises
SIR.26.16	in the Lord's heaven.
SIR.26.17	A lovely face on a good figure
SIR.26.17	shines like the lamps
SIR.26.17	on the sacred lampstand,
SIR.26.18	and shapely legs with firm feet
SIR.26.18	are like golden columns
SIR.26.18	resting on silver bases.
SIR.26.19	Students, when you come of age,
SIR.26.19	stay away from immoral women
SIR.26.19	and stay healthy.
SIR.26.20	To find a good wife
SIR.26.20	is to find a good field
SIR.26.20	where you can plant
SIR.26.20	your own seed,
SIR.26.20	knowing that it will produce
SIR.26.20	a good harvest.
SIR.26.21	And as your children grow,
SIR.26.21	they will have confidence
SIR.26.21	in your family line
SIR.26.21	and will become successful.
SIR.26.22	A prostitute is worth
SIR.26.22	less than spit,
SIR.26.22	and affairs with married women
SIR.26.22	are deadly.
SIR.26.23	Reject God's Law,
SIR.26.23	and he will give you
SIR.26.23	a godless wife.
SIR.26.23	But if you fear the Lord,
SIR.26.23	your wife will be
SIR.26.23	faithful to him.
SIR.26.24	A shameless wife is vulgar
SIR.26.24	in public,
SIR.26.24	but a good woman is modest,
SIR.26.24	even alone with her husband.
SIR.26.25	If a wife does what she pleases,
SIR.26.25	she is no better than a dog,
SIR.26.25	but if she is ashamed
SIR.26.25	to do wrong,
SIR.26.25	she will fear the Lord.
SIR.26.26	Everyone can tell
SIR.26.26	that a wife is wise
SIR.26.26	if she honors her husband,
SIR.26.26	but if she is proud and refuses,
SIR.26.26	they will see she is ungodly.
SIR.26.26	Yes, a man who is married
SIR.26.26	to a good woman
SIR.26.26	is happy, and he will live
SIR.26.26	twice as long.
SIR.26.27	But the constant talking
SIR.26.27	of a loud wife
SIR.26.27	is a trumpet signal
SIR.26.27	for a battle to begin,
SIR.26.27	and her family will live
SIR.26.27	in the chaos of war.
SIR.26.28	It makes me terribly sad
SIR.26.28	when the rich become poor
SIR.26.28	or the wise are insulted.
SIR.26.28	But I get angry
SIR.26.28	if those who do right
SIR.26.28	start doing wrong.
SIR.26.28	The Lord will punish them
SIR.26.28	with a violent death.
SIR.26.29	It is almost impossible
SIR.26.29	to succeed in business
SIR.26.29	and still be honest.
SIR.27.1	People sin
SIR.27.1	when they try to get rich,
SIR.27.1	and they convince themselves
SIR.27.1	they are not being dishonest.
SIR.27.2	But sin is stuck tightly
SIR.27.2	between buying and selling,
SIR.27.2	just like a wooden peg
SIR.27.2	hammered between two stones
SIR.27.2	in a wall.
SIR.27.3	And if you disobey the Lord,
SIR.27.3	your home
SIR.27.3	will soon be destroyed.
SIR.27.4	Impurities can easily be seen
SIR.27.4	after flour is sifted
SIR.27.4	and after someone speaks.
SIR.27.5	The quality of a clay dish
SIR.27.5	is seen in the heat
SIR.27.5	of the pottery furnace,
SIR.27.5	just as our true character
SIR.27.5	is seen in what we say.
SIR.27.6	a tree has received,
SIR.27.6	and our words show the care
SIR.27.6	we have given to our minds.
SIR.27.7	So don't start praising people,
SIR.27.7	until you hear what they say.
SIR.27.8	Make fairness your goal;
SIR.27.8	you will reach it
SIR.27.8	and receive great honor.
SIR.27.9	Just as birds of the same kind
SIR.27.9	come together in a flock,
SIR.27.9	people will be honest with you,
SIR.27.9	if you are honest with them.
SIR.27.10	But sin is watching like a lion
SIR.27.10	and is ready to gobble you up
SIR.27.10	if you do evil.
SIR.27.11	Good people always speak wisely,
SIR.27.11	but you never can tell
SIR.27.11	what a fool will say next.
SIR.27.12	Don't waste your time
SIR.27.12	listening to stupid people;
SIR.27.12	spend it with those
SIR.27.12	who know how to think.
SIR.27.13	It is disgusting to listen to fools
SIR.27.13	laughing about their sins.
SIR.27.13	* 
SIR.27.14	Their cursing and arguing
SIR.27.14	makes your hair stand on end
SIR.27.14	and your ears ache.
SIR.27.15	But fools are too proud
SIR.27.15	to stop sinning,
SIR.27.15	until someone gets hurt.
SIR.27.16	or like you anymore
SIR.27.16	if you can't keep a secret.
SIR.27.17	If you don't tell their secrets,
SIR.27.17	your friends will know
SIR.27.17	that you really like them.
SIR.27.17	But if you tell their secrets,
SIR.27.17	they won't want you around,
SIR.27.18	and your friendship is as dead
SIR.27.18	as a soldier
SIR.27.18	killed by the enemy.
SIR.27.19	It is gone for good,
SIR.27.19	like a captive bird
SIR.27.19	that has been set free
SIR.27.20	or a deer that has escaped
SIR.27.20	from a trap.
SIR.27.20	So don't bother trying
SIR.27.20	to get back that friendship.
SIR.27.21	Wounds can be bandaged
SIR.27.21	and insults forgiven,
SIR.27.21	but nothing can heal the harm
SIR.27.21	of telling someone's secret.
SIR.27.22	Stay away from those who wink
SIR.27.22	and plan to deceive others.
SIR.27.23	They tell you how great you are
SIR.27.23	and how well you speak,
SIR.27.23	but later, they twist your words
SIR.27.23	to make you look bad.
SIR.27.24	I hate people like them
SIR.27.24	more than anything else,
SIR.27.24	and even the Lord hates them.
SIR.27.25	Striking a friend is the same
SIR.27.25	as throwing a stone
SIR.27.25	straight up in the air—
SIR.27.25	you will be the one
SIR.27.25	who gets hurt.
SIR.27.26	And you will get caught
SIR.27.26	in traps that you set
SIR.27.26	to cheat others.
SIR.27.27	No one seems to realize
SIR.27.27	that evil always returns
SIR.27.27	to the one who does it.
SIR.27.28	Proud people insult others,
SIR.27.28	but revenge will follow them
SIR.27.28	like a lion stalking a victim.
SIR.27.29	When God's people
SIR.27.29	are in trouble,
SIR.27.29	those who make fun of them
SIR.27.29	will die in terrible pain,
SIR.27.29	like an animal in a trap.
SIR.27.30	Taking revenge in anger
SIR.27.30	is disgusting—yet sinners
SIR.27.30	just won't give it up.
SIR.28.1	The Lord keeps a record
SIR.28.1	of those who take revenge
SIR.28.1	and he will punish them
SIR.28.1	for their sins.
SIR.28.2	and when you pray,
SIR.28.2	God will forgive you.
SIR.28.3	But don't expect
SIR.28.3	the Lord to forgive you
SIR.28.3	if you hold a grudge
SIR.28.4	or refuse to show mercy.
SIR.28.5	God won't accept sacrifices
SIR.28.5	for your sins
SIR.28.5	if you stay angry with others.
SIR.28.6	Life is too short
SIR.28.6	to waste it by being angry,
SIR.28.6	so obey God
SIR.28.6	and forgive your enemies.
SIR.28.7	Remember his commands
SIR.28.7	and his agreement with us.
SIR.28.7	Don't let the faults of others
SIR.28.7	make you angry with them.
SIR.28.8	If you control your temper,
SIR.28.8	you won't start arguments
SIR.28.8	or sin as much.
SIR.28.9	And remember, it is sinful
SIR.28.9	to start an argument
SIR.28.9	that destroys a friendship.
SIR.28.10	Stubbornness heats up
SIR.28.10	an argument,
SIR.28.10	just as adding wood
SIR.28.10	heats up a fire.
SIR.28.10	If you are rich and powerful,
SIR.28.10	you can afford
SIR.28.10	to lose your temper.
SIR.28.11	A quick temper can blaze up
SIR.28.11	and lead to murder.
SIR.28.12	Blow on a spark
SIR.28.12	and it bursts into flames;
SIR.28.12	spit on a spark
SIR.28.12	and it dies out.
SIR.28.12	In the same way, your words
SIR.28.12	can either heat up an argument
SIR.28.12	or make it cool down.
SIR.28.13	are under God's curse,
SIR.28.13	because they have brought ruin
SIR.28.13	to innocent people
SIR.28.14	and forced many others
SIR.28.14	to leave home and country.
SIR.28.14	Such talk has been the downfall
SIR.28.14	of strong cities
SIR.28.14	and powerful leaders.
SIR.28.15	Because of lies others told,
SIR.28.15	faithful, hard-working wives
SIR.28.15	have been divorced
SIR.28.15	and have lost everything
SIR.28.16	So if you want peace of mind,
SIR.28.16	don't listen to gossip!
SIR.28.17	Whips leave painful stripes
SIR.28.17	on the skin,
SIR.28.17	but cruel words break bones
SIR.28.17	deep down inside
SIR.28.18	and can be more deadly
SIR.28.18	than a sword.
SIR.28.18	* 
SIR.28.19	You should be happy
SIR.28.19	if you have never been attacked
SIR.28.19	with lies and gossip,
SIR.28.19	or felt them wrap around you
SIR.28.20	like heavy bronze chains
SIR.28.20	or a collar
SIR.28.21	Cruel words cause suffering
SIR.28.21	worse than death itself.
SIR.28.22	Although they are fiery flames,
SIR.28.22	they cannot harm
SIR.28.22	God's faithful people,
SIR.28.23	but those who reject him
SIR.28.23	will be burned to ashes.
SIR.28.23	And these cruel words
SIR.28.23	are like lions and leopards,
SIR.28.23	hunting down their victims
SIR.28.23	and tearing them apart.
SIR.28.24	You protect your land
SIR.28.24	with a hedge of thornbushes
SIR.28.24	and you keep your money
SIR.28.24	locked away safely.
SIR.28.25	Be just as careful
SIR.28.25	to guard what you say.
SIR.28.25	Always think before you speak,
SIR.28.25	and know when to be silent,
SIR.28.26	so that others cannot attack you
SIR.28.26	for what you have said.
SIR.29.1	about helping
SIR.29.1	your neighbors;
SIR.29.1	have mercy and lend them money
SIR.29.1	when they truly need it.
SIR.29.2	If others lend you money,
SIR.29.2	pay them back,
SIR.29.2	and don't be late!
SIR.29.3	If you keep your promises
SIR.29.3	to pay what you owe,
SIR.29.3	others will be glad
SIR.29.3	to lend you what you need.
SIR.29.4	Many think what they borrow
SIR.29.4	is theirs to keep,
SIR.29.4	and this causes trouble
SIR.29.4	when others try to help them.
SIR.29.5	Those who lend money
SIR.29.5	are treated with great respect
SIR.29.5	until the time comes
SIR.29.5	for loans to be repaid.
SIR.29.5	Then all they get are excuses
SIR.29.5	and stories of hard times.
SIR.29.6	Sometimes they feel lucky
SIR.29.6	to get back half
SIR.29.6	of the money they lent.
SIR.29.6	And instead of respect,
SIR.29.6	a lender often gets nothing
SIR.29.6	but curses and angry words
SIR.29.6	from a borrower
SIR.29.6	who is robbing the lender
SIR.29.6	by not paying back the loan.
SIR.29.7	That's why many refuse to lend;
SIR.29.7	they do care about others,
SIR.29.7	but they have no desire
SIR.29.7	to be cheated.
SIR.29.8	However, give to the poor;
SIR.29.8	be quick and generous.
SIR.29.9	Obey the Lord's command—
SIR.29.9	don't refuse to help
SIR.29.9	when people are in need.
SIR.29.10	Give away your silver
SIR.29.10	to a brother or a friend;
SIR.29.10	don't hide it under a rock,
SIR.29.10	where it will rust.
SIR.29.11	Give your gold to the needy
SIR.29.11	as God Most High commands,
SIR.29.11	and you will be better off
SIR.29.11	than if you had kept it.
SIR.29.12	Your gifts to the poor
SIR.29.12	are a treasure
SIR.29.12	that will rescue you
SIR.29.12	when trouble comes,
SIR.29.13	and they give better protection
SIR.29.13	than the strongest shields
SIR.29.13	and spears.
SIR.29.14	When a friend needs a loan,
SIR.29.14	a good person will guarantee
SIR.29.14	that the loan will be repaid.
SIR.29.14	To refuse to help this friend
SIR.29.14	would be a disgrace.
SIR.29.15	And remember—if friends
SIR.29.15	have helped you this way,
SIR.29.15	they have risked all they own
SIR.29.15	to be kind * 
SIR.29.16	and rescue you.
SIR.29.16	So if they are forced to repay
SIR.29.16	what you borrowed,
SIR.29.17	you are not only ungrateful,
SIR.29.17	you are a sinner.
SIR.29.18	People of wealth and power
SIR.29.18	have often become poor
SIR.29.18	and homeless,
SIR.29.18	drifting from place to place
SIR.29.18	in foreign countries,
SIR.29.18	their wealth taken in payment
SIR.29.18	for loans they guaranteed.
SIR.29.19	Sinners want to make big profits
SIR.29.19	from guaranteed loans,
SIR.29.19	but they may get only trouble
SIR.29.19	and lawsuits in court.
SIR.29.20	Be careful! There is danger
SIR.29.20	when you guarantee a loan,
SIR.29.20	but you have to help a friend
SIR.29.20	as much as you can.
SIR.29.21	Life's most important things
SIR.29.21	are water, food, clothing,
SIR.29.21	and a home that gives you
SIR.29.21	some privacy.
SIR.29.22	It is better to be poor
SIR.29.22	in your own home,
SIR.29.22	than to live with others
SIR.29.22	and be treated to banquets.
SIR.29.23	Be content with what you have,
SIR.29.23	because you will be insulted
SIR.29.23	if you live off others.
SIR.29.24	You will always be miserable
SIR.29.24	and will not dare say a word,
SIR.29.24	if you have to depend on others
SIR.29.24	for food and a place to sleep.
SIR.29.25	You will become their servant,
SIR.29.25	and instead of thanking you,
SIR.29.25	they will say,
SIR.29.26	“Stranger, set the table!”
SIR.29.26	Or, “I'm still hungry—
SIR.29.26	give me your food.”
SIR.29.27	Finally they will tell you to leave
SIR.29.27	so they can give your room
SIR.29.27	to a relative
SIR.29.27	or some important guest.
SIR.29.28	Such comments are insulting
SIR.29.28	to a sensitive person,
SIR.29.28	just like those of a lender
SIR.29.28	demanding payment of a loan.
SIR.30.1	Parents show love
SIR.30.1	for their children
SIR.30.1	by spanking them
SIR.30.1	whenever they do wrong.
SIR.30.1	Later those parents will be glad
SIR.30.1	to see their children
SIR.30.1	grow into fine adults.
SIR.30.2	If parents correct a child,
SIR.30.2	they will someday boast
SIR.30.2	about how much help
SIR.30.2	that child has been to them.
SIR.30.3	Parents who give their children
SIR.30.3	an education
SIR.30.3	make their enemies jealous
SIR.30.3	and can boast to friends.
SIR.30.3	* 
SIR.30.4	These parents have no regrets
SIR.30.4	when they die,
SIR.30.4	and they live on
SIR.30.4	in their children,
SIR.30.5	who brought them such joy.
SIR.30.6	Then it is up to the children
SIR.30.6	to take revenge
SIR.30.6	on their parents' enemies,
SIR.30.6	and to be kind
SIR.30.6	to their parents' friends.
SIR.30.7	If you spoil your children,
SIR.30.7	you will have to put bandages
SIR.30.7	on the wounds they will get,
SIR.30.7	and you will shake with fear
SIR.30.7	every time you hear shouting.
SIR.30.8	That's why you
SIR.30.8	must correct them,
SIR.30.8	so they will not be as stubborn
SIR.30.8	as unbroken horses.
SIR.30.8	* 
SIR.30.9	If you give children
SIR.30.9	everything they desire
SIR.30.9	and laugh when they sin,
SIR.30.10	they will end up giving you
SIR.30.10	sadness, terror, and pain.
SIR.30.11	Don't let them do
SIR.30.11	just anything they want,
SIR.30.11	but correct their mistakes.
SIR.30.12	Break their stubbornness
SIR.30.12	by whipping them
SIR.30.12	while they are young,
SIR.30.12	or else they will disobey you
SIR.30.12	and bring you deep sorrow.
SIR.30.13	Take care to discipline them,
SIR.30.13	so they will not disgrace you
SIR.30.13	when they are older.
SIR.30.14	I would rather be poor,
SIR.30.14	yet healthy and strong,
SIR.30.14	than to be rich and sickly.
SIR.30.15	To have your health
SIR.30.15	and a good attitude
SIR.30.15	is better than gold
SIR.30.15	and infinite riches.
SIR.30.16	No amount of money
SIR.30.16	can compare with health
SIR.30.16	or bring happiness
SIR.30.16	deep inside your heart.
SIR.30.17	Death is better
SIR.30.17	than a life of constant pain
SIR.30.17	and sickness.
SIR.30.18	If a fine dinner is served,
SIR.30.18	but the guests
SIR.30.18	are too sick to eat,
SIR.30.18	the dinner will go to waste,
SIR.30.18	like food placed on a grave
SIR.30.19	or like a sacrifice to an idol,
SIR.30.19	which cannot eat or smell.
SIR.30.19	If the Lord punishes people
SIR.30.19	by making them sick,
SIR.30.20	they can only stare at food
SIR.30.20	and groan like a young man
SIR.30.20	unable to have sex
SIR.30.20	who holds a virgin
SIR.30.20	in his arms.
SIR.30.21	or look for reasons
SIR.30.21	to be upset.
SIR.30.22	Joy and happiness will help you
SIR.30.22	to live longer.
SIR.30.23	So enjoy life and forget sorrow,
SIR.30.23	because sorrow never helps,
SIR.30.23	and it has destroyed many.
SIR.30.24	Jealousy and anger
SIR.30.24	will cut your life short,
SIR.30.24	and worrying makes you old
SIR.30.24	before your time.
SIR.30.25	If you are cheerful at meals,
SIR.30.25	the food you eat
SIR.30.25	will do you more good.
SIR.31.1	The rich lie awake at night
SIR.31.1	worrying about their money,
SIR.31.1	and they waste away
SIR.31.1	from lack of rest.
SIR.31.2	It is hard to fall asleep
SIR.31.2	when you are very sick
SIR.31.2	or worried about money.
SIR.31.3	The rich work hard
SIR.31.3	and get richer,
SIR.31.3	then they rest in luxury.
SIR.31.4	But the poor work hard
SIR.31.4	and barely earn a living,
SIR.31.4	and if they rest,
SIR.31.4	they become even poorer.
SIR.31.5	Some people love gold
SIR.31.5	and aim to make big profits,
SIR.31.5	and they will be led to do wrong
SIR.31.5	instead of right.
SIR.31.6	Because of gold,
SIR.31.6	many lives have been ruined
SIR.31.6	or have ended in destruction.
SIR.31.7	Money controls those fools
SIR.31.7	who worship it.
SIR.31.8	God will bless those rich people
SIR.31.8	who do only what is right
SIR.31.8	and don't try to get richer.
SIR.31.9	If you ever find such people,
SIR.31.9	you should honor them
SIR.31.9	for doing the impossible.
SIR.31.10	When tested by money,
SIR.31.10	who can always do right?
SIR.31.10	When people could cheat
SIR.31.10	to get more money
SIR.31.10	but instead are honest,
SIR.31.10	they have something
SIR.31.10	to boast about.
SIR.31.11	The community will honor them
SIR.31.11	for the kind things they do,
SIR.31.11	and their wealth will grow.
SIR.31.12	When you go to a banquet,
SIR.31.12	don't stuff yourself
SIR.31.12	just because so much food
SIR.31.12	is on the table.
SIR.31.13	Some people's eyes
SIR.31.13	want everything they see.
SIR.31.13	Is anything more evil?
SIR.31.13	Such eyes will have plenty
SIR.31.13	of tears.
SIR.31.14	Don't reach out and grab
SIR.31.14	the food you want
SIR.31.14	or push others aside.
SIR.31.15	Be thoughtful of others—
SIR.31.15	they have feelings too.
SIR.31.16	Eat what is served,
SIR.31.16	but you won't be welcome
SIR.31.16	if you gobble it up
SIR.31.16	like an animal.
SIR.31.17	Show good manners;
SIR.31.17	stop eating before others do.
SIR.31.17	If you keep on eating,
SIR.31.17	they will be offended.
SIR.31.18	And in a large group of people,
SIR.31.18	don't be the first one
SIR.31.18	to reach for the serving dish.
SIR.31.19	Train yourself to be satisfied
SIR.31.19	with a little food,
SIR.31.19	and later, in bed,
SIR.31.19	you will not be in pain
SIR.31.19	when you try to breathe.
SIR.31.20	You will sleep well
SIR.31.20	and wake up early,
SIR.31.20	feeling good.
SIR.31.20	But overeating causes cramps,
SIR.31.20	as well as an upset stomach
SIR.31.20	and sleepless nights.
SIR.31.21	If your host makes you overeat,
SIR.31.21	leave the table and vomit—
SIR.31.21	you will feel much better.
SIR.31.22	Listen to me! Pay attention,
SIR.31.22	and later on,
SIR.31.22	you will thank me.
SIR.31.22	Don't try to eat
SIR.31.22	and you will stay healthy.
SIR.31.23	It is right to honor those
SIR.31.23	who are generous with food
SIR.31.23	at their dinner parties.
SIR.31.24	But the whole town is right
SIR.31.24	to complain about a host
SIR.31.24	who gives only a snack.
SIR.31.25	Wine has destroyed many lives,
SIR.31.25	and heavy drinking is no way
SIR.31.25	to prove you are strong.
SIR.31.26	The strength of iron is seen
SIR.31.26	when it is heated,
SIR.31.26	then dipped in water.
SIR.31.26	And people show their arrogance
SIR.31.26	when they argue
SIR.31.26	after drinking wine.
SIR.31.27	A little wine is refreshing,
SIR.31.27	and to live without wine
SIR.31.27	is hardly living at all.
SIR.31.27	God created wine
SIR.31.27	to make us happy.
SIR.31.28	A little wine at the right time
SIR.31.28	helps us celebrate.
SIR.31.29	But drinking too much wine
SIR.31.29	leads us to hate others
SIR.31.29	and to take revenge.
SIR.31.30	When fools are drunk,
SIR.31.30	they become angry and fight,
SIR.31.30	but their strength is gone,
SIR.31.30	and so they get hurt.
SIR.31.31	Don't scold your friends
SIR.31.31	or be disgusted
SIR.31.31	when they drink and celebrate
SIR.31.31	at a party.
SIR.31.31	And don't make them feel bad
SIR.31.31	or upset them with a reminder
SIR.31.31	that they owe you money.
SIR.32.1	If you are placed in charge
SIR.32.1	of a dinner party,
SIR.32.1	don't try to act important.
SIR.32.1	Just make sure all the guests
SIR.32.1	have what they need
SIR.32.2	before you are seated.
SIR.32.2	Then enjoy the dinner
SIR.32.2	with everyone else,
SIR.32.2	and they will honor you
SIR.32.2	for a job well done.
SIR.32.3	If you are an older guest,
SIR.32.3	it is right for you to talk.
SIR.32.3	But be sure what you say is true,
SIR.32.3	and don't talk during the music
SIR.32.4	or other entertainment.
SIR.32.4	That is not the right time
SIR.32.4	for clever remarks.
SIR.32.4	* 
SIR.32.5	Good wine and good music
SIR.32.5	at a banquet
SIR.32.6	are like rubies and emeralds
SIR.32.6	in settings of gold.
SIR.32.7	If you are a younger guest,
SIR.32.7	don't talk unless someone
SIR.32.7	asks you a question.
SIR.32.7	Don't speak more than twice,
SIR.32.8	and say as much as you can
SIR.32.8	in as few words as possible.
SIR.32.8	This will show your knowledge
SIR.32.8	and also your self-control.
SIR.32.9	Treat important people
SIR.32.9	with proper respect,
SIR.32.9	and don't chatter on and on
SIR.32.9	if someone older is talking.
SIR.32.10	Lightning goes ahead of thunder,
SIR.32.10	and if you are humble,
SIR.32.10	you will be liked and accepted
SIR.32.10	before you even arrive.
SIR.32.11	Then later, at the proper time,
SIR.32.11	just say goodbye and go home.
SIR.32.11	Don't wait around
SIR.32.11	to be the last to leave.
SIR.32.12	At home, you can have fun
SIR.32.12	doing whatever you want—
SIR.32.12	but be careful not to sin
SIR.32.12	by speaking with arrogance.
SIR.32.13	And give thanks to your Creator,
SIR.32.13	who lets you enjoy
SIR.32.13	all the good things he made.
SIR.32.14	If you obey the Lord,
SIR.32.14	expect him to correct you,
SIR.32.14	but do your best,
SIR.32.14	and you will be accepted.
SIR.32.15	Sincerely studying God's Law
SIR.32.15	will bring contentment,
SIR.32.15	but if you are not sincere
SIR.32.15	that Law will condemn you.
SIR.32.16	If you obey the Lord,
SIR.32.16	you will be well known
SIR.32.16	for justice and fairness.
SIR.32.17	But sinners refuse
SIR.32.17	to be corrected,
SIR.32.17	and they twist the Law
SIR.32.17	so they can do
SIR.32.17	whatever they please.
SIR.32.18	A wise person can take a hint,
SIR.32.18	but even fear of great danger
SIR.32.18	won't stop an arrogant fool.
SIR.32.19	Give plenty of thought
SIR.32.19	to what you will do,
SIR.32.19	and afterwards, don't worry
SIR.32.19	about how well you did.
SIR.32.20	Don't look for trouble,
SIR.32.20	but learn from your mistakes.
SIR.32.21	It's easy to be careless
SIR.32.21	on a smooth road,
SIR.32.22	so always pay attention
SIR.32.22	to the path ahead.
SIR.32.23	Think your actions through,
SIR.32.23	and you will be able
SIR.32.23	to obey the Lord's commands.
SIR.32.24	If you believe in God's Law,
SIR.32.24	then do what it says.
SIR.32.24	Trust the Lord,
SIR.32.24	and you will have success.
SIR.33.1	If you obey him,
SIR.33.1	you will be protected
SIR.33.1	and rescued from danger.
SIR.33.2	You are wise to love God's Law,
SIR.33.2	but if you are not sincere,
SIR.33.2	you will be tossed around
SIR.33.2	like a boat in a storm.
SIR.33.3	what God has said in his Law.
SIR.33.4	If you want others to listen,
SIR.33.4	then think about what you know
SIR.33.4	and how to say it best.
SIR.33.5	Fools talk in circles
SIR.33.5	like a wheel going around.
SIR.33.6	To make fun of a friend
SIR.33.6	is to act like a horse
SIR.33.6	that snorts at anyone
SIR.33.6	who tries to ride.
SIR.33.7	Each day of the year
SIR.33.7	depends on the sun for light,
SIR.33.7	so why are some days
SIR.33.7	more important than others?
SIR.33.8	The Lord used his wisdom
SIR.33.8	and made them different.
SIR.33.8	Some have a special meaning,
SIR.33.8	others are festivals,
SIR.33.9	and some are sacred days—
SIR.33.9	but most are ordinary.
SIR.33.10	from the soil,
SIR.33.11	and the Lord used great wisdom
SIR.33.11	to make each of us different,
SIR.33.11	with different destinies.
SIR.33.12	He blessed our ancestors
SIR.33.12	and made them great,
SIR.33.12	and he even let some
SIR.33.12	be his holy priests.
SIR.33.12	But he put a curse
SIR.33.12	on the nations of Canaan—
SIR.33.12	they were defeated
SIR.33.12	and forced to leave the land.
SIR.33.13	Humans become
SIR.33.13	what the Creator chooses,
SIR.33.13	just as clay is shaped
SIR.33.13	by the hands of the potter.
SIR.33.14	There are many opposites—
SIR.33.14	good and evil, life and death,
SIR.33.14	sinners and God's people.
SIR.33.15	You can see that God Most High
SIR.33.15	made everything the opposite
SIR.33.15	of something else.
SIR.33.16	I am the last in the line
SIR.33.16	of the teachers of wisdom,
SIR.33.16	like a poor man picking grapes
SIR.33.16	after the main harvest.
SIR.33.17	But the Lord blessed me,
SIR.33.17	and I gathered enough grapes
SIR.33.17	to fill a wine-pit.
SIR.33.18	I wasn't working
SIR.33.18	just for my own good,
SIR.33.18	but to help all those
SIR.33.18	who want to learn wisdom.
SIR.33.19	So pay attention to what I say,
SIR.33.19	all you officials and leaders.
SIR.33.20	Never give anyone else power
SIR.33.20	to make decisions for you—
SIR.33.20	not your husband or wife,
SIR.33.20	and not your children,
SIR.33.20	relatives, or friends.
SIR.33.20	And don't give away property—
SIR.33.20	if you later want it returned,
SIR.33.20	you will have to beg for it.
SIR.33.21	As long as you are alive,
SIR.33.21	don't let others run your life.
SIR.33.22	It is better that your children
SIR.33.22	ask you for money
SIR.33.22	than for you to ask them.
SIR.33.23	Be the best at whatever you do,
SIR.33.23	and do only what brings honor
SIR.33.23	and not shame.
SIR.33.24	Wait until you are about to die
SIR.33.24	before giving your children
SIR.33.24	their inheritance.
SIR.33.25	If you feed your donkeys
SIR.33.25	and beat them with a stick,
SIR.33.25	they will carry their loads.
SIR.33.25	Slaves are like that—
SIR.33.25	feed and discipline them,
SIR.33.25	and they will do their work.
SIR.33.26	If you don't want trouble,
SIR.33.26	keep your slaves busy;
SIR.33.26	otherwise, they will have time
SIR.33.26	to think about becoming free.
SIR.33.27	Use collars and leather straps
SIR.33.27	to keep slaves at their work,
SIR.33.27	and punish the rebellious ones
SIR.33.27	by torturing them.
SIR.33.27	* 
SIR.33.28	Keep your slaves busy
SIR.33.28	or they will have time to think
SIR.33.29	of ways to cause trouble.
SIR.33.30	Slaves are supposed to work,
SIR.33.30	so give them something to do,
SIR.33.30	and if they refuse to obey,
SIR.33.30	put them in chains.
SIR.33.30	But always be fair,
SIR.33.30	not arrogant.
SIR.33.31	If one slave is all you have,
SIR.33.31	treat him like a family member
SIR.33.31	or even as you treat yourself.
SIR.33.31	You worked a long time
SIR.33.31	to buy that slave,
SIR.33.31	and you need his help
SIR.33.31	to survive.
SIR.33.32	If you are mean,
SIR.33.32	and that slave runs away,
SIR.33.33	where will you look for him?
SIR.34.1	ignorant people,
SIR.34.1	and dreams lead fools
SIR.34.1	to be even more foolish.
SIR.34.2	Believing in dreams
SIR.34.2	is like holding on to shadows
SIR.34.2	or chasing the wind.
SIR.34.3	Just as a mirror
SIR.34.3	reflects your face,
SIR.34.3	your dreams reflect
SIR.34.3	your concerns.
SIR.34.4	Something clean cannot come
SIR.34.4	from something dirty,
SIR.34.4	and truth cannot come
SIR.34.4	from a lie.
SIR.34.5	Dreams are meaningless,
SIR.34.5	like something said
SIR.34.5	by a fortuneteller,
SIR.34.5	because they can mean anything
SIR.34.5	you want them to.
SIR.34.6	So unless a dream has been sent
SIR.34.6	by God Most High,
SIR.34.6	ignore it.
SIR.34.7	Dreams have fooled many—
SIR.34.7	first giving them hope,
SIR.34.7	then disappointing them.
SIR.34.8	You can obey God's Law
SIR.34.8	and learn from wise people,
SIR.34.8	without paying attention
SIR.34.8	to deceitful dreams.
SIR.34.9	A person who has traveled
SIR.34.9	has learned many things,
SIR.34.9	and knows about them
SIR.34.9	from experience.
SIR.34.10	If you have few experiences,
SIR.34.10	you won't learn much,
SIR.34.11	but the more you travel,
SIR.34.11	the smarter you will become.
SIR.34.12	I saw many things
SIR.34.12	when I traveled,
SIR.34.12	and I learned more
SIR.34.12	than I can tell you.
SIR.34.13	My life was often in danger,
SIR.34.13	but what I had learned
SIR.34.13	always helped me escape.
SIR.34.13	* 
SIR.34.14	If you fear the Lord
SIR.34.14	and put your trust in him,
SIR.34.15	he will keep you safe,
SIR.34.16	and so you can be brave
SIR.34.16	and face any danger.
SIR.34.17	The Lord will bless you
SIR.34.17	if you fear him
SIR.34.18	and ask for his help.
SIR.34.19	And if you love the Lord,
SIR.34.19	he will give you strength
SIR.34.19	and keep you from falling.
SIR.34.19	He will be your shield,
SIR.34.19	protecting you and giving shade
SIR.34.19	from the burning heat
SIR.34.19	of the summer sun at noon.
SIR.34.20	Your eyes will sparkle
SIR.34.20	with the happiness he gives,
SIR.34.20	and he will bless you
SIR.34.20	with health and a long life.
SIR.34.21	A stolen animal isn't fit
SIR.34.21	as a sacrifice for the Lord,
SIR.34.22	and he won't accept gifts
SIR.34.22	from those who reject his Law.
SIR.34.23	Sinners cannot please
SIR.34.23	God Most High,
SIR.34.23	and he will not forgive them,
SIR.34.23	even if they offer
SIR.34.23	sacrifice after sacrifice.
SIR.34.24	Stealing food from the poor
SIR.34.24	to offer as a sacrifice
SIR.34.24	is like murdering children
SIR.34.24	while their parents watch.
SIR.34.25	The poor have so little food,
SIR.34.25	that taking it is the same
SIR.34.25	as committing murder.
SIR.34.26	Stealing what someone needs
SIR.34.26	to earn a living
SIR.34.26	is the same as murder,
SIR.34.27	and refusing to pay the wages
SIR.34.27	of someone who works for you
SIR.34.27	is just as evil.
SIR.34.28	So, if you steal possessions
SIR.34.28	that others worked for,
SIR.34.28	you will cause trouble
SIR.34.28	for yourself and for them.
SIR.34.29	When they are asking God
SIR.34.29	to put a curse on you,
SIR.34.29	will he listen to your prayer?
SIR.34.30	from touching a dead body,
SIR.34.30	what's the point of washing
SIR.34.30	if you touch the body again?
SIR.34.31	Suppose you go without eating
SIR.34.31	to show sorrow for your sins
SIR.34.31	and then commit
SIR.34.31	the same sins again.
SIR.34.31	Will God forgive you?
SIR.34.31	No, it was all for nothing.
SIR.35.1	Obeying the Law
SIR.35.1	of the Lord
SIR.35.1	is the same
SIR.35.1	as bringing him many gifts,
SIR.35.2	and obeying his commands
SIR.35.2	is like offering a sacrifice
SIR.35.2	to ask his blessing.
SIR.35.3	Showing kindness to someone
SIR.35.3	who has been kind to you
SIR.35.3	is like offering a sacrifice
SIR.35.3	to give thanks to the Lord.
SIR.35.4	And giving to the poor
SIR.35.4	is offering a sacrifice
SIR.35.4	that gives the Lord praise.
SIR.35.5	So please the Lord
SIR.35.5	and seek his forgiveness,
SIR.35.5	by staying away from evil.
SIR.35.6	However, do not come
SIR.35.6	to worship the Lord
SIR.35.6	without bringing him a gift
SIR.35.7	as his Law commands.
SIR.35.8	When one of God's people
SIR.35.8	burns the fat of a sacrifice,
SIR.35.8	God Most High is pleased
SIR.35.8	with the smell of the smoke
SIR.35.8	rising from the altar.
SIR.35.9	are acceptable to God
SIR.35.9	and will not be forgotten.
SIR.35.10	When you offer to the Lord
SIR.35.10	the first part of the harvest
SIR.35.10	or a sacrifice to give thanks,
SIR.35.10	be generous—not stingy.
SIR.35.11	Be happy and cheerful
SIR.35.11	when you give him a gift
SIR.35.11	or a tenth of your harvest.
SIR.35.12	Be as generous with the Lord
SIR.35.12	as he has been with you.
SIR.35.13	Remember! The Lord is the one
SIR.35.13	who repays seven times more
SIR.35.13	than you give him.
SIR.35.14	You cannot bribe the Lord
SIR.35.14	by offering a sacrifice,
SIR.35.15	and he won't accept as a gift
SIR.35.15	what you get by cheating.
SIR.35.15	The Lord is a judge
SIR.35.15	who doesn't take sides,
SIR.35.16	especially against the poor,
SIR.35.16	but he answers the prayers
SIR.35.16	of all who suffer injustice.
SIR.35.17	God listens when an orphan
SIR.35.17	begs for his help.
SIR.35.17	He hears the complaints
SIR.35.17	of a mistreated widow
SIR.35.17	as she cries out
SIR.35.18	with tears in her eyes
SIR.35.19	and tells him about the one
SIR.35.19	who has abused her.
SIR.35.20	If you obey the Lord,
SIR.35.20	he will accept you
SIR.35.20	and answer when you pray.
SIR.35.21	Be humble, and your prayers
SIR.35.21	will go up beyond the clouds
SIR.35.21	and be heard
SIR.35.21	by God Most High.
SIR.35.22	He will quickly punish those
SIR.35.22	who have wronged his people
SIR.35.22	and completely crush those
SIR.35.22	who have shown no mercy.
SIR.35.23	God will take revenge
SIR.35.23	on evil, arrogant Gentiles,
SIR.35.23	breaking their power
SIR.35.23	and destroying them.
SIR.35.24	And someday, all humans
SIR.35.24	will be repaid, as their thoughts
SIR.35.24	and deeds deserve.
SIR.35.25	Then God will judge
SIR.35.25	in favor of his people,
SIR.35.25	and they will celebrate
SIR.35.25	because he showed mercy.
SIR.35.26	We welcome God's mercy
SIR.35.26	when we are in trouble,
SIR.35.26	just as we welcome rain
SIR.35.26	in hot, dry weather.
SIR.36.1	Our God, you rule all things;
SIR.36.1	have mercy on us
SIR.36.2	and show all nations
SIR.36.2	that they should fear you.
SIR.36.3	Let them see your power
SIR.36.3	as you attack them.
SIR.36.4	They have seen that you are holy
SIR.36.4	in the way you treat us.
SIR.36.4	Now show us that you are great
SIR.36.4	as you deal with them!
SIR.36.5	Teach them, our Lord,
SIR.36.5	as you taught us,
SIR.36.5	that you alone are God.
SIR.36.6	Perform new miracles,
SIR.36.7	so that everyone will know
SIR.36.7	how powerful you are.
SIR.36.8	Get really angry
SIR.36.9	and destroy our enemies.
SIR.36.10	You have set a time to do this—
SIR.36.10	please let it come quickly,
SIR.36.10	then everyone will be talking
SIR.36.10	about your mighty power.
SIR.36.11	And if any survive of those
SIR.36.11	who had harmed your people,
SIR.36.11	destroy those enemies
SIR.36.11	with your fiery anger.
SIR.36.12	Crush the heads of their rulers
SIR.36.12	who say, “All that matters
SIR.36.12	is what we want to do.”
SIR.36.13	Gather together
SIR.36.13	the tribes of Israel,
SIR.36.16	and
SIR.36.16	control of their land.
SIR.36.17	Have pity on us, our Lord.
SIR.36.17	We are known as your nation,
SIR.36.17	your first-born child.
SIR.36.18	Show mercy to Jerusalem,
SIR.36.18	your holy city, your home.
SIR.36.19	Then everyone in Zion
SIR.36.19	will celebrate as they tell
SIR.36.19	of your mighty deeds.
SIR.36.20	Prove that you chose us
SIR.36.20	as your people.
SIR.36.20	You told your prophets
SIR.36.20	to make promises to us;
SIR.36.20	now keep these promises
SIR.36.21	so your prophets
SIR.36.21	will not have lied.
SIR.36.21	Please reward us
SIR.36.21	for waiting patiently.
SIR.36.22	Our Lord, we are your servants.
SIR.36.22	If you are pleased with us,
SIR.36.22	answer our prayer,
SIR.36.22	and then the whole world
SIR.36.22	will know that you
SIR.36.22	are the Eternal Lord God.
SIR.36.23	There are many different foods,
SIR.36.23	but you like some
SIR.36.23	better than others.
SIR.36.24	And just as your taste tells you
SIR.36.24	what you are eating,
SIR.36.24	a smart mind will know
SIR.36.24	when it hears a lie.
SIR.36.25	People with twisted minds
SIR.36.25	cause a lot of trouble,
SIR.36.25	but if you learn from experience
SIR.36.25	you can send the trouble
SIR.36.25	back on them.
SIR.36.26	A woman cannot choose
SIR.36.26	the man she will marry,
SIR.36.26	but a man can choose his wife,
SIR.36.26	and some women
SIR.36.26	make better wives than others.
SIR.36.27	Beauty is important to men,
SIR.36.27	and most men would be happy
SIR.36.27	to marry a beautiful woman.
SIR.36.28	But a man is really lucky
SIR.36.28	if his wife speaks
SIR.36.28	with humility and kindness.
SIR.36.29	The most important thing
SIR.36.29	a man can have
SIR.36.29	is a wife who helps him
SIR.36.29	and is a suitable partner.
SIR.36.30	Without a fence around a home,
SIR.36.30	robbers can steal
SIR.36.30	whatever they want.
SIR.36.30	And without a wife,
SIR.36.30	a man wanders aimlessly,
SIR.36.31	homeless, spending the night
SIR.36.31	wherever he can,
SIR.36.31	trusted no more than a thief
SIR.36.31	who is always on the run.
SIR.37.1	Someone who claims
SIR.37.1	to be your friend
SIR.37.1	may not be telling the truth.
SIR.37.2	The sorrow when a close friend
SIR.37.2	becomes an enemy
SIR.37.2	is almost like mourning
SIR.37.2	for a friend who has died.
SIR.37.3	Why do people's thoughts
SIR.37.3	lead them to do wrong
SIR.37.3	and spread deceit everywhere?
SIR.37.4	Some friends are happy for you
SIR.37.4	when everything is fine,
SIR.37.4	but when you have trouble
SIR.37.4	they turn against you.
SIR.37.5	Another friend seems to help
SIR.37.5	only for a free meal,
SIR.37.5	but when you both go off to war,
SIR.37.5	he gives you protection.
SIR.37.6	Never forget your friends,
SIR.37.6	and if you are successful,
SIR.37.6	share your wealth with them.
SIR.37.7	When people claim to offer
SIR.37.7	advice that is good for you,
SIR.37.7	it may really be good
SIR.37.7	for them.
SIR.37.8	Before you do what they say,
SIR.37.8	see if they are looking out
SIR.37.8	for themselves
SIR.37.8	and putting you at risk
SIR.37.9	with their advice,
SIR.37.9	while they can safely watch
SIR.37.9	what happens to you.
SIR.37.10	If someone is jealous
SIR.37.10	or suspicious of you,
SIR.37.10	don't ask them for advice
SIR.37.10	or tell them your plans.
SIR.37.11	If a man has two wives,
SIR.37.11	don't ask one about the other.
SIR.37.11	Take care who you ask
SIR.37.11	for advice.
SIR.37.11	A coward can't tell you
SIR.37.11	how to fight in battle,
SIR.37.11	and a store owner won't tell
SIR.37.11	how much something
SIR.37.11	is really worth.
SIR.37.11	Can someone with a grudge
SIR.37.11	show you how to be grateful,
SIR.37.11	or someone mean
SIR.37.11	tell you how to be kind?
SIR.37.11	Don't bother asking
SIR.37.11	a lazy person
SIR.37.11	if work needs to be done.
SIR.37.11	And don't ask someone
SIR.37.11	who gets paid by the hour
SIR.37.11	how long a job should take.
SIR.37.12	If you need advice, ask someone
SIR.37.12	who obeys God's commands
SIR.37.12	and thinks like you—
SIR.37.12	someone who will be sad
SIR.37.12	if you fail.
SIR.37.13	And trust your own judgment—
SIR.37.13	you care more about yourself
SIR.37.13	than anyone else does.
SIR.37.14	Thinking for yourself
SIR.37.14	will often tell you more
SIR.37.14	than if you had seven lookouts
SIR.37.14	in a high tower.
SIR.37.15	But the most important thing
SIR.37.15	is to pray that God Most High
SIR.37.15	will show you what to do.
SIR.37.16	Before you begin a project,
SIR.37.16	talk with others
SIR.37.16	and get their advice.
SIR.37.17	Everything starts as an idea,
SIR.37.18	whether it helps or harms,
SIR.37.18	or brings life or death,
SIR.37.18	and how people talk
SIR.37.18	determines what they do.
SIR.37.19	Some people can give
SIR.37.19	excellent advice to others
SIR.37.19	but show no wisdom
SIR.37.19	in their own lives.
SIR.37.20	And some who can speak well
SIR.37.20	will be hated and starve,
SIR.37.21	because they speak
SIR.37.21	without wisdom from the Lord,
SIR.37.21	and they offend others.
SIR.37.22	If you see that certain people
SIR.37.22	make wise choices themselves,
SIR.37.22	you can depend on the advice
SIR.37.22	they give to you.
SIR.37.23	The wise teach their wisdom
SIR.37.23	to God's people
SIR.37.23	so their wisdom will live on.
SIR.37.24	The wise are admired and praised
SIR.37.24	by everyone they meet.
SIR.37.25	Life is short for each of us,
SIR.37.25	but Israel will last forever,
SIR.37.26	honoring the memory of those
SIR.37.26	who shared their wisdom.
SIR.37.27	Take notice, students,
SIR.37.27	what foods make you feel sick,
SIR.37.27	and stay away from them.
SIR.37.28	After all, no one likes
SIR.37.28	every kind of food.
SIR.37.29	Control any desire to overeat
SIR.37.29	or to have lots of fancy food
SIR.37.29	at every meal.
SIR.37.30	You will get sick
SIR.37.30	if you eat too much.
SIR.37.31	Be careful!
SIR.37.31	Many have died young
SIR.37.31	from overeating.
SIR.38.1	The Lord chose some people
SIR.38.1	to be doctors, so honor them
SIR.38.1	for helping others get well.
SIR.38.2	God Most High gave them
SIR.38.2	the ability to heal,
SIR.38.2	and they are rewarded
SIR.38.2	by the king.
SIR.38.3	Their skills
SIR.38.3	make them important,
SIR.38.3	and they are admired
SIR.38.3	by powerful people.
SIR.38.4	Medicines are part
SIR.38.4	of the Lord's creation,
SIR.38.4	and if you are sensible,
SIR.38.4	you will use them.
SIR.38.5	made water fit to drink,
SIR.38.5	and this showed God's power.
SIR.38.6	He gives knowledge to humans
SIR.38.6	so that we will praise him
SIR.38.6	for his amazing creations.
SIR.38.6	* 
SIR.38.7	Doctors relieve pain
SIR.38.7	and bring healing
SIR.38.7	by mixing medicines
SIR.38.7	from things that God created.
SIR.38.8	God will always be at work
SIR.38.8	bringing health
SIR.38.8	to everyone on earth.
SIR.38.9	Students, if you get sick,
SIR.38.9	quickly pray to the Lord,
SIR.38.9	and you will be healed.
SIR.38.10	Give up all your sins
SIR.38.10	and decide to do right.
SIR.38.11	Offer a sacrifice of fine flour
SIR.38.11	and as much olive oil
SIR.38.11	as you can afford,
SIR.38.11	and the smell of the smoke
SIR.38.11	will be pleasing to God.
SIR.38.12	But God also created doctors,
SIR.38.12	and you need their help,
SIR.38.12	so don't reject them.
SIR.38.13	Someday your life
SIR.38.13	will be in their hands,
SIR.38.14	and they will ask the Lord
SIR.38.14	how to make you well
SIR.38.14	and relieve your pain.
SIR.38.15	Those who sin against God,
SIR.38.15	their Creator,
SIR.38.15	will also reject doctors.
SIR.38.16	you should mourn and weep
SIR.38.16	as though you were in pain.
SIR.38.16	Prepare the body to be buried,
SIR.38.16	and attend the funeral.
SIR.38.17	Weep bitterly to show respect
SIR.38.17	for the dead.
SIR.38.17	If you don't grieve at all,
SIR.38.17	you will be criticized,
SIR.38.17	but don't mourn for longer
SIR.38.17	than a day or two.
SIR.38.18	If you don't stop grieving,
SIR.38.18	you will grow weak
SIR.38.18	and die.
SIR.38.19	After a funeral, sorrow remains,
SIR.38.19	but don't let it drag you down
SIR.38.19	into poverty.
SIR.38.20	Put away your grief
SIR.38.20	and enjoy what is left
SIR.38.20	of your own life.
SIR.38.21	You cannot bring back
SIR.38.21	those who have died.
SIR.38.21	Grieving won't help them,
SIR.38.21	and it can harm you.
SIR.38.22	Just remember that in the past,
SIR.38.22	death caught up with them,
SIR.38.22	and in the future,
SIR.38.22	it will catch up with you.
SIR.38.23	The dead are at rest,
SIR.38.23	so be strong
SIR.38.23	and stop thinking about them
SIR.38.23	all the time.
SIR.38.24	If teachers are to become wise,
SIR.38.24	they need lots of time to study
SIR.38.24	and freedom from other work.
SIR.38.24	* 
SIR.38.25	Who has time to study wisdom?
SIR.38.25	Not farmers!
SIR.38.25	All day long they guide oxen
SIR.38.25	to plow 
SIR.38.26	in straight lines.
SIR.38.26	Then they work at night
SIR.38.26	feeding their livestock.
SIR.38.26	Farmers talk about cattle,
SIR.38.26	not wisdom.
SIR.38.27	Who has time to study wisdom?
SIR.38.27	Not artists who carve designs
SIR.38.27	on rings and other jewelry.
SIR.38.27	These artists work with care
SIR.38.27	night and day, making sure
SIR.38.27	each design is different
SIR.38.27	and leaves a perfect pattern
SIR.38.27	when pressed in soft wax.
SIR.38.28	Who has time to study wisdom?
SIR.38.28	Not the blacksmith,
SIR.38.28	soaked in sweat from the heat
SIR.38.28	of the furnace,
SIR.38.28	going deaf from the noise
SIR.38.28	as he hammers the red-hot iron,
SIR.38.28	shaping it on his anvil.
SIR.38.28	He wants to finish this piece,
SIR.38.28	and will work late to see
SIR.38.28	all its decorations completed.
SIR.38.29	Who has time to study wisdom?
SIR.38.29	A potter doesn't.
SIR.38.29	His feet must always move
SIR.38.29	to spin the pottery wheel.
SIR.38.29	He keeps his mind on his work—
SIR.38.29	so many pieces to make,
SIR.38.30	and so much to do.
SIR.38.30	He works the clay with his feet
SIR.38.30	to make it soft,
SIR.38.30	then shapes it with his hands
SIR.38.30	before baking it.
SIR.38.30	And then at night,
SIR.38.30	he cleans out the furnace.
SIR.38.31	All these are skilled people
SIR.38.31	who work with their hands.
SIR.38.32	Without them in a town,
SIR.38.32	no one would live there
SIR.38.32	or even visit.
SIR.38.32	But they are not asked to serve
SIR.38.32	on public committees,
SIR.38.33	and they don't become leaders
SIR.38.33	in the town council.
SIR.38.33	They are not judges
SIR.38.33	and cannot explain
SIR.38.33	the decisions of the court.
SIR.38.33	They cannot even tell stories
SIR.38.33	that teach lessons.
SIR.38.34	But they do pray
SIR.38.34	about their work,
SIR.38.34	and they keep life going
SIR.38.34	for everyone else.
SIR.38.34	Teachers who study the Law
SIR.38.34	of God Most High
SIR.38.34	are different.
SIR.39.1	In their search for wisdom,
SIR.39.1	they study the old writings,
SIR.39.1	especially those
SIR.39.1	of the prophets.
SIR.39.2	These teachers learn the sayings
SIR.39.2	of famous people
SIR.39.2	and understand the meaning
SIR.39.2	of stories, 
SIR.39.3	even those parts
SIR.39.3	that are difficult.
SIR.39.3	And they look for the meaning
SIR.39.3	hidden in a proverb.
SIR.39.4	They give advice to leaders,
SIR.39.4	and they travel
SIR.39.4	in other countries
SIR.39.4	to see the good and the bad
SIR.39.4	done there.
SIR.39.5	These teachers get up early
SIR.39.5	to pray to the Lord Most High,
SIR.39.5	their Creator—
SIR.39.5	they tell him what they need
SIR.39.5	and ask that their sins
SIR.39.5	be forgiven.
SIR.39.6	The great Lord may choose
SIR.39.6	to give special understanding
SIR.39.6	to a teacher's mind.
SIR.39.6	Such teachers will pray
SIR.39.6	and thank the Lord
SIR.39.6	for the wise advice
SIR.39.6	that they now can give.
SIR.39.7	They will study those things
SIR.39.7	the Lord has kept secret.
SIR.39.7	He will help them learn
SIR.39.7	and tell them what to say,
SIR.39.8	and they will teach
SIR.39.8	what they have learned.
SIR.39.8	They will be proud
SIR.39.8	of the Lord's Law
SIR.39.8	and agreement with Israel.
SIR.39.9	Their understanding
SIR.39.9	will be praised by many,
SIR.39.9	and their names remembered
SIR.39.9	for all time.
SIR.39.10	Israel will honor them,
SIR.39.10	and other nations will admire
SIR.39.10	their wisdom.
SIR.39.11	If they live to old age,
SIR.39.11	they will be famous,
SIR.39.11	and if not, they will be content
SIR.39.11	to be at rest.
SIR.39.12	I have hardly begun to tell you
SIR.39.12	all the things I want to say.
SIR.39.13	You, my students,
SIR.39.13	are faithful to God,
SIR.39.13	so listen, and you will blossom
SIR.39.13	like rose bushes
SIR.39.13	planted beside a stream.
SIR.39.14	You will grow faster than lilies,
SIR.39.14	and your songs praising the Lord
SIR.39.14	for what he has done
SIR.39.14	will be a pleasant smell,
SIR.39.14	spreading like incense.
SIR.39.15	So play your harps
SIR.39.15	and sing praises to the Lord.
SIR.39.15	Give honor to him
SIR.39.15	with this song:
SIR.39.16	“Everything the Lord does
SIR.39.16	is very good,
SIR.39.16	and his commands
SIR.39.16	will be obeyed
SIR.39.16	at the right moment.
SIR.39.17	what God has done,
SIR.39.17	but he has set a time
SIR.39.17	to explain everything.
SIR.39.17	He created places
SIR.39.17	for all the water,
SIR.39.17	and when he commanded the sea,
SIR.39.17	it piled up like a wall.
SIR.39.18	When he gives an order,
SIR.39.18	it is obeyed,
SIR.39.18	and no one can stop him
SIR.39.18	when he decides to rescue.
SIR.39.19	“We can't hide from God;
SIR.39.19	he has watched everything
SIR.39.19	that each human has done.
SIR.39.20	He sees the past and the future;
SIR.39.20	there is nothing
SIR.39.20	he cannot do.
SIR.39.21	So don't question
SIR.39.21	what God has done;
SIR.39.21	he had a purpose in mind
SIR.39.21	for each thing he created.
SIR.39.22	“God will bless us greatly,
SIR.39.22	like a river that overflows
SIR.39.22	and soaks the dry ground.
SIR.39.23	But the Gentiles
SIR.39.23	will feel his anger,
SIR.39.23	as he makes their fresh water
SIR.39.23	too salty to drink.
SIR.39.24	God lets his people walk
SIR.39.24	on a straight pathway,
SIR.39.24	but those who reject his laws
SIR.39.24	will find that their path
SIR.39.24	is lined with hidden traps.
SIR.39.25	From the very beginning
SIR.39.25	God prepared good things
SIR.39.25	for good people,
SIR.39.25	and horrible things for sinners.
SIR.39.26	“What do we need for daily life?
SIR.39.26	Iron tools, water, and fire;
SIR.39.26	flour, milk, and honey,
SIR.39.26	wine, olive oil, and salt;
SIR.39.26	and, of course, clothing.
SIR.39.27	All of these are good
SIR.39.27	for God's loyal people
SIR.39.27	but become evil in the hands
SIR.39.27	of sinners.
SIR.39.28	“The Lord created furious winds
SIR.39.28	to take revenge for him.
SIR.39.28	And on the day of judgment,
SIR.39.28	they will punish his enemies,
SIR.39.28	then his anger will be calmed.
SIR.39.28	* 
SIR.39.29	God also created other things
SIR.39.29	to take revenge for him—
SIR.39.29	fire and hail, along with famine
SIR.39.29	and deadly diseases,
SIR.39.30	wild animals and scorpions,
SIR.39.30	and poisonous snakes,
SIR.39.30	not to mention war.
SIR.39.31	They are ready to serve him,
SIR.39.31	and at his command,
SIR.39.31	they gladly and quickly obey.”
SIR.39.32	I have believed all these things
SIR.39.32	since my childhood,
SIR.39.32	but I thought deeply about them
SIR.39.32	before I wrote them down
SIR.39.32	in that song.
SIR.39.33	The Lord made only good things,
SIR.39.33	and at the right time
SIR.39.33	he will give us what we need.
SIR.39.34	Everything he created
SIR.39.34	has its own purpose,
SIR.39.34	and so, you cannot say,
SIR.39.34	“This is better than that.”
SIR.39.35	Sing praises to the Lord
SIR.39.35	with all your heart,
SIR.39.35	and give him thanks!
SIR.40.1	to work hard
SIR.40.1	from the day of our birth
SIR.40.1	until we are buried in the soil
SIR.40.1	from which we were made.
SIR.40.2	We don't understand life,
SIR.40.2	so we worry and dread the day
SIR.40.2	that it will end.
SIR.40.2	* 
SIR.40.3	And each of us is bothered
SIR.40.3	by troubling feelings—
SIR.40.3	from the king,
SIR.40.3	seated on his glorious throne
SIR.40.3	and wearing his crown
SIR.40.3	and royal robes,
SIR.40.3	* 
SIR.40.4	to the homeless in the street,
SIR.40.4	sitting in dirt and grime
SIR.40.4	and wearing worn-out clothes.
SIR.40.5	We are angry, jealous,
SIR.40.5	or hateful;
SIR.40.5	or maybe we feel guilty
SIR.40.5	or are afraid of death.
SIR.40.5	Sometimes we are confused
SIR.40.5	by a dream,
SIR.40.6	or lie awake
SIR.40.6	worrying about our work,
SIR.40.6	and so we get little rest.
SIR.40.6	We see ourselves
SIR.40.6	running for our lives,
SIR.40.7	and almost reaching safety,
SIR.40.7	then we wake up, amazed—
SIR.40.7	it was all a dream.
SIR.40.8	The troubles that sinners have
SIR.40.8	will be seven times worse
SIR.40.8	than those of other people.
SIR.40.8	Any living creature
SIR.40.9	can suffer a violent death
SIR.40.9	when there is war or fighting,
SIR.40.9	or they can die from disaster,
SIR.40.9	horrible disease, or famine.
SIR.40.10	to punish those who do wrong,
SIR.40.10	as when he sent the flood.
SIR.40.11	were created from the soil,
SIR.40.11	and will return to it,
SIR.40.11	just as water
SIR.40.11	returns to the sea.
SIR.40.12	What you gain by being honest
SIR.40.12	will last forever,
SIR.40.12	but wealth you get
SIR.40.12	by bribery and cheating
SIR.40.12	will disappear.
SIR.40.13	It will dry up like a stream
SIR.40.13	in the summer heat,
SIR.40.13	or quickly fade, like thunder
SIR.40.13	from a passing storm.
SIR.40.14	And while generous people
SIR.40.14	can celebrate success,
SIR.40.14	those who disobey God
SIR.40.14	will be failures.
SIR.40.15	Their children will be like trees
SIR.40.15	growing out of a rocky cliff
SIR.40.15	and having rotten roots
SIR.40.15	and few branches.
SIR.40.16	They are like the tall grass
SIR.40.16	that grows beside a stream—
SIR.40.16	when the stream runs dry,
SIR.40.16	the grass quickly withers.
SIR.40.17	But those who show kindness,
SIR.40.17	especially to the poor,
SIR.40.17	are gardens that always bloom
SIR.40.17	with blessing after blessing.
SIR.40.18	It is good to have a job
SIR.40.18	and earn your own money,
SIR.40.18	but it is even better
SIR.40.18	to discover hidden treasure.
SIR.40.19	Having wisdom is better
SIR.40.19	than giving your name
SIR.40.19	to your children or to a city
SIR.40.19	that you have built.
SIR.40.19	Cattle and fruit trees
SIR.40.19	can bring you wealth,
SIR.40.19	but a happy marriage
SIR.40.19	is better than riches.
SIR.40.20	Wine and music bring happiness,
SIR.40.20	but if you love wisdom,
SIR.40.20	you will be even happier.
SIR.40.21	A pleasant voice is sweeter
SIR.40.21	than the music
SIR.40.21	of flutes and harps.
SIR.40.22	Our eyes like beauty
SIR.40.22	and graceful movement,
SIR.40.22	but most of all, we want to see
SIR.40.22	our fields becoming green
SIR.40.22	with sprouting wheat.
SIR.40.23	Having friends and neighbors
SIR.40.23	is important,
SIR.40.23	but being married
SIR.40.23	is even better.
SIR.40.24	Relatives and friends can help
SIR.40.24	when you are in trouble,
SIR.40.24	but the best help comes
SIR.40.24	from giving to the poor.
SIR.40.25	Gold and silver
SIR.40.25	may give security,
SIR.40.25	but they don't compare
SIR.40.25	with good advice.
SIR.40.26	Many trust wealth and power,
SIR.40.26	but if you obey the Lord,
SIR.40.26	he will give you
SIR.40.26	whatever you need
SIR.40.26	if you will just ask.
SIR.40.27	If you obey the Lord,
SIR.40.27	he will protect you
SIR.40.27	and make your life a garden
SIR.40.27	where blessings grow.
SIR.40.28	You would be better off dead
SIR.40.28	than to be a beggar.
SIR.40.29	If you have to beg for food,
SIR.40.29	your life isn't your own,
SIR.40.29	and you won't have
SIR.40.29	any respect for yourself.
SIR.40.29	If you are smart
SIR.40.29	and have learned anything,
SIR.40.29	you won't beg.
SIR.40.30	No matter what beggars say,
SIR.40.30	they really are ashamed
SIR.40.30	of what they do.
SIR.41.1	Death is a bitter thought
SIR.41.1	for those who are prosperous
SIR.41.1	and without a worry.
SIR.41.1	They have everything
SIR.41.1	and are healthy enough
SIR.41.1	to enjoy good food.
SIR.41.2	But others would rather die
SIR.41.2	because they are poor and sick,
SIR.41.2	old and worn out.
SIR.41.2	They are grumpy and impatient,
SIR.41.2	always finding something
SIR.41.2	to worry about.
SIR.41.3	When it's your time to die,
SIR.41.3	don't be afraid—
SIR.41.3	you are merely following those
SIR.41.3	who have gone on before.
SIR.41.3	And everyone else
SIR.41.3	will soon follow you,
SIR.41.4	because the Lord has commanded
SIR.41.4	that life ends with death,
SIR.41.4	and we all must obey.
SIR.41.4	No one in the world of the dead
SIR.41.4	will ask how long you lived,
SIR.41.4	whether it was ten, a hundred,
SIR.41.4	or a thousand years.
SIR.41.5	The children of sinners
SIR.41.5	are disgusting,
SIR.41.5	because they are raised
SIR.41.5	in godless homes.
SIR.41.6	They will lose everything
SIR.41.6	they inherited,
SIR.41.6	and their own children
SIR.41.6	will live in disgrace.
SIR.41.7	If parents reject God,
SIR.41.7	their children are disgraced
SIR.41.7	and blame them.
SIR.41.8	The godless are in for trouble,
SIR.41.8	because they refuse to obey
SIR.41.8	the Law of God Most High.
SIR.41.9	They will groan as disaster
SIR.41.9	strikes their children,
SIR.41.9	and at the death of the godless,
SIR.41.9	God's people will celebrate
SIR.41.9	and will curse them.
SIR.41.10	All living creatures
SIR.41.10	will return to the soil
SIR.41.10	from which they were made,
SIR.41.10	but sinners are under a curse
SIR.41.10	and will be destroyed.
SIR.41.11	When someone dies,
SIR.41.11	we usually mourn,
SIR.41.11	but everyone tries to forget
SIR.41.11	those who were evil.
SIR.41.12	So be careful! Your reputation
SIR.41.12	won't die with you—
SIR.41.12	it will outlast the gold
SIR.41.12	in a thousand treasure chests.
SIR.41.13	Every one of us must die,
SIR.41.13	but our reputations won't.
SIR.41.14	Students, you have learned well.
SIR.41.14	So don't worry; just do
SIR.41.14	what you have been taught.
SIR.41.14	Your wisdom is a treasure—
SIR.41.14	bring it out and use it,
SIR.41.14	don't bury it!
SIR.41.15	Fools who hide their stupidity
SIR.41.15	will be better off than you,
SIR.41.15	if you hide your wisdom.
SIR.41.16	Certain deeds are shameful,
SIR.41.16	although not everyone agrees
SIR.41.16	what these are.
SIR.41.16	So listen carefully,
SIR.41.16	and I will tell you.
SIR.41.17	You should be ashamed
SIR.41.17	if you are immoral
SIR.41.17	and your parents find out;
SIR.41.17	if a leader discovers
SIR.41.17	that you have lied;
SIR.41.18	if you commit a crime
SIR.41.18	and everyone in town
SIR.41.18	comes to watch your trial;
SIR.41.18	if you cheat your friends
SIR.41.19	or steal from neighbors;
SIR.41.19	if you break promises
SIR.41.19	that you made in God's name;
SIR.41.19	if you have bad manners
SIR.41.19	when eating dinner,
SIR.41.19	or when giving a gift
SIR.41.19	or receiving one;
SIR.41.20	if you don't reply
SIR.41.20	when someone greets you;
SIR.41.20	if you men look at a prostitute
SIR.41.20	* 
SIR.41.21	or if you desire the wife
SIR.41.21	of another man
SIR.41.21	or if you try to have sex
SIR.41.21	with one of his slave girls;
SIR.41.21	if you refuse to help a relative
SIR.41.21	or if you take what was given
SIR.41.21	to someone else;
SIR.41.22	if you insult your friends,
SIR.41.22	even though you have given
SIR.41.22	a gift to them;
SIR.42.1	if you repeat rumors
SIR.42.1	or tell someone's secret.
SIR.42.1	If someone catches you
SIR.42.1	doing any of these things,
SIR.42.1	show how ashamed you are,
SIR.42.1	then others will forgive you.
SIR.42.1	Don't ever be ashamed
SIR.42.1	to do what is right,
SIR.42.1	even if others don't approve.
SIR.42.2	For example, don't be ashamed
SIR.42.2	if you obey the Law
SIR.42.2	of God Most High;
SIR.42.2	or if a godless person
SIR.42.2	is on trial,
SIR.42.2	and you vote “innocent”
SIR.42.2	because you believe it's true;
SIR.42.3	if you pay your fair share
SIR.42.3	of the expenses for business
SIR.42.3	or travel;
SIR.42.3	if you divide up an inheritance
SIR.42.3	among all those
SIR.42.3	who deserve a share;
SIR.42.4	if you have accurate scales
SIR.42.4	for weighing what you buy
SIR.42.4	and sell;
SIR.42.4	if you buy much or little,
SIR.42.5	or if you make a profit
SIR.42.5	on what you sell;
SIR.42.5	if you punish your children
SIR.42.5	when they need it;
SIR.42.5	if your slaves do wrong,
SIR.42.5	and you whip them
SIR.42.5	until they bleed.
SIR.42.6	Husbands, if your wife
SIR.42.6	cannot be trusted,
SIR.42.6	or if a lot of visitors
SIR.42.6	will be in your home,
SIR.42.6	lock up everything of value.
SIR.42.7	If you leave valuable items
SIR.42.7	with someone for safekeeping,
SIR.42.7	be sure to get a receipt,
SIR.42.7	and keep records of everything
SIR.42.7	you give or receive.
SIR.42.8	Do not be embarrassed
SIR.42.8	to correct stupid fools
SIR.42.8	or even an older person
SIR.42.8	who is being immoral.
SIR.42.8	If you follow my advice,
SIR.42.8	others will honor you
SIR.42.8	for the lessons of wisdom
SIR.42.8	you have learned.
SIR.42.9	worry about your daughters
SIR.42.9	and lose sleep, while questions
SIR.42.9	trouble your minds.
SIR.42.9	Will she find a husband?
SIR.42.9	Will he love her, 
SIR.42.10	and will she
SIR.42.10	be faithful to him?
SIR.42.10	Will she get pregnant
SIR.42.10	before she gets married
SIR.42.10	and leaves your home?
SIR.42.10	Or will she be able
SIR.42.10	to have children?
SIR.42.11	If your daughter
SIR.42.11	always wants her own way,
SIR.42.11	watch her closely,
SIR.42.11	or she may embarrass you.
SIR.42.11	Your enemies will laugh,
SIR.42.11	and everyone in town
SIR.42.11	will talk about it.
SIR.42.11	Don't let her bedroom window
SIR.42.11	look down on the front door,
SIR.42.11	and a room without a window
SIR.42.11	is even better.
SIR.42.12	Don't let men see her beauty,
SIR.42.12	and keep her away
SIR.42.12	from married women,
SIR.42.13	because evil comes from women
SIR.42.13	as fast as moths that fly
SIR.42.13	from wool clothing.
SIR.42.14	Women are the cause
SIR.42.14	of so much disgrace,
SIR.42.14	that the wrong things men do
SIR.42.14	are better than the good
SIR.42.14	done by women.
SIR.42.15	Now let me tell you
SIR.42.15	what the Lord has done;
SIR.42.15	this is what I have seen.
SIR.42.15	When he gives a command,
SIR.42.15	things begin to happen,
SIR.42.15	and his creatures obey.
SIR.42.16	When the sun starts shining,
SIR.42.16	God's glory can be seen
SIR.42.16	in all the earth.
SIR.42.17	Even his angels cannot explain
SIR.42.17	everything he has done,
SIR.42.17	because he wants all creation
SIR.42.17	to show how great he is.
SIR.42.18	God knows everything—
SIR.42.18	from the unseen world
SIR.42.18	of the ocean floor,
SIR.42.18	to the secret thoughts
SIR.42.18	deep in our hearts,
SIR.42.18	to those things that change
SIR.42.18	from one age to the next.
SIR.42.19	God explains the past to us
SIR.42.19	and tells what lies ahead;
SIR.42.19	he even shows us clues
SIR.42.19	to the mysteries of creation.
SIR.42.20	Each thought and word
SIR.42.20	are known to him.
SIR.42.21	The laws of nature
SIR.42.21	show his great wisdom.
SIR.42.21	God has never changed
SIR.42.21	and never will;
SIR.42.21	he has no need of advice.
SIR.42.22	Look at his creation—
SIR.42.22	it sparkles with beauty,
SIR.42.23	and year after year, each part
SIR.42.23	fulfills its purpose.
SIR.42.24	Every part has an opposite,
SIR.42.24	and together,
SIR.42.24	they make creation complete,
SIR.42.25	each one contributing
SIR.42.25	something good to the other.
SIR.42.25	Who could ever see enough
SIR.42.25	of such majestic beauty?
SIR.43.1	Nothing can compare
SIR.43.1	with the glorious sight
SIR.43.1	of the clear, blue sky.
SIR.43.2	And you can almost hear
SIR.43.2	the rising sun say,
SIR.43.2	“I am a wonderful creation
SIR.43.2	of the Most High God.”
SIR.43.3	By noon its fiery heat
SIR.43.3	has dried out the soil.
SIR.43.3	It forces people into the shade,
SIR.43.4	and scorches mountain slopes.
SIR.43.4	The sun's blinding light
SIR.43.4	is three times hotter
SIR.43.4	than any fire we can build.
SIR.43.5	Our great Lord created the sun,
SIR.43.5	and when he commands,
SIR.43.5	it hurries to obey.
SIR.43.6	The moon also has its turn
SIR.43.6	in the sky
SIR.43.6	serving as a sign
SIR.43.6	of the changing months,
SIR.43.7	and setting the times
SIR.43.7	for sacred festivals.
SIR.43.7	When its light has become dark,
SIR.43.7	a new month begins—
SIR.43.8	the word “month”
SIR.43.8	even comes from “moon”—
SIR.43.8	then we watch in amazement,
SIR.43.8	as the moon gradually grows
SIR.43.8	until it is full,
SIR.43.8	giving light to God's armies
SIR.43.8	in the heavens above.
SIR.43.9	Heaven, the Lord's home,
SIR.43.9	is decorated at night
SIR.43.9	with beautiful, twinkling stars.
SIR.43.10	They never rest but stand guard
SIR.43.10	where he has placed them.
SIR.43.11	Look at the rainbow,
SIR.43.11	bright and beautiful,
SIR.43.11	and praise its Creator,
SIR.43.12	who bent it with his hands
SIR.43.12	and placed it around the sky.
SIR.43.13	At the Lord's command,
SIR.43.13	snow begins to fall,
SIR.43.13	and lightning quickly obeys.
SIR.43.14	And like birds, the clouds fly
SIR.43.14	from his storehouse.
SIR.43.15	He gives them his great power,
SIR.43.15	and he crushes hailstones.
SIR.43.15	* 
SIR.43.16	His voice thunders at the earth,
SIR.43.16	and at the sight of him,
SIR.43.16	mountains tremble.
SIR.43.17	The whirlwind obeys him,
SIR.43.17	as do winds from the south
SIR.43.17	and storms from the north.
SIR.43.17	God sends the snow,
SIR.43.17	and it settles on the ground
SIR.43.17	like a flock of birds
SIR.43.17	or a swarm of locusts.
SIR.43.18	We watch amazed
SIR.43.18	as it floats down,
SIR.43.18	white and lovely.
SIR.43.19	He sprinkles frost
SIR.43.19	as though it were salt,
SIR.43.19	and icicles form.
SIR.43.20	A freezing north wind
SIR.43.20	makes the surface of every pond
SIR.43.20	hard as armor.
SIR.43.21	God sends the fiery heat,
SIR.43.21	and deserted mountain pastures
SIR.43.21	are scorched and withered.
SIR.43.22	But soon the early morning mist
SIR.43.22	and the refreshing dew
SIR.43.22	will heal the damage.
SIR.43.23	The Lord calmed the oceans
SIR.43.23	and placed the islands,
SIR.43.23	all according to his plan.
SIR.43.24	And when sailors tell stories
SIR.43.24	of danger at sea,
SIR.43.24	we are amazed.
SIR.43.25	The oceans are home
SIR.43.25	to strange creatures
SIR.43.25	and huge monsters.
SIR.43.26	God tells each of these things
SIR.43.26	what to do,
SIR.43.26	and because of his power,
SIR.43.26	they never fail.
SIR.43.26	All creation is held together
SIR.43.26	by his command.
SIR.43.27	We could never finish telling
SIR.43.27	what God has done,
SIR.43.27	so we should say,
SIR.43.27	“The Lord can be seen
SIR.43.27	in all his creation.”
SIR.43.28	But he is far greater
SIR.43.28	than what he created,
SIR.43.28	so where can we look
SIR.43.28	for strength to praise him?
SIR.43.29	The Lord is fearsome
SIR.43.29	and powerful,
SIR.43.30	so always praise him
SIR.43.30	with all your strength.
SIR.43.30	Don't let yourself grow tired—
SIR.43.30	he deserves more praise
SIR.43.30	than you can give.
SIR.43.31	Since no one has seen the Lord
SIR.43.31	and described him to us,
SIR.43.31	we really don't know
SIR.43.31	how to praise him.
SIR.43.32	We have seen so little
SIR.43.32	of God's creation,
SIR.43.32	and we do not understand
SIR.43.32	so many things.
SIR.43.33	Still, the Lord created it all,
SIR.43.33	and he has given wisdom
SIR.43.33	to those who worship him.
SIR.44.1	Sing the praises of our ancestors,
SIR.44.1	those famous men
SIR.44.1	who lived long ago.
SIR.44.2	The Lord gave them honor
SIR.44.2	and showed them his power
SIR.44.2	from the very first.
SIR.44.3	Some of them were kings
SIR.44.3	or were famous
SIR.44.3	for their courage.
SIR.44.3	Some gave wise advice
SIR.44.3	or spoke messages from God.
SIR.44.4	There were leaders
SIR.44.4	who made good decisions,
SIR.44.4	who learned the wisdom
SIR.44.4	passed down by our people,
SIR.44.4	and who taught it to others.
SIR.44.5	Some of our ancestors
SIR.44.5	wrote poetry or music;
SIR.44.6	others were rich and powerful,
SIR.44.6	but lived in peace.
SIR.44.7	All these men
SIR.44.7	were highly honored
SIR.44.7	in their own time;
SIR.44.8	their reputations live on,
SIR.44.8	and even today
SIR.44.8	they still are praised.
SIR.44.9	Others of our people
SIR.44.9	are best
SIR.44.9	as if they and their descendants
SIR.44.9	had never been born.
SIR.44.10	But the ancestors we praise
SIR.44.10	were faithful to God,
SIR.44.10	and so we will remember
SIR.44.10	their good deeds.
SIR.44.11	Their good name
SIR.44.11	has been handed down,
SIR.44.11	generation by generation,
SIR.44.12	to those who follow them
SIR.44.12	in being faithful
SIR.44.12	to their agreement with God.
SIR.44.12	* 
SIR.44.13	Their families will live on,
SIR.44.13	and each new generation
SIR.44.13	will honor these ancestors,
SIR.44.14	even though their bodies
SIR.44.14	were long ago laid to rest.
SIR.44.15	Israel praises them,
SIR.44.15	and other nations still tell
SIR.44.15	about their wisdom.
SIR.44.16	and became an example
SIR.44.16	for all time,
SIR.44.16	and the Lord was so pleased
SIR.44.16	that he took Enoch to heaven.
SIR.44.17	And so when God in his anger
SIR.44.17	sent the flood
SIR.44.17	to sweep humans from the earth,
SIR.44.17	he spared Noah's life.
SIR.44.18	And God made an agreement
SIR.44.18	with him—
SIR.44.18	never again will such a flood
SIR.44.18	destroy all living creatures.
SIR.44.19	than Abraham, the great ancestor
SIR.44.19	of many nations.
SIR.44.20	He obeyed the Law
SIR.44.20	of God Most High
SIR.44.20	and made an agreement with God
SIR.44.20	that left a mark on his body.
SIR.44.20	And when tested by the Lord,
SIR.44.20	Abraham remained faithful.
SIR.44.21	And so, the Lord promised
SIR.44.21	that Abraham's descendants
SIR.44.21	would be more numerous
SIR.44.21	than the stars in the sky
SIR.44.21	or specks of dust on earth.
SIR.44.21	All nations would be blessed
SIR.44.21	by his descendants,
SIR.44.21	and they would be given land
SIR.44.21	from sea to sea,
SIR.44.21	and from the Euphrates River
SIR.44.21	to the end of the earth.
SIR.44.21	* 
SIR.44.22	 God later made the same promise
SIR.44.22	to Isaac, the son of Abraham.
SIR.44.22	God's agreement and promise
SIR.44.22	then came to Jacob—
SIR.44.22	all people would be blessed
SIR.44.22	by his descendants,
SIR.44.23	and God would bless him
SIR.44.23	and give him land to be divided
SIR.44.23	among the twelve tribes.
SIR.44.23	One of Jacob's descendants
SIR.44.23	was faithful to the Lord
SIR.44.23	and pleasing to everyone;
SIR.45.1	by Israel and God.
SIR.45.1	The man was Moses,
SIR.45.1	and we still give thanks
SIR.45.1	whenever we think of him.
SIR.45.2	The Lord gave Moses glory
SIR.45.2	equal to the angels
SIR.45.2	and power that terrified
SIR.45.2	his enemies.
SIR.45.2	* 
SIR.45.3	When Moses spoke,
SIR.45.3	miracles happened,
SIR.45.3	and even the king of Egypt
SIR.45.3	was forced to honor him.
SIR.45.3	The Lord chose Moses
SIR.45.3	to see his glory
SIR.45.3	and to receive the Law
SIR.45.4	because Moses was faithful
SIR.45.4	and humble.
SIR.45.5	He heard the Lord's voice
SIR.45.5	and saw him face to face,
SIR.45.5	when the Lord told him
SIR.45.5	to teach Israel the commands
SIR.45.5	that give knowledge and life.
SIR.45.6	was a holy man
SIR.45.6	from the tribe of Levi,
SIR.45.6	and the Lord chose him
SIR.45.6	* 
SIR.45.7	 and his descendants
SIR.45.7	to be Israel's priests
SIR.45.7	for all time.
SIR.45.7	The Lord told him to wear
SIR.45.7	glorious clothing
SIR.45.8	with beautiful decorations
SIR.45.8	and jewelry.
SIR.45.8	Three things truly showed
SIR.45.8	Aaron's priestly power—
SIR.45.8	the linen shorts, the robe,
SIR.45.8	and the sacred vest.
SIR.45.9	Pomegranates
SIR.45.9	along the hem of the robe,
SIR.45.9	and gold bells were sewn there,
SIR.45.9	so others could hear the ringing
SIR.45.9	as he walked in the temple.
SIR.45.9	* 
SIR.45.10	The vest was embroidered
SIR.45.10	with blue and purple yarn
SIR.45.10	and decorated with gold.
SIR.45.11	The breastpiece was decorated
SIR.45.11	with red yarn,
SIR.45.11	and it held the sacred items
SIR.45.11	used in getting answers
SIR.45.11	from God.
SIR.45.11	On it were precious stones,
SIR.45.11	set in finely worked gold
SIR.45.11	and engraved with the names
SIR.45.11	of Israel's twelve tribes.
SIR.45.12	On Aaron's turban
SIR.45.12	was a beautiful strip of gold
SIR.45.12	made by an expert
SIR.45.12	and engraved with the words,
SIR.45.12	“Dedicated to the Lord.”
SIR.45.13	All these things were made
SIR.45.13	for Aaron the priest,
SIR.45.13	and since his time,
SIR.45.13	only his descendants
SIR.45.13	have ever worn them.
SIR.45.14	Twice each day,
SIR.45.14	these priests offer sacrifices
SIR.45.14	to please the Lord.
SIR.45.15	by pouring sacred olive oil
SIR.45.15	on his head.
SIR.45.15	And the Lord promised Aaron
SIR.45.15	that his descendants would serve
SIR.45.15	as his priests forever
SIR.45.15	and bless the people of Israel
SIR.45.15	in his name.
SIR.45.16	The Lord chose only him
SIR.45.16	to burn sacrifices and incense
SIR.45.16	with a pleasing smell,
SIR.45.16	reminding the Lord of his people
SIR.45.16	and asking him
SIR.45.16	to forgive their sins.
SIR.45.17	Aaron was made a judge
SIR.45.17	and was given the Law
SIR.45.17	with instructions to teach it
SIR.45.17	to Israel.
SIR.45.18	some men who were not priests
SIR.45.18	became jealous of Aaron,
SIR.45.18	and they rebelled, led by Dathan,
SIR.45.18	Abiram, and Korah.
SIR.45.19	But the Lord wasn't pleased,
SIR.45.19	and to show he was furious,
SIR.45.19	he sent down fire
SIR.45.19	to destroy them.
SIR.45.20	The Lord honored Aaron
SIR.45.20	even more
SIR.45.20	by giving to him
SIR.45.20	the offerings of the first part
SIR.45.20	of the harvest.
SIR.45.20	And so these offerings
SIR.45.20	are the priests' inheritance,
SIR.45.21	along with other sacrifices
SIR.45.21	the Lord gave to them.
SIR.45.22	not a piece of ground
SIR.45.22	among the rest of Israel.
SIR.45.23	is almost as famous
SIR.45.23	as Moses and Aaron.
SIR.45.23	Phinehas was brave
SIR.45.23	and eager to obey the Lord,
SIR.45.23	when the other Israelites
SIR.45.23	were unfaithful.
SIR.45.23	And so, because of what he did,
SIR.45.23	God spared Israel
SIR.45.24	and promised to Phinehas
SIR.45.24	and his descendants
SIR.45.24	the honor of forever being
SIR.45.24	leaders of the nation
SIR.45.24	and priests in the temple.
SIR.45.25	According to this promise
SIR.45.25	made by the Lord,
SIR.45.25	only a descendant of Aaron
SIR.45.25	can be a priest,
SIR.45.25	just as Israel's king must be
SIR.45.25	from the family of David.
SIR.45.26	Give thanks to the Lord
SIR.45.26	who has given glory
SIR.45.26	to you priests.
SIR.45.26	I pray he will give you wisdom
SIR.45.26	so you will make fair decisions
SIR.45.26	when you judge his people.
SIR.45.26	Then they will be successful
SIR.45.26	and famous forever.
SIR.46.1	was a mighty warrior
SIR.46.1	and the next prophet
SIR.46.1	after Moses.
SIR.46.1	His name means,
SIR.46.1	“The Lord rescues,”
SIR.46.1	and Joshua did rescue Israel
SIR.46.1	by defeating their enemies,
SIR.46.1	as he led Israel into the land
SIR.46.1	God had promised them.
SIR.46.2	Joshua was glorious
SIR.46.2	as he raised his sword
SIR.46.2	and gave the signal
SIR.46.2	to attack a city.
SIR.46.3	He had more courage
SIR.46.3	than any warrior before him,
SIR.46.3	because he was fighting
SIR.46.3	at the Lord's command.
SIR.46.4	Joshua even kept the sun
SIR.46.4	from moving across the sky,
SIR.46.4	so that one day lasted
SIR.46.4	as long as two.
SIR.46.5	His enemies attacked all around,
SIR.46.5	but he prayed
SIR.46.5	to our Mighty God,
SIR.46.5	and the Lord, the Most High,
SIR.46.5	made deadly hailstones fall
SIR.46.5	on the enemy army.
SIR.46.6	As the battle moved down
SIR.46.6	the mountain slopes
SIR.46.6	Joshua defeated and destroyed
SIR.46.6	the enemy army,
SIR.46.6	so that everyone would know
SIR.46.6	he fought under the command
SIR.46.6	of the Mighty Lord of Israel,
SIR.46.6	and that the Lord himself
SIR.46.6	fought on their side.
SIR.46.7	along with Joshua,
SIR.46.7	proved he was loyal to God
SIR.46.7	by standing up to the people
SIR.46.7	who rebelled against Moses.
SIR.46.7	These two held back the people
SIR.46.7	from sinning
SIR.46.7	and put an end
SIR.46.7	to their complaints.
SIR.46.8	Six hundred thousand men died,
SIR.46.8	but Caleb and Joshua
SIR.46.8	were spared
SIR.46.8	and led Israel into the land
SIR.46.8	rich with milk and honey.
SIR.46.9	The Lord kept Caleb strong,
SIR.46.9	and although Caleb was old,
SIR.46.9	he captured the hill country.
SIR.46.9	Then he handed down his land
SIR.46.9	to his descendants
SIR.46.10	to remind Israel of the benefits
SIR.46.10	of being faithful to the Lord.
SIR.46.11	were the famous judges
SIR.46.11	who never turned from the Lord
SIR.46.11	to worship idols.
SIR.46.11	And we still honor them
SIR.46.11	because they were faithful.
SIR.46.12	Though they are now dead,
SIR.46.12	we pray their good names
SIR.46.12	will be honored by the way
SIR.46.12	their descendants live.
SIR.46.13	the prophet who appointed
SIR.46.13	the first kings of Israel
SIR.46.13	and other rulers.
SIR.46.14	Samuel judged the nation
SIR.46.14	according to the Lord's Law,
SIR.46.14	and so the Lord
SIR.46.14	watched over Israel.
SIR.46.15	The people knew that Samuel
SIR.46.15	spoke for the Lord,
SIR.46.15	because Samuel was faithful,
SIR.46.15	and his words came true.
SIR.46.16	One time, Israel's enemies
SIR.46.16	attacked from every side,
SIR.46.16	but Samuel prayed
SIR.46.16	to the Mighty Lord
SIR.46.16	and sacrificed a lamb.
SIR.46.17	Then the Lord thundered
SIR.46.17	his answer from heaven
SIR.46.18	and defeated the leaders
SIR.46.18	of Tyre and
SIR.46.19	Before Samuel died,
SIR.46.19	he asked the Lord and the king
SIR.46.19	to be his witnesses
SIR.46.19	so that no one could accuse him
SIR.46.19	of ever taking anything
SIR.46.19	that wasn't rightfully his—
SIR.46.19	not even a pair of sandals.
SIR.46.20	And then, after he had died,
SIR.46.20	he spoke from the grave
SIR.46.20	and predicted King Saul's death,
SIR.46.20	which brought to an end
SIR.46.20	Saul's disobedience.
SIR.47.1	and while David was king,
SIR.47.1	Nathan spoke God's message.
SIR.47.2	from Israel, his people,
SIR.47.2	just as the fat
SIR.47.2	is taken from sacrifices
SIR.47.2	and is given to the Lord.
SIR.47.3	David played with lions and bears
SIR.47.3	as if they were young goats
SIR.47.3	or lambs from his flock.
SIR.47.4	When David was a boy,
SIR.47.4	he put a stone in his sling
SIR.47.4	and swung it around.
SIR.47.4	Then he let the stone fly,
SIR.47.4	and it brought down Goliath,
SIR.47.4	the giant whose boasting
SIR.47.4	had put Israel to shame.
SIR.47.5	David had prayed
SIR.47.5	to the Lord Most High,
SIR.47.5	and the Lord gave David strength
SIR.47.5	to defeat this mighty soldier
SIR.47.5	and give victory to Israel.
SIR.47.6	Israel praised David
SIR.47.6	for killing enemies
SIR.47.6	by the thousands
SIR.47.6	and for being blessed
SIR.47.6	by the Lord.
SIR.47.6	And when he became king,
SIR.47.7	he conquered his enemies
SIR.47.7	on every side,
SIR.47.7	especially the Philistines,
SIR.47.7	who have never recovered.
SIR.47.8	Whenever David won a victory,
SIR.47.8	he thanked the Holy God
SIR.47.8	and sang songs of praise
SIR.47.8	with all his heart,
SIR.47.8	expressing love for his Creator,
SIR.47.8	the Lord Most High.
SIR.47.9	David also commanded singers
SIR.47.9	to stand in front of the altar
SIR.47.9	and sing beautiful songs.
SIR.47.10	And so, all day long,
SIR.47.10	at every festival,
SIR.47.10	Israel hears songs of praise
SIR.47.10	in the temple courtyard.
SIR.47.11	The Lord forgave David's sins
SIR.47.11	and made him a glorious king,
SIR.47.11	and he also promised
SIR.47.11	that the kings of Israel
SIR.47.11	would be David's descendants
SIR.47.11	for all time.
SIR.47.11	* 
SIR.47.12	Solomon, the wise son of David,
SIR.47.12	became the next king,
SIR.47.12	and for David's sake,
SIR.47.13	from attacking Israel.
SIR.47.13	And so, Solomon ruled
SIR.47.13	in a time of peace,
SIR.47.13	because he had been chosen
SIR.47.13	to build the Lord a temple
SIR.47.13	that would last forever.
SIR.47.14	When Solomon was young,
SIR.47.14	his wisdom overflowed
SIR.47.14	like a river
SIR.47.15	and spread across the land,
SIR.47.15	filling it with proverbs
SIR.47.15	and riddles.
SIR.47.16	He was famous in faraway islands;
SIR.47.16	he brought peace,
SIR.47.16	and so he was loved.
SIR.47.17	His songs, proverbs, stories,
SIR.47.17	and answers
SIR.47.17	amazed many nations.
SIR.47.18	of the Lord God of Israel
SIR.47.18	and gathered silver and gold
SIR.47.18	as if they were tin or lead.
SIR.47.19	and they used his desire for sex
SIR.47.19	to gain control over him.
SIR.47.20	Solomon ruined his reputation
SIR.47.20	and that of his descendants.
SIR.47.20	The Lord punished them
SIR.47.20	for Solomon's sins,
SIR.47.20	and they mourned,
SIR.47.21	broke away, dividing Israel.
SIR.47.22	to have mercy;
SIR.47.22	he will never abandon
SIR.47.22	those he has chosen
SIR.47.22	and who love him.
SIR.47.22	And so, the Lord has kept alive
SIR.47.22	a few of David's descendants
SIR.47.22	for the sake of Israel.
SIR.47.23	was his son Rehoboam,
SIR.47.23	the nation's worst fool,
SIR.47.23	and his senseless decisions
SIR.47.23	caused the people to rebel.
SIR.47.23	Then Jeroboam
SIR.47.23	led the northern kingdom
SIR.47.23	into sin.
SIR.47.23	* 
SIR.47.24	Israel sinned so much
SIR.47.24	and in so many ways,
SIR.47.24	that the Lord
SIR.47.24	finally punished them,
SIR.47.25	and they were led as prisoners
SIR.47.25	from their land.
SIR.48.1	the prophet Elijah
SIR.48.1	to speak messages
SIR.48.1	that burned like fire.
SIR.48.2	At Elijah's command,
SIR.48.2	a famine hit Israel,
SIR.48.2	and many of the people died.
SIR.48.3	Elijah performed miracles
SIR.48.3	by God's power—
SIR.48.3	he held back rain from Israel
SIR.48.3	and three times commanded fire
SIR.48.3	to fall from heaven.
SIR.48.4	He is worthy of honor,
SIR.48.4	because who else could do
SIR.48.4	such amazing miracles?
SIR.48.5	By the power of God Most High
SIR.48.5	he brought back life
SIR.48.5	into a dead body.
SIR.48.6	But he also destroyed kings
SIR.48.6	and told famous people
SIR.48.6	they would die of disease.
SIR.48.7	God corrected Elijah
SIR.48.7	at Mount Sinai
SIR.48.7	and told him to announce
SIR.48.7	that God's enemies
SIR.48.7	would be punished.
SIR.48.8	So Elijah appointed kings
SIR.48.8	to punish these enemies,
SIR.48.8	and he appointed prophets
SIR.48.8	to carry on his own work.
SIR.48.9	Then God took him to heaven
SIR.48.9	in a fiery whirlwind—
SIR.48.9	a chariot and horses
SIR.48.9	made of fire.
SIR.48.10	It is written that Elijah
SIR.48.10	will come at the right time,
SIR.48.10	to calm God's anger
SIR.48.10	before it overflows,
SIR.48.10	and help parents
SIR.48.10	love their children.
SIR.48.10	Then Israel will be successful
SIR.48.10	once again.
SIR.48.11	Those who live until he comes
SIR.48.11	will be blessed by the Lord,
SIR.48.11	and God's people who have died
SIR.48.11	will live again.
SIR.48.12	in the whirlwind,
SIR.48.12	God gave Elisha the same power
SIR.48.12	he had given to Elijah.
SIR.48.12	Elisha wasn't afraid of kings
SIR.48.12	and could not be forced
SIR.48.12	to do what they wanted.
SIR.48.12	* 
SIR.48.13	 No problem was too hard for him,
SIR.48.13	and he did marvelous things.
SIR.48.14	Even after his death,
SIR.48.14	his body caused a miracle.
SIR.48.15	still did not give up sinning
SIR.48.15	and they did not turn to God.
SIR.48.15	And so, they were captured
SIR.48.15	and led away
SIR.48.15	to foreign countries.
SIR.48.15	The kingdom of Judah
SIR.48.15	had few people,
SIR.48.15	but at least they had a king
SIR.48.15	from David's family.
SIR.48.16	Sometimes they did right,
SIR.48.16	but often they sinned
SIR.48.16	worse than ever.
SIR.48.17	and using iron tools
SIR.48.17	he cut a tunnel through rock
SIR.48.17	to bring water in,
SIR.48.17	and dug cisterns to store it.
SIR.48.18	Sennacherib attacked Judah,
SIR.48.18	and before he left,
SIR.48.18	he sent his highest officer
SIR.48.18	to Jerusalem.
SIR.48.18	This arrogant officer boasted,
SIR.48.18	making threats against Zion.
SIR.48.19	The people of Jerusalem
SIR.48.19	trembled with fear,
SIR.48.19	and they suffered
SIR.48.19	like a woman giving birth.
SIR.48.20	and prayed to the Lord,
SIR.48.20	the merciful and holy God.
SIR.48.20	He heard their prayers
SIR.48.20	and sent the prophet Isaiah
SIR.48.20	to rescue them.
SIR.48.21	Then the Lord sent an angel,
SIR.48.21	who killed all the Assyrians
SIR.48.21	in their own army camp.
SIR.48.22	Jerusalem was saved
SIR.48.22	because Hezekiah obeyed Isaiah
SIR.48.22	and pleased the Lord
SIR.48.22	by following the example
SIR.48.22	of his ancestor King David.
SIR.48.22	When this great prophet
SIR.48.22	had a vision, it came true.
SIR.48.23	to move backward,
SIR.48.23	and he gave a longer life
SIR.48.23	to the king.
SIR.48.24	God's Spirit gave him power
SIR.48.24	to see the future,
SIR.48.24	and he comforted those in Zion
SIR.48.24	who were in sorrow,
SIR.48.25	by telling them the secrets
SIR.48.25	hidden in the future
SIR.48.25	as far as the end of time.
SIR.49.1	is pleasant,
SIR.49.1	like skillfully mixed incense
SIR.49.1	or the taste of honey,
SIR.49.1	or like music at a banquet
SIR.49.1	where wine is served.
SIR.49.2	He did right and led the nation
SIR.49.2	to get rid of its idols
SIR.49.2	and turn back to God.
SIR.49.3	Many had rejected God's Law,
SIR.49.3	but Josiah was faithful
SIR.49.3	and encouraged others
SIR.49.3	to obey God.
SIR.49.4	David, Hezekiah, and Josiah
SIR.49.4	were good kings,
SIR.49.4	but the other kings of Judah
SIR.49.4	sinned terribly
SIR.49.4	and rejected the Law
SIR.49.4	of God Most High.
SIR.49.4	So he took away their kingdom
SIR.49.5	and gave their glorious power
SIR.49.5	to foreigners
SIR.49.6	the city God had chosen
SIR.49.6	for his temple.
SIR.49.6	The city streets lay empty,
SIR.49.6	just as Jeremiah had said.
SIR.49.7	He had been chosen as a prophet
SIR.49.7	before his birth
SIR.49.7	and was later told to speak
SIR.49.7	of doom and destruction,
SIR.49.7	of rising and rebuilding.
SIR.49.7	But the evil kings of Judah
SIR.49.7	mistreated him.
SIR.49.8	of the Lord's glory
SIR.49.8	above the living creatures
SIR.49.8	that were his chariot.
SIR.49.9	always did what was right.
SIR.49.10	I pray that the twelve prophets
SIR.49.10	will live on
SIR.49.10	in their descendants
SIR.49.10	because they helped Israel
SIR.49.10	stand firm during hard times
SIR.49.10	by giving them hope.
SIR.49.11	to praise Zerubbabel?
SIR.49.11	He was like a valuable ring
SIR.49.11	on the Lord's right hand,
SIR.49.12	They built a holy temple
SIR.49.12	for the Lord,
SIR.49.12	and it will always be famous.
SIR.49.13	because he rebuilt
SIR.49.13	the homes in Jerusalem;
SIR.49.13	he repaired the city walls
SIR.49.13	and put in strong new gates.
SIR.49.14	No one like Enoch
SIR.49.14	has ever been born—
SIR.49.14	he was taken up
SIR.49.14	from earth to heaven.
SIR.49.15	And no one like Joseph
SIR.49.15	has ever been born—
SIR.49.15	he kept Israel from starving
SIR.49.15	and ruled his brothers;
SIR.49.15	then after his death,
SIR.49.15	the people of Israel
SIR.49.15	watched over his bones.
SIR.49.16	Shem and Seth are also honored,
SIR.49.16	but of all God's creatures,
SIR.49.16	Adam was the greatest.
SIR.50.1	High Priest Simon
SIR.50.1	the son of Onias
SIR.50.1	repaired and fortified
SIR.50.1	the temple,
SIR.50.2	and he laid the foundations
SIR.50.2	for the high double walls
SIR.50.2	that went around it.
SIR.50.3	Simon also dug a cistern
SIR.50.3	as big as the large bronze bowl
SIR.50.3	called “the Sea.”
SIR.50.4	He fortified Jerusalem
SIR.50.4	and drew up plans
SIR.50.4	in case it was ever attacked
SIR.50.4	or surrounded.
SIR.50.5	When he came out
SIR.50.5	from the Most Holy Place
SIR.50.5	and walked among the people,
SIR.50.5	he looked glorious,
SIR.50.6	like the morning star
SIR.50.6	between the clouds
SIR.50.6	or a full moon
SIR.50.6	during a festival,
SIR.50.7	or like sunshine on the temple
SIR.50.7	of God Most High,
SIR.50.7	or a brilliant rainbow
SIR.50.7	set against beautiful clouds.
SIR.50.8	Seeing him was as pleasant
SIR.50.8	as the first roses of spring
SIR.50.8	or lilies beside a stream,
SIR.50.8	or green grass on a hot day
SIR.50.8	in the Lebanon mountains.
SIR.50.9	He was majestic, like the smoke
SIR.50.9	from burning incense,
SIR.50.9	or a golden bowl set with jewels
SIR.50.9	of every kind,
SIR.50.10	or like an olive tree
SIR.50.10	heavy with olives,
SIR.50.10	or a cypress tree
SIR.50.10	reaching toward the clouds.
SIR.50.11	The whole temple courtyard
SIR.50.11	reflected his glory
SIR.50.11	when he wore his special robes
SIR.50.11	and went up to the sacred altar.
SIR.50.12	Then he stood beside the altar,
SIR.50.12	and other priests gave him
SIR.50.12	the sacrifices to be burned.
SIR.50.12	These priests stood around him
SIR.50.12	like palm trees near a cedar
SIR.50.12	in the Lebanon mountains.
SIR.50.13	They wore beautiful robes
SIR.50.13	and held the sacrifices
SIR.50.13	in their hands.
SIR.50.13	All Israel watched
SIR.50.14	while Simon placed each offering
SIR.50.14	on the altar fires.
SIR.50.15	Then he was handed a cup
SIR.50.15	of blood-red wine,
SIR.50.15	which he poured out
SIR.50.15	at the foot of the altar
SIR.50.15	as a pleasant-smelling offering
SIR.50.15	to God Most High,
SIR.50.15	the King of all creation.
SIR.50.16	After this, the priests shouted
SIR.50.16	and blew silver trumpets,
SIR.50.16	making a loud noise
SIR.50.16	as a prayer
SIR.50.16	to the Most High God.
SIR.50.17	Immediately, everyone bowed
SIR.50.17	with their face to the ground
SIR.50.17	to worship the all-powerful
SIR.50.17	Lord God Most High.
SIR.50.18	The temple choir began singing,
SIR.50.18	and sweet songs of praise
SIR.50.18	echoed through the courtyard.
SIR.50.19	Meanwhile, the people prayed
SIR.50.19	to their God,
SIR.50.19	the merciful Lord Most High,
SIR.50.19	until the ceremonies of worship
SIR.50.19	were finished.
SIR.50.20	from the altar
SIR.50.20	and raised his hands
SIR.50.20	to praise the Lord
SIR.50.20	and to bless the people
SIR.50.20	in his name.
SIR.50.21	They bowed down again
SIR.50.21	to receive Simon's blessing
SIR.50.21	and to worship God Most High.
SIR.50.22	Praise the God of all creation,
SIR.50.22	because he works miracles
SIR.50.22	everywhere on earth.
SIR.50.22	He watches over us as we grow,
SIR.50.22	and shows mercy to us.
SIR.50.23	Now we pray for happiness
SIR.50.23	and peace in Israel,
SIR.50.23	as it used to be.
SIR.50.24	May he be merciful
SIR.50.24	and rescue us before we die.
SIR.50.24	* 
SIR.50.25	Two nations I hate are Edom
SIR.50.25	and Philistia,
SIR.50.26	and I also hate
SIR.50.26	the people of Shechem—
SIR.50.26	those fools are unworthy
SIR.50.26	to even be called a nation.
SIR.50.27	My name is Jesus son of Eleazar
SIR.50.27	son of Sirach,
SIR.50.27	and I wrote this book
SIR.50.27	to help you learn and understand
SIR.50.27	the wisdom that overflows
SIR.50.27	from my heart.
SIR.50.28	If you read and pay attention
SIR.50.28	to the wisdom in this book,
SIR.50.28	you will be happy and wise.
SIR.50.29	The Lord's wisdom gives light
SIR.50.29	to the pathway of life.
SIR.50.29	Follow wisdom,
SIR.50.29	and you will never fail.
SIR.51.1	I praise you, Lord God,
SIR.51.1	because you are my king,
SIR.51.1	and you rescued me.
SIR.51.1	I give you thanks
SIR.51.2	for protection and help
SIR.51.2	when I was in danger
SIR.51.2	from enemies
SIR.51.2	who tried to destroy me
SIR.51.2	with cruel lies.
SIR.51.3	My enemies wanted me dead
SIR.51.3	and were about
SIR.51.3	to gobble me up,
SIR.51.3	but you had pity and rescued me
SIR.51.3	from the trouble they caused.
SIR.51.4	I was surrounded by fires
SIR.51.4	they had set,
SIR.51.4	and I could not breathe
SIR.51.4	for the smoke.
SIR.51.4	* 
SIR.51.5	Death was ready to swallow me,
SIR.51.5	because their filthy lies
SIR.51.6	had reached the king.
SIR.51.6	I was standing at the edge
SIR.51.6	of an open grave.
SIR.51.7	Enemies surrounded me,
SIR.51.7	and I called for help—
SIR.51.7	but no one came.
SIR.51.8	Then, Lord, I remembered
SIR.51.8	your mercy and kindness
SIR.51.8	and how you have always saved
SIR.51.8	those who trusted you
SIR.51.8	when they were attacked
SIR.51.8	by evil people.
SIR.51.9	So I prayed and cried out,
SIR.51.9	“Don't let me die!
SIR.51.10	I am in trouble,
SIR.51.10	facing arrogant enemies
SIR.51.10	with no one to help me.
SIR.51.10	But you are my Lord and Father,
SIR.51.10	so please don't let me down.
SIR.51.10	Rescue me,
SIR.51.11	and I will honor you forever
SIR.51.11	with songs of praise.”
SIR.51.11	I know you heard my prayer,
SIR.51.12	because you saved me from death
SIR.51.12	and rescued me from danger.
SIR.51.12	That's why I thank you
SIR.51.12	and give you honor and praise.
SIR.51.12	* 
SIR.51.13	When I was young
SIR.51.13	and before I had traveled,
SIR.51.14	I prayed in the temple courtyard
SIR.51.14	and openly asked for Wisdom.
SIR.51.14	And I will look for her
SIR.51.14	every day of my life.
SIR.51.15	Now I am old,
SIR.51.15	but ever since I was a child,
SIR.51.15	I have loved Wisdom
SIR.51.15	and always followed her
SIR.51.15	on the path where she walked.
SIR.51.16	When I listened even a little
SIR.51.16	to what she said,
SIR.51.16	I learned many things.
SIR.51.17	So I continued to study,
SIR.51.17	and I praise God,
SIR.51.17	who gives me Wisdom.
SIR.51.18	I chose to live by Wisdom
SIR.51.18	and always do right,
SIR.51.18	and I have never had a reason
SIR.51.18	to be ashamed.
SIR.51.19	Whenever I had to struggle
SIR.51.19	to follow her completely,
SIR.51.19	I would lift my hands in prayer
SIR.51.19	and tell God I was sorry
SIR.51.19	I knew so little of Wisdom.
SIR.51.20	But I was set on finding her,
SIR.51.20	and I did, by removing sin
SIR.51.20	from my heart.
SIR.51.20	Now, I grow wiser and wiser,
SIR.51.20	and she will never leave me.
SIR.51.21	I made the effort to find Wisdom
SIR.51.21	because I really wanted her,
SIR.51.21	and she is worth it all.
SIR.51.22	The Lord also rewarded me
SIR.51.22	with a gift for using words,
SIR.51.22	and so I will use that gift
SIR.51.22	to offer him praise.
SIR.51.23	If Wisdom is a subject
SIR.51.23	you have never studied,
SIR.51.23	then come to my school.
SIR.51.24	If your desire for her
SIR.51.24	is like a great thirst,
SIR.51.24	why haven't you quenched it?
SIR.51.25	Here is my advice—
SIR.51.25	you cannot buy Wisdom,
SIR.51.26	and you need not travel far.
SIR.51.26	You just have to be willing
SIR.51.26	to do what she says.
SIR.51.27	Studying wisdom has filled
SIR.51.27	my life with peace,
SIR.51.27	and you can see it is worth
SIR.51.27	any effort I have made.
SIR.51.28	And even if learning Wisdom
SIR.51.28	costs you a lot of silver,
SIR.51.28	she will bring you
SIR.51.28	even more in gold.
SIR.51.29	Celebrate the mercy of God!
SIR.51.29	Don't be ashamed to tell others
SIR.51.29	how great he is.
SIR.51.30	Work when it is time to work,
SIR.51.30	and God will reward you
SIR.51.30	when the time is right.
BAR.1.2	on the seventh day of the month of Ab,
BAR.1.4	the government officials and the religious leaders, together with all the people of Israel, both young and old, who lived in Babylon near the Sud River.
BAR.1.5	After they had listened to me read the book, everyone cried and prayed to the Lord, then went without eating to show their sorrow. 
BAR.1.6	They collected as much money as they could 
BAR.1.7	and sent it to Jerusalem for Priest Jehoiakim
BAR.1.8	On the tenth day of the month of Sivan,
BAR.1.9	and that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia
BAR.1.10	The Jews living in Babylon wrote the following letter for Baruch to take with him to Judah:
BAR.1.10	Please use the money we are sending to buy animals for sacrifices to please the Lord
BAR.1.11	Pray that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his son Belshazzar will live forever, like the heavens above. 
BAR.1.12	And pray that the Lord will keep our people strong and show us how to be faithful. Then King Nebuchadnezzar and King Belshazzar will be pleased with us and protect us, and in return we will be loyal to them. 
BAR.1.13	Finally, pray for us—we have sinned against the Lord our God, and he is still angry. 
BAR.1.14	When you go to the temple during festivals and other religious celebrations to confess your sins to the Lord, be sure to have this book read aloud.
BAR.1.15	Pray the following prayer when you confess your sins to the Lord:
BAR.1.15	The Lord our God always does right, but we are deeply ashamed of what we have done. We are the people of Judah and Jerusalem, but all of us, 
BAR.1.16	including our kings and rulers, our priests and prophets, are guilty. Even our ancestors did what was wrong! 
BAR.1.17	We have all sinned against the Lord our God. 
BAR.1.18	We have disobeyed him and have refused to follow the laws he has given. 
BAR.1.19	In fact, ever since the Lord brought our ancestors out of Egypt, we have been unfaithful and have ignored him. 
BAR.1.20	 The Lord rescued our ancestors from Egypt, so that he could give them a land that is rich with milk and honey. He also warned his servant Moses that terrible things would happen, if our ancestors refused to obey the Lord. And so, because they disobeyed him, we are suffering from those curses. 
BAR.1.21	Even when the Lord's prophets came and told us how the Lord our God wanted us to live, we refused to listen. 
BAR.1.22	Instead, we did what we wanted and followed our own evil ways—we worshiped other gods and did what the Lord hated.
BAR.2.1	That's why the Lord did everything he threatened. He punished our judges, our kings, and our leaders, as well as the people of Israel and Judah.
BAR.2.2	The Lord severely punished the city of Jerusalem, just as he had warned in the Law of Moses. Nothing on earth has ever been as horrible as that destruction. 
BAR.2.3	There was so little food that some of us ate our own children. 
BAR.2.4	The Lord scattered our people all over the world, where foreign nations ruled over us and insulted and made fun of us. 
BAR.2.5	Our country was defeated and humiliated in every way, because we had disobeyed the Lord our God and sinned against him.
BAR.2.6	Our Lord God, we are filled with shame, just as our ancestors were in the past. You were right 
BAR.2.7	to punish us terribly, just as you had warned us. 
BAR.2.8	Even then we refused to stop our evil ways and turn back to you. 
BAR.2.9+BAR.2.10	All your commands are completely fair, yet we were unfaithful and rejected the Law you had given us. That's why you punished us in all these painful ways that you had kept ready for us.
BAR.2.11	Lord God of Israel, you brought your people out of Egypt and worked miracles to show your mighty power. You made a great name for yourself, and you are still famous.
BAR.2.12	But we have sinned against you, our Lord God. We have been unfaithful and have disobeyed all your commands. 
BAR.2.13	There are only a few of us left here in the nations where you scattered us. Please stop being angry! 
BAR.2.14	Listen to our sincere prayer and rescue us, so that you will bring honor to your name. Let those who led us away as captives have pity on us. 
BAR.2.15	Then everyone in the world will know that you, the Lord God, have chosen the people of Israel to be your very own.
BAR.2.16	Look down from your home in heaven, Lord, and think about us. Listen when we call out to you. 
BAR.2.17	Open your eyes and see how we are suffering. Those who are in the world of the dead have no life and cannot praise you or tell others how fair and just you are. 
BAR.2.18	But even though we are in terrible pain, and we can hardly see or walk, we are alive. And so we can praise you and tell others how good you are.
BAR.2.19	Our Lord God, we pray for your mercy, even though our ancestors and our kings refused to do what was right. 
BAR.2.20	You have punished us in your anger, just as your servants the prophets warned. 
BAR.2.21	 Long ago, your prophets gave us your message and told us that if we would obey the king of Babylonia and serve him, we would not be carried away from our homeland. 
BAR.2.22	They told us that if we refused to obey you and serve the king, 
BAR.2.23	 you would make Judah and Jerusalem places of sadness where no joyful sounds are heard, even at wedding feasts. You threatened to make our country an empty wasteland.
BAR.2.25	and now lie scattered all over, scorched by the sun during the day and covered with frost at night. Our ancestors died horrible deaths from starvation, war, and disease. 
BAR.2.26	And because the people of Israel and Judah did evil, you destroyed the temple that was built in your honor, and it lies in ruins even today.
BAR.2.27	But you, Lord God, have shown us mercy. You are always patient and kind, 
BAR.2.28	 just as you told your servant Moses on the day you commanded him to write down your Law while our ancestors watched. Then you said:
BAR.2.29	If you refuse to obey me, I will scatter you among the nations, and this mighty nation of yours will be nothing but a handful of people. 
BAR.2.30	Yet I know you will disobey me, because you people are stubborn! Someday, after you have been taken captive and forced to live in foreign nations, you will realize what you have done. 
BAR.2.31	Then you will know I am the Lord your God. I will give you a new heart, and you will be faithful and will listen to what I say. 
BAR.2.32	There in the nation where you are living, you will praise me and turn back to me. 
BAR.2.33	You will remember what happened to your ancestors when they sinned against me, and you will stop being stubborn and wicked. 
BAR.2.34	Then I will let you return to the land that I promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You will once again rule there and increase in numbers. Never again will you be a small, powerless country. 
BAR.2.35	 I will make a solemn agreement with you, and it will last forever—I will be your God, and you will be my people. I will promise never again to take you out of the land that I have given you as your own.
BAR.3.1	Lord All-Powerful, God of Israel, we are worn out with trouble and distress, and we pray to you for help. 
BAR.3.2	Though we have sinned against you, won't you answer our prayer and have mercy on us. 
BAR.3.3	You rule as king forever, but when we die, we are gone forever. 
BAR.3.4	So when we cry out to you, please listen. We are almost dead, because we are being punished for the sins of our ancestors. 
BAR.3.5	Forget their sins, and think only of your own power and glory. 
BAR.3.6	You are the Lord our God, and we will praise you. 
BAR.3.7	You have made us fear you, so that we would pray to you. We are here as captives, yet we will praise you and turn from the sinful ways of our ancestors. 
BAR.3.8	They sinned against you, and you have punished us by scattering us here among the nations, where we have been insulted and cursed.
BAR.3.10	You have lived in this enemy land so long that you are now much older. You are unfit to worship the Lord and are unclean, like a dead body.
BAR.3.11	In fact, you are almost dead yourselves! Don't you know why these things are happening to you? 
BAR.3.12	It's because you have turned away from the only source of wisdom. 
BAR.3.13	If you had followed the ways of God, you would have lived in peace forever. 
BAR.3.14	Learn where wisdom, strength, and knowledge come from. Then you will know how to have a long and peaceful life, and you will find light to guide you.
BAR.3.16	People have tried hard to find her, including rulers of nations, people who tamed wild animals 
BAR.3.17	and raised birds, greedy people who did anything to get more of the silver and gold they believed would protect them, 
BAR.3.18	and selfish people who worried about not having enough money and thought of ways to make more. But all of these people have disappeared—they died 
BAR.3.19	and went to the world below, and others have taken their place.
BAR.3.20+BAR.3.21	Neither could any of their descendants find the way to knowledge. They couldn't find out how to gain Wisdom or even how to look for her.
BAR.3.22	The Canaanites and the Edomites never heard of Wisdom. 
BAR.3.23	The Ishmaelites
BAR.3.25	There is no end to the universe, and no one can measure its width or height. 
BAR.3.26	 Long ago, the famous giants were born here. They were powerful and skilled warriors, 
BAR.3.27	yet God did not choose them to be his own or tell them the way to knowledge. 
BAR.3.28	So they all died because they were fools and lacked Wisdom.
BAR.3.29	No one has gone up into heaven and brought Wisdom down to earth. 
BAR.3.30	No one has sailed across the ocean and found her or bought her with pure gold. 
BAR.3.31	There's no one who knows how to gain Wisdom or how to find the path that leads to her.
BAR.3.32	God alone knows Wisdom, because he knows everything. In fact, he discovered Wisdom with his own knowledge. God created the earth to last forever, and then filled it with all kinds of animals. 
BAR.3.33	When he commanded light to shine, it trembled and obeyed, and now goes wherever he sends it. 
BAR.3.34	Even the stars obeyed his voice, and they are happy to shine wherever and whenever he commands. 
BAR.3.35	He is our God, and nothing is as great as he is. 
BAR.3.36	God found the complete way to knowledge, then gave it to his servant Israel, the one he loved. 
BAR.3.37	Since then, Wisdom has lived on earth among human beings.
BAR.4.2	People of Israel,
BAR.4.3	Don't give away to any other nation the glorious Wisdom that rightfully belongs to you. 
BAR.4.4	We should celebrate, because we are the people of Israel, the only ones who know what pleases God.
BAR.4.5	Be brave, my people. Keep Israel's name alive! 
BAR.4.6	You were not sold to enemy nations to be destroyed. Instead, those nations dragged you away as captives because you did things that God hated. 
BAR.4.7	God is your Creator, yet you made him angry by offering sacrifices to demons instead of to him. 
BAR.4.8	You rejected the eternal God who gave you life. And you caused much sadness for Jerusalem, the city that was a mother to you. 
BAR.4.9	When she saw God punish you in anger, she said:
BAR.4.9	Listen to me, you nearby towns. God has made me very sad, 
BAR.4.10	because I have watched my children Israel being dragged away to foreign nations. The eternal God has done this to punish them! 
BAR.4.11	I was very happy raising my children, but now I cry and mourn while they are taken from me. 
BAR.4.12	Please don't be happy about my sadness. I am a widow and a deserted city—all of my children have been forced to leave because they rejected God's Law. 
BAR.4.13	They ignored and refused to obey his teachings. His laws would have helped them live right, yet my children simply refused to obey.
BAR.4.14	Come and see how the eternal God has punished my children by leading them away as captives! 
BAR.4.15	God brought a cruel and foreign nation here, and it had no pity on anyone, whether young or old. 
BAR.4.16	That nation stole my sons and daughters, and now I am a lonely widow.
BAR.4.17	As for you, my children Israel, I can do nothing to help you. 
BAR.4.18	God punished you in these terrible ways, and now only God can rescue you from your enemies. 
BAR.4.19	 Go on with your life, my children—I am alone. 
BAR.4.20	I have taken off the clothes I wore during my time of peace, and I have put on the clothes that show I am in mourning. I will cry out to the eternal God until the day I die.
BAR.4.21	Be brave, my children, and beg God to help you! He is the one who will rescue you from your powerful enemy. 
BAR.4.22	I know without a doubt that the Holy and eternal God will save you. In fact, it makes me happy to think that he will soon show you mercy. 
BAR.4.23	I cried and moaned as I watched you leave, but God will bring you back to me, and I will celebrate and shout forever. 
BAR.4.24	The neighboring cities also watched while you were taken captive. And soon they will see your eternal God save you with his mighty and glorious power.
BAR.4.25	For now, my children, be patient. God has punished you in anger, and your enemies rule over you. Yet soon they will be destroyed, and you will have power over them. 
BAR.4.26	My dear children, you are suffering now in a foreign nation, like sheep that have been dragged off by an enemy.
BAR.4.27	Be brave and cry out to God for help. He has not forgotten you, even though he has done all these things to punish you. 
BAR.4.28	Just as you were determined to turn away from God in the past, you should be ten times more determined to obey him now. 
BAR.4.29	The same God who punished you with these disasters will save you and give you never-ending happiness.
BAR.4.30	City of Jerusalem, be brave! Your God chose you long ago as his own, and he will soon comfort you. 
BAR.4.31	Disaster will come to those nations who mistreated you and celebrated your destruction. 
BAR.4.32	The cities that made your children their slaves will one day be miserable, and the city of Babylon, where your people now live, will suffer pain. 
BAR.4.33	Babylon was glad when you fell and were destroyed; now she will moan at her own destruction. 
BAR.4.34	God will turn her pride into mourning, and she will no longer be proud of her great people. 
BAR.4.35	The eternal God will send down fire, and she will burn for days and days, until nothing can live there except demons.
BAR.4.36+BAR.4.37	Jerusalem, look toward the east and be glad, because God is bringing your children home! They were once dragged away as captives, yet at his command they are now gathered together from the east and the west and are praising God's glorious power.
BAR.5.2	Wear the robe of God's justice and the crown of his eternal power. 
BAR.5.3	God will let every nation on earth see your brightness, 
BAR.5.4	and he will give you this new name forever: “Right-Living-Brings-Peace and Faith-in-God-Brings-Honor.”
BAR.5.5	So stand on top of the mountain and look east. Our Holy God has gathered your children from the east and the west, and they are celebrating because he hasn't forgotten them. 
BAR.5.6	 Their enemies forced them to leave on foot, and now God will bring them back to you with great honor, as if they were kings being carried on beautiful thrones. 
BAR.5.7	He has commanded every high mountain and ancient hill to be made low, and every valley to be filled up, so that the people of Israel can return home safely on level ground. They will show God's glory to the world. 
BAR.5.8	God has commanded every forest and every sweet-smelling tree to shade the Israelites 
BAR.5.9	as he leads them home, and they will celebrate and shout for joy on their way. The brightness of God's own glory will guide them, and his mercy and justice will go with them.
LJE.1_1.2	You have sinned against God! That's why King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia
LJE.1_1.3	You will be forced to live there a very long time—as long as seven generations. Then God will lead you home in peace.
LJE.1_1.4	While you are in Babylon, you will see people carrying around idols made of silver and gold and wood. The people worship these so-called gods out of fear that something terrible might happen if they refuse. 
LJE.1_1.5	Don't act like these heathens or be frightened into worshiping their idols. 
LJE.1_1.6	When you see crowds worshiping idols, tell yourselves to worship only the Lord, 
LJE.1_1.7	and God's angel will help you.
LJE.1_1.8	Idols are not really gods—they can't even talk! They are covered with gold and silver, and their tongues were carved out of wood. 
LJE.1_1.9	People make gold crowns like the ones young women love to wear, and they put these crowns on their idols. 
LJE.1_1.10	Sometimes the priests steal the gold and silver from these idols and spend it on themselves 
LJE.1_1.11	or give it to temple prostitutes.
LJE.1_1.11	People dress up their idols as if they were human, even though they are nothing but chunks of silver or gold or wood. 
LJE.1_1.12	They cannot even protect themselves from rust and decay.
LJE.1_1.13	but someone needs to wipe off their faces when dust from the temple settles on them. 
LJE.1_1.14	These idols hold a scepter
LJE.1_1.15	Some of them even hold small swords or axes, but they cannot defend themselves from being destroyed in war or stolen. 
LJE.1_1.16	All of this proves that idols are not gods. So don't fear them!
LJE.1_1.17	A broken dish is useless! 
LJE.1_1.18	And so are the idols in the temples. They can't see, because their eyes are covered with the dust that people stir up when they walk. These idols are locked up in their temples like prisoners about to be put to death for committing a crime against the king. They can't protect the temples, so the priests must close the heavy doors and lock them with bolts to keep robbers out. 
LJE.1_1.19	The priests light more lamps in honor of the idols than they do for themselves, yet the idols can't see even one of them. 
LJE.1_1.20	These idols are nothing but wood, just like the beams in the temple, and their insides and their clothes are eaten by worms and insects. They don't even know 
LJE.1_1.21	when the smoke in the temple makes their faces black. 
LJE.1_1.22	Bats, swallows, and other birds perch on their heads and bodies, and cats sleep on them. 
LJE.1_1.23	All this proves that idols are not gods. So don't fear them!
LJE.1_1.24+LJE.1_1.25	No matter how much money it took to make these idols, there is no life in them. They didn't feel a thing when they were being made out of melted gold poured into molds—even the gold used to make them beautiful must be polished before it shines.
LJE.1_1.26	They are so helpless that they must be carried around—they can't walk on their own.
LJE.1_1.26	People who worship idols are put to shame, 
LJE.1_1.27	because whenever an idol falls, someone has to pick it up. And after someone sets it back up, the idol cannot move itself anywhere. Even if an idol starts to lean, it cannot straighten itself up.
LJE.1_1.27	Offering gifts to an idol is no better than giving gifts to a dead body.
LJE.1_1.28	The priests sell the sacrifices that have been offered to these idols and spend the money on themselves. And their wives use salt to preserve any leftover meat from the sacrifices, then save it for their own use, instead of giving it to the poor. 
LJE.1_1.29	Women who are having their monthly periods or who have just given birth are even allowed to touch the sacrifices offered to these idols.
LJE.1_1.30	How could these idols of silver and gold and wood ever be gods, when women are allowed to make offerings to them?
LJE.1_1.31	The priests shave their beards and hair when they mourn, then they go to the temples in torn clothes, where they sit with their heads uncovered. 
LJE.1_1.32	They moan and shout in the temples of these idols, just as some people do at a funeral. 
LJE.1_1.33	They even take some of the idols' clothes and give them to their own wives and children. 
LJE.1_1.34	You see, it doesn't matter how anyone treats these idols—they cannot reward or punish in return.
LJE.1_1.34	Idols aren't able to help anyone become king or take away a king's power. 
LJE.1_1.35	They can't make people rich or force them to pay for not keeping a promise. 
LJE.1_1.36	These idols cannot keep anyone from dying or protect the weak from the strong. 
LJE.1_1.37	They can't give sight to a blind person or rescue someone from danger 
LJE.1_1.38	or show mercy to widows and orphans. 
LJE.1_1.39	These idols are nothing but chunks of wood covered with gold and silver. They are no more powerful than stones dug from a mountain, and all who worship them will be put to shame. 
LJE.1_1.40	Only a fool would think that these idols should be called gods!
LJE.1_1.40	The Babylonians dishonor their own gods by deserting them when they are unable to help. For example, when the Babylonians see a person who cannot talk, they ask the god Bel to heal that person, as if Bel can really hear and understand. 
LJE.1_1.41	 But when the Babylonians realize these gods have no sense, they just leave them.
LJE.1_1.42	Some Babylonian women wrap cords around their heads as a decoration,
LJE.1_1.43	And after one of them returns from sleeping with a stranger, that prostitute makes fun of the one sitting next to her for not being pretty enough to be chosen.
LJE.1_1.44	Everything the Babylonians do to serve their idols is useless. How could anyone ever believe that idols are gods?
LJE.1_1.45	Idols are made by woodworkers and metalworkers, and so the idols always turn out to be exactly what the workers want. 
LJE.1_1.46	These workers are humans and die like everyone else. 
LJE.1_1.47	How could they ever make a god? The only thing they can leave for future generations is deceit and disgrace.
LJE.1_1.48	When war or trouble comes, priests must decide where they will go to escape and hide with their so-called gods. 
LJE.1_1.49	The idols cannot save themselves from war or trouble because they aren't gods.
LJE.1_1.50	Idols are nothing more than wood covered with gold and silver. Someday people will finally realize that they are fake. 
LJE.1_1.51	People from every nation, including kings, will know that these powerless idols were made by human hands. 
LJE.1_1.52	Everyone will realize that they are not gods.
LJE.1_1.53	Idols don't have the power to make someone king or to send rain. 
LJE.1_1.54	They can't make their own decisions or free a person who has been wronged. They are powerless 
LJE.1_1.55	and as useless as crows flying through the air.
LJE.1_1.55	If a temple catches on fire, the priests will run to safety. But since the idols are merely wood covered with gold or silver, they will burn like logs.
LJE.1_1.56	Since idols cannot oppose an enemy or a king, it's foolish to believe they are gods.
LJE.1_1.57	These wooden idols covered with silver and gold cannot even protect themselves from thieves, 
LJE.1_1.58	who strip off the silver and gold, as well as the clothes. All of it can be easily carried off by robbers because these false gods can do nothing to stop them.
LJE.1_1.59	Anything is better than an idol, including a brave king, a household pot, a door that protects things in a house, or a wooden column in a palace. All these are more useful than false gods.
LJE.1_1.60+LJE.1_1.61	The sun, moon, and stars, as well as the lightning and the wind, all do what they are supposed to do. 
LJE.1_1.62+LJE.1_1.63	And when God tells clouds to cover the earth or commands fire to burn forests, they also obey. But idols cannot do a thing! 
LJE.1_1.64	No one should ever believe that idols are gods. They can't help anyone or make decisions about justice. 
LJE.1_1.65	You know they are not gods, so why fear them?
LJE.1_1.66	Idols cannot punish or bless kings, 
LJE.1_1.67	and they can't make strange things happen in the sky. They don't shine like the sun or the moon. 
LJE.1_1.68	Even wild animals are better off than idols—at least they can run to protect themselves from danger. 
LJE.1_1.69	Nothing shows that these idols are gods. So don't fear them!
LJE.1_1.70	The Babylonian gods are pieces of wood covered with gold and silver, and they are as helpless as a scarecrow guarding a cucumber patch. 
LJE.1_1.71	They are like a thornbush that birds use as a place to perch or like a dead body thrown out into the darkness. 
LJE.1_1.72	The purple linen
LJE.1_1.73	People who do right have no use at all for idols. And these people are better off, because they will never be put to shame.
