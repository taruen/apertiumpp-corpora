GEN.1.1	In the beginning, God began to make the earth and the 
GEN.1.2	The earth was without shape. Nothing was alive on it. Deep water covered the earth. There was no light. Everywhere was dark. The Spirit of God moved above the water. 
GEN.1.3	God said ‘I want light to appear.’
GEN.1.3	And there was light.
GEN.1.4	God looked at the light.
GEN.1.4	And he saw that it was good.
GEN.1.4	He separated the light from the dark.
GEN.1.5	God called the light ‘day’. And he called the dark ‘night’.
GEN.1.5	Evening passed and morning came.
GEN.1.5	This was the first (1st) day. 
GEN.1.6	Then God said ‘A wide space will appear between the waters. So the waters will separate. Some of the water will stay above the space. The rest of the water will stay below the space.’
GEN.1.7	So God made a wide space. He separated the water under the space from the water above it.
GEN.1.7	And what God said happened.
GEN.1.8	God called the wide space ‘sky’.
GEN.1.8	Evening passed and then it was morning.
GEN.1.8	This was the second (2nd) day.
GEN.1.9	God said ‘The water under the sky will gather in one place. And dry ground will appear.’
GEN.1.9	And what God said happened.
GEN.1.10	God called the dry ground ‘land’. He called the water (that he put in one place) ‘sea’.
GEN.1.10	God looked at what he had made.
GEN.1.10	And he saw that it was good.
GEN.1.11	God said ‘Plants will grow in the land. They will make seeds. And fruit trees will grow, with seeds inside the fruit. Then they can make more plants and trees. These plants and trees will be the same as the plants and trees that they have come from.’
GEN.1.11	And it was like that.
GEN.1.12	So plants and trees began to grow in the ground. The plants and trees made seeds, so that more of the same plants and trees could grow.
GEN.1.12	God looked at what he had made.
GEN.1.12	And he saw that it was good.
GEN.1.13	Evening passed, and then it was morning.
GEN.1.13	This was the third (3rd) day.
GEN.1.14	God said ‘There will be lights in the sky. They will separate the day from the night. They will show the seasons, days and years.
GEN.1.15	The lights in the sky will give light to the earth.’
GEN.1.15	And this happened.
GEN.1.16	God made two great lights. The brightest light ruled over the day. The less bright light ruled over the night. God also made the stars.
GEN.1.17	God put the lights and stars in the sky to give light on the earth.
GEN.1.18	They were to rule over the day and night. And they separated the light from dark.
GEN.1.18	God looked at what he had made.
GEN.1.18	And he saw that it was good.
GEN.1.19	Evening passed, and then it was morning.
GEN.1.19	This was the fourth (4th) day. 
GEN.1.20	God said ‘The waters will fill with fish and other living things. And birds will appear and fly in the sky, above the earth.’
GEN.1.21	So God made big animals to live in the sea. He made every different living thing that filled the sea. God made every different bird and flying thing in the sky.
GEN.1.21	God looked at what he made.
GEN.1.21	And he saw that it was good.
GEN.1.22	God 
GEN.1.23	Evening passed and then it was morning.
GEN.1.23	This was the fifth (5th) day. 
GEN.1.24	God said ‘I will make different animals come up from the ground. I will make 
GEN.1.24	And what God said happened.
GEN.1.25	So God made the different wild animals and the different 
GEN.1.25	God looked at what he had made.
GEN.1.25	And he saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.26	God said ‘We will make man. Men and women will be like us. They will rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky. They will rule over the 
GEN.1.27	So God made man. He made man to be like God. God made them. He made some males, and some females.
GEN.1.28	God 
GEN.1.29	Then God said, ‘Look! I give you every plant on the earth that has seeds in it. I give you every tree that has fruit with a seed in it. They are yours. The seeds and fruits will be food for you.
GEN.1.30	And they will be food for all the animals on the earth. They will be food for all the birds in the sky and for all the animals that move along the ground. Everything that has life can eat every green plant.’
GEN.1.30	And what God said happened.
GEN.1.31	God looked at everything that he had made.
GEN.1.31	And he saw that it was very good.
GEN.1.31	Evening passed. And then it was morning.
GEN.1.31	This was the sixth (6th) day.
GEN.2.1	So God finished making the earth and everything in it. He made the whole world.
GEN.2.2	The seventh (7th) day came.
GEN.2.2	And God stopped working, because he had finished making the earth. God rested on the 7th day.
GEN.2.3	God 
GEN.2.4	This is what happened when God made the earth and everything in it.
GEN.2.4	When the 
GEN.2.5	there were no plants or trees growing on it. That was because the 
GEN.2.6	But streams came up from the earth. And they made all the top of the ground wet. 
GEN.2.7	Then the 
GEN.2.8	The 
GEN.2.9	And the 
GEN.2.10	A river began in Eden. It went through Eden. And it gave water for the ground. It separated into four smaller rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first river is the Pishon. It goes through the whole of the land of Havilah. There is gold in this land. 
GEN.2.12	The gold there is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also in Havilah. 
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is the Gihon. It goes through the whole of the land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is the Tigris. It goes along the east side of the Asshur. The name of the fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	Then the 
GEN.2.17	But you must not eat the fruit from the tree of 
GEN.2.18	Then the 
GEN.2.19	The 
GEN.2.20	So the man gave names to the 
GEN.2.20	But the man did not find a helper. 
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	Then the 
GEN.2.23	Then the man said to God, ‘At last, this is one like me. She has bones taken from my bones. And her body is from my body. I will call her “woman” because God took her out of a man.’ 
GEN.2.24	Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother to be with his wife. And the two people will become like one person. 
GEN.2.25	The man and his wife did not wear any clothes. But they did not feel ashamed.
GEN.3.1	The 
GEN.3.2	The woman replied, ‘We can eat fruit from the trees in the garden. 
GEN.3.3	But God said, “You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden And you must not touch it. You will die if you touch that fruit.” ’
GEN.3.4	But the snake said to the woman, ‘You will not die. 
GEN.3.5	God knows that when you eat the fruit from this tree you will be like him. You will understand. And you will know good and 
GEN.3.6	The woman looked at the fruit. She saw that it was good to eat. And she thought that it would be good to know about good and 
GEN.3.7	Then they saw that they had no clothes. And they felt ashamed. So, they joined leaves from fig trees together to cover their bodies. 
GEN.3.8	In the evening the man and the woman heard the sound of the 
GEN.3.9	The 
GEN.3.10	The man replied, ‘I heard you in the garden. I was afraid because I had no clothes. So I hid from you.’
GEN.3.11	God said, ‘Who told you that you had no clothes? Have you eaten from the tree that I told you not to eat from?’
GEN.3.12	The man said, ‘The woman that you put here – she gave me some fruit from the tree. So I ate it.’ 
GEN.3.13	The 
GEN.3.14	The 
GEN.3.15	I will make you and the woman enemies. Your 
GEN.3.16	God said to the woman, ‘I will make it more painful for you while you are 
GEN.3.17	God said to Adam, ‘You listened to your wife. You ate the fruit from the tree after I said, “You must not eat from this tree.” Because you did this, I will 
GEN.3.18	Thistles and thorns will grow out of the ground. You will eat the plants that grow in the fields. 
GEN.3.19	But you will have to work for a long time before you have any food to eat. You will do this until you return to the ground. This is where you came from. I made you from the ground. And you will return to the ground.’ 
GEN.3.20	Adam gave the woman a name. He called her Eve. This was because she would be the mother of all people. 
GEN.3.21	The 
GEN.3.22	The 
GEN.3.23	So, the 
GEN.3.24	Then God put cherubim and a 
GEN.4.1	Adam had sex with his wife Eve. And she became 
GEN.4.2	After some time had passed, Eve gave birth to Cain's brother. She called him Abel. When they had grown, Abel kept sheep. And Cain worked on the land.
GEN.4.3	Some time passed. Then one day Cain brought to God some of the fruit that he had grown. The fruits were an 
GEN.4.4	But Abel brought fat pieces from some of the first young ones of the animals that he kept. The 
GEN.4.5	But God was not happy with Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry. His face looked sad. 
GEN.4.6	Then the 
GEN.4.7	If you do what is right, I will be happy with you. But if you do wrong things, 
GEN.4.8	One day Cain said to his brother Abel, ‘Let us go out to the field.’ While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel. And he killed him.
GEN.4.9	Some time passed and the 
GEN.4.10	Then the 
GEN.4.11	Then God said, ‘I have 
GEN.4.12	When you work on the land, no plants will grow in it. There will be no plants that you can eat. You will travel from place to place. You will not live in one place.’ 
GEN.4.13	Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	From today, you will not let me work on the land. You will not be with me. I will be like a traveller without a home. If someone sees me, they will kill me.’ 
GEN.4.15	But the 
GEN.4.16	Cain went away from the 
GEN.4.17	Cain had sex with his wife. After some time she gave birth to Enoch. Cain was building a city. He called the city Enoch because it was his son's name. 
GEN.4.18	Enoch was the father of Irad. Irad was the father of Mehujael. Mehujael was the father of Methushael. Methushael was the father of Lamech.
GEN.4.19	Lamech married 2 women. One was called Adah and one was called Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal. Jabal was the father of the people who live in 
GEN.4.21	Jabal had a brother called Jubal. Jubal was the father of the people who play the harp and flute. 
GEN.4.22	A son was born to Zillah. His name was Tubal-Cain. He made tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain had a sister. Her name was Naamah. 
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives, ‘Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech hear my words. A man hurt me, so I killed him. I killed a young man because he hurt me. 
GEN.4.24	If a man kills Cain, then God will hurt him 7 times more. So I will hurt the man who hurts me 77 times more.’ 
GEN.4.25	Adam had sex with Eve. And she gave birth to a son. She called him Seth. Eve said, ‘God has given me another child because Cain killed Abel.’ 
GEN.4.26	Seth became the father of Enosh.
GEN.4.26	At this time, men began to 
GEN.5.1	This is a report of Adam's family. When God made man, he made him like God. 
GEN.5.2	God made both male and female. He 
GEN.5.3	When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son. The son was like Adam. Adam called him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	After Seth was born, Adam was alive for 800 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	Adam was 930 years old when he died.
GEN.5.6	When Seth was 105 years old, he had a son. He called him Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	After Seth became the father of Enosh, Seth was alive for 807 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	Seth was 912 years old when he died.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh was 90 years old, he had a son. He called him Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh was alive for 815 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	Enosh was 905 years old when he died.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan was 70 years old, he had a son. He called him Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	After Kenan became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan was alive for 840 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	Kenan was 910 years old when he died.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he had a son. He called him Jared. 
GEN.5.16	After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel was alive for 830 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	Mahalalel was 895 years old when he died.
GEN.5.18	When Jared was 162 years old, he had a son. He called him Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	After Jared became the father of Enoch, Jared was alive for 800 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	Jared was 962 years old when he died.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch was 65 years old, he had a son. He called him Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After that, Enoch did as God wanted for 300 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	Enoch lived on earth for 365 years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch did as God wanted for all this time; then Enoch was no more. God took Enoch to be with him. 
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah was 187 years old, he had a son. He called him Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	After Methuselah became the father of Lamech, Methuselah was alive for 782 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	Methuselah was 969 years old when he died.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech was 182 years old, he had a son. 
GEN.5.29	He called his son Noah. Lamech said ‘He will help us in our difficult work on the land. Our hands hurt when we work the land. That is because the 
GEN.5.30	After Noah was born, Lamech was alive for 595 years. During this time, he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	Lamech was 777 years old when he died.
GEN.5.32	When Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	People began to grow in number all over the earth. And daughters were born to them. 
GEN.6.2	The sons of God saw the daughters. They thought that the daughters of men were beautiful to look at. They took the daughters of men as their wives. They took anyone that they wanted. 
GEN.6.3	The 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim lived on the earth at that time. (They also lived on the earth after this time.) This is when the sons of God had children with the daughters of men. People thought that the Nephilim were great men and leaders.
GEN.6.5	The 
GEN.6.6	He was sad that he had made men and women. And he was sad that he had put them on the earth. 
GEN.6.7	So the 
GEN.6.8	But the 
GEN.6.9	This is a report of Noah. Noah was a good man. He was the only man at that time who obeyed God. The people who lived near him could not find anything wrong with what he did. 
GEN.6.10	Noah was the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	God saw that everything on the earth was bad. People began to hurt and kill each other. And they did everything that was wrong. 
GEN.6.12	God saw how bad the earth had become. All the people were doing bad things. 
GEN.6.13	He said to Noah, ‘I am going to destroy all the people. The earth is bad because of them. I am going to destroy the people and the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make yourself a boat. Use wood from cypress trees. Make rooms in the boat. Cover the inside and outside of the boat with pitch.’ 
GEN.6.15	‘This is how you will build the boat. The boat must be 150 metres long, 25 metres wide and 15 metres high.
GEN.6.16	Make a roof for the boat and put windows 45 centimetres high along the top of it. Put a door in the side of the boat. Make 3 floors on top of each other (lower, middle and top floor). 
GEN.6.17	I am going to cover the earth with water. I will destroy all life under the 
GEN.6.18	But I will make a 
GEN.6.19	You must bring 2 of all the different animals into the boat. They must be male and female. They will stay alive with you. 
GEN.6.20	Bring 2 of every different bird. And bring 2 of every different animal and 2 of every different animal that moves along the ground. All these will come to you, and they will stay alive with you. 
GEN.6.21	You must take every different food on the earth. Store this for food for you and the animals.’
GEN.6.22	Noah did everything that God had told him.
GEN.7.1	Then the 
GEN.7.2	God said ‘Take 7 of every different clean animal. Take a male and a female together. Take 2 of every different 
GEN.7.3	Take 7 of every kind of bird. Take males and females. Do this so that they will have young ones again. Then the different animals and birds will not die. 
GEN.7.4	In 7 days, I will send rain down to the earth. It will rain for 40 days and 40 nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made on the earth.’
GEN.7.5	Noah did everything that God told him.
GEN.7.6	Noah was 600 years old when God sent the rain to cover the earth with water. 
GEN.7.7	Noah and his wife went into the boat. And his sons and their wives went into it. They all went into the boat to be safe from the water that would cover the earth. 
GEN.7.8	Pairs of clean and 
GEN.7.9	Both males and females came to Noah and went into the 
GEN.7.10	After 7 days had passed, God sent the waters to cover the earth. 
GEN.7.11	On the 17th day of the 2nd month all the water below the earth came up and covered the earth. All the water in the 
GEN.7.12	Rain fell on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights.
GEN.7.13	On the day that the rains began, Noah and his sons went into the boat with their wives. (Noah's sons are Shem, Ham and Japheth.) 
GEN.7.14	With them was every different wild animal and every different 
GEN.7.15	Pairs of every animal alive came to Noah and went into the boat. 
GEN.7.16	The animals were male and female of every different animal. This happened as the 
GEN.7.17	For 40 days, the waters came on the earth. More water came and lifted the boat high above the ground.
GEN.7.18	The waters rose and covered the earth. The boat was safe on top of the water. 
GEN.7.19	More water came and covered every high mountain on the earth. 
GEN.7.20	And even more water came. It covered all the mountains. The water was more than 20 feet higher than the top of the mountains. 
GEN.7.21	Everything still living on the earth died. Birds, 
GEN.7.22	Everything that was alive on the dry land died. 
GEN.7.23	Every living thing on the earth died. Men and animals died. The animals that move across the ground and the birds of the air died. God destroyed all of them. Only Noah and his family, and the animals that were in the boat stayed alive.
GEN.7.24	The waters covered the earth for 150 days.
GEN.8.1	Then God thought of Noah, and all the animals in the boat. He sent a wind to blow over the whole world. And the waters began to go down. 
GEN.8.2	Water stopped coming up from below the earth. And water stopped coming down from 
GEN.8.3	The waters went down, and at the end of 150 days the water had almost gone. 
GEN.8.4	On the 17th day of the 7th month, the boat 
GEN.8.5	The water continued to go down until the 10th month. On the 1st day of the 10th month the tops of the mountains appeared.
GEN.8.6	After 40 more days, Noah opened the window in the boat. 
GEN.8.7	He sent out a raven. The raven flew back to the boat. Then it flew away from it again. It did this several times until the earth was dry. 
GEN.8.8	Noah also sent out a dove. He sent the dove to see if the water had gone from the top of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove could not find anywhere to stand. This was because still there was water over all of the ground. So it returned to Noah in the boat. Noah put out his hand and took the dove back into the boat. 
GEN.8.10	He waited for 7 days. Then he sent the dove out again. 
GEN.8.11	The dove returned to him in the evening. It carried a fresh olive leaf in its mouth. Then Noah knew that the waters had gone down. 
GEN.8.12	He waited for 7 more days. Then he sent the dove out again. This time, it did not return to Noah. 
GEN.8.13	It was the 1st day of the first month. Noah was now 601 years old. The water that covered the earth was gone. The earth was dry. Noah removed the top of the 
GEN.8.14	Some time passed. On the 27th day of the 2nd month, the earth was completely dry.
GEN.8.15	God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	‘Come out of the boat. Bring your wife, your sons and their wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring every different living animal out of the boat. Bring out the birds and the animals. And bring out those animals that move across the ground. Bring them out so that they may have young ones. Then they can grow in number on the earth.’
GEN.8.18	Noah came out of the boat. His wife, and his sons and their wives came too. 
GEN.8.19	All the animals came out of the boat. Those that moved across the ground, and the birds came too. Every different animal came out of the boat.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an 
GEN.8.21	The 
GEN.8.22	As long as the earth is here, the time for planting will come each year. The time for getting the plants out of the ground will come each year. Cold and heat, and summer and winter will always come. They will never stop. Day and night will never stop.’ 
GEN.9.1	God 
GEN.9.2	Every animal will be afraid of you. All the birds will be afraid of you. And every animal that moves across the ground will be afraid of you. All the fish in the sea will be afraid of you. You will have authority over all of them. 
GEN.9.3	All living animals will be food for you. Before, I gave you the green plants to eat. Now I give you everything.
GEN.9.4	But you must not eat meat that still has the blood of life in it.
GEN.9.5	Men must not kill other men. Animals must not kill men. If an animal kills a man, kill the animal. If a man kills another man, kill the man.
GEN.9.6	God made men like himself. So, if anyone kills a man or a woman, a man must kill him. 
GEN.9.7	You must have many children, so that the number of people on the earth will grow.’
GEN.9.8	God said to Noah and his sons that were with him, 
GEN.9.9	‘I will make my promise with you, and with all your 
GEN.9.10	and with all the animals on the earth. 
GEN.9.11	This is my promise. I will never destroy all life on the earth again. I will never cover the earth with water again.’ 
GEN.9.12	God said, ‘I will show you that I have made a promise with you, and every living animal. It is a promise for all that live on the earth, now and as long as the earth is here. 
GEN.9.13	I have put my rainbow in the sky. It will show you the promise between me and everything on the earth. 
GEN.9.14	When I bring clouds over the earth, a rainbow will appear. 
GEN.9.15	Then I will remember my promise. Never again will the waters destroy all life. 
GEN.9.16	When I see a rainbow in the clouds, I will remember my promise to you. It is for all time. It is a promise between God and every thing that lives on the earth.’ 
GEN.9.17	God said to Noah, ‘This will show you the promise that I have made. My promise is between me and all life on earth.’
GEN.9.18	The names of Noah's sons were Shem, Ham and Japheth. Ham had a son called Canaan. They all came out of the 
GEN.9.19	All the people who are on the earth are 
GEN.9.20	Noah worked on the ground. He planted a 
GEN.9.21	He drank some of the 
GEN.9.22	Ham, Canaan's father, saw that Noah was not wearing any clothes. He went outside. He told his two brothers what he had seen. 
GEN.9.23	Shem and Japheth took some clothes and put them across their shoulders. They walked into Noah's 
GEN.9.24	Noah woke up from his sleep. He found out what his youngest son (Ham) had done. 
GEN.9.25	He said ‘
GEN.9.26	Noah also said, ‘
GEN.9.27	Let God make the land of Japheth grow. Let Japheth receive the good things of Shem. Let Canaan be his slave.’ 
GEN.9.28	Noah was alive for 350 years after God covered the earth with water. 
GEN.9.29	Noah's whole life lasted for 950 years. Then he died.
GEN.10.1	This is the story of Shem, Ham and Japheth. They are Noah's sons. After God covered the earth with water, they had sons.
GEN.10.2	These are the sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	These are the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	These are the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim and the Rodanim. 
GEN.10.5	These people lived by the sea. They lived in groups. Each group went to live in a different place. Each group spoke its own language.
GEN.10.6	These are the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	These are the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca. 
GEN.10.8	These are the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
GEN.10.9	Cush was the father of Nimrod. Nimrod grew into a great soldier on the earth. Nimrod was a great hunter in front of the 
GEN.10.10	The first of Nimrod's lands were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went to Assyria. This is where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir and Calah. 
GEN.10.12	He also built Resen. Resen is between Nineveh and Calah, which is a large city. 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusites, Casluhites (this is where Philistines came from) and Caphtorites. 
GEN.10.15	Canaan was the father of Sidon, who was born first. Canaan was also the father of the Hittites, 
GEN.10.16	Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,

GEN.10.18	Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. After some time had passed, the Canaanite families separated, 
GEN.10.19	and the land of Canaan went from Sidon to Gerar, as far as Gaza. It went to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are all 
GEN.10.21	Shem also had sons. Shem's older brother was Japheth. All the sons of Eber are 
GEN.10.22	These are the sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	These are the sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech. 
GEN.10.24	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah. Shelah was the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Eber had 2 sons. He called one Peleg. When he was alive, people began to live in different places on the earth. So he called him Peleg. He called the other son Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	The land where they lived went from Mesha to Sephar. This is in the land with hills in the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are the 
GEN.10.32	All these people (verses 2-13) are 
GEN.11.1	At this time, everyone who lived on the earth spoke one language. 
GEN.11.2	People moved to the East. They reached a large flat piece of land called Shinar. They stayed and lived there. 
GEN.11.3	They said to each other, ‘Let us build a city with a

GEN.11.13	After he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad was alive for 403 years. He had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber.

GEN.11.16	When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	After he became the father of Peleg, Eber was alive for 430 years. He had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu. 
GEN.11.19	After he became the father of Reu, Peleg was alive for 209 years. He had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	After he became the father of Serug, Reu was alive for 207 years. He had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor.

GEN.11.24	When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	After he became the father of Terah, Nahor was alive for 119 years. He had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	When Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
GEN.11.27	This is the report of the 
GEN.11.28	While Terah was alive, Haran died. Haran died in Ur, the land of the Chaldeans. This was where Haran was born. 
GEN.11.29	Abram married Sarai. Nahor married Milcah. Milcah was Haran's daughter. Haran was the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai could not give birth to children. She did not have any children.
GEN.11.31	Terah took his son Abram, and Abram's wife, Sarai. Terah took his grandson Lot. (Lot is the son of Haran.) They all left Ur, the land of the Chaldeans. They began to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they stayed there. 
GEN.11.32	Terah was alive for 205 years. He died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	The

GEN.12.6	Abram walked through the land. He went as far as the big tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time, Canaanites lived in this land. 
GEN.12.7	The 
GEN.12.8	Abram left Shechem. He went to the hills. The hills are east of Bethel. This is where he put his 
GEN.12.9	Then Abram took his 
GEN.12.10	There was a 
GEN.12.11	When Abram was going into Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, ‘I know that you are a very beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.12	When the people of Egypt see you they will say, “This is his wife.” They will kill me. But they will not kill you. 
GEN.12.13	Tell them that you are my sister. Then they will do good things for me because of you. They will not kill me. Because they will think that you are my sister.’ 
GEN.12.14	When Abram came to Egypt, the people saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.15	Pharaoh's officers saw her. They said good things about her to Pharaoh. They took Sarai to Pharaoh's palace. (Pharaoh is the name for all the kings of Egypt.) 
GEN.12.16	Pharaoh did good things for Abram because of Sarai. He gave him sheep and cows. He also gave Abram male and female 
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh called Abram to come before him. Pharaoh said, ‘You have done this to me. You did not tell me that she was your wife! 
GEN.12.19	You told me “She is my sister”, so I took her to be my wife. Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!’ 
GEN.12.20	Pharaoh told his men what to do with Abram. They sent Abram away with his wife and everything that they had. 
GEN.13.1	Abram went from Egypt to the Negev. He took his wife and everything that he had. Lot went with him.
GEN.13.2	Abram had many valuable things. He had cows, 
GEN.13.3	Abram left the Negev. He went from place to place until he came to Bethel. He came to the place between Bethel and Ai. This is where he had put his 
GEN.13.4	This is where Abram had built an 
GEN.13.5	Lot was moving from place to place with Abram. Lot also had cows, sheep and 
GEN.13.6	The ground could not grow enough food for all the animals to eat. The ground could not grow enough food for Abram's animals and for Lot's animals. Abram and Lot could not stay together. They had too many animals and people with them. 
GEN.13.7	Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen began to quarrel. At that time, Canaanites and Perizzites also lived in the land. 
GEN.13.8	Abram said to Lot, ‘We must not quarrel with each other. Your herdsmen and my herdsmen must not quarrel with each other. There must be no more quarrelling because we belong to the same family.’
GEN.13.9	‘The whole land is in front of you. We must separate. If you go to the left, I will go to the right. If you go to the right, I will go to the left.’
GEN.13.10	Lot looked up. He saw the flat land of Jordan. He saw that it had water. It was like the garden of the 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose the flat land of Jordan. He went towards the East. 
GEN.13.12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan. Lot lived in the cities of the land that he had chosen. Lot put his 
GEN.13.13	The men of Sodom were very bad. They 
GEN.13.14	After Lot had gone, the 
GEN.13.15	I will give you all the land that you can see. I will give it to you and your

GEN.13.18	Abram moved his 
GEN.14.1+GEN.14.2+GEN.14.3+GEN.14.4	Now there were many kings living in that land, at that time. They fought against each other. One fight was when Kedorlaomer had ruled over the other kings for 12 years. And in the next year, 5 kings made one group like that and fought against him. Kedorlaomer joined with 3 other kings. So, it was 4 kings against 5 other kings.
GEN.14.1+GEN.14.2+GEN.14.3+GEN.14.4	The 4 kings were Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim. And these fought a war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela. Bela is another name for the town Zoar. They fought in the Valley of Siddim. (That is the Salt Sea.) 
GEN.14.5	In the 14th year, Kedorlaomer and the kings with him beat the Rephaites. This was in Ashteroth Karnaim. They beat the Zuzites in Ham. They beat the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim. 
GEN.14.6	And they beat the Horites in the country of Seir. This was as far as El Paran near the land of dry sand. 
GEN.14.7	They then went back. They went to En Mishpat. (That is Kadesh.) They took the whole land of the Amalekites. They also took the land of the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar. 
GEN.14.8	Then, the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar) went to fight. This was in the Valley of Siddim. 
GEN.14.9	They fought against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar. There were 4 kings fighting against 5 kings. 
GEN.14.10	The Valley of Siddim had many holes in the ground. The holes were filled with 
GEN.14.11	The 4 kings took everything in Sodom and Gomorrah. And they took all the food. Then they went away. 
GEN.14.12	They also took Abram's 
GEN.14.13	A man ran away from the kings. He told Abram the 
GEN.14.14	Abram heard that the kings caught his 
GEN.14.15	During the night, Abram separated his men into 2 groups. Then they attacked the men who took Lot. Abram followed them as far as Hobah. Hobah is North of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	Abram took back everything that the men took from Sodom. He brought back his 
GEN.14.17	Abram beat Kedorlaomer and the kings with him. He returned, and the king of Sodom came out to meet Abram. This was in the Valley of Shaveh. (That is the Kings' valley.) 
GEN.14.18	Melchizedek was the king of Salem. He brought out bread and 
GEN.14.19	He 
GEN.14.20	 is God Most High. He gave your enemies to you.’ Abram gave king Melchizedek a 10th of everything. 
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, ‘Give me the people. Keep everything else.’ 
GEN.14.22	But Abram said ‘I have raised my hand to the 
GEN.14.23	I promised not to take anything from you. I will not take even a part of your shoe. So you can never say “I made Abram rich.” 
GEN.14.24	The men who went with me may take their part. They may take their part of anything that we took. They are Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their part.’ 
GEN.15.1	After this, Abram had a dream. The 
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, ‘
GEN.15.3	Abram said ‘You have not given me any children. So a servant in my house will 
GEN.15.4	Then the 
GEN.15.5	Then God took Abram outside. God said, ‘Look up at the 
GEN.15.6	Abram believed the 
GEN.15.7	God also said to Abram, ‘I am the 
GEN.15.8	But Abram said, ‘My 
GEN.15.9	God said to Abram, ‘Bring me a young cow, a goat and a male sheep. Each animal must be 3 years old. Also bring a dove and a young pigeon.’ 
GEN.15.10	Abram brought all the animals and birds to God. Abram cut each one in half. He put the halves opposite each other. But he did not cut the birds in half. 
GEN.15.11	Some other birds came. These birds liked to eat dead animals. But Abram sent them away.
GEN.15.12	The sun went down. Abram fell asleep. It was very dark. He felt afraid. 
GEN.15.13	Then the 
GEN.15.14	But I will 
GEN.15.15	And yet, you will have a long life. You will have a long, good and quiet life. Then you will die very happy. 
GEN.15.16	After 4 generations, your 
GEN.15.17	The sun went down. It became dark. Abram saw a smoking pot of fire. He also saw a light made of fire. Both of these passed between the halves of the animals. 
GEN.15.18	On that day, the 
GEN.15.19	This is the land where these people live: Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.’ 
GEN.16.1	Abram's wife was Sarai. She did not have any children. She had a servant from Egypt. The servant's name was Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	Sarai said to Abram, ‘The 
GEN.16.3	Abram had been living in Canaan for 10 years. Sarai took Hagar. She gave Hagar to Abram to be his wife.
GEN.16.4	Abram had sex with Hagar. And Hagar became 
GEN.16.5	Sarai said to Abram, ‘It is because of you that this has happened. What Hagar is doing is wrong. I gave her to you. And now she is 
GEN.16.6	Abram said to Sarai, ‘Do whatever you think is right. Do what you want to do with Hagar.’ Then Sarai did bad things to Hagar. So Hagar ran away.

GEN.16.8	The 
GEN.16.9	The 
GEN.16.10	The 
GEN.16.11	The 
GEN.16.11	‘You will have a child.
GEN.16.11	You will have a son.
GEN.16.11	You must name him Ishmael.
GEN.16.11	Because the 
GEN.16.12	He will be a wild man.
GEN.16.12	He will be like a 
GEN.16.12	He will fight against everyone.
GEN.16.12	And everyone will fight against him.
GEN.16.12	He will think that everyone is his enemy.
GEN.16.12	He will think that his brothers are his enemies.’ 
GEN.16.13	Hagar said to the 
GEN.16.14	That is why they called the well ‘Beer Lahai Roi’. The well is between Kadesh and Bered. 
GEN.16.15	Some time passed. Hagar had a son. Abram was his father. Abram gave Hagar's son a name. The name of Hagar's son was Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
GEN.17.1	Abram was 99 years old. The 
GEN.17.2	‘I will fix my 
GEN.17.3	Abram fell to the ground. He put his face to the ground. God said to him,
GEN.17.4	‘This is what I will do. This is my 
GEN.17.5	‘Your name is not Abram any longer. Now your name is Abraham. This is because you are the father of many people. I will make this happen.

GEN.17.15	God also said to Abraham, ‘As for your wife Sarai, you must not call her Sarai. Her name will be Sarah. 
GEN.17.16	I will 
GEN.17.17	Abraham fell to the ground. He put his face to the ground. Abraham laughed. He said to himself, ‘I am 100 years old. That is too old to have a son. Sarah is 90 years old. That is too old to have a child.’ 
GEN.17.18	Abraham said to God, ‘If only Ishmael may have your

GEN.17.21	But I will make my 
GEN.17.22	God had finished speaking to Abraham. So God left Abraham. 
GEN.17.23	On that day, Abraham went to Ishmael. He also went to all the males born into his 
GEN.17.24	Abraham's 
GEN.17.25	Ishmael's 
GEN.17.26	Abraham and his son Ishmael were 
GEN.17.27	Abraham 
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	Abraham looked up. He saw 3 men. He hurried to meet them. He bowed to the ground. 
GEN.18.3	Abraham said to them, ‘If it makes you happy, my 
GEN.18.4	‘Let us bring some water for you. Then you can all wash your feet. Then you can rest under this tree.’ 
GEN.18.5	Abraham said, ‘Let me get you some bread. Then you will be ready to continue with your journey. I will do this now because you have come to me.’ The men replied, ‘Very well, do as you have said.’ 
GEN.18.6	Abraham hurried to the 
GEN.18.7	Then Abraham ran to his cows. He chose a baby cow. He gave it to a servant. The servant quickly prepared it for the men to eat. 
GEN.18.8	Then Abraham brought some butter, milk and the meat from the cow. He put all these in front of the men. The men ate the food. And Abraham stood near them. He stood under a tree.
GEN.18.9	The men asked Abraham ‘Where is Sarah, your wife?’ Abraham replied, ‘She is in the 
GEN.18.10	Then the 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were very old. Sarah was past the age of giving birth to a child. 
GEN.18.12	So Sarah laughed to herself. She thought ‘I am too old. And my husband is too old. I cannot have this baby now.’ 
GEN.18.13	The 
GEN.18.14	God said, ‘Nothing is too difficult for the 
GEN.18.15	Sarah was afraid. So she did not say what was true. She said, ‘I did not laugh.’ But God said, ‘Yes, you did laugh.’
GEN.18.16	The men got up. They were leaving. They looked down in the direction of Sodom. Abraham walked with them. He walked with them for part of their journey. 
GEN.18.17	Then the 
GEN.18.18	‘Abraham's 
GEN.18.19	‘I chose him. Then he will teach his children and everyone in his

GEN.18.21	‘I will go down to Sodom and Gomorrah. I will see what they have done. I will see if it is as bad as the 
GEN.18.22	The men turned away. They went towards Sodom. But Abraham remained with the 
GEN.18.23	Then Abraham went near to God. Abraham asked, ‘Will you kill your people with the 
GEN.18.24	There might be 50 people who know you in the city. Will you still destroy the city? Or will you let the people live, because of the 50 people who know you? 
GEN.18.25	The ruler of all the earth will do what is right! So, you will not kill the people who know you. You will not kill them along with the 
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham spoke again. ‘I have been brave enough to speak to the 
GEN.18.28	Then Abraham asked, ‘What if there are 45 people in the city who know you. Will you destroy the city, because there are only 45 good people there?’ The 
GEN.18.29	Abraham spoke to God again. ‘What will you do if only 40 good people are there?’ The 
GEN.18.30	Then Abraham said ‘Please do not be angry. Let me speak. What if there are only 30 people who know you there?’ The 
GEN.18.31	Abraham said ‘I have been brave. I have spoken to the 
GEN.18.32	Abraham said, ‘Please do not be angry. Let me speak once more. What if only 10 good people live there?’ The 
GEN.18.33	The 
GEN.19.1	The 2 
GEN.19.2	Lot said ‘My 
GEN.19.3	But Lot asked them to stay with him again. So they went with Lot. The 
GEN.19.4	They had not yet gone to bed. All the men from every part of Sodom came to the house. Old and young men came. They were all outside the house. 
GEN.19.5	The men said ‘Where are the men who are staying with you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them’ 
GEN.19.6	Lot went outside to the men. He shut the door of his house. 
GEN.19.7	Lot said, ‘No, my friends. Do not do this bad thing. 
GEN.19.8	I have 2 daughters. They have never had sex with a man. Let me bring them out to you. You can do whatever you want with them. But do not do anything to these men. They are staying at my house. I cannot let anyone hurt them.’ 
GEN.19.9	The men from the city said ‘Get out of our way. You are a foreign person in this city. Now you are telling us what to do! We will do worse things to you.’ They pushed Lot. They began to break the door of his house. 
GEN.19.10	The 2 men inside the house pulled Lot. They pulled him back into his house. They shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	Then they made the men outside blind. They made the young men blind. They also made the old men blind. This was so that they could not find the door to the house. 
GEN.19.12	The 2 men spoke to Lot. They said, ‘Do you have any people belonging to you here? Do you have men who are going to marry your daughters? Do you have sons or daughters? Do you have any people belonging to you in the city? If you do, get them out of here. 
GEN.19.13	We are going to destroy this city. The 
GEN.19.14	Lot went out. He spoke to the men who were going to marry his daughters. Lot said to them, ‘Hurry! Leave this place because the 
GEN.19.15	At dawn, the 
GEN.19.16	Lot did not go with the 
GEN.19.17	As soon as the 
GEN.19.18	But Lot said, ‘No! Please, my 
GEN.19.19	You are happy with me, your servant. You have been very kind to me. You have saved my life. But I cannot run to the mountains. This 
GEN.19.20	Lot said, ‘Look! Here is a town. It is near. I can run to it. And the town is small. Let me run to it. The town is very small. Then I will stay alive.’ 
GEN.19.21	The 
GEN.19.22	But run to the town quickly. I cannot do anything until you get to the town.’ (The name of the town was Zoar.) 
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen in the sky. Then Lot reached Zoar.
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	So God destroyed those cities. He killed everyone who lived in those cities. And he killed all the plants that grew on that land.
GEN.19.26	But Lot's wife looked back at the city. And she changed into a large piece of salt. 
GEN.19.27	Early the next morning, Abraham returned to where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	He looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah. And he looked down towards all the land near the cities. He saw thick smoke. It was rising from the land. It was the smoke from a big fire.
GEN.19.29	God destroyed the cities of that land. And Lot lived in these cities. But God had remembered Abraham. God brought Lot out of the cities, before he destroyed them.
GEN.19.30	Lot was afraid to live in Zoar. So, he and his 2 daughters stayed in the mountains. Lot and his 2 daughters lived in the rocks in the side of the mountain. 
GEN.19.31	The oldest daughter said to the youngest daughter, ‘Our father is old. And there is no other man here. So, we will not have any man to marry us. Then we will not have children. Everyone on the earth wants to have children. 
GEN.19.32	Let us cause our father to drink 
GEN.19.33	That night they gave their father 
GEN.19.34	The next day the oldest daughter said to the youngest daughter, ‘Last night I had sex with my father. Let us make him drink 
GEN.19.35	So that night, they gave their father 
GEN.19.36	Both of Lot's daughters would give birth to a baby. This was because they had both had sex with their father. 
GEN.19.37	The oldest daughter had a son. She called him Moab. All the Moabites of today are his 
GEN.19.38	The youngest daughter also had a son. She called him Ben-Ammi. All the Ammonites of today are his 
GEN.20.1	Abraham moved on to the land of Negev. He lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a time he stayed in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	While he was there, he told people that Sarah was his sister. Because of this, Abimelech sent for Sarah. Abimelech is the king of Gerar. He wanted Sarah to be his wife.
GEN.20.3	But God spoke to Abimelech in a dream. God said, ‘You are a dead man. This is because of the woman that you have taken. She is a married woman.’ 
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not gone near Sarah. He said, ‘Will you destroy people who have not done anything wrong? 
GEN.20.5	Abraham said to me “I am her brother.” Sarah said to me “I am his sister.” I did not know that I was doing anything wrong.’ 
GEN.20.6	God spoke to Abimelech in a dream. God said, ‘You did not know that you were doing wrong. I knew that. So I kept you from

GEN.20.8	Early the next morning, Abimelech called together his officers. He told them what had happened. They were very afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham to him. Abimelech said, ‘What have you done to us? What have I done against you? Why have you brought this bad 
GEN.20.10	Abimelech asked Abraham, ‘Why did you do this?’ 
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, ‘Because I thought that the people here were not afraid of God. They will kill me because of my wife.’ 
GEN.20.12	Abraham said, ‘But she is my sister. She is the daughter of my father. But she is not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	God caused me to leave my father's 
GEN.20.14	Abimelech brought sheep and cows. He also brought male and female slaves. He gave them to Abraham. He gave Sarah, Abraham's wife back to him. 
GEN.20.15	Abimelech said, ‘Here is my land. Live anywhere you want to live.’ 
GEN.20.16	He said to Sarah, ‘I have given your brother 1000 pieces of

GEN.20.18	The 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	Sarah became 
GEN.21.3	Abraham called his son Isaac. This is the son that Sarah gave birth to. 
GEN.21.4	Isaac was 8 days old. Abraham 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born. 
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, ‘God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears about my son will be happy with me.’ 
GEN.21.7	She also said, ‘Who would think that I would have a child? But I have given Abraham a son, even when he is old.’
GEN.21.8	The child grew, and his mother weaned him. On that day, Abraham gave a big feast. 
GEN.21.9	Sarah saw that Ishmael was laughing at Isaac. Ishmael was Hagar's son. Hagar was the slave from Egypt. 
GEN.21.10	Sarah said to Abraham, ‘Send that slave woman and her son away. He must never have a part in the 
GEN.21.11	This made Abraham very sad, because it was about his son Ishmael. 
GEN.21.12	God said to Abraham, ‘Do not be sad about the boy Ishmael and your female servant. Listen to Sarah. Do whatever she tells you, because I will continue my promise through Isaac. 
GEN.21.13	I will also make many people from the 
GEN.21.14	Abraham was awake early the next morning. He took some food. And he took a bottle that someone had made out of animal skin. He filled it with water. He put the food and water on Hagar's shoulders. Then he sent Hagar and her son Ishmael away. She went to the 
GEN.21.15	After they had drunk the water, Hagar put her son under a bush. 
GEN.21.16	She thought, ‘I cannot watch the boy die.’ As she sat near the boy, she began to cry. Then she went away from him. She sat down. She was not very far away from him. 
GEN.21.17	God heard the boy crying. The 
GEN.21.18	Lift the boy up. Take him by the hand. I will make him into a great people.’ 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened Hagar's eyes. She saw a well of water. Hagar filled the bottle with water. And she gave the boy a drink. 
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy while he grew up. The boy lived in the 
GEN.21.21	The boy lived in the 
GEN.21.22	At that time Abimelech and Phicol, his officer, said to Abraham, ‘God is with you in everything that you do. 
GEN.21.23	Tell me that you will not do things in a false way. You will not do anything false with me or with my children or with my 
GEN.21.24	Abraham said ‘I will do as you say.’
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham told Abimelech about a well of water. Abimelech's servants had said that the well belonged to them and not to Abraham. 
GEN.21.26	Abimelech said ‘I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me before. I only heard about it today.’ 
GEN.21.27	Abraham brought sheep and cows. He gave them to Abimelech. The two men made a promise. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham separated 7 young female sheep from the other sheep. 
GEN.21.29	Abimelech asked Abraham ‘Why have you separated 7 young female sheep? What does this mean?’ 
GEN.21.30	Abraham replied ‘Take these 7 young female sheep from my hand. You know that I dug this well. This shows that you know it.’ 
GEN.21.31	So he called that place Beersheba. He called it that because the 2 men made a promise there. 
GEN.21.32	So they made a promise at Beersheba. Abimelech and Phicol, his officer, returned to the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba. He called on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
GEN.22.1	Some time passed. God wanted to see how 
GEN.22.2	God said ‘Take your son. Take your only son Isaac, whom you love. Go to the place of Moriah. 
GEN.22.3	Abraham got up early the next morning. He put a blanket on his 
GEN.22.4	On the 3rd day, Abraham looked up. He saw the place. It was not too far away. 
GEN.22.5	Abraham spoke to his servants. He said ‘Stay here with the 
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood for the burnt 
GEN.22.7	Isaac spoke to Abraham. He said ‘Father?’ Abraham replied ‘Yes my son?’ Isaac said, ‘The fire and the wood are here. But where is the

GEN.22.9	They came to the place that God told them. Abraham built an 
GEN.22.10	Then Abraham took the knife in his hand to kill his son.
GEN.22.11	But the 
GEN.22.12	The 
GEN.22.13	Abraham looked up. He saw a ram, caught in a bush. He took the ram. Abraham 
GEN.22.14	Abraham called that place ‘The 
GEN.22.15	The 
GEN.22.16	The 
GEN.22.17	Because you have done this, I will 
GEN.22.18	I will 
GEN.22.19	Abraham returned to his servants. Together they left for Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	Some time passed. Someone told Abraham ‘Milcah is also a mother. She has given birth to sons through your brother Nahor.’ 
GEN.22.21	They are: Uz, the first born, his brother Buz, Kemuel, (who is the father of Aram), 
GEN.22.22	Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel. 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah gave birth to these 8 sons. Nahor was the father of these 8 sons. Nahor was Abraham's brother. 
GEN.22.24	Nahor had a slave wife. Her name was Reumah. She also had sons. They were Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived for 127 years. 
GEN.23.2	She died in Kiriath Arba (that is Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham was very sad because Sarah had died. He sat by her body and cried. He cried because she was dead.
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham got up and said, 
GEN.23.4	‘I am a foreign person among you. Sell me some land for a 
GEN.23.5	The Hittites replied, 
GEN.23.6	‘My 
GEN.23.7	Abraham got up. He 
GEN.23.8	He said to the Hittites ‘As you will let me bury my dead, listen to me. Speak with Ephron son of Zohar for me. 
GEN.23.9	Speak to him so that he will sell me the 
GEN.23.10	Ephron the Hittite was sitting with his people. He spoke so that all the Hittites could hear him. They were at the city gate. 
GEN.23.11	Ephron said ‘No my 
GEN.23.12	Abraham 
GEN.23.13	He said to Ephron, ‘Listen to me. I will pay you the price of the field. Accept the price from me. Then I can bury my dead there.’ Abraham said this so that everyone could hear him. 
GEN.23.14	Ephron replied to Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	‘Listen to me, my 
GEN.23.16	Abraham agreed to this price. He weighed the amount of 
GEN.23.17	Ephron's field in Machpelah, near Mamre, now belonged to Abraham. The field, the 
GEN.23.18	It now belonged to Abraham. They did this in front of all the Hittites at the city gate. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife. He did this in the 
GEN.23.20	They recorded the field and the 
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now very old. He had been alive for many years. The 
GEN.24.2	Abraham had a servant. This servant had authority over everything in Abraham's 
GEN.24.3	Abraham said ‘I live among the Canaanites. But I want you to make a promise to me. Make a promise to me in front of the 
GEN.24.4	You must go to my country. Go to my 
GEN.24.5	The servant asked Abraham ‘What if the woman will not come back with me to this land? Must I take your son to the country that you came from?’ 
GEN.24.6	Abraham replied ‘You must not take my son back there. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	Perhaps the woman will not come back. Then you do not have to do as I have told you. But do not take my son back to that land.’ 
GEN.24.9	The servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh. The servant said that he would do everything that Abraham had said. 
GEN.24.10	The servant took 10 of his master's 
GEN.24.11	The servant was outside the town. He made the 
GEN.24.12	The servant 
GEN.24.13	See, I am standing by this well. The daughters of the people who live in the town are coming out. They are coming to get water from the well. 
GEN.24.14	May this happen. I will say to a girl “Please put your water pot down the well so that I may have a drink.” She may say, “Drink and I will give water to your 
GEN.24.15	The servant was still praying when Rebekah came out. She had her pot on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel. Bethuel was the son of Milcah. Milcah was the wife of Abraham's brother, Nahor. 
GEN.24.16	The girl was very beautiful. She had not had sex with a man. No man had slept with her. She went down to the well. She filled her pot with water. And she came up again. 
GEN.24.17	The servant hurried to meet the girl. He said ‘Please give me some water from your pot.’ 
GEN.24.18	The girl replied ‘Drink my 
GEN.24.19	After she had done this, she said ‘I will get water for your 
GEN.24.20	So Rebekah quickly emptied her pot. She emptied the water into the place where animals drank. She ran back to the well. She took more water from the well. She took enough for all the 
GEN.24.21	The servant did not say anything. But he watched the girl. He wanted to see if the 
GEN.24.22	The 
GEN.24.23	The servant asked ‘Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for me and my men to spend the night there?’ 
GEN.24.24	She replied ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel. He is the son of Milcah (his mother) and Nahor (his father).’ 
GEN.24.25	She said ‘We have plenty of dry grass and food for the 
GEN.24.26	Then the man 
GEN.24.27	He said ‘
GEN.24.28	The girl ran on before the servant. She told her mother's 
GEN.24.29	Rebekah had a brother. His name was Laban. 
GEN.24.30	Laban saw the nose ring and the bracelets. The bracelets were on his sister's arms. He heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her. So Laban went out to the servant. He found him standing by the 
GEN.24.31	Laban said ‘You are 
GEN.24.32	So the servant went to the house. He took everything off the 
GEN.24.33	They gave him food. But the servant said ‘I will not eat. Not until I tell you why I have come here.’ Laban said, ‘Then tell us.’
GEN.24.34	The servant said ‘I am Abraham's servant. 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	Sarah was my master's wife. She gave him a son even when she was very old. My master has given his son everything that belongs to him. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me make a promise. He said, “You must not get a Canaanite woman to be a wife for my son. I live in the land of the Canaanites. 
GEN.24.38	Go to my father's family and to my own 
GEN.24.39	I asked my master “What if the woman will not return with me?” 
GEN.24.40	My master said “The 
GEN.24.41	Go to my 
GEN.24.42	‘I came to the well today. I prayed to the 
GEN.24.43	Look. I am standing by a well. If a girl comes to get water, I will say to her, ‘Please let me drink some water from your jar.’ 
GEN.24.44	She may say to me, ‘Drink and I will get some water for your 
GEN.24.45	‘While I was still praying, Rebekah came out. She carried her pot on her shoulder. She went down to the well, and got some water. I said to her “Please give me a drink.” 
GEN.24.46	She quickly took her pot off her shoulder. She said, “Drink. And I will get water for your 
GEN.24.47	I asked her “Whose daughter are you?” She said, “I am the daughter of Bethuel. He is the son of Nahor. Milcah is Bethuel's mother.” Then I put the ring in her nose. I put the bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.48	And I 
GEN.24.49	If you want to say, “No” then tell me. Or if you want to say, “Yes” then tell me. Then I will know what to do.’
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel replied ‘These things are from the 
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebekah. Take her and go. She will become the wife of your master's son. This is as the 
GEN.24.52	Abraham's servant heard what they said. He 
GEN.24.53	Then the servant brought out things made from gold and 
GEN.24.54	Then the servant ate and drank. And the men with him ate and drank. They stayed the night there. The next morning they woke up. The servant said, ‘Let me go back to my master.’ 
GEN.24.55	Rebekah's brother and mother replied ‘Let her stay with us for 10 days or so. Then you can go.’ 
GEN.24.56	The servant said ‘Do not stop me. The 
GEN.24.57	The brother and mother said ‘Let us call the girl. Let us ask her what she wants to do.’ 
GEN.24.58	So they called out to Rebekah. They asked her ‘Will you go with this man?’ Rebekah said ‘I will go.’ 
GEN.24.59	So they sent their sister Rebekah away. And her nurse went with her. They went with Abraham's servant, and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And her brother and mother 
GEN.24.61	Rebekah and her female servants left. They rode on 
GEN.24.62	Isaac came from Beer Lahai Roi because he was living in the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	It was evening. And Isaac went out to the field to meditate. He looked up. And he saw 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah looked up. She saw Isaac. She got down from her 
GEN.24.65	She asked the servant ‘Who is that man in the field? Who is that man coming to meet us?’ The servant replied ‘He is my master’. Rebekah covered herself with her veil. 
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac everything that happened. 
GEN.24.67	Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother's 
GEN.25.1	Abraham took another wife. Her name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The 
GEN.25.4	Midian became the father of Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were 
GEN.25.5	When he died, Abraham left everything that was his to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	When he was still alive, he gave gifts to the sons of the other wives. He sent these sons away from Isaac. He sent them to the land of the east.
GEN.25.7	Abraham's whole life was 175 years. 
GEN.25.8	And he died when he was very old. He joined his people who had died before him. 
GEN.25.9	Isaac and Ishmael buried him. They were his sons. They buried Abraham in the 
GEN.25.10	Abraham bought this field. He bought it from the Hittites. They buried Abraham there with his wife, Sarah.
GEN.25.11	After the death of Abraham, God 
GEN.25.12	This is a report of Ishmael. Ishmael is Abraham's son. Sarah's female servant gave birth to Ishmael. Her name was Hagar. She was from Egypt. 
GEN.25.13	These are the names of Ishmael's sons. The list starts from the first-born son and ends with the last born son. Nebaioth was the first born son of Ishmael. Then there were Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedmah. 
GEN.25.16	These were all Ishmael's sons. And these were the names of the 12 groups of people. They separated and lived in their own land. They ruled over the 12 groups of people. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael was alive for 137 years. He took his last 
GEN.25.18	Ishmael's 
GEN.25.19	This is a report of what happened to Isaac. He was Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	When Isaac was 40 years old, he married Rebekah. Rebekah was the daughter of Bethuel. Bethuel was an Aramean from Paddan Aram. She was the sister of Laban the Aramean. 
GEN.25.21	Rebekah could not have children. So Isaac 
GEN.25.22	The babies inside her were fighting with each other. Rebekah said ‘Why is this happening to me?’ So Rebekah went to ask the 
GEN.25.23	The 
GEN.25.24	The time came for Rebekah to give birth. There were two babies inside her. 
GEN.25.25	The first baby to come out was red. Hair covered the whole of his body. They called him Esau. 
GEN.25.26	After this, his brother came out. His hand was holding the back of Esau's foot. They called him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
GEN.25.27	Time passed and the boys grew. Esau became a good hunter. He liked being in the country. Jacob was a quiet man. He stayed among the 
GEN.25.28	Isaac liked to eat the meat from the animals that Esau killed. So he loved Esau. But Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	One day, Jacob was cooking a meal. Esau came back from the country. He was very hungry. 
GEN.25.30	He said to Jacob ‘Quick let me have some of that red food! I am very hungry.’ (That is also why he was called Edom.) 
GEN.25.31	Jacob said, ‘You must first sell me your 
GEN.25.32	Esau said ‘Look I am going to die now. What good is my 
GEN.25.33	Jacob said ‘First, say a promise to me.’ So Esau said a promise to Jacob. He promised to sell his 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and the meal made from seeds. Esau ate and drank. Then he got up and left. So Esau showed that he did not care about his 
GEN.26.1	There was a 
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	Stay in this land for a time. And I will be with you. And I will 
GEN.26.4	I will give you many 
GEN.26.5	This will happen because of Abraham. He kept all my 
GEN.26.6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	The men of Gerar asked Isaac about his wife. He said, ‘She is my sister.’ He was afraid to say ‘She is my wife.’ He thought ‘The men of Gerar may kill me. They may kill me because of Rebekah. They may kill me because she is beautiful.’ 
GEN.26.8	Isaac stayed in Gerar for a long time. One day Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked down from his window. Abimelech saw Isaac touching his wife, Rebekah. 
GEN.26.9	Abimelech called Isaac to come to him. Abimelech said ‘She is your wife! Why did you say, “She is my sister”?’ Isaac replied ‘I thought that someone might kill me because of her.’ 
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said ‘What have you done to us? One of my men might have had sex with your wife. Then we would have done wrong.’ 
GEN.26.11	Abimelech told his people, ‘I will kill anyone who hurts this man.’
GEN.26.12	Isaac planted 
GEN.26.13	Isaac became rich. His riches continued to grow. Then Isaac became very rich. 
GEN.26.14	Isaac had many sheep, goats and cows. He also had many servants. He had so many that the Philistines became angry with him. They thought that he had more than they had. And they wanted what he had. That is why they were angry. 
GEN.26.15	When Abraham was alive, his servants had dug many wells. Now, the Philistines filled them in again. They did this because they did not want Isaac to get rich. 
GEN.26.16	Abimelech said to Isaac ‘You have become too powerful for us. Go and live away from us.’
GEN.26.17	So Isaac moved away from that place. He put his 
GEN.26.18	Isaac dug the wells again. They were the wells that Abraham had dug. But the Philistines filled them with the ground. This happened when Abraham died. Isaac opened them. He gave them the same names as his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	Isaac's servants dug in the valley. They found a well there. It was full of fresh water. 
GEN.26.20	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled with Isaac's herdsmen. They said ‘The water belongs to us!’ So Isaac called the well Esek. He called it that because they quarrelled with him. 
GEN.26.21	So Isaac's men dug another well. But the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled about that one. Isaac called that well Sitnah. 
GEN.26.22	Isaac moved on from Sitnah. He dug another well. No one quarrelled with him about this well. He called it Rehoboth. He said ‘Now the 
GEN.26.23	From that place, Isaac went to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	That night the 
GEN.26.25	Isaac built an 
GEN.26.26	During that time, Abimelech came to Isaac. He came from Gerar. He came with Ahuzzath his officer and with Phicol the officer of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac asked them ‘Why have you come to me? You were like an enemy. And you sent me away.’ 
GEN.26.28	They replied ‘We saw that the 
GEN.26.29	Promise that you will not hurt us. We did not hurt you. We did only good to you. And we sent you away as friends. And now the 
GEN.26.30	Then Isaac made a large meal for them. And they all ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Early the next morning, they made a promise to each other. And Isaac sent them away. They left without fighting. 
GEN.26.32	The same day, Isaac's servants came to him. They told him about a well that they had dug. They said, ‘We have found water!’ 
GEN.26.33	Isaac called the well Shibah. And the name of the town is Beersheba. 
GEN.26.34	When Esau was 40 years old, he got married. He married Judith. She was the daughter of Beer the Hittite. He also married Basemath. She was the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	This made Isaac and Rebekah very sad. 
GEN.27.1	Isaac became old. He could not see anything. He could not see because his eyes were weak. He called for Esau. Esau was his oldest son. Isaac said, ‘My son.’ Esau replied, ‘Yes’. 
GEN.27.2	Isaac said ‘I am an old man. I do not know when I will die. 
GEN.27.3	Now get your bow and arrows. Go out into the country. Kill some wild animals for me.’ 
GEN.27.4	Isaac said, ‘Prepare the food that I like to eat. And bring it to me. Bring it to me so that I can eat it. Then I can give you my 
GEN.27.5	Rebekah listened to what Isaac said to Esau. Esau went out into the country. He went to kill an animal and bring back the meat.
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to Jacob ‘I heard your father say this to Esau. 
GEN.27.7	“Bring me some meat. And prepare the food that I like to eat. Bring it to me. Then I can give you my 
GEN.27.8	Rebekah said ‘Now my son, listen carefully. And do as I tell you. 
GEN.27.9	Go out to the animals. Bring me two nice looking goats. Bring me two young goats. Then I will prepare some food that your father likes to eat. It will be prepared how he likes it. 
GEN.27.10	Then take the food to your father to eat. Then he will give you his 
GEN.27.11	Jacob said ‘Hair covers my brother's skin. But my skin does not have any hair. 
GEN.27.12	My father may touch me. Then he will know that I am telling him lies (words that are not true). Then he will not 
GEN.27.13	Jacob's mother said, ‘My son. Let the 
GEN.27.14	Jacob went and got the goats. He brought them to his mother. She prepared some food. She prepared the food that Isaac liked to eat. 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took some of Esau's clothes. They were his best clothes. Rebekah had them in her house. She put them on Jacob, her younger son. 
GEN.27.16	She covered Jacob's hands with the skin from the goats. She also covered the part of his neck that had no hair. 
GEN.27.17	Then she gave Jacob (her son) the food that Isaac liked to eat. And she gave him some bread that she had made.
GEN.27.18	Jacob went to his father. He said ‘My father.’ Isaac replied ‘Yes, my son. Who is it?’ 
GEN.27.19	Jacob said ‘I am Esau. I am your first born son. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my meat. Then you can give me your 
GEN.27.20	Isaac asked his son ‘My son. How did you find it so quickly?’ Jacob replied, ‘The 
GEN.27.21	Isaac said to Jacob ‘Come near to me so that I can touch you. Then I will know if you really are my son Esau.’
GEN.27.22	Jacob went close to his father. Isaac touched him. He said ‘The voice is that of Jacob. But the hands are those of Esau.’ 
GEN.27.23	Isaac did not know that it was Jacob. He did not know because he could feel the hair on Jacob's hands. They felt like Esau's hands. So Isaac 
GEN.27.24	Isaac asked ‘Are you really my son Esau?’ Jacob replied ‘I am.’
GEN.27.25	Isaac said ‘My son, bring me some of your meat. I will eat it. Then I can give you my 
GEN.27.26	Then Isaac said ‘Come here my son. And kiss me.’ 
GEN.27.27	So Jacob went to Isaac and kissed him. Isaac smelled the clothes that Jacob wore. Then Isaac 
GEN.27.28	May God give you rain for your crops. Then may he give you a good harvest of crops, and 
GEN.27.29	May you be the master of many peoples living in many countries. And may they bow down to you. Be master over your brothers. May the sons of your mother bow down to you. May people who 
GEN.27.30	Isaac finished 
GEN.27.31	Esau prepared the food that Isaac liked to eat. Then he took the food to Isaac. Esau said ‘My father. Sit up and eat some of my meat. Then you can give me your 
GEN.27.32	His father Isaac asked ‘Who are you?’ Esau replied ‘I am your son. I am your first born son Esau.’ 
GEN.27.33	Isaac 
GEN.27.34	Esau understood what his father had said. And he cried aloud. He said ‘
GEN.27.35	But Isaac said ‘Your brother came to me. He 
GEN.27.36	Esau said ‘Jacob is the right name for him. He has 
GEN.27.37	Isaac replied ‘I have made him master over you. And I have made all his 
GEN.27.38	Esau said ‘My father! Do you have only one 
GEN.27.39	Isaac replied ‘You will not grow rich from the earth. You will not have rain to make your 
GEN.27.40	You will have to fight for everything. And your brother will rule over you. But after a time, you will break away from him, and from his 
GEN.27.41	Esau did not forget what Jacob had done. He hated Jacob because of the 
GEN.27.42	Someone told Rebekah what Esau had said. She sent for Jacob. She said to him ‘Your brother Esau wants to kill you. When he thinks about killing you, it helps him to feel better. 
GEN.27.43	Now my son, do what I tell you. Go to my brother Laban. He lives in Haran. 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him for a time. Stay there until your brother is not angry with you. 
GEN.27.45	When Esau is not angry with you, I will send someone to tell you. When he forgets what you did to him, you can come back from Haran. I do not want to lose both of you in one day.’ 
GEN.27.46	Rebekah said to Isaac ‘I do not like living with Esau's wives. I do not like it because they are Hittites. My life will be worse if Jacob marries a Hittite woman (a woman from the people of this land).’ 
GEN.28.1	Isaac called for Jacob. Isaac 
GEN.28.2	Go now to Paddan Aram. Go to the house of Bethuel. He is your mother's father. Take a wife from there. Take a wife from the daughters of Laban. He is your mother's brother. 
GEN.28.3	May God 
GEN.28.4	May God give to you the 
GEN.28.5	Isaac sent Jacob on his journey. Jacob went to Paddan Aram. He went to Laban, who was the son of Bethuel the Aramean. Laban was the brother of Rebekah. Rebekah was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Esau heard that Isaac 
GEN.28.7	Esau knew that Jacob obeyed his father and mother. And that Jacob went to Paddan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	Esau knew that Isaac did not like the Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	So Esau went to Ishmael. He married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth. Mahalath is also the daughter of Ishmael. Ishmael is the son of Abraham. Esau married Mahalath. And he kept his other wives.
GEN.28.10	Jacob left Beersheba. He went towards Haran. 
GEN.28.11	He came to a place. And he stayed there for the night. He stayed there because the sun had gone down. He took a stone. He put it under his head. And he lay down and went to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	He had a dream. In the dream, he saw some steps. The steps went from the earth, into 
GEN.28.13	The 
GEN.28.14	Your 
GEN.28.15	I am with you. And I will watch over you everywhere you go. I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you. Not until I have done what I have promised you.’ 
GEN.28.16	Jacob woke from his sleep. He thought ‘The 
GEN.28.17	Jacob was afraid. He said ‘How great this place is! This must be the house of God. This is the gate of 
GEN.28.18	In the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head. He made it stand up straight in the ground. He poured oil on top of it. 
GEN.28.19	Jacob called that place Bethel. The name of the place was Luz. But Jacob called it Bethel. 
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a promise. He said ‘I want God to be with me and to watch over me, while I am on this journey. I want him to give me food to eat and clothes to wear. 
GEN.28.21	I want to return to my father's house. If God does all these things, then the 
GEN.28.22	This stone that I have put here will be God's house. And from every thing that God gives me, I will give God one tenth.’
GEN.29.1	Jacob continued on his journey. He came to the land where the people from the east live. 
GEN.29.2	He saw a well in a field. Three groups of sheep lay by the well. They lay there because the sheep had water from that well. A large stone covered the top of the well. 
GEN.29.3	 waited until all the sheep were there. Then they removed the stone from the well. And they gave their sheep water to drink. After this, they put the stone back on the top of the well. 
GEN.29.4	Jacob asked the 
GEN.29.5	Jacob said ‘Do you know Laban? He is Nahor's grandson.’ The 
GEN.29.6	Jacob asked them ‘Is he in good health?’ They replied ‘Yes he is. Here comes his daughter with the sheep. Her name is Rachel.’ 
GEN.29.7	Jacob said ‘Look. The sun is high in the sky. It is not the right time to bring all the sheep together. Give the sheep water. And take them back to the fields.’ 
GEN.29.8	The 
GEN.29.9	When Jacob was speaking, Rachel came. She brought her father's sheep with her. She was a shepherdess. 
GEN.29.10	Jacob saw Rachel. She was the daughter of Laban. Laban was Jacob's mother's brother. Jacob saw Laban's sheep. So Jacob went to the stone on the well. He removed it from the well. Then he gave water to Laban's sheep. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel. He began to cry aloud. 
GEN.29.12	Jacob told Rachel that he was a 
GEN.29.13	Laban heard what Rachel said. He hurried to meet Jacob. Jacob was the son of Laban's sister. He put his arms round Jacob. And he kissed him. Laban brought Jacob to his home. And Jacob told Laban why he had come to him. 
GEN.29.14	Then Laban said ‘You are my own 
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob ‘You should not work for me for nothing because you are my 
GEN.29.16	Laban had 2 daughters. The name of the older daughter was Leah. The name of the younger daughter was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah had weak eyes. But Rachel was beautiful. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel. He said ‘I will work for you for 7 years. In return, I want your daughter Rachel.’ 
GEN.29.19	Laban said ‘It is better to give her to you than to another man. Stay here with me.’ 
GEN.29.20	Jacob worked for 7 years to have Rachel. But the years passed quickly. They seemed like a few days to Jacob because he loved Rachel very much.
GEN.29.21	After 7 years, Jacob said to Laban, ‘Give me my wife. My time is finished. And I want to marry her.’ 
GEN.29.22	Laban called all the people in that place together. He gave a 
GEN.29.23	Evening came. But Laban took his daughter Leah. And he gave her to Jacob. And Jacob married her. 
GEN.29.24	Laban gave his female servant to Leah. Her name was Zilpah. Zilpah was now Leah's servant. 
GEN.29.25	When morning came, Jacob saw Leah! Jacob said to Laban, ‘What have you done to me? I worked for you to have Rachel. Why have you 
GEN.29.26	Laban replied ‘In this land, we do not give the younger daughter first. We do not give her before the older daughter. 
GEN.29.27	Finish Leah's marriage week. Then we will give you the younger daughter also. And you must work for another 7 years.’ 
GEN.29.28	So Jacob did this. He finished the week with Leah. 
GEN.29.29	Then Laban gave Rachel to Jacob to be his wife. Laban give his female servant Bilhah to Rachel. Bilhah was now one of Rachel's servants. 
GEN.29.30	Jacob married Rachel also. He loved Rachel more than he loved Leah. Jacob worked for Laban. He worked for 7 more years.
GEN.29.31	The 
GEN.29.32	Leah became 
GEN.29.33	Leah became 
GEN.29.34	Leah became 
GEN.29.35	Leah became 
GEN.30.1	Rachel now knew that she could not have any children. She knew that she could not give Jacob any children. So, she did not like her sister because her sister had children. Rachel said to Jacob, ‘Give me children, or I will die.’ 
GEN.30.2	Jacob became angry with Rachel. He said ‘Am I God? God has stopped you from giving birth to children!’ 
GEN.30.3	Rachel said ‘Here is Bilhah. She is my female servant. Have sex with her so that she can have children for me. Through her, I can build a family.’ 
GEN.30.4	So Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob. Jacob took her as a wife. 
GEN.30.5	She became 
GEN.30.6	Rachel said ‘God has done what is right to me. He has listened to me. And he has given me a son.’ Because of this, she called the baby Dan. 
GEN.30.7	Rachel's servant Bilhah became 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said ‘I have fought with my sister. And I have won.’ She called this baby Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	Leah saw that she had stopped having children. So she took her female servant. Her name was Zilpah. She gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Zilpah became 
GEN.30.11	Leah said ‘This is very good.’ And she called the baby Gad. 
GEN.30.12	Leah's servant gave Jacob another son. 
GEN.30.13	Leah said ‘I am very happy! Women will call me happy.’ So she called this baby Asher.
GEN.30.14	It was the time to get the wheat in from the fields. Reuben went out into the fields. He found some mandrake plants. He brought them to Leah, his mother. Rachel said to Leah, ‘Please give me some of the mandrake plants that your son gave to you.’ 
GEN.30.15	But Leah said to Rachel ‘You took my husband. Was not that enough? Now you want my son's mandrakes too!’ Rachel said, ‘You must give me some of your son's mandrakes. Then Jacob can sleep with you tonight.’ 
GEN.30.16	In the evening, Jacob came in from the fields. Leah went out to meet him. She said ‘You must sleep with me tonight. I have bought you with my son's mandrakes.’ So Jacob slept with Leah that night. 
GEN.30.17	God listened to Leah. And she became 
GEN.30.18	Leah said ‘God has paid me because I gave my servant to Jacob.’ She called her son Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	Leah became 
GEN.30.20	Leah said ‘God has given me this valuable gift. Now my husband will want to stay with me because I have given him 6 sons.’ She called this son Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	Some time passed. And Leah became 
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her. And he let her give birth to children. 
GEN.30.23	She became 
GEN.30.24	Rachel called her son Joseph. She said ‘May the 
GEN.30.25	After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob spoke to Laban. He said ‘Let me go on my way. Let me go so that I can go back to my own land. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives. Give me my children. I have worked for you to have them. Then I will go on my journey. You know how much I have worked for you.’ 
GEN.30.27	Laban said to Jacob ‘If you are happy with me then please stay. I know that the 
GEN.30.28	Laban continued, ‘Say what you want. And I will pay it.’ 
GEN.30.29	Jacob said ‘You know how much I have worked for you. And you know how many more animals you have. 
GEN.30.30	You had a small number of sheep and goats before I came. Now the number of them is much bigger. And anywhere that I have been, the 
GEN.30.31	Laban asked ‘What must I give you?’ Jacob replied, ‘Do not give me anything. But do one thing for me. Then I will still 
GEN.30.32	Let me go among all your animals today. And let me remove any animal that has a mark on it. Let me remove any animal that has more than one colour on its skin. I will take them from your sheep and from your goats. These animals will be what I receive from you. 
GEN.30.33	And this will show that I am honest. You can check on my animals when you want to. I may have a sheep or a goat that does not have more than one colour on its skin. Then you can say that I have taken it from you.’ 
GEN.30.34	Laban said ‘I agree to this. It will be as you have said.’ 
GEN.30.35	On that same day, Laban went to his animals. He quickly removed any animal that had more than one colour on its skin. And he gave them to his sons to 
GEN.30.36	Then Laban went away. It would take Jacob 3 days to reach Laban. While this was happening, Jacob 
GEN.30.37	Jacob took branches cut from trees. He took them from the poplar tree, the almond tree and the plane tree. He made white lines on them. He did this by taking the outside part of the wood from some of the branch. Then he could see the white part of the branch. 
GEN.30.38	Then he put the branches in the place where the animals drank. They were in front of the animals when they came to drink. Sometimes it was the right time when the animals came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	They would have sex and become 
GEN.30.40	Jacob kept the animals separate from Laban's animals. Then he separated Laban's animals. He separated the female animals from the male animals. And he would only let the female animals have sex with his own black male sheep. 
GEN.30.41	Jacob waited until the time was right for the stronger female animals. Then he put the branches in front of them, when they had sex with his own black male animals. 
GEN.30.42	But if the female animals were weak, he did not put the branches in front of the animals. So Jacob put the weak animals with Laban's animals. But Jacob kept the strong animals. 
GEN.30.43	By doing this, Jacob became very rich. He had many animals, female servants and male servants and 
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard Laban's sons saying, ‘Jacob has taken everything that our father had. He has got rich from things belonging to our father.’ 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob saw that Laban was not as nice to him as he had been before. 
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	Jacob sent someone to go to Rachel and Leah. Jacob said that they must come to the field where he was. He was with his animals. 
GEN.31.5	Jacob said to Rachel and Leah, ‘Your father is not as nice to me now, as he was before. I have seen that he is not so nice. But the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know how I have worked for your father. I have worked as well as I can. 
GEN.31.7	But your father has changed what I receive in return for working. He changed it many times. But God has not let him hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	Sometimes Laban said, “The animals with different colours on their skin will be your 
GEN.31.9	In this way God took your father's animals, and gave them to me. 
GEN.31.10	I had a dream. It was at the time when the animals became 
GEN.31.11	The 
GEN.31.12	And the 
GEN.31.13	I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel. This is where you poured oil on the stone. And this is where you made a promise to me. Now leave this land. Go back to the land where your father lived.” ’ 
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah replied, ‘We no longer have any part of our father's 
GEN.31.15	He thinks of us as foreign people. He sold us. Then he used what he received for us on himself.’ 
GEN.31.16	They said, ‘Everything that God took from our father belongs to us, and to our children. So you must do what God tells you.’
GEN.31.17	So Jacob put his children and wives on 
GEN.31.18	He took all his animals, and everything that he had got in Paddan Aram. He left to go to his father Isaac. He left to go to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	Before they left, Laban went to cut wool from his sheep. While he was gone, Rachel took his 
GEN.31.20	Jacob did not tell Laban the Aramean that he was going away. 
GEN.31.21	So Jacob ran away. He took everything that he had. He went across the river. He went towards the hill country of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	After 3 days, someone told Laban that Jacob had run away with his family. 
GEN.31.23	Laban took his 
GEN.31.24	Then God came to Laban the Aramean. He appeared to him in a dream at night. God said to Laban, ‘Be careful what you say to Jacob. Do not say that you will do anything to him.’
GEN.31.25	Jacob had put up his 
GEN.31.26	Laban said to Jacob, ‘What have you done? You have 
GEN.31.27	Why did you keep it a secret that you were leaving? You 
GEN.31.28	You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren goodbye. Or let me kiss my daughters goodbye. What you have done is not right. 
GEN.31.29	I have the power to hurt you. But last night the God of your father came to me. He said, “Be careful what you say to Jacob. Do not say that you will do anything to him.” 
GEN.31.30	I know that you want to return to your father's house. But why did you take my gods?’ 
GEN.31.31	Jacob replied, ‘I was afraid. I thought that you would try to stop me. And I thought that you would try to take your daughters away from me. 
GEN.31.32	But if you find your gods with anyone here, that person will die. While our 
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob's 
GEN.31.34	Rachel had taken the 
GEN.31.35	When he went into Rachel's 
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became angry with Laban. He asked him ‘What have I done wrong? What have I done against you? Why have you followed me? 
GEN.31.37	Now you have looked through everything that I have. And what have you found that belongs to you? If you have found anything, put it in front of your 
GEN.31.38	I have worked for you for 20 years. Your animals have all given birth to young ones. I have not eaten any of your male animals. 
GEN.31.39	I did not bring you animals killed by wild animals. I paid you for them. You said that I must pay for any animals that someone took in the day or night.’
GEN.31.40	Jacob said, ‘This is what it was like to work for you: I could not get away from the heat of the sun in the day. It felt like it was eating me. And the night-time was so cold that I could not sleep. 
GEN.31.41	It was like this for 20 years. That is the time that I have been working for you, in your 
GEN.31.42	The God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac was with me. If he were not, then you would have sent me away with nothing. But God has seen what you have done to me. He has seen how I have worked for you. And last night he told you that he knew what you had done.’ 
GEN.31.43	Laban replied ‘These women are my daughters. Their children are my children. The animals are my animals. But what can I do today about my daughters or about their children? 
GEN.31.44	Let us make a promise between you and me. And let it show what has happened between us.’ 
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a large stone and made it stand up. 
GEN.31.46	He said to his 
GEN.31.47	Laban called the place Jegar Sahadutha. Jacob called it Galeed. 
GEN.31.48	Laban said ‘These stones show that we made a promise today.’ That is why Jacob called that place Galeed. 
GEN.31.49	That place also had the name ‘Mizpah’. That was because Laban said ‘May the 
GEN.31.50	Remember that God is watching you. If you do wrong to my daughters, God will see it. And if you marry any other women, remember this. God is watching you. Even if no one else is with you, God will know.’
GEN.31.51	Laban also said ‘I have set this stone up. And I have set the 
GEN.31.52	I will not go past the stones to your side to hurt you. And you must not go past them to my side to hurt me. The stones will show where we can go. 
GEN.31.53	Let the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, the God of their father say who is right between us.’ So Jacob made a promise in the name of God. 
GEN.31.54	He offered a 
GEN.31.55	Early the next morning, Laban woke. He kissed his grandchildren. And he kissed his daughters. He 
GEN.32.1	Jacob continued to go to his father's house. And the 
GEN.32.2	Jacob saw them and said, ‘This is where God's army is!’ So he called that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent men with messages in front of him. He sent them to his brother Esau. He was in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	Jacob told his men, ‘This is what you must say to my master Esau: Your servant Jacob says, “I have been staying with Laban. I have stayed there until now. 
GEN.32.5	I have cows and 
GEN.32.6	When the men returned, they said to Jacob, ‘We went to your brother Esau. And now he is coming to meet you. And he has 400 men with him.’ 
GEN.32.7	Jacob was very frightened and 
GEN.32.8	He thought ‘If Esau attacks one group, the other group may be safe.’
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob prayed, ‘God of Abraham and God of my father Isaac, 
GEN.32.10	I am not worth all the kind things that you have done for me. You have stayed with me. And I am not worth this. When I crossed the River Jordan, I only had my stick. But now I can make 2 groups of good things from what I have. 
GEN.32.11	I pray that you will save me from my brother Esau. Because I am afraid that he will come and attack me. He may also attack my family. 
GEN.32.12	But you have said, “I will give you many good things. I will make your 
GEN.32.13	Jacob stayed the night in that place. He chose a gift for Esau from everything that he had. 
GEN.32.14	He chose 200 female goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep. 
GEN.32.15	Also he chose 30 female 
GEN.32.16	He told his servants to 
GEN.32.17	He told the servant at the front, ‘When my brother Esau meets you and asks, “Who do you belong to? Where are you going? Who do all these animals belong to?” 
GEN.32.18	You must say, “They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift that he has sent to my 
GEN.32.19	Jacob also told the other servants who followed a group of animals ‘You are to say the same thing to Esau, when you meet him. 
GEN.32.20	And you must say “Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.” ’ Jacob thought ‘Esau will be pleased with my gifts. Then he will not hurt me.’ 
GEN.32.21	So Jacob's gifts went on before him. But he spent the night with his people. 
GEN.32.22	That night Jacob took his 2 wives, 11 sons and 2 female servants. And he sent them over the part of the River Jabbok that was not very deep. 
GEN.32.23	After he had sent his people across, he sent everything that was his over the stream. 
GEN.32.24	Jacob was alone. And a man came and fought with him. The man fought with Jacob until it was day. 
GEN.32.25	The man saw that he was not beating Jacob. So, he touched Jacob's hip. And Jacob's hip broke as he fought with the man. 
GEN.32.26	Then the man said ‘Let me go because now it is day.’ But Jacob said, ‘I will not let you go until you 
GEN.32.27	The man asked Jacob ‘What is your name?’ Jacob replied ‘Jacob’. 
GEN.32.28	Then the man said ‘Your name will not be Jacob any more. Your name will be 
GEN.32.29	Jacob said ‘Please tell me your name.’ But the man said ‘Why do you ask my name?’ Then he 
GEN.32.30	So Jacob called that place Peniel. He said ‘I saw God face to face. And I did not die.’ 
GEN.32.31	The sun rose in the sky as Jacob passed through Peniel. And Jacob could not walk very well because of his hip.
GEN.32.32	Even today, the 
GEN.33.1	Jacob looked up. He saw Esau with 400 men coming towards him. So, he separated his children into groups. Some went with Leah, some with his 2 female servants and Joseph went with Rachel. 
GEN.33.2	He put his female servants and their children at the front of the group. Then came Leah and her children. But Jacob put Rachel and Joseph at the back of the group. 
GEN.33.3	Jacob went in front of the group. He 
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob. And he hugged him. He hugged Jacob's neck. And Esau kissed him. And they both wept.
GEN.33.5	Then Esau looked up. He saw the women and children. He asked ‘Who are these people with you?’ Jacob replied, ‘They are the children that God has given to me.’ 
GEN.33.6	Then the female servants and their children came to Esau. As they came close to him, they 
GEN.33.7	Then Leah and her children came and 
GEN.33.8	Esau asked ‘Why did you send all those animals in front of you?’ Jacob replied, ‘So that you would be happy to see me, my 
GEN.33.9	But Esau said ‘Keep your animals for yourself my brother. I have enough of my own.’ 
GEN.33.10	But Jacob replied ‘No! If you are happy to see me, accept these as a gift from me. I was afraid to see you. I was as afraid as if I could see the face of God. But I have seen you. And I did not die. 
GEN.33.11	Please accept the gift that I brought to you. Accept it because God has given me many good things. And I have everything that I need.’ So, Esau accepted the gifts because Jacob wanted him to.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said ‘Let us go on our way. I will go with you.’ 
GEN.33.13	But Jacob said, ‘My 
GEN.33.14	So my 
GEN.33.15	Esau said ‘Then let me leave some of my men with you.’ But Jacob replied ‘You do not have to do that. All I want is for you to be happy with me.’ 
GEN.33.16	So Esau began his journey back to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob went to Succoth. He built a hut for himself. And he made places for his animals to sleep. That is why they called the place Succoth. 
GEN.33.18	After Jacob left Paddan Aram he arrived at the city of Shechem. This is in Canaan. He put up his 
GEN.33.19	He bought the piece of ground where he put up his 
GEN.33.20	Jacob built an 
GEN.34.1	Dinah was the daughter of Leah and Jacob. One day she went out to visit the women who lived in the land. 
GEN.34.2	Shechem was the son of Hamor the Hivite. Hamor was the ruler of the land. When Shechem saw Dinah, he took her. And he had sex with her. Dinah did not want this to happen. 
GEN.34.3	He liked Dinah, Jacob's daughter, very much. And he loved her. He spoke kind words to her. 
GEN.34.4	And Shechem said to Hamor his father ‘Get me this girl. I want her for my wife.’ 
GEN.34.5	Jacob heard what had happened to his daughter. But his sons were out in the fields with his animals. So, Jacob did not do anything until his sons came home. And he did not say anything.
GEN.34.6	Shechem's father Hamor went to talk to Jacob. 
GEN.34.7	Now Jacob's sons heard what had happened. And they came in from the fields at once. They were very angry. They were angry because Shechem had done a very bad thing by having sex with Dinah. It was so bad that the whole of Jacob's family were ashamed because of it. Shechem should not have done this.
GEN.34.8	Hamor said to them, ‘My son Shechem loves your daughter. Please give her to him so that she can be his wife. 
GEN.34.9	And make marriages with our people. Give your daughter to us. And take our daughters for wives for your people. 
GEN.34.10	You can live among us. You can live anywhere you want to in this land. Live here. And buy and sell things here. Buy land and houses here.’ 
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers ‘Perhaps what I say will make you happy. Then I will give you whatever you ask. 
GEN.34.12	Tell me what you want me to pay for your daughter. Tell me the gift that I should bring. It can be as large as you want it to be. I will pay whatever you ask me. But give me the girl as my wife.’
GEN.34.13	Because of what Shechem did to Dinah, Jacob's sons planned to 
GEN.34.14	They said ‘We cannot do what you want. We cannot give our sister to an 
GEN.34.15	You must do one thing. Then we will agree to what you want. You must 
GEN.34.16	Then we will give you our daughters so that your people can marry them. And we will marry your daughters. We will live among you. And we will be like one people with you. 
GEN.34.17	But you must agree to 
GEN.34.18	What Jacob's sons suggested seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	Shechem's people liked him very much. So, he and his father agreed at once to do what Jacob's sons told them. Shechem agreed with them because he loved Dinah. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate. And they spoke to their people. 
GEN.34.21	They said ‘These men are our friends. Let them live in our land. And they can sell things to us, and buy things from us. This land is big enough for them. We can marry their daughters. And they can marry our daughters. 
GEN.34.22	But we must do what the men say. If we do not, then they will not agree to live among us. They say that we have to

GEN.34.24	All the men who were at the city gate agreed with Hamor and Shechem. And they 
GEN.34.25	And 3 days after the men were 
GEN.34.26	Simeon and Levi killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords. And they took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 
GEN.34.27	All Jacob's sons saw that the men of the city were dead. So they took everything from the city. It was the city where Shechem had sex with their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took all the animals and everything in the city. And they took everything that was out in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	They carried away everything valuable. And they took all the women and children, and everything from the houses in the city. 
GEN.34.30	When they returned to Jacob, he said, ‘You have brought trouble on me. You have made me like a bad smell to the Canaanites and Perizzites, by what you have done. These people also live in this land. We do not have many men. If the Perizzites and Canaanites attack, they will destroy us all.’ 
GEN.34.31	But Levi and Simeon replied ‘Shechem should not have used our sister as if she were a

GEN.35.6	Jacob and everyone with him arrived at Luz. (That is Bethel.) This is in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	And he built an 
GEN.35.8	Deborah was Rebekah's nurse. (She was travelling with Jacob.) Deborah died. Jacob buried her under the oak tree below Bethel. That is why they call the place Allon Bacuth. 
GEN.35.9	After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again. And God 
GEN.35.10	God said to Jacob ‘Your name is Jacob. But your name will no longer be Jacob Your name will be

GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a stone. This was at the place where God spoke to him. He poured a drink 
GEN.35.15	Jacob called the place where God talked to him Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Then they left Bethel. When they were still several miles from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth. She had a lot of difficulty. 
GEN.35.17	As she was having so much difficulty, the woman helping her said, ‘Do not be afraid. You have another son.’ 
GEN.35.18	Rachel was dying. And with her last 
GEN.35.19	Rachel died. They buried her on the way to Ephrath. 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a stone over the place where he buried her. This stone shows where Jacob buried Rachel.
GEN.35.21	Israel moved on again. He put up his 
GEN.35.22	Israel stayed in that place. And Reuben went to Bilhah and had sex with her. Bilhah was his father's 
GEN.35.22	Jacob had 12 sons:
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah were Reuben, who was the first of her sons, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Rachel's female servant, Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. 
GEN.35.26	The sons of Leah's female servant, Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
GEN.35.27	Jacob arrived home. He arrived at his father Isaac's home. This is in Mamre near Kiriath Arba (that is Hebron.) This is where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
GEN.35.28	Isaac was alive for 180 years. 
GEN.35.29	Then he died. And he joined his people who had died before him. He was an old man when he died. And his sons, Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	This is a list of the 
GEN.36.2	Esau took women from Canaan to be his wives. They were: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite

GEN.36.4	Adah had a son called Eliphaz. Basemath had a son called Reuel. 
GEN.36.5	Oholibamah had 3 sons: Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives, sons and daughters and everyone in his

GEN.36.8	So Esau (that is Edom) lived in the land of Seir.

GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king after him. 
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Hadad, son of Bedad became king after him. Bedad beat Midian in the country of Moab. He ruled a city called Avith. 
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah became king after him. 
GEN.36.37	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river, became king after him.

GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel and Iram. These were the leaders of the 
GEN.37.1	Israel (Jacob) lived in Canaan. This is where his father had lived.
GEN.37.2	This is what happened to Jacob's family:
GEN.37.2	Joseph was Jacob's son. He was 17 years old. He kept the sheep safe with his brothers. These were the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah. Bilhah and Zilpah were his father's wives. Now Joseph told Jacob bad things about his brothers. 
GEN.37.3	Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph. He loved him more than he loved any of his other sons. This was because Joseph was born when Jacob was old. And Jacob made a special coat for him. 
GEN.37.4	Joseph's brothers knew that Jacob loved him more than them. And they hated Joseph. They could not say anything nice to him.
GEN.37.5	Joseph had a dream. And he told his brothers about it. And his brothers hated Joseph even more than they did before. 
GEN.37.6	Joseph said to his brothers, ‘Listen to what happened in my dream: 
GEN.37.7	We were out in the field tying the 
GEN.37.8	Joseph's brothers said to him ‘Do you think that you will be like a king to us? Will you rule over us?’ And they hated him even more. They hated him because of what Joseph told them about his dream. 
GEN.37.9	Then Joseph had another dream. And he told his brothers about it. He said ‘Listen to me. I have had another dream. This is what happened. The sun and moon and 11 stars 
GEN.37.10	Joseph told his father and his brothers about the dream. His father was angry with him. Jacob said, ‘What is this dream that you had? Do you think that your mother and me, and your brothers will come and 
GEN.37.11	Joseph's brothers felt very angry with him. But Jacob thought about what Joseph had said.
GEN.37.12	Some time passed. Joseph's brothers had taken their father's sheep to eat grass. This was near the place called Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And 
GEN.37.14	So 
GEN.37.15	A man found Joseph walking in the fields. He asked Joseph ‘What are you looking for?’ 
GEN.37.16	Joseph replied ‘I am looking for my brothers. They have taken the sheep to eat grass. Can you tell me where they are?’ 
GEN.37.17	The man said ‘They have moved away from here. I heard them say, “Let us go to Dothan.” ’ So Joseph followed his brothers. And he found them near the place called Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	But his brothers recognised Joseph, while he was still far away. And before he had arrived at the place, they planned to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to each other ‘Here comes the man who dreams! 
GEN.37.20	We will kill him. And we will throw him down this dry well. We will that say a wild animal ate him. Then he will not dream again!’ 
GEN.37.21	When Reuben heard this, he tried to save Joseph. He said ‘We should not kill him. 
GEN.37.22	Do not have his blood on your hands. Throw him into this dry well in the 
GEN.37.23	So Joseph arrived at where his brothers were. He was wearing his special coat. They took his coat off him. 
GEN.37.24	And they took Joseph. And they threw him into the dry well.
GEN.37.25	Then the brothers sat down to eat their meal. They looked up and saw a group of Ishmaelites coming towards them. They came from the place called Gilead. The Ishmaelites had 
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, ‘We could kill our brother. We could then say that we did not kill him. But then we will not get anything. 
GEN.37.27	Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. Then we will not have to kill him. After all, he is our brother. He is our own 
GEN.37.28	When the Midianite merchants (men who buy and sell things) came to them, Joseph's brothers pulled him out of the dry well. And they sold Joseph for 20 pieces of 
GEN.37.29	Reuben returned to the dry well. And he saw that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes because he was very 
GEN.37.30	Reuben went back to his brothers. He said ‘The boy is not there! Where can I go now?’ 
GEN.37.31	Then the brothers got Joseph's special coat. They killed a goat. And they put the blood from the goat on to Joseph's coat. 
GEN.37.32	They took the special coat back to their father. They told him ‘We found this. Look at it. Tell us if it is your son's coat.’ 
GEN.37.33	Israel (that is Jacob) saw that it was Joseph's coat. He said ‘It is my son's coat! A wild animal has eaten him. The animal has torn Joseph to pieces.’ 
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob tore his own clothes. He did this because he was very sad. He put on clothes made from sackcloth because he was very sad. He wore sackcloth for many days. 
GEN.37.35	All Jacob's sons and daughters came to him. They tried to make Jacob feel less sad. But Jacob was very sad. Jacob said ‘I will be sad until I die. I will be sad because my son is dead.’ And he wept because Joseph was dead. 
GEN.37.36	While this was happening, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt. They sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officers. Potiphar had authority over all of Pharaoh's 
GEN.38.1	At that time, Judah left his brothers. He went to stay with a man from the town of Adullam. His name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	Then Judah met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her. 
GEN.38.3	She became 
GEN.38.4	She became 
GEN.38.5	She gave birth to another son. She called him Shelah. She gave birth to Shelah at the place called Kezib. 
GEN.38.6	Judah got a wife for his oldest son, Er. Her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But God saw that Er, the first born son of Judah, was bad. So the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan ‘Marry your dead brother's wife. You must do this because you are her dead husband's brother. You must have a son for your dead brother.’ 
GEN.38.9	But Onan did not want Tamar to have his child. He knew that a child like that would not belong to him. So when he had sex with his brother's wife Tamar, he made his 
GEN.38.9	Semen comes out of the man's sex part when he has sex. It can cause the woman to become 
GEN.38.10	What Onan did was wrong. So the 
GEN.38.11	So Judah said to Tamar ‘Go to your father's house. And live there as a widow. Live there until my son Shelah is older.’ Judah thought ‘Shelah may also die, because his brothers died.’ So Tamar went to live in her father's house. 
GEN.38.12	A long time passed. And Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua died. When Judah had stopped being sad because of her, he went to the place called Timnah. He went to some men who were cutting the wool from his sheep. And Judah's friend, Hirah the Adullamite went with him. 
GEN.38.13	Someone told Tamar ‘Your husband's father is going to Timnah to get the wool off his sheep.’ 
GEN.38.14	So Tamar took off her widow's clothes. And she covered herself with a veil. She did not want anyone to know who she was. That is why she did this. Then she sat at the place called Enaim. This is on the road going to Timnah. Tamar knew that Jacob's son Shelah had grown into a man. And he had not married her. That is why she did this. 
GEN.38.15	Judah saw her. And he thought that she was a 
GEN.38.16	He did not know that she was his son's widow. And he went over to her while she was at the side of the road. He said ‘Let me sleep with you.’ Tamar asked, ‘If I sleep with you, what will you give me?’ 
GEN.38.17	Judah replied ‘I will send a young goat from my animals.’ Tamar said, ‘You will have to give me something to show that you will do as you say.’ 
GEN.38.18	Judah asked ‘What should I give you?’ Tamar replied ‘Give me your seal and the cord that holds it. And give me the staff in your hand.’ So Judah gave them to her. And he slept with her. And she became 
GEN.38.19	After this, Tamar left Judah. And she took off her 
GEN.38.20	Judah sent his friend, the Adullamite with a young goat back to where the woman had been. Judah wanted to get his seal, cord and staff back from the woman that he had slept with. But the Adullamite could not find the woman. 
GEN.38.21	The Adullamite asked some men who live there ‘Where is the shrine-prostitute? Where is the woman who was by the road at Enaim?’ But the men said, ‘There has not been any shrine-prostitute here.’ 
GEN.38.22	So Judah's friend went back to Judah. He said ‘I did not find her. The men who lived there said, “There has not been any shrine-prostitute here.” ’ 
GEN.38.23	So Judah said ‘Let her keep the things that I gave to her. People will laugh at me if you go back there again. I sent a young goat for her. But you could not find her.’
GEN.38.24	Then, 3 months later, someone told Judah ‘Your dead son's wife, Tamar, is 
GEN.38.25	So they brought Tamar out. They were going to kill her. But she sent a message to her dead husband's father. She said ‘The man who owns these things has made me 
GEN.38.26	Judah saw that the things belonged to him. He said ‘She is more 
GEN.38.27	The time came for Tamar to give birth. And she had two babies. 
GEN.38.28	As she was giving birth, one baby put out his hand. So, the woman who was helping Tamar tied something red to that baby's arm. She said ‘This baby came out first.’ 
GEN.38.29	But the baby put his hand back inside Tamar. And his brother came out. And the woman said ‘So you have come out!’ And Tamar called him Perez. 
GEN.38.30	Then his brother came out. He had something red on his arm. And Tamar called him Zerah. 
GEN.39.1	Now the Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt. And they sold Joseph as a slave. Potiphar was one of Pharaoh's officers. He had authority over all the 
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	Potiphar saw that the 
GEN.39.4	So Potiphar was happy with Joseph. And Joseph became Potiphar's special servant. Potiphar gave Joseph authority over his 
GEN.39.5	Potiphar gave Joseph authority over everything that belonged to him. Then the 
GEN.39.6	So Joseph kept safe everything that belonged to Potiphar. Potiphar did not think about anything in his 
GEN.39.7	And after some time had passed, Potiphar's wife saw that Joseph was handsome. She said ‘Come to bed with me!’ 
GEN.39.8	But Joseph would not do as she asked. He said ‘I 
GEN.39.9	No one has more authority in this house than I do. My master keeps nothing from me except you. That is because you are his wife. I could not do such a bad thing. And I will not 
GEN.39.10	Potiphar's wife spoke to Joseph every day. But he still would not go to bed with her. He would not even be with her. 
GEN.39.11	One day Joseph went into the house to work. And there were no other servants there. 
GEN.39.12	Potiphar's wife took hold of Joseph's coat. She said ‘Come to bed with me!’ but Joseph left his coat in her hand. And he ran out of the house.
GEN.39.13	Potiphar's wife saw that he left his coat in her hand. She saw that he had run out of the house. 
GEN.39.14	So she called her 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me scream he ran out of the house. But he left his coat next to me.’ 
GEN.39.16	Potiphar's wife kept the coat next to her until Joseph's master, Potiphar came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told him this story: ‘That 
GEN.39.18	But I screamed for help. And he left his coat next to me. And he ran out of the house.’
GEN.39.19	Joseph's master heard the story that his wife told him. She said ‘This is what your slave did to me.’ And Potiphar was very angry. 
GEN.39.20	Joseph's master took Joseph, and put him in prison. He put Joseph in the king's prison. 
GEN.39.21	The 
GEN.39.22	So this man gave Joseph authority over all the people in prison. And Joseph 
GEN.39.23	The 
GEN.40.1	Some time later, 2 workers made the king of Egypt angry. He had many workers. He had a cupbearer and a baker. They did something to make him angry. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers. He was angry with the cupbearer and the baker. 
GEN.40.3	And Pharaoh put them in the same prison that Joseph was in. 
GEN.40.4	The man who had authority in the prison put Joseph over them. And Joseph was over them. And they were there for some time. 
GEN.40.5	And each of them – the cupbearer and the baker – had a dream. Both had a dream on the same night. And each dream had a different meaning.
GEN.40.6	Joseph came to them the next day. And he saw that they were 
GEN.40.7	So Joseph asked them both ‘Why are you sad today?’ 
GEN.40.8	They replied ‘We both had dreams, but there is no one to tell us what they mean.’ Joseph said ‘Only God knows the meaning of dreams. But tell me your dreams.’
GEN.40.9	So the cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He told Joseph, ‘In my dream I saw a fruit plant in front of me. 
GEN.40.10	And there were 3 branches on the plant. As soon as new leaves came, flowers came. And they became fruit. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. And I took the fruit. And I put the 
GEN.40.12	Joseph said ‘This is what your dream means. The 3 branches are 3 days. 
GEN.40.13	In 3 days, Pharaoh will lift up your head. Then he will let you come out of this prison. And you will be Pharaoh's cupbearer again. You will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand. You did that when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	But when these things happen, remember me. And be kind to me. Tell Pharaoh about me. Then I will get out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	Truly, men took me from the land of the 
GEN.40.16	The baker heard that Joseph had given a good meaning to the cupbearer's dream. So he said, ‘I also had a dream: I had 3 baskets of bread on my head.
GEN.40.17	The top basket contained many different cooked things for Pharaoh. But birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.’
GEN.40.18	Joseph said ‘This is what your dream means. The 3 baskets are 3 days. 
GEN.40.19	In 3 days, Pharaoh will lift off your head. And he will hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat your body.’ 
GEN.40.20	Now on the 3rd day it was Pharaoh's birthday. He gave a 
GEN.40.21	He let the cupbearer be his own cupbearer again. So, the cupbearer put the cup into Pharaoh's hand again.
GEN.40.22	But Pharaoh hanged the baker. This is what Joseph said would happen. He had told the baker what his dream meant.
GEN.40.23	But the cupbearer did not remember Joseph. The cupbearer forgot about Joseph.
GEN.41.1	Then 2 years passed and Pharaoh had a dream. In his dream, he was standing by the River Nile. 
GEN.41.2	And 7 cows walked out of the river. They were fat and good to look at. They ate the plants at the side of the river. 
GEN.41.3	After them, 7 other cows came out of the river. They were thin. And their bones were close to their skin. They stood next to the cows already on the side of the river. 
GEN.41.4	And the thin cows ate the 7 fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. 
GEN.41.5	He went to sleep again. And he had another dream. He dreamed that 7 food plants were growing on one branch. They were fat and good to look at. 
GEN.41.6	After them, 7 other food plants grew. They seemed thin and burned by the east wind. 
GEN.41.7	Then the thin food plants ate the 7 fat plants. Then Pharaoh woke up. It was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	In the morning, Pharaoh was 
GEN.41.9	Then the cupbearer said to Pharaoh, ‘Now I remember the wrong that I have done! 
GEN.41.10	Two (2) years ago, Pharaoh was angry with his servants. He put the baker and me in prison. 
GEN.41.11	One night we both had a dream And each of our dreams had a different meaning. 
GEN.41.12	A young 
GEN.41.13	And everything happened as he had told us. You gave me my job as cupbearer again. And you hanged the baker.’ 
GEN.41.14	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph. And they quickly brought him from the prison. Joseph washed himself. He removed the hair that grew on his face. And he put on clean clothes. Then he stood in front of Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh spoke to Joseph. He said, ‘I had a dream. And no one can tell me what it means. But I have heard people saying that you can tell the meaning of dreams.’ 
GEN.41.16	Joseph replied, ‘I cannot do this. But God will give Pharaoh the answer that he is looking for.’ 
GEN.41.17	Then Pharaoh said, ‘In my dream, I stood at the side of the River Nile. 
GEN.41.18	Then 7 cows came out of the river. They were fat, and good to look at. And they ate the plants at the side of the river. 
GEN.41.19	After them, 7 more cows came out of the river. They were thin and they were not good to look at. I have not seen cows as bad looking as these in Egypt before. 
GEN.41.20	The thin bad looking cows ate the fat cows that came out of the river first. 
GEN.41.21	They ate the 7 fat cows. But you could not see that they had eaten them. They looked thin before they ate the fat cows. They still looked as thin after they ate them. Then I woke up. 
GEN.41.22	In my dream, I also saw 7 food plants. They grew from one branch. They were fat and good to look at. 
GEN.41.23	After them, 7 other plants grew. They seemed thin and burned by the east wind. 
GEN.41.24	The thin plants ate the fat plants. I told those dreams to my men who can tell the meaning of dreams. But they could not tell me the meaning of my dreams.’
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, ‘Pharaoh's dreams both have the same meaning. God has shown Pharaoh what God is going to do. 
GEN.41.26	The 7 fat cows are 7 years. And the 7 good food plants are 7 years. Both dreams have the same meaning. 
GEN.41.27	The 7 thin cows that came out of the river mean 7 years. And the 7 bad plants mean 7 years. Both dreams mean 7 years of 
GEN.41.28	This is what your dreams mean. God has shown Pharaoh what he is going to do. 
GEN.41.29	There will be plenty of food for 7 years. All through the land of Egypt, there will be food. 
GEN.41.30	But 7 years of 
GEN.41.31	No one will remember the first 7 years, when there was plenty of food. They will not remember them because the 
GEN.41.32	God gave you 2 dreams with the same meaning. This is because God has decided what he will do. And he will do it soon. 
GEN.41.33	Now Pharaoh should look for a clever man. He should look for a man who knows what is right and wrong. Tell him to rule over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Pharaoh should choose some officers. They must take one 5th (20%) of the food grown in Egypt, in the 7 years of plenty. 
GEN.41.35	They must store all the food from these good years. Pharaoh will have authority over what happens to the food. 
GEN.41.36	This food should be stored. So the people in Egypt will have enough food, when the 7 years of 
GEN.41.37	Pharaoh thought that Joseph's plan was good. And he told it to all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	Pharaoh said to them, ‘This man has the Spirit of God in him. Can we find anyone else like him?’ 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘God has made these things known to you. There is no one more clever than you. 
GEN.41.40	You will have authority in my palace. All my people will do whatever things you tell them. Only I will be greater than you because I am the king.’ 
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘I give you authority in the whole land of Egypt.’ 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took his king's ring from his finger. And he put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed Joseph in clothes of good material. And he put gold on Joseph's neck. 
GEN.41.43	Joseph rode in a chariot. All the people knew that only Pharaoh had more authority in Egypt. Men shouted, ‘
GEN.41.44	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘I am Pharaoh. But nobody in Egypt will do anything, unless you tell them to.’ 
GEN.41.45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave him a wife. She was called Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera. He was 
GEN.41.46	Joseph was 30 years old when he became Pharaoh's special servant. And Joseph started to work at once. And he travelled all over Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	During the 7 years of plenty, lots of food grew in the land. 
GEN.41.48	Joseph got all this food. He got all the food that they grew in the 7 years of plenty. He stored it in cities in Egypt. He stored the food near the fields where it grew. 
GEN.41.49	Joseph stored large quantities of food. It was like the sand by the sea. Joseph stopped keeping records of the food. He stopped because there was too much food to measure.
GEN.41.50	Before the years of 
GEN.41.51	Joseph called his first born son Manasseh. That was because Joseph said ‘God made me forget all my trouble. And he made me forget all the people who live with my father.’ 
GEN.41.52	Joseph called his second son Ephraim. That was because Joseph said, ‘God has made me have children. I have had them in the land where bad things happened to me.’
GEN.41.53	Then the 7 good years, when there was plenty of food in Egypt, ended. 
GEN.41.54	And the 7 years of 
GEN.41.55	The people of Egypt began to go hungry. And they cried out to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, ‘Go to Joseph. And do as he tells you.’ 
GEN.41.56	The 
GEN.41.57	And people from other countries came to Egypt. They came to buy food from Joseph. They came because the 
GEN.42.1	Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. So he said to his sons, ‘Why do you keep looking at each other? 
GEN.42.2	I have heard that there is food in Egypt. Go there and buy some for us. Buy it so that we do not die.’ 
GEN.42.3	Then 10 of Joseph's brothers went to Egypt. They went to buy food. 
GEN.42.4	But 
GEN.42.5	Jacob's sons were among the people who went to Egypt, to buy food. They went to Egypt because there was 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the man who had authority in the land. He was the man who sold food to all the people. Joseph's brothers arrived in Egypt. And they 
GEN.42.7	As soon as Joseph saw the men, he knew that they were his brothers. But he did not tell them who he was. And he spoke words to them that were not kind. He asked them, ‘Where do you come from?’ They replied ‘From the land of Canaan. We have come to buy food.’ 
GEN.42.8	Joseph knew that they were his brothers. But they did not recognise Joseph. He spoke to his brothers through a man who could speak 
GEN.42.9	Then Joseph remembered his dream about his brothers. He said to them, ‘You have come to see where you can attack our land.’ 
GEN.42.10	They replied ‘No my 
GEN.42.11	We are all the sons of one man. We are honest men. We are not enemies.’ 
GEN.42.12	But Joseph said ‘No! You have come to see where you can attack us.’ 
GEN.42.13	And Joseph's brothers replied ‘We were 12 brothers, the sons of one man. He lives in Canaan. The youngest brother is with our father. And one brother is not with us any more.’ 
GEN.42.14	Joseph said ‘It is as I told you. You have come to see where you can attack us. You are enemies! 
GEN.42.15	I will see if what you say is true. This is how I will see it. As Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place. You will not leave until your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you to get your brother. I will keep the other brothers in prison. Then I will know if what you said is true. If you are not saying what is true, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are enemies!’ 
GEN.42.17	And Joseph put his brothers in prison for 3 days.
GEN.42.18	On the 3rd day Joseph said to them ‘Do what I say. Then you will stay alive, because I believe in God.’ 
GEN.42.19	Joseph said ‘If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay in prison. The other brothers can go back to Canaan. And take food back with you, because your families are hungry. 
GEN.42.20	But you must return to Egypt. And you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that what you say is true. And you will not die.’ And the brothers said, ‘Yes, we will do what you say.’
GEN.42.21	They said to each other, ‘This is happening because of what we did to Joseph. He asked us not to kill him. We saw how sad he was. But we would not listen. That is why we are in this trouble.’ 
GEN.42.22	Reuben said, ‘I told you not to do wrong to the boy. But you would not listen! Now we will have bad things done to us.’ 
GEN.42.23	Joseph had a man who could speak 
GEN.42.24	Joseph turned away from his brothers. And he began to weep. But then he turned to face them again. And he spoke to them again. Then Joseph had Simeon taken from them. And the servants tied Simeon's hands. This happened in front of the other brothers. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph told servants to fill the brothers' bags with food. And he told them to put each man's 
GEN.42.26	Then the brothers put their food on to their 
GEN.42.27	They travelled until it was night. Then they stopped. One of the brothers opened his bag to get food for his 
GEN.42.28	He said to his brothers, ‘They have given back my 
GEN.42.29	Some time passed. And they arrived at Canaan. They went to their father Jacob. And they hold Jacob everything that had happened to them. 
GEN.42.30	They said, ‘There is a man who is 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him “We are honest men. We are not enemies. 
GEN.42.32	We are 12 brothers, all the sons of one father. One brother is not with us any more. And the youngest brother is with our father in Canaan.” 
GEN.42.33	Then the man who is 
GEN.42.34	But you must bring your youngest brother to me. So, I will know that you are not enemies. And I will know that you are honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you. And you can buy and sell things in the land.” ’
GEN.42.35	The brothers emptied their bags. And in their bags, they found each man's 
GEN.42.36	Their father Jacob said to them ‘You have taken my children away from me. Joseph is not here any more. And Simeon is not here any more. And now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!’ 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to Jacob, ‘I will bring Benjamin back to you. If I do not, then you can kill both of my sons. 
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, ‘My son will not go with you. He will not go with you because his brother is dead. He is the only one left. Something bad may happen on your journey. I am an old man. If something bad happened to him, I would die. I would die because I would be so sad.’ 
GEN.43.1	Time passed. And the 
GEN.43.2	Jacob and his 
GEN.43.3	But Judah said, ‘The man told us many times, “Unless your brother is with you, you will not see my face again.” 
GEN.43.4	You must send Benjamin with us. Then we will go and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	But if you do not send Benjamin, we will not go. Because the man said to us, “Unless your brother is with you, you will not see my face again.”’ 
GEN.43.6	Israel (that is Jacob) asked, ‘Why did you bring this trouble on me? You should not have told the man that you had another brother.’ 
GEN.43.7	The brothers replied, ‘The man asked us many questions about our family. He asked, “Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?” We only answered his questions. We did not know that he would say, “Bring your brother here.”’ 
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to 
GEN.43.9	Judah said, ‘I will make you a promise. I will keep Benjamin safe. He will be with me. I will bring him back to you. If I do not, then you can say that it was because of me. And you can say this for all of my life. 
GEN.43.10	Now say what you want to do. We have wasted much time, talking about this. We could have gone to Egypt and returned twice.’
GEN.43.11	Then their father 
GEN.43.12	Jacob said, ‘Take 2 times the amount of 
GEN.43.13	Also take your brother Benjamin. And go back to the man at once. 
GEN.43.14	I 
GEN.43.15	So the brothers took the gifts. And they took twice as much 
GEN.43.16	Joseph saw that Benjamin was with them. He said to a servant who worked in his house, ‘Take these men to my house. Kill an animal and prepare it for a meal. These men will eat with me at noon.’ 
GEN.43.17	The servant did as Joseph told him. He took the men to Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.18	The brothers were frightened when the servant took them to Joseph's house. They thought, ‘He has brought us here because of the 
GEN.43.19	So the brothers went to Joseph's servant. And they spoke to him at the door to Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.20	They said, ‘Please sir. The first time we came here, we came to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	But on our journey back, we stopped because it was night. We opened our bags. And each of us found the same amount of 
GEN.43.22	We have also brought more 
GEN.43.23	The servant replied, ‘Do not 
GEN.43.24	The servant took the men into Joseph's house. He gave them water to wash their feet. And he gave them food for their 
GEN.43.25	The brothers prepared their gifts. They made them ready for when Joseph would come at noon. They had heard that they were to eat there.
GEN.43.26	Joseph arrived. And they gave him the gifts that they had brought into his house. And they 
GEN.43.27	Joseph asked them if they were all right. Then he said ‘How is your old father whom you told me about? Is he still alive?’ 
GEN.43.28	The brothers replied, ‘Your servant, our father is still alive. And he is well.’ And they 
GEN.43.29	Joseph looked about. And he saw his brother Benjamin, who was his mother's son. Joseph asked, ‘Is this your youngest brother? Is this the one that you told me about?’ And Joseph said to Benjamin, ‘God be kind to you, my son.’ 
GEN.43.30	Joseph loved his brother very much and he hurried away. He hurried away because he wanted to weep. He went into his own room. And he wept there. 
GEN.43.31	When he had finished weeping, he washed his face. And he returned to his brothers. And he stopped himself from weeping. He said, ‘Give them the food.’ 
GEN.43.32	Joseph sat away from his brothers. And he ate there. The brothers sat together. And the Egyptians, who ate there, sat together. The Egyptians could not eat with 
GEN.43.33	The brothers sat in front of Joseph. The servants told them to sit in special places, from the oldest to the youngest. And the brothers were surprised. 
GEN.43.34	The servants gave the brothers food from Joseph's table. And they gave Benjamin 5 times more food than his brothers. So the brothers ate and drank 
GEN.44.1	Joseph told his servant, ‘Fill the men's bags. Give them as much food as their animals can carry. And put each man's 
GEN.44.2	Then take my 
GEN.44.3	Morning came, and the men went on their journey with their 
GEN.44.4	They had not gone very far away from the city. Then Joseph said to his servant, ‘Go after those men. Go now. And when you find them, say to them. “Why have you done bad things? We did only good things for you. 
GEN.44.5	You have taken my master's own cup. It is the cup that he drinks from. And he uses it to know what will happen. What you did is wrong.” ’
GEN.44.6	So Joseph's servant went after the men. He found them. And he said the words that Joseph had told him. 
GEN.44.7	But the men said to him, ‘Why do you say these things my 
GEN.44.8	We even gave back the 
GEN.44.9	If any one of us has this cup, they will die. And the rest of us will become my 
GEN.44.10	The servant said, ‘Very well. It will be as you say. Whoever has the cup, will become my slave. The rest of you will go free.’ 
GEN.44.11	Each man quickly put his bag on the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	Then the servant began to look in the bags. He began with the oldest man's bag. And he finished with the youngest man's bag. And he found the cup in Benjamin's bag. 
GEN.44.13	When this happened they tore their clothes. They tore them because they were very 
GEN.44.14	Joseph was still in his house. And Judah and his brothers arrived. And they threw themselves on the ground in front of Joseph. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said, ‘What have you done? Do you not know about a man like me? I can find out what people do.’ 
GEN.44.16	Judah said, ‘I do not know what to say to you, my 
GEN.44.17	But Joseph said, ‘I would not do a thing like that! Only the man whose bag contained the cup will be my slave. The rest of you can return to your father. You may go as friends.’
GEN.44.18	Then Judah went up to Joseph. He said, ‘Please my 
GEN.44.19	My 
GEN.44.20	And we replied, “We have a father. He is old. And he has a young son. This son was born when our father was old. His brother is dead. And he is the only remaining son of his mother. And his father loves him.” 
GEN.44.21	Then you said, “Bring him to me so that I can see him.” 
GEN.44.22	And we said, “The boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves him, his father will die.” 
GEN.44.23	But you said to us “Your youngest brother must come with you. If he does not come, you will not see my face again.” 
GEN.44.24	We returned to our father. And we told him what you said. 
GEN.44.25	Some time passed. And our father said, “Go back and buy some more food.” 
GEN.44.26	But we said, “We cannot go. We can only go if our youngest brother comes with us. Unless our youngest brother is with us, we cannot see the man's face again.” 
GEN.44.27	My father said to us, “My wife gave birth to 2 sons. 
GEN.44.28	One of them went away from me. And I said, ‘He has been eaten by a wild animal.’ And I have not seen him after that. 
GEN.44.29	If you take my youngest son from me, something bad may happen to him. Then I will die, because I will be so sad.” ’ 
GEN.44.30	Judah said, ‘I could go back to my father. But my father lives because of this boy. And if the boy is not with us, then my father will die. He will die because he is so sad. He will die because we did not bring the boy back. 
GEN.44.31	He will see that the boy is not with us. And he will die. Because we did not bring the boy back to him, he will be so sad. 
GEN.44.32	I promised my father that I would keep the boy safe. I said, “I will bring the boy back. If I do not, then you can say that it was because of me. You can say this for the rest of my life!” 
GEN.44.33	Please let me stay here. Let me stay as your slave instead of the boy. And let the boy return with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	I cannot go back to my father. Not if the boy is not with me. No! Do not let me see how sad my father will be.’ 
GEN.45.1	After Judah said this, Joseph could not stop himself from crying. In front of all his servants he shouted, ‘Make everyone leave me!’ So there was no one with Joseph except his brothers. And he told his brothers who he was. 
GEN.45.2	And Joseph wept loudly. And the Egyptians heard him. And Pharaoh's 
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?’ But his brothers did not answer him. They did not answer him because they were too frightened. They were frightened because Joseph was with them. 
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘Come close to me.’ When they did this he said, ‘I am your brother Joseph. I am the one that you sold into Egypt! 
GEN.45.5	Now, do not 
GEN.45.6	There has been a 
GEN.45.7	But God sent me in front of you, so that you would stay alive. And to make sure that your 
GEN.45.8	So you did not send me here. God sent me here. He made me an officer to Pharaoh. I have more authority than any other officer. I have authority over all of Egypt. And I rule all Egypt.’ 
GEN.45.9	‘Now hurry back to my father. Say to him, “This is what your son Joseph says. ‘God has made me 
GEN.45.10	You can live in the place called Goshen. You and your children can live there. And your grandchildren can live there. And all your animals and everything that you have can live there. And you will be near me. 
GEN.45.11	I will give you everything that you need. Because there are still 5 years of 
GEN.45.12	You can all see that I am Joseph. And so can my brother Benjamin. 
GEN.45.13	Tell my father how much authority I have in Egypt. And tell him about everything that you saw here. And bring my father here quickly.’
GEN.45.14	Then he hugged his brother Benjamin. And he wept. And Benjamin hugged Joseph. And Benjamin wept. 
GEN.45.15	Then Joseph kissed all of his brothers. And he wept over them. After this, his brothers talked to him.
GEN.45.16	Pharaoh heard that Joseph's brothers were in Egypt. And Pharaoh and his officers were happy. 
GEN.45.17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘Tell your brothers, “Do this. Put food on your 
GEN.45.18	And bring your father. And bring your families. Bring them back to me. I will give you the best land in Egypt. And you will have everything that Egypt can give you.” ’ 
GEN.45.19	Pharaoh said, ‘You must also tell them, “Do this. Take some carts from Egypt. They are for your wives and children. And get your father. Then come here.” 
GEN.45.21	So the sons of 
GEN.45.22	Joseph gave each brother new clothes. But he gave Benjamin 300 pieces of 
GEN.45.23	And Joseph sent these things to his father:
GEN.45.23	10 
GEN.45.23	10 female 
GEN.45.23	and other food for the journey.
GEN.45.24	Then Joseph sent his brothers on their journey. As they left he said, ‘Do not argue on the way!’
GEN.45.25	So the brothers left Egypt. And then they arrived in Canaan, where their father Jacob was. 
GEN.45.26	They told him, ‘Joseph is still alive! He rules over all of Egypt.’ Jacob was surprised. And he did not believe what they said. 
GEN.45.27	So the brothers told Jacob everything that Joseph had said to them. And Jacob saw the carts that Joseph sent to carry him back to Egypt. So Jacob began to be happy. 
GEN.45.28	And 
GEN.46.1	So 
GEN.46.2	And God spoke to 
GEN.46.3	God said, ‘I am God. I am the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go to Egypt. I will make you have many 
GEN.46.4	I will go to Egypt with you. And I will bring you back again. And you will be with Joseph when you die.’
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob left Beersheba. And 
GEN.46.6	They also took all their animals and everything that they had got in Canaan. And Jacob and all his family went to Egypt. 
GEN.46.7	He took his sons and grandsons, and his daughters and granddaughters. He took all his family to Egypt.
GEN.46.8	These are the names of the sons of 
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah, (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These were the sons that Leah gave birth to in Paddan Aram. Jacob was their father. Leah also gave birth to a daughter, Dinah. These sons and daughters of Jacob's were 33 in all. 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel. 
GEN.46.18	These were the children that Zilpah gave birth to. Jacob was their father. Leah gave Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. There were 16 children in all. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph. Their mother was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, 
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These were the sons of Rachel, born to Jacob. There were 14 in all. 
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These were the sons born to Jacob. Their mother was Bilhah. Rachel gave her to Jacob as a wife. There were 7 in all. 
GEN.46.26	Jacob's 
GEN.46.27	Jacob's family came to 70 people. This included Joseph's 2 sons. They were born in Egypt. All these were in Egypt with Jacob.
GEN.46.28	Now Jacob sent Judah in front of him. He sent him to Joseph, to learn how to get to Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	Joseph had his chariot prepared. And he went to Goshen to meet his father 
GEN.46.30	Israel said to Joseph, ‘Now I am ready to die. Because I have seen for myself that you are still alive.’ 
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph spoke to his brother and to his father's 
GEN.46.32	The men are 
GEN.46.33	Pharaoh will call you to him and ask, “What is your job?” 
GEN.46.34	Then you should answer, “We are 
GEN.47.1	Joseph went to Pharaoh. He told him, ‘My father and brothers, and all their animals are now in Goshen. They have come from Canaan. And they have brought everything that belongs to them.’ 
GEN.47.2	Joseph chose 5 of his brothers. And he took them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	Pharaoh asked the brothers, ‘What is your job?’ The brothers replied, ‘We are 
GEN.47.4	They said to Pharaoh, ‘We have come here because the 
GEN.47.5	Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is here for them. Your fathers and brothers can stay in the best part of the land. They can live in Goshen. You may know some of them who are good at what they do. If you do, then they can keep my own animals safe.’
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in to Pharaoh. Jacob 
GEN.47.8	Then Pharaoh asked Jacob, ‘How old are you?’ 
GEN.47.9	Jacob replied, ‘I have been alive for 130 years. My years have been few, and difficult. And I am not as old as my 
GEN.47.10	Then Jacob 
GEN.47.11	So Joseph's father and brothers stayed in Egypt. And Joseph gave them houses in the best part of the land. This was in the place called Rameses. Joseph did as Pharaoh had told him to. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph also gave food to his father, his brothers and all his father's 
GEN.47.13	But, because the 
GEN.47.14	Joseph had all the money in Egypt. He received it from the people in return for food. And Joseph brought all the money to Pharaoh's 
GEN.47.15	Soon the people did not have any more money. Everyone came to Joseph and said, ‘Give us food. Do not let us die. We do not have any more money.’ 
GEN.47.16	And Joseph replied, ‘Then bring me your animals. Because you do not have any more money, I will give you food. But you must give me your animals in return.’ 
GEN.47.17	So the people brought their animals to Joseph. And he sold them food in return for their animals. They brought horses, sheep, goats, cows and 
GEN.47.18	The year ended. And the people came to Joseph again and said, ‘You know that we do not have any money. And our animals now belong to you. We have nothing left to sell. We only have our land and ourselves. 
GEN.47.19	Do not let us die! And do not let our fields stay empty because we do not have seed to plant. Give us food. And we will be Pharaoh's slaves. And our land will belong to Pharaoh. Give us seed to plant. Give it to us so that we will not die. And then our fields will not be empty.’
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Because the 
GEN.47.21	And all the people in Egypt worked for Pharaoh. They were like slaves. 
GEN.47.22	But Joseph did not buy the land belonging to the 
GEN.47.23	Joseph said to the people, ‘I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now I will give you some seed to plant in the fields. 
GEN.47.24	But when the plants are ready to eat, you must give one 5th to Pharaoh. You may keep the other four 5ths. You may keep it for seed to plant again. And for food for you, your 
GEN.47.25	The people said, ‘You have not let us die. So we agree to be slaves of the king.’ 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made a 
GEN.47.27	For all of that time, the 
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in Egypt for 17 years. And he lived for 147 years in all.
GEN.47.29	The time came for 
GEN.47.30	Jacob said, ‘When I die, carry my body out of Egypt. And bury me where my 
GEN.47.31	Jacob said ‘Promise me.’ Then Joseph made a promise to him. And 
GEN.48.1	Some time passed. And someone told Joseph, ‘Your father is ill.’ So, Joseph took his 2 sons, Manasseh and Ephraim with him. 
GEN.48.2	Someone told Jacob, ‘Your son Joseph has come to you.’ So 
GEN.48.3	Jacob said to Joseph, ‘God 
GEN.48.4	He said to me, “I am going to make good things happen to you, and give you many 
GEN.48.5	Now you have 2 sons. They were born before I came to Egypt. They will be like my own sons. People will think of Ephraim and Manasseh as my sons, as they think of Reuben and Simeon as my sons. 
GEN.48.6	Any children born to you after them will be your own children. They will 
GEN.48.7	Rachel died on our journey from Paddan. I was very sad. She died a few miles from Ephrath. So I buried her there, next to the road to Ephrath (that is Bethlehem).’ 
GEN.48.8	Joseph brought Ephraim and Manasseh to Jacob. And Jacob asked, ‘Who are these?’ 
GEN.48.9	Joseph replied, ‘They are my sons. God gave them to me in Egypt.’ Then 
GEN.48.10	Now 
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, ‘I never thought that I would see your face again. And now God has let me see your children too.’ 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph removed his sons from Jacob's knees. And he 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took his 2 sons. He put Ephraim by 
GEN.48.14	But 
GEN.48.15	Then 
GEN.48.16	He is the 
GEN.48.17	Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim's head. And Joseph thought that this was wrong. So he took hold of his father's hand. And he moved it from Ephraim's head. And he put it on Manasseh's head. 
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said to Jacob, ‘No my father. This son is the oldest. Put your right hand on his head.’ 
GEN.48.19	But Jacob put his right hand on Ephraim's head. And he said, ‘I know, my son, I know. Manasseh will also have many 
GEN.48.20	That day Jacob 
GEN.48.21	Then 
GEN.48.22	And you are over your brothers. So, I give you the part of the land that I took from the Amorites. It is the land that I fought for.’ 
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called for his sons. He said, ‘Come here to me. Then I can tell you what will happen to you, in future years. 
GEN.49.2	Sons of Jacob come together and listen. Listen to your father, 
GEN.49.3	Jacob said, ‘Reuben you are my oldest son. You were my first child after I became a man. Of all my sons, you think yourself most important. And you are the strongest.
GEN.49.4	Yet you are as wild as the sea. People will no longer know you as the most important son (or first-born son) because you went to your father's bed. And you slept with my 
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brothers. They use their 
GEN.49.5	Verse 4 See also 35:22.
GEN.49.5	Verse 5 See also 34:26.
GEN.49.6	I will not take part in their plans. They kill men when they are angry. And they hurt animals only because they want to. So, I will not meet with them.
GEN.49.7	May they be 
GEN.49.8	Judah, your brothers will 
GEN.49.9	Judah is like a wild animal that has eaten its meal. He rests after eating. Nobody would want to wake a wild animal.
GEN.49.10	The royal sceptre will not leave him. And the 
GEN.49.14	Issachar is like a 
GEN.49.15	He saw how good his resting-place was. And he saw how nice the country was. So he stayed there. And he worked like a slave for other people.’ 
GEN.49.17	He will be as dangerous as a snake on the road. He will be like a snake that bites the feet of horses. Then the person falls off the horse.
GEN.49.18	I look to you to keep me safe 
GEN.49.20	Asher will have good food. It will be good enough for kings to eat.’ 
GEN.49.22	Joseph is like a 
GEN.49.24	But he stayed strong and beat them. That was because the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob (the 
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is like a hungry wild animal. He kills an animal and eats it in the morning. In the evening, he gives what remains to his people.’ 
GEN.49.28	All these are the 12 
GEN.49.29	Then Jacob said to his 12 sons, ‘I am about to die. So take my body from here. Take my body to Canaan. Bury me with my 
GEN.49.30	The 
GEN.49.31	That is where they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. And it is where they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah. And this is where I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	Abraham bought the field and the 
GEN.49.33	Jacob finished telling his sons what he wanted them to do. And he lay on his bed. He died. And he went to be with his 
GEN.50.1	Joseph hugged his father's body. And he wept over him. And he kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph spoke to his servants who were doctors. He told them to put special oil and material on Jacob's body. They did this so that it would stay whole. And it would not smell. So, Joseph's servants did as he said. 
GEN.50.3	The servants did this for 40 days. Because that is how long it takes to put the special oil and material on a body. And the Egyptians were sad for 70 days because Jacob died. 
GEN.50.4	The days of showing that they were sad ended. And Joseph said to Pharaoh's officers, ‘If you agree, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him: 
GEN.50.5	“My father made me make a promise. He said, ‘I am going to die soon. Bury me in the 
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh said, ‘Go and bury your father. Because he made you promise that you would.’
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went to bury his father. All Pharaoh's officers went with him. These were the important people who lived in Pharaoh's 
GEN.50.8	And every one in Joseph's 
GEN.50.9	 and men on horses went with them. Very many people went with Joseph to bury Jacob. 
GEN.50.10	They came to Atad, near the River Jordan. They stopped at the place where people separated food plants. (They separated the good to eat parts from the parts that they could not eat.) And they stayed there for 7 days. And they showed that they were very sad. They were sad because Jacob died. 
GEN.50.11	The people were showing that they were sad. The Canaanites saw this at Atad. And they said, ‘The Egyptians are showing that they are sad. This is because someone died.’ And they called that place Abel Mizraim. 
GEN.50.12	So Jacob's sons did what he had told them. 
GEN.50.13	They carried his body to Canaan. And they buried him in the 
GEN.50.14	So Joseph buried his father. Then he returned to Egypt together with his brothers. And everyone who went with him returned too.
GEN.50.15	So Jacob was dead. And Joseph's brothers were frightened. They said to each other, ‘We did a bad thing to Joseph. Perhaps he now wants to do something bad to us.’ 
GEN.50.16	So they sent a message to Joseph. It said, ‘Your father said this to us before he died: 
GEN.50.17	“This is what you are to say to Joseph: I, Jacob ask you to 
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers came. And they 
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, ‘Do not be frightened. Only God 
GEN.50.20	‘You wanted to hurt me. But God wanted what you did for his good plan. God is saving many lives because I am here. 
GEN.50.21	So do not be frightened. I will give you what you need for you, and your children.’ And Joseph spoke kind words to them. So, they knew that he would not hurt them.
GEN.50.22	Joseph stayed in Egypt with all his father's family. He lived for 110 years. 
GEN.50.23	And he saw the 3rd 
GEN.50.24	Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am about to die. But God will come and help you. And he will take you out of Egypt. He will take you to the land that he promised to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.’ 
GEN.50.25	And Joseph made the sons of 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died when he was 110 years old. And they put special oil and materials on his body. And they put his body in a special box. 
EXO.1.1	The sons of 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher. Joseph was already in Egypt. 
EXO.1.5	There were 70 people in Jacob's family.
EXO.1.6	After some time, Joseph died and his brothers also died. All the people who had lived during Joseph's life died. 
EXO.1.7	But the 
EXO.1.8	After some more time had passed, a new king began to rule in Egypt. He did not know anything about Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, ‘Look! The 
EXO.1.10	We must be very careful. If we do nothing, even more of them will be born. Then, if there is a war they will join our enemies. The enemies and the 
EXO.1.11	So the 
EXO.1.12	The 
EXO.1.13	So the 
EXO.1.14	The 
EXO.1.15	There were two 
EXO.1.16	‘When you help the 
EXO.1.16	If they have a baby boy, kill him.
EXO.1.16	If they have a baby girl, let her live.’
EXO.1.17	But the two women did not obey the king of Egypt. They obeyed God and they let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	Then the King of Egypt caused the two women to come to him. He asked them: ‘Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?’ 
EXO.1.19	The two women answered Pharaoh. They said, ‘
EXO.1.20	Because of this, God was kind to the two women. The people grew in number and they became very strong. 
EXO.1.21	Because the two women obeyed God, he gave them families of their own.
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh spoke to his people. He said: ‘When an 
EXO.2.1	At this time, there was an 
EXO.2.2	A baby boy was born. His mother saw that he was a very beautiful baby. So she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	Then the woman could not continue to hide him. So she took a basket that someone had made from dry river grass. She painted the basket with sticky black paint, to keep the water out of it. The mother put her baby in the basket. Then she put the basket on the edge of the river, among the river grasses. 
EXO.2.4	The baby's sister stood not very far away. She wanted to see what would happen to the baby.
EXO.2.5	Now the daughter of 
EXO.2.6	When 
EXO.2.7	Then the baby's sister spoke to 
EXO.2.9	's daughter spoke to the baby's mother. She said: ‘Take this baby away and 
EXO.2.10	When the baby was older, his mother brought him to 
EXO.2.11	Many years later, Moses grew to be a man. At that time, he went out to look at the 
EXO.2.12	Moses looked in every direction. He saw nobody near. Then Moses killed the 
EXO.2.13	Moses went out again the next day and he saw two 
EXO.2.14	The man answered: ‘You should not be a ruler and a 
EXO.2.15	Then someone told 
EXO.2.16	Now the 
EXO.2.17	But the 
EXO.2.18	When the girls came to Reuel, their father, he asked them a question. He said: ‘Why have you come home so soon today?’
EXO.2.19	They answered: ‘An 
EXO.2.20	Reuel said to his daughters, ‘Where is the man? You should not have left him there. Ask him to come here so that he can eat bread with us.’ 
EXO.2.21	Moses was happy to stay with Reuel. Reuel gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as his wife. 
EXO.2.22	After several months, Zipporah gave birth to a baby boy. Moses called the boy Gershom. He called him that because he said: ‘I have been a stranger in a foreign country.’ 
EXO.2.23	After a long time had passed, the king of Egypt died. The 
EXO.2.24	God heard them crying because they were slaves. He remembered his promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	So God looked at the 
EXO.3.1	Moses fed the animals of Jethro the 
EXO.3.2	There the 
EXO.3.3	Moses said to himself: ‘I will go and see this strange thing. I want to see why the bush is not burned.’
EXO.3.4	Then the 
EXO.3.5	God said to Moses: ‘Do not come near this place. Remove your shoes from your feet. The place where you stand is 
EXO.3.6	Then God said: ‘I am the God of your fathers. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’ Then Moses hid his face. He was afraid to look at God. 
EXO.3.7	Then the 
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to save them from the 
EXO.3.9	And now I have heard 
EXO.3.10	Now go! I will send you to Pharaoh. You will lead my people, the 
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God: ‘I am not an important person. I cannot go to Pharaoh. I cannot lead the 
EXO.3.12	God said to Moses: ‘I will be with you. After you have led the people out of Egypt you will 
EXO.3.13	Then Moses answered God. He said: ‘If I go to the 
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses: ‘I am who I am! Say to the 
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses: ‘Say this to the 
EXO.3.16	Go and bring together the leaders of 
EXO.3.17	I have promised that I will bring you out of your difficult life in Egypt. I will bring you into the country of the 
EXO.3.18	The leaders of the 
EXO.3.19	I know that the king of Egypt will not want to let you go. He will only let you go if someone more powerful than himself causes him to obey.
EXO.3.20	So I will show him my powerful authority. I will cause very strange and bad things to happen to Egypt. I will do great and powerful things to that country. After that, Pharaoh will let you go.
EXO.3.21	And I will cause the 
EXO.3.22	Each 
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered: ‘But perhaps the leaders of Israel will not believe me. Perhaps they will not listen to my voice. Perhaps they will say: “The 
EXO.4.2	Then the 
EXO.4.3	The 
EXO.4.4	But the 
EXO.4.5	God said, ‘Do this, and they will believe you. They will believe that the 
EXO.4.6	Then the 
EXO.4.7	Then God said: ‘Put your hand back inside your clothes, near to your heart.’ So Moses did that. And when he took his hand out, it was well again. It was the same as the other parts of his body.
EXO.4.8	God said, ‘They may not believe you. They may not think that the first 
EXO.4.9	But if they will not believe the two 
EXO.4.10	But Moses said to the 
EXO.4.11	Then the 
EXO.4.12	Now go! I will help you to speak. I will teach you what to say.’
EXO.4.13	But Moses said, ‘Oh Master, please send some other person.’
EXO.4.14	Then the 
EXO.4.15	Then you must speak to him. You must tell him what to say. I will help both of you to speak. And I will teach you what you must do. 
EXO.4.16	Aaron will speak to the people for you. You will be like God to him. You will tell Aaron what to say. 
EXO.4.17	Take this stick with you. You will use this stick to do the 
EXO.4.18	Then Moses went back to Jethro, his wife's father. Moses said to Jethro: ‘Please let me return to my family in Egypt. I must see if they are still alive.’ So Jethro said to Moses: ‘Go in peace.’ 
EXO.4.19	The 
EXO.4.20	So Moses put his wife and his sons on a 
EXO.4.21	Then the 
EXO.4.22	Then you must speak to Pharaoh. You must say: “The 
EXO.4.23	I have already said to you: Let my son go so that he can 
EXO.4.24	On the way to Egypt, there was a house where people can rest on their journey. The 
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah took a sharp stone and she cut off her son's 
EXO.4.26	So God did not do anything bad to Moses. Then Zipporah said to Moses: ‘You are a husband of blood, because of this 
EXO.4.27	The 
EXO.4.28	Then Moses told Aaron all that the 
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went to Egypt. They brought together all the leaders of the 
EXO.4.30	Aaron told them all the things that the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed Aaron and Moses. They had heard that the 
EXO.5.1	After this, Moses and Aaron went to visit Pharaoh. They said to him: ‘Listen to what the 
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh said: ‘I do not know the 
EXO.5.3	Moses and Aaron said: ‘The God of the 
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said: ‘Moses and Aaron, you must not take the people away from their work! Go back to your jobs!’ 
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said: ‘Look, there are now many people in the country. But you stop them doing their work.’
EXO.5.6	On that day, Pharaoh gave a 
EXO.5.7	This was the 
EXO.5.8	But they must still make the same number of 
EXO.5.9	So you must cause them to work harder. They will then be too busy to listen to false words.’ 
EXO.5.10	So the slaves' masters and the leaders of the work went to the people. They said to them: ‘Pharaoh says: “I will not give you 
EXO.5.11	You must find your own 
EXO.5.12	So the people went everywhere in the land of Egypt, to get 
EXO.5.13	The slaves' masters made the 
EXO.5.14	Pharaoh's slave masters hit the leaders who had authority over the people. They said to them: ‘Why have you not made as many 
EXO.5.15	Then the 
EXO.5.16	Our masters do not give us any 
EXO.5.17	But Pharaoh said: ‘You are lazy! You are only lazy! That is why you say: “Let us go. Let us take gifts to the 
EXO.5.18	Now go and do your work. Nobody will give you any 
EXO.5.19	The 
EXO.5.20	Then the 
EXO.5.21	And the leaders spoke to Moses and Aaron. They said: ‘We hope that the 
EXO.5.22	Then Moses returned to the 
EXO.5.23	I came to speak in your name. But since I spoke to Pharaoh, he has done only bad things to the people. And you have done nothing to save your people.’
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God said to Moses: ‘I am the 
EXO.6.3	I showed myself to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob, as God 
EXO.6.4	I also made my special promise to them. I promised to give them the country of Canaan. I promised to give them the country where they had lived as foreign people. 
EXO.6.5	And I have heard the 
EXO.6.6	So you must say this to the 
EXO.6.7	I will make you my own people and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you to another country. I made a very serious promise to give that other country to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you and it will be your own country. I am the 
EXO.6.9	Moses reported these words to the 
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	‘Go and speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Tell him that he must let the 
EXO.6.12	But Moses said to the 
EXO.6.13	Then the 
EXO.6.14	These were the leaders of the whole families:

EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters. Phinehas was their son.
EXO.6.25	These were the leaders of the families of the 
EXO.6.26	This Aaron and Moses are the same men to whom the 
EXO.6.27	Yes, it was the same Moses and Aaron who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt. They told him that the 
EXO.6.28	When the 
EXO.6.29	he said, ‘I am the 
EXO.6.30	Then Moses said: ‘Look, my lips are unable to speak good words from the 
EXO.7.1	Then the 
EXO.7.2	You must say everything that I 
EXO.7.3	‘But I will make Pharaoh angry and cruel. He will refuse to listen to you. I will do even more great 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you. Then I will show my authority to Egypt. And I will remove my army, my people the 
EXO.7.5	Then the 
EXO.7.6	So Moses and Aaron obeyed all the 
EXO.7.7	Now Moses was 80 years old when he spoke to Pharaoh. And Aaron was 83 years old.
EXO.7.8	Then the 
EXO.7.9	‘Pharaoh will say: “Show me one of your special 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They did everything that the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.7.12	Each 
EXO.7.13	But still Pharaoh felt angry and cruel. He refused to listen to Moses and Aaron. This was what the 
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes to the river. Wait for him by the edge of the river. Then take in your hand the stick that became a snake. 
EXO.7.16	Then say to him: “The 
EXO.7.17	So this is what the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish in the water will die. And the river will have a very bad smell. Then the 
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron obeyed the 
EXO.7.21	The fish in the river died. The river became bad and the 
EXO.7.22	But the 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh turned and he went away into his house. He did not think about what had happened. 
EXO.7.24	And the 
EXO.7.25	Seven days went by after the 
EXO.8.1	The 
EXO.8.2	But if you do not let them go, I will send thousands of 
EXO.8.3	The river will be full of 
EXO.8.4	The 
EXO.8.5	Then the 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron lifted up his hand over the waters of Egypt. Then the 
EXO.8.7	But the 
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh: ‘You can choose the time when I will speak to God. Then I will ask God to do this for you, for your servants and for your people. I will ask God to remove the 
EXO.8.10	And Pharaoh said: ‘Do it tomorrow.’
EXO.8.10	Moses answered: ‘It will be as you say. Then you will know that there is nobody like the 
EXO.8.11	The 
EXO.8.12	So Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh. Then Moses prayed to the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	The people swept the 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that the 
EXO.8.16	Then the 
EXO.8.17	Moses and Aaron obeyed God. Aaron lifted up his hand and he hit the dirt with his stick. Then 
EXO.8.18	Then the 
EXO.8.19	Then the 
EXO.8.20	Then the 
EXO.8.21	If you do not let my people go, I will send thousands of flies on you. I will send them on your servants and on your people. I will send them into your houses. The houses of the 
EXO.8.22	But on that day, the country of Goshen will be separate. That is where my people live. There will be no flies there. Then you will know that I, the 
EXO.8.23	I will make a difference between my people and your people. This 
EXO.8.24	And this is what the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.8.26	But Moses said: ‘It would not be right to do that. The 
EXO.8.27	We must go on a journey for three days, into the 
EXO.8.28	So Pharaoh said: ‘I will let you go. You can 
EXO.8.29	Then Moses said: ‘I will leave you now. And I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	So Moses left Pharaoh and Moses prayed to the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	But again, Pharaoh refused to let the people go. There was no change in his thoughts.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	If you refuse to let them go, you will have trouble. If you still keep them in Egypt, 
EXO.9.3	the 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	So on the next day, the 
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh sent men to see what had happened. And they reported that not one of the animals of the 
EXO.9.8	Then the 
EXO.9.9	They will become very small bits of dirt over the whole country of Egypt. These will cause 
EXO.9.10	So they took ashes from the fire and they stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses threw the ashes up in the air. And 
EXO.9.11	Because of the 
EXO.9.12	But Pharaoh refused to listen to them. The 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	Or this time, I will send all my worst troubles against you. I will send them against your servants and against your people. I want you to know that there is nobody like me in the whole earth. That is why I am doing this. 
EXO.9.15	Already I could have killed you and your people with one very bad trouble. I could have removed you from the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But I have let you live, to show you my power. This is so that people will speak about my powerful name, over the whole world. 
EXO.9.17	You still think bad thoughts about my people. You will not let them go.
EXO.9.18	Look! Tomorrow at this time, I will send a very great storm. Heavy pieces of ice will fall. Nobody has ever seen anything like this in Egypt. From Egypt's first day as a country, nobody has seen a storm like this. 
EXO.9.19	Now send your servants out. They must bring all your animals from the fields into the buildings. The ice will fall on every human and on every animal that is outside. They will all die.’ ” ’
EXO.9.20	Then those of Pharaoh's servants who were afraid of the 
EXO.9.21	But those who did not listen to the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	When Moses lifted up his stick towards the sky, the 
EXO.9.24	The ice fell and the fire burned. It was the worst storm that the country of Egypt had ever known. 
EXO.9.25	The ice knocked down everything that was in the fields. In the whole country of Egypt it hit both people and animals. It knocked down every plant in the fields and it broke every tree. 
EXO.9.26	But in the country of Goshen, there were no pieces of ice. That was where 
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.9.28	Pray to the 
EXO.9.29	Then Moses said to Pharaoh: ‘When I have left the city, I will lift my hands to the 
EXO.9.30	But I know you and your servants. You still do not believe in the 
EXO.9.31	The large pieces of ice had destroyed the 
EXO.9.32	But the ice had not destroyed the wheat and the spelt. This was because they appeared out of the ground later. 
EXO.9.33	Then Moses left Pharaoh and Moses went out of the city. Moses lifted up his hands to the 
EXO.9.34	Pharaoh saw that the rain and the ice and the storms had stopped. But he did a wrong thing again. He and his servants did not do what they had promised to do. There had been no change in his thoughts. 
EXO.9.35	Pharaoh still refused to listen to God. He did not let the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	You can tell your sons and your grandsons how I 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said to him: ‘The 
EXO.10.4	If you refuse to let them go, I will bring 
EXO.10.5	And they will cover the whole country. Nobody will be able to see the ground. They will eat everything that the ice has not destroyed. This will include every tree that is still growing in your fields.
EXO.10.6	They will fill your houses. They will fill your servants' houses. And they will fill the 
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh's servants said to him: ‘Stop keeping this man with us, to cause problems. Let the people go, to 
EXO.10.8	So Pharaoh 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said: ‘We will all go, both young people and old people. We will take our sons and daughters. We will take our animals, because we must have a party for the 
EXO.10.10	Pharaoh said to them: ‘The 
EXO.10.11	No! Only the men can go and 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses lifted up his stick over the country of Egypt. And the 
EXO.10.14	And the 
EXO.10.15	The 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh quickly 
EXO.10.17	Please 
EXO.10.18	Then Moses left Pharaoh and Moses prayed to the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses lifted up his hand towards the sky and it became completely dark through the whole country of Egypt. It was dark for three days. 
EXO.10.23	People could not see each other. Nobody could get up and move about for three days. But all the 
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.10.25	But Moses said: ‘You must also let us take animals with us. We will 
EXO.10.26	‘We must take our animals with us. Not one can remain behind. We will use some of them to 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Then Pharaoh said to Moses: ‘Go away from me! Never appear in front of me again! On the day that you see my face, you will die!’ 
EXO.10.29	And Moses said: ‘You are right! I will never appear in front of you again.’
EXO.11.1	The 
EXO.11.2	Tell the people now what they must do. Every man must ask the 
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	So Moses said: ‘The 
EXO.11.5	Then all the 
EXO.11.6	‘ “Everyone will be crying loudly in the whole country called Egypt. Never before have the people felt so sad or cried so loudly. It will never happen again. 
EXO.11.7	But among the 
EXO.11.8	All these servants of yours will come to me. They will fall down in front of me. They will say to me: “Go! Both you and all the people who follow you.” And then, I will leave.’ Then Moses was very angry and he left Pharaoh.
EXO.11.9	The 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these signs in front of Pharaoh. But the 
EXO.12.1	The 
EXO.12.2	He said: ‘This month will be for you the first month of your year. 
EXO.12.3	Tell the 
EXO.12.4	The family may be too small to eat a whole sheep. Then they must eat it with another small family. You must decide this by how much each person can eat. 
EXO.12.5	Each young sheep must have nothing wrong with it. It must be a male that is one year old. It can be either a young sheep or a young goat.
EXO.12.6	Keep the young sheep safe until the 14th day of the month. Then all 
EXO.12.7	Then they must take some of the blood. They must put it on the wood that is round the door of their houses. They must do this to the houses where they will eat the young sheep. 
EXO.12.8	That night, they must cook the meat over the fire and they must eat it. They must eat it with special plants and with bread that has no 
EXO.12.9	You must cook the meat, but do not boil it in water. Cook the meat over the fire, with the head, the legs and the inside parts of the animal. 
EXO.12.10	You must eat all of the meat before the morning comes. If you cannot eat it before the morning, then you must burn it. 
EXO.12.11	This is how you must eat the young sheep: Fix your belt round your coat, put your shoes on your feet. Take your stick in your hand and eat the food quickly.
EXO.12.11	This meal will be called the 
EXO.12.12	I will pass through the country of Egypt on that night. I will kill every 
EXO.12.13	The blood will be a 
EXO.12.14	‘You must remember this day as a special day every year. On this day, you must make a special party for the 
EXO.12.15	For 7 days, you must eat bread with no 
EXO.12.16	On the first day, you must bring together all the people to a special meeting. And you must do the same thing on the 7th day. On these special days, you must not do any work except to prepare food. This is the only work that you can do.
EXO.12.17	Enjoy the meal of the bread with no 
EXO.12.18	In the first month, you must eat bread without 
EXO.12.19	You must not have any 
EXO.12.20	Eat nothing that has

EXO.12.22	Take some 
EXO.12.23	‘The 
EXO.12.24	You must obey these rules always, both you and your sons, for all time. 
EXO.12.25	You will come into the country that the 
EXO.12.26	Your children may say to you: “What does this party mean to you?” 
EXO.12.27	Then you must say to them: “It is the 
EXO.12.28	And the 
EXO.12.29	At midnight, the 
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh and all his servants got up in the middle of the night. All the 
EXO.12.31	Then Pharaoh 
EXO.12.32	Take all your animals with you, as you have said. Go away! But ask God to do good things to me too.’
EXO.12.33	The 
EXO.12.34	So the 
EXO.12.35	The 
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	Then the 
EXO.12.38	Many other people travelled with them. And they had a very large number of animals, both sheep and cows. 
EXO.12.39	The 
EXO.12.40	The 
EXO.12.41	It was on the last day of the 430 years that all the 
EXO.12.42	The 
EXO.12.43	Then the 
EXO.12.43	No foreign person can eat the 
EXO.12.44	If you buy a foreign slave, you must first 
EXO.12.45	But if you pay him money for his work, he must not eat the food. A visitor must not eat the food.
EXO.12.46	You must eat the meat in one house. You must not take any of the meat outside the house. You must not break any of the bones in the meat. 
EXO.12.47	All the 
EXO.12.48	There may be a foreign person who lives among you. He may want to enjoy the 
EXO.12.49	The 
EXO.12.50	All the 
EXO.12.51	And on the same day, the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	He said: ‘Keep every 
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people: ‘Remember this day, the day when you came out of Egypt. You left the place where you were slaves. The 
EXO.13.4	Today you are leaving Egypt. It is the month of Abib. 
EXO.13.5	The 
EXO.13.6	For 7 days you must eat bread without 
EXO.13.7	Eat bread without 
EXO.13.8	On that day, you must tell your son the reason for this. Say to him: “I do this because of what the 
EXO.13.9	This special time will be like a sign on your hand. It will be like something that you fix between your eyes. It will cause you to remember. Then you will not forget to speak always about the 
EXO.13.10	At the same time, every year, you must obey what I have said.
EXO.13.11	The 
EXO.13.12	You must give to the 
EXO.13.13	When a 
EXO.13.14	One day, your son may ask you a question: “What does this mean?” Then you must say to him: “The 
EXO.13.15	Pharaoh completely refused to let us go. But the 
EXO.13.16	So, it will be like a sign on your hand and something between your eyes. It will cause you to remember. You will remember that the 
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them through the country of the 
EXO.13.18	So God led the people round by the 
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. Joseph had caused the 
EXO.13.20	The 
EXO.13.21	During the day, the 
EXO.13.22	The cloud did not leave the people during the day. Nor did the fire in the cloud leave them during the night. It was always in front of them.
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	He said: ‘Tell the 
EXO.14.3	Then Pharaoh will think: “The 
EXO.14.4	And I will cause Pharaoh to think cruel thoughts. He will go after the 
EXO.14.5	Someone told the king of Egypt that the 
EXO.14.6	So Pharaoh prepared his 
EXO.14.7	He took 600 of his best 
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	The 
EXO.14.10	Pharaoh was coming nearer. The 
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses: ‘There are many places in Egypt to bury dead people! You did not have to bring us here! Have you brought us here to die in the 
EXO.14.12	We said to you in Egypt: “Leave us alone. Let us work for the 
EXO.14.13	Then Moses spoke to the people. He said: ‘Do not be afraid. Stand quietly. See how the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	Then the 
EXO.14.16	Lift up your stick. Lift up your hand over the sea. Then the water will become two separate parts. Then the 
EXO.14.17	I will make the 
EXO.14.18	Then the 
EXO.14.19	The 
EXO.14.20	It stood between the 
EXO.14.21	Then Moses lifted up his hand over the sea. During that whole night, the 
EXO.14.22	Then the 
EXO.14.23	The 
EXO.14.24	In the early morning, the 
EXO.14.25	Their 
EXO.14.26	Then the 
EXO.14.27	So Moses lifted up his hand over the sea. And at dawn, the sea returned to its own place. The 
EXO.14.28	The water returned. It covered the 
EXO.14.29	But the 
EXO.14.30	On that day, the 
EXO.14.31	Then the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the 
EXO.15.1	I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	He threw horses and the men who ride them into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	He is my God and I will 
EXO.15.2	He is my father's God and I will 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	He threw Pharaoh's 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh's best officers drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep waters have covered them.
EXO.15.5	They fell to the floor of the sea, like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.7	With your powerful authority, you killed your enemies.
EXO.15.7	You were very angry with them. You killed them, like a fire burns dry grass.
EXO.15.8	You blew on the water and it became like a wall.
EXO.15.8	The deep waters stood up and they did not move.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said: ‘I will go after them. I will catch them.
EXO.15.9	I will take good things from these 
EXO.15.9	I will be very happy to do this! I will pull out my sharp knife and I will kill them.’
EXO.15.10	But you blew on the waters and the sea covered your enemies.
EXO.15.10	They went down like heavy metal in the great waters.
EXO.15.11	Oh 
EXO.15.11	You are so great and so 
EXO.15.11	You do great and powerful things.
EXO.15.12	You lifted up your right hand. You caused a hole to open in the ground. Your enemies fell into it.
EXO.15.13	Because your love never changes, you have led your people.
EXO.15.13	They are the ones that you have saved.
EXO.15.13	With your strong hand, you will be their guide to your 
EXO.15.14	The people in other countries will hear and they will be very afraid.
EXO.15.14	You will frighten the people in Philistia with a great pain.
EXO.15.15	The rulers of Edom will feel weak and very afraid.
EXO.15.15	The leaders of Moab cannot stand. They are so much afraid.
EXO.15.15	All the people in Canaan will run away.
EXO.15.16	They are very afraid of your powerful authority.
EXO.15.16	They cannot move. They have become like stones that do not move.
EXO.15.16	And they will remain like that, until your people pass by them, 
EXO.15.16	They will not move, until your own people have passed by them.
EXO.15.17	You will bring in your people. You will bring them to live on your own mountain.
EXO.15.17	It is the 
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	Pharaoh's horses and his 
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam, Aaron's sister, who was a female 
EXO.15.21	This is the song that she sang:
EXO.15.21	‘Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	He is great and powerful.
EXO.15.21	He threw into the sea
EXO.15.21	the horse and the man who rides it!’
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led the 
EXO.15.23	Then, when they came to Marah, they could not drink the water there. They tasted the water, but it was bad. That is why they called that place ‘Marah’. Marah means ‘it tastes bad’. 
EXO.15.24	Then the people were not happy and they spoke against Moses. They said: ‘What can we drink?’
EXO.15.25	Then Moses prayed to the 
EXO.15.25	In that place, the 
EXO.15.26	He said: ‘Be careful to listen to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim. There they found 12 wells of water and 70 
EXO.16.1	Then all the 
EXO.16.2	When they were in the 
EXO.16.3	The 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	And on the sixth day, they must pick up and prepare twice as much bread.’
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron spoke to the 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning, you will see how great and powerful the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses also said: ‘The 
EXO.16.9	Then Moses spoke to Aaron: ‘Say to all the 
EXO.16.10	While Aaron spoke, the 
EXO.16.11	Then the 
EXO.16.12	He said: ‘I have heard the bad things that the 
EXO.16.13	That same evening, 
EXO.16.13	And in the morning, there was something like rain on all the ground where the 
EXO.16.14	When the ground was dry again, small white pieces of material remained on the ground in the 
EXO.16.15	When the 
EXO.16.16	This is what the 
EXO.16.17	So the 
EXO.16.18	But when they measured the amount, everyone had the right amount of food. The person who had picked up a lot did not have too much. And the person who had picked up only a little food still had enough food. Each person had picked up what he needed.
EXO.16.19	Then Moses said to them: ‘Do not keep any of it until the morning.’
EXO.16.20	But some of them did not listen to Moses. They kept part of the food until the morning. But very small snakes appeared in it. And it began to have a bad smell. Then Moses was angry with those people.
EXO.16.21	Each morning, everyone picked up as much food as he needed. But when the heat of the sun became strong, the food became soft. Then it went away. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day, the 
EXO.16.23	Moses said to them: ‘This is what the 
EXO.16.24	So they kept the food until the morning, as Moses had said. The food did not have a bad smell and there were no small snakes in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said: ‘Eat it today, because this day is a 
EXO.16.26	On six days of the week, you must pick it up from the ground. But on the 7th day of the week, there will be none of this food on the ground. That is because the 7th day is the 
EXO.16.27	But on the 7th day, some of the people went out to pick up food. And they did not find any. 
EXO.16.28	Then the 
EXO.16.29	Remember that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the 7th day.
EXO.16.31	Now the 
EXO.16.32	And Moses said: ‘This is what the 
EXO.16.33	So Moses spoke to Aaron. He said: ‘Put one 
EXO.16.34	And Aaron did what the 
EXO.16.35	The 
EXO.16.36	(10 
EXO.17.1	Then all the 
EXO.17.2	Because of this, the people quarrelled with Moses. They said: ‘Give us water to drink!’ And Moses said to them: ‘You should not quarrel with me! You should not try to make the 
EXO.17.3	But the people needed water very much and they said bad things against Moses. They said: ‘You should not have brought us out of Egypt! You will kill us and our children and our animals. We will die, because we have no water.’
EXO.17.4	Then Moses shouted aloud to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	I will stand there, in front of you, by the rock at Horeb. Hit the rock, and water will come out of it. Then the people can drink.’ So Moses did this, while the leaders of the 
EXO.17.7	And he called that place Massah and Meribah, because the 
EXO.17.8	At Rephidim, the 
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua: ‘Choose some of our men. Then go out and fight with the 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua fought against the 
EXO.17.11	When Moses lifted up his hand, the 
EXO.17.12	Moses hands became tired. So Aaron and Hur put a stone under Moses and he sat on the stone. Then Aaron and Hur held up Moses' hands. Aaron stood on one side of Moses and Hur stood on the other side. They held his hands up, until sunset. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua and his men beat the 
EXO.17.14	Then the 
EXO.17.15	Then Moses built a stone table and he called it ‘The 
EXO.17.16	Moses said: ‘I lifted up my hands to the 
EXO.18.1	Jethro, the 
EXO.18.2	Moses had sent Zipporah, who was his wife, back to her home. Then her father, Jethro, brought her 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons into his house. One son was called Gershom. Moses said about him, ‘I have become a stranger in a foreign country.’ 
EXO.18.4	The other son was called Eliezer. Moses said about him, ‘My father's God gave me help. He saved me from Pharaoh, when Pharaoh wanted to kill me.’ 
EXO.18.5	Then Jethro came to Moses in the 
EXO.18.6	Jethro had sent a message to Moses. He said: ‘I am Jethro, your wife's father. I am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.’
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his wife's father. Moses bent his head and he kissed Jethro. They spoke together and then they went into the 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his wife's father about all the things that the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro was very happy to listen to Moses. Moses repeated to him how the 
EXO.18.10	Jethro said: ‘Let us thank the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, the father of Moses' wife, brought an animal, and other gifts, to God. And Aaron came, with all the leaders of the 
EXO.18.13	The next day, Moses sat down to 
EXO.18.14	Jethro saw all that Moses did for the people. Then he said: ‘What is this that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone and 
EXO.18.15	Moses answered Jethro: ‘The people come to me to discover God's 
EXO.18.16	When they cannot agree, they come to me. I decide between them and I tell them about God's 
EXO.18.17	The father of Moses' wife replied: ‘The thing that you do is not good. 
EXO.18.18	Both you and the people who come to you will become too tired. The work is too much for you. You cannot do it alone. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to me! I will give you some good ideas, and God will make you strong. You must be the person who speaks to God, for the 
EXO.18.20	Teach them the rules and 
EXO.18.21	But you must choose 
EXO.18.22	Let them work as 
EXO.18.23	If God 
EXO.18.24	Then Moses listened to Jethro. And Moses did everything that he suggested.
EXO.18.25	Moses chose good and 
EXO.18.26	They worked as 
EXO.18.27	Then Moses said goodbye to his wife's father and Jethro returned to his own country.
EXO.19.1	Three whole months after the 
EXO.19.2	After they left Rephidim, they arrived in the 
EXO.19.3	Then Moses went up the mountain to God. The 
EXO.19.4	“You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt. You know how I carried you. I carried you like a large bird carries her young birds on her 
EXO.19.5	Now, obey me completely and love my promises. Then I will make you my special people that I love. I have chosen you only, from all the people in other countries. The whole world is mine, 
EXO.19.6	but you will all become my 
EXO.19.7	So Moses returned and he brought together all the leaders of the 
EXO.19.8	The people all replied together. They said: ‘We will do everything that the 
EXO.19.9	The 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	They must be ready on the third day. On that day, the 
EXO.19.12	Do not let the people come too near to the mountain. Say to them: “Be careful! Do not go up the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain must die. 
EXO.19.13	You must throw stones at him until he dies. Or you must shoot at him with 
EXO.19.14	Then Moses came down from the mountain. He 
EXO.19.15	Then Moses said to them: ‘Prepare yourselves for the third day. Do not have sex with anyone.’
EXO.19.16	On the morning of the third day, there was a great storm. The people heard loud noises and they saw bright lights. A dark cloud was there over the mountain and the people heard very loud music. They were so afraid that their bodies were 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses led the people out to meet with God. And they stood at the edge of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	Smoke covered 
EXO.19.19	and the sound of the music became louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	and the 
EXO.19.22	Even the 
EXO.19.23	Moses said to the 
EXO.19.24	The 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and he repeated these words to them.
EXO.20.1	Then God spoke all these words:
EXO.20.2	‘I am the 
EXO.20.3	You must not have any other gods except me.
EXO.20.4	You must not make any false god for yourself. Do not make a false god in the shape of anything in the sky. Do not make one in the shape of anything on the earth or in the water. 
EXO.20.5	You must not bend down your head to a false god, nor 
EXO.20.6	But I will love thousands of people who love me. These are the people who obey my 
EXO.20.7	You must not use the name of the 
EXO.20.8	Remember the 
EXO.20.9	You must do all your work for six days. 
EXO.20.10	But the seventh day is a 
EXO.20.11	In six days, the 
EXO.20.12	Always be very kind to your father and your mother. Then you will live for many years in the country that the 
EXO.20.13	You must not 
EXO.20.14	You must not have sex with another person's husband or wife.
EXO.20.15	You must not take another person's things for yourself.
EXO.20.16	You must not say false things about your 
EXO.20.17	You must not want to take your 
EXO.20.18	The people saw the very bright light and they heard the loud noises. They heard the loud music and they saw the smoke on the mountain. They were so afraid that they could not stop their bodies moving. They would not come near. 
EXO.20.19	They said to Moses: ‘Speak to us yourself. We will listen to you. But do not let God speak to us. If he does, we will die.’
EXO.20.20	Moses said to the people: ‘Do not be afraid. God has only come to 
EXO.20.21	So the people stayed away from the mountain. But Moses walked toward the thick, dark cloud, where God was.
EXO.20.22	Then the 
EXO.20.23	Do not make any gods to be equal to me. Do not make for yourselves gods out of 
EXO.20.24	Make a table out of earth for me. Burn your dead animals upon it and also your other gifts to me. I will cause people in many places to love my name. And in those places, I will come to you and I will make you happy. 
EXO.20.25	You can make a table of stone for me also. But do not build it with stones that you have cut. If you use tools on the stones, the table will not be clean for God.
EXO.20.26	Do not climb up to my table on anything, because someone may see parts of your body.”
EXO.21.1	These are the 
EXO.21.2	If you buy an 
EXO.21.3	If he came to you alone, he is free to leave alone. If he came with a wife, she can leave with him. 
EXO.21.4	But if his master gives him a wife, she is her master's slave. And if she has had children, they are also her master's slaves. Only the husband can leave the master.
EXO.21.5	But perhaps the slave may say: “I love my master, my wife and my children. I will not go away like a free man!” 
EXO.21.6	Then his master must take him in front of the 
EXO.21.7	Perhaps a man may sell his daughter as a slave. She is not free to leave her master, as the male slaves are, after six years. Her master has chosen her for himself. 
EXO.21.8	If he does not like her, he must let someone from her family buy her from him. He cannot sell her to a foreign person. He has not done what he promised to her. 
EXO.21.9	If the man chooses the girl to be his son's wife, she must become like his daughter.
EXO.21.10	If the man marries another woman, he must not forget the first woman. He must continue to give her food and clothes. He must be kind to her because she is still his wife. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not do these three things, she can leave him. She does not have to pay him any money.
EXO.21.12	Perhaps a person will hit another person and kill him. This is murder. The person who does it must die. 
EXO.21.13	But perhaps he did not want to do it, but God let it happen. Then the man must run away to a place that I will show him. 
EXO.21.14	But a man may decide to kill another man. Then you must take him away from my table and you must kill him.
EXO.21.15	You must kill anyone who attacks his father or his mother.
EXO.21.16	You must kill anyone who 
EXO.21.16	You must kill the bad man when you catch him.
EXO.21.17	You must kill anyone who 
EXO.21.18	Perhaps two men may quarrel. One man hits the other man with a stone or with his fist.
EXO.21.18	The second man does not die but he has to stay in bed. 
EXO.21.19	Then he gets up and walks about outside, with his stick. Then nobody will

EXO.21.22	When two men fight together, perhaps one man may hit a woman. That woman may be with child. Then she gives birth to her child before the right time. If the cruel man has not hurt the child, he must pay money to her husband. He must pay the amount of money that the husband asks. A 
EXO.21.23	But if the man has hurt the child, you must take a life for a life. 
EXO.21.24	You must take an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth. You must take a hand for a hand or a foot for a foot. 
EXO.21.25	You must take a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, a bruise for a bruise.’ 
EXO.21.26	‘If a man hits the eye of a male or female slave, he may destroy the eye. Then he must let the slave go away free because of his bad eye. 
EXO.21.27	Perhaps a man may knock out the tooth of a male or female slave. Then he must let the slave go away free, because of his lost tooth.
EXO.21.28	Perhaps a male cow may attack a person and kill him. Then you must throw stones at the male cow until it dies. You must not eat the meat from that male cow. But do not 
EXO.21.29	But perhaps that male cow has attacked people before. Perhaps someone has told his master about this, but the man has not listened. He has not kept the male cow in a safe place and the animal has killed a person. Then you must throw stones at the animal but you must also kill his master. 
EXO.21.30	But if the dead person's family demands money, the man can give money instead of his life. 
EXO.21.31	This 
EXO.21.32	If it attacks a male or female slave, the animal's master must pay 30 
EXO.21.33	If a man finds a hole, he must cover it. If he digs a hole, he must cover it. If he does not do this, a cow or a 
EXO.21.34	Then the man who dug the hole must pay for the loss of the animal. He must pay money to the animal's master but he can keep the dead animal for himself.
EXO.21.35	If one man's male cow attacks another man's male cow, it may die. Then they must sell the animal that is alive. Each man can have half of the money and half of the dead animal. 
EXO.21.36	But perhaps that male cow has attacked another animal before. Someone has told the animal's master about this, but he has not listened. He has not kept the animal in a safe place. So he must pay the other man for the loss of his animal. But he can keep the dead animal for himself.
EXO.22.1	Perhaps a bad man may take a cow or a sheep. He may kill it or he may sell it. Then he must pay the animal's master. He must pay five cows for the one cow that he took. And he must pay four sheep for the one sheep that he took.
EXO.22.2	Perhaps someone may catch a bad man, just as he goes into another man's house. He hits the bad man and the bad man dies. This thing is not murder, if it happens at night. But if it happens during the day, it is murder.
EXO.22.3	A man who takes another man's animal must certainly give it back. If he cannot do this, then someone must buy him as a slave. And he must give the money to the man whose animal he took.
EXO.22.4	Perhaps someone will find the animal alive, in the man's field. Then the man must give back two animals. He must do this, whether it was a cow, or a 
EXO.22.5	A man's animals may eat grass in his field or in his garden of 
EXO.22.6	Someone may light a fire in a field and it begins to burn the bushes. Then the fire becomes bigger and hotter. It burns some of the food that is growing in the field. It may even burn the whole field. Then the person who lit the fire must pay money to the farmer. He has destroyed the farmer's food.
EXO.22.7	Perhaps a man may give some

EXO.22.12	But if a bad man did take the animal, then the

EXO.22.14	Perhaps a man may lend an animal to his 
EXO.22.15	But if the man is with his animal, then the 
EXO.22.16	Perhaps a man may have sex with a young girl. She has not yet promised to marry anyone. Then that man must marry her. He must pay the bride-price to her father. 
EXO.22.17	Her father may completely refuse to give her to the man. But the man must still pay the bride-price for a girl who is not married.’ 
EXO.22.18	‘You must kill any woman who is a

EXO.22.23	If you are not fair to them, they will shout aloud to me. I will certainly hear their voices 
EXO.22.24	and I will be angry with you. I will kill you in a war. You will leave your wives and children without husbands and fathers.
EXO.22.25	You may lend money to one of my people who needs help. But do not be like the people in other countries. They cause poor people to pay extra money for the help.

EXO.22.30	Do the same thing with your cows and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for 7 days. But on the eighth day, you must give them to me.
EXO.22.31	You will be my special people. So do not eat any meat that wild animals have killed. Instead, you must throw it to the dogs. They can eat it.
EXO.23.1	Do not make false reports. Do not say false words to give help to a bad man.
EXO.23.2	Do not follow other people, to do wrong things. When you speak in front of a

EXO.31.18	The 
EXO.32.1	Moses was on the mountain for a very long time. So the 
EXO.32.2	Then Aaron answered them: ‘Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters. Then bring the rings to me.’ 
EXO.32.3	So all the 
EXO.32.4	Aaron took the rings and he made a false god from the gold. He used a tool to make the false god in the shape of a young cow. Then the 
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw this, he built an 
EXO.32.6	So, on the next day, the 
EXO.32.7	Then the 
EXO.32.8	They have turned away from my

EXO.32.14	Then the 
EXO.32.15	Moses turned and he went down the mountain. He carried the two flat stones of the 
EXO.32.16	This was God's own work. He himself had written the words on the stones.
EXO.32.17	The 
EXO.32.18	But Moses answered: ‘It is not the sound of soldiers who are beating their enemies. It is not the sound of soldiers who run away from their enemies. It is the sound of singers that I can hear.’
EXO.32.19	Then Moses came near to the 
EXO.32.20	Then he took the young cow that they had made. He burned it in the fire. He made it into powder and he poured it into the water. Then he 
EXO.32.21	Moses said to Aaron: ‘You should not have caused these people to do such a bad 
EXO.32.22	Aaron answered: ‘Do not be angry, my 
EXO.32.23	They said to me: “Make us some gods that will lead us. This man called Moses brought us out of Egypt. But now we do not know what has happened to him.” 
EXO.32.24	So I said to them: “If anyone has any gold rings, he must remove them.” Then they gave the gold to me. I threw it into the fire and this young cow came out of the fire!’
EXO.32.25	All the 
EXO.32.26	So Moses stood at the edge of the 
EXO.32.27	Then Moses said to the 
EXO.32.28	The 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said to the 
EXO.32.30	On the next day, Moses said to the 
EXO.32.31	So Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	But now, please

EXO.33.9	When Moses went into the 
EXO.33.10	Every time that the people saw the special cloud at the door of the 
EXO.33.11	The 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	If you love me, please tell me your thoughts. I want to understand you. I want you to love me always. Remember that the 
EXO.33.14	The 
EXO.33.15	Then Moses said: ‘If you do not go with us, do not send us away from here. 
EXO.33.16	If you do not go with us, nobody will know about you. Nobody will know that we give you pleasure. We will not be special people. We will be like everyone else in the world.’
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said: ‘Please, show me your 
EXO.33.19	And the 
EXO.33.20	But you cannot see my face. Nobody can see my face and live.’
EXO.33.21	Then the 
EXO.33.22	When my

EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	‘Make yourself ready in the morning and come up 
EXO.34.3	Nobody must come with you. Nobody must be anywhere on the mountain. Even the animals must not eat grass in front of the mountain.’
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two flat stones like the first ones. He went up 
EXO.34.5	Then the 
EXO.34.6	Then the 
EXO.34.7	He loves thousands of people. He 
EXO.34.8	Then Moses bent down his head immediately and he 
EXO.34.9	He said: ‘

EXO.34.32	After this, all the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses had spoken to them, he covered his face with a thin cloth. 
EXO.34.34	But when he spoke with the

NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to explore the country called Canaan. And he said to them, ‘Go north from here. Go through the south of Canaan. Then continue to go north, into the part of the country where there are hills. 
NUM.13.18	And have a look at the country. See whether the people there are strong or weak. And see whether few people or many people live there. 
NUM.13.19	See whether their land is good or bad. And see whether their towns have no walls or strong walls. 
NUM.13.20	And see whether good food or not much food grows on their land. See whether there are trees in their country or not. Then try to get some fruit from the country.’ (It was the time for the first

NUM.13.26	They came to Moses and Aaron and to all the 
NUM.13.27	They said to Moses, ‘We went into the country that you sent us to. And there certainly is a lot of milk and 
NUM.13.28	But the people who live in the country are strong. Their towns are very big and strong walls keep them safe. Also, we saw the

NUM.14.1	Then all the people started to cry very loudly. And the people cried all night. 
NUM.14.2	And all the 
NUM.14.3	We do not know why the 
NUM.14.4	So they said to each other, ‘We should choose a new leader and we should return to Egypt.’
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron threw themselves on the ground in front of all the 
NUM.14.6	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh were among those who had explored the country. And they tore their clothes.

NUM.16.2	So they stood up in front of Moses, together with 250 leaders of the 
NUM.16.3	They all came to Moses and Aaron and they said, ‘All the 
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard that, he threw himself on to the ground. He prayed. 
NUM.16.5	Moses said to Korah and to all the other men, ‘Tomorrow the 
NUM.16.6	Do this: Get some pots for yourselves, Korah and all your friends. 
NUM.16.7	And put fire and 
NUM.16.8	Then Moses said to Korah, ‘Listen, you 
NUM.16.9	The God of Israel has made you separate from all the other 
NUM.16.10	He has brought you near to himself, Korah, and all the other

NUM.16.13	You have brought us up out of a country where there is a lot of milk and 
NUM.16.14	You have certainly not brought us into a country where there is a lot of milk and 
NUM.16.15	Moses was angry. He said to the 
NUM.16.16	Moses said to Korah, ‘Tomorrow, you and your men must come to the 
NUM.16.17	Each of you must take a pot and you must put

NUM.16.20	The 
NUM.16.21	‘Stand away from these men so that I can kill them.’
NUM.16.22	But Moses and Aaron threw themselves on the ground. Their faces were touching the ground. And they said, ‘You, our God, are the God of the

NUM.16.32	The ground opened. The men, their families and everything that was theirs fell down into the hole. The earth covered Korah and all his men and everything that was theirs, too. 
NUM.16.33	They went alive into

NUM.16.35	Also fire came out from the 
NUM.16.36	The 
NUM.16.37	‘Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the

NUM.16.48	He stood between the people who were living and the dead people. The bad things and illnesses stopped.

NUM.20.3	They said to Moses, ‘When the 
NUM.20.4	We are the 
NUM.20.5	You should not have brought us from Egypt to this very bad place. It is not a place where we can get

NUM.20.11	Moses lifted up his arm. He hit the rock twice with his stick. Water poured from the rock. The people and the animals drank the water. 
NUM.20.12	The 
NUM.20.13	That place was called ‘The Waters of Meribah’, because the 
NUM.20.14	From Kadesh, Moses sent men to the king of Edom with this message: ‘We are

NUM.20.17	Please let us travel through your land. We will not go through any fields or through any

NUM.20.19	The 
NUM.20.20	The king of Edom said, ‘No you must not travel through our country.’ Then the people in Edom came out to attack the

NUM.20.22	All the

NUM.21.4	The 
NUM.21.5	They said to God and to Moses, ‘You should not have brought us from Egypt to die in the

NUM.21.9	Moses made a snake out of 
NUM.21.10	The 
NUM.21.11	And they travelled from Oboth, and they

NUM.21.13	Then they 
NUM.21.14	So someone wrote in the Book of the 
NUM.21.15	He wrote, ‘The sides of the valleys lead the way to the town called Ar on the edge of Moab.’ 
NUM.21.16	And from there they continued to travel until they arrived at Beer. That is the well where the 
NUM.21.17	The 
NUM.21.17	‘Sing to this well.
NUM.21.17	Ask it to give water to us.
NUM.21.18	This was the well that our rulers dug.

NUM.21.18	After that the 
NUM.21.19	They went from Mattanah to Nahaliel. They went from Nahaliel to Bamoth. 
NUM.21.20	They went from Bamoth to the valley of Moab. They 
NUM.21.21	The 
NUM.21.22	‘Please let us go through your country. We will travel on the road. We will not touch your food or drink your water. We will pass through your country.’ 
NUM.21.23	Sihon would not let the 
NUM.21.24	The 
NUM.21.25	They got power over all the cities of the 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the 
NUM.21.27	So the people who say clever things say, ‘Come to Heshbon and build it up again. Build the city of Sihon again. 
NUM.21.28	An army that was like a fire went out from Heshbon. It was like a 
NUM.21.29	It is sad for you, people of Moab. Sihon has killed the people of Chemosh. Your god has let the king of the

NUM.21.31	So, the 
NUM.21.32	Moses sent men to find the best way to attack Jazer. The 
NUM.21.33	Next, they travelled towards Bashan. Og, the king of Bashan marched out to meet them. He wanted to attack them. They met at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	So they killed him and his sons and all his people. So all those people were dead and their land became the 
NUM.22.1	The 
NUM.22.2	Balak was the son of Zippor. He saw what the 
NUM.22.3	So the people in Moab were afraid because there were very many 
NUM.22.4	So the 
NUM.22.5	He sent men to get Balaam who was the son of Beor. Balaam was near the river at Pethor. Pethor was his home. Balak told them that they should say to Balaam, ‘Many people have come from Egypt. And they cover the ground, everywhere. They want to take our land. 
NUM.22.6	They are more powerful than I am. Put a 
NUM.22.7	The leaders of Moab and Midian went to find Balaam. They took the money for the 
NUM.22.8	Balaam said to them, ‘Stay here tonight. I will talk to the 
NUM.22.9	Then God came to Balaam and he said, ‘Who are these men who are with you?’
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said to God, ‘Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent a message to me. 
NUM.22.11	He said, “Many people have come from Egypt. And they cover the ground, everywhere. So come and 
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, ‘Do not 
NUM.22.13	The next day, Balaam said to the men from Moab, ‘Go back to Moab. The 
NUM.22.14	The men went back to Moab. They told Balak that Balaam would not come with them.
NUM.22.15	Then Balak sent more leaders to Balaam. These leaders were even more important than the first group of leaders. 
NUM.22.16	They said to him, ‘Balak says, “Do not let anything stop you coming to me. 
NUM.22.17	I will certainly make you rich and famous. And I will do for you anything that you want. So please come and 
NUM.22.18	Balaam said to them, ‘No, not even if Balak gives me his house, all his gold and all his 
NUM.22.19	Balaam said, ‘Stay here tonight as the other men did. I will talk to the 
NUM.22.20	That night, God spoke to Balaam. God said to him, ‘Go with these men. But only do what I say.’
NUM.22.21	In the morning, Balaam put a blanket on his 
NUM.22.22	The 
NUM.22.23	The 
NUM.22.24	Then the 
NUM.22.25	When the 
NUM.22.26	The 
NUM.22.27	When the 
NUM.22.28	The

NUM.22.30	The 
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	The 
NUM.22.33	If the 
NUM.22.34	Then Balaam said to the 
NUM.22.35	But the 
NUM.22.36	People told Balak that Balaam was coming. Balak went out to meet him at the town in Moab on the river Arnon that is on the border. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, ‘I will not give anything to you because you did not come to me quickly.’
NUM.22.38	So Balaam said to Balak, ‘I have come to you now! But I cannot choose to say the things that I want to say. I can only say the words that God puts into my mouth.’
NUM.22.39	Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	And Balak 
NUM.22.41	The next day Balak and Balaam went to Bamoth-Baal. Balaam saw some of the 
NUM.23.1	Balaam said, ‘Build 7 
NUM.23.2	Balak did this. Balaam and Balak gave a gift of a

NUM.23.5	God told Balaam what he should say to Balak.

NUM.23.12	But Balaam answered, ‘I have to be careful. I have to speak only the words that the 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, ‘Please come with me to another place where you can see only a small part of the 
NUM.23.14	They went to the field of Zophim on the top of the mountain called Pisgah. He built 7 
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, ‘Stay here with your gift while I talk with the 
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	So Balaam went back to Balak. Balak and the men were standing by his gift. Balak said, ‘What did the 
NUM.23.18	Balaam spoke his message, ‘Balak, son of Zippor listen to me.

NUM.23.29	Balaam said, ‘Build 7 
NUM.23.30	Balak did as Balaam asked him to. He offered a

NUM.24.2	Balaam looked up. And he saw Israel's people. They were 
NUM.24.3	And so he said, ‘This is the message of Balaam the son of Beor. It is the words of a man. This man understands what God says. 
NUM.24.4	This man can hear God. This man sees a picture as in a dream from the greatest God.

NUM.24.9	The 
NUM.24.10	Balak was angry with Balaam. He raised his fist to Balaam. He said, ‘I asked you to come here and to 
NUM.24.11	Go home. I said that I would give you money. The 
NUM.24.12	Balaam said to Balak, ‘I said this to the men that you sent to get me. 
NUM.24.13	“I can only say the 
NUM.24.14	And so now I will return to my people. But first I will tell you what these people will do to your people in future days.’
NUM.24.15	Balaam spoke and he said, ‘This is the message of Balaam the son of Beor. It is the words of a man. This man understands what God says. 
NUM.24.16	This is the 
NUM.24.17	I see that at a future time a king will come from the 
NUM.24.18	He will attack his enemies in Edom and Seir. The

NUM.24.21	Then he saw the 
NUM.24.22	But Assyria's people will take you away as

NUM.24.24	Ships will come from the north. They will bring people from Cyprus who will destroy Assyria and Eber. Then God will destroy them.’ 
NUM.24.25	Balaam returned to his home. And Balak went away too.

DEU.1.23	I thought that this was a good idea. I chose 12 men, one from each of your 
DEU.1.24	They left and went up into the hills. They came to the valley of Eshcol and they explored it. 
DEU.1.25	They took some of the fruit that they found. They brought it back to us. And they reported, ‘The 
DEU.1.26	But you did not want to go into the country. You refused to obey the 
DEU.1.27	You spoke bad words in your 
DEU.1.28	We do not know where to go. Our friends have made us afraid. They say, “These people are taller and stronger than we are. The cities are large. They have walls that reach up to the sky. We even saw some 
DEU.1.29	Then I said to you, ‘Do not be so frightened. Do not be afraid of these people. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	And he was with you in the 
DEU.1.32	But you did not believe in the 
DEU.1.33	But he went in front of you, on your journey. He was there in a fire by night and in a cloud by day. He found places for you to put your 
DEU.1.34	When the 
DEU.1.35	‘None of you bad men will see the good country. I promised to give this country to your fathers. 
DEU.1.36	Only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh will see it. I will give to him and to his family the land that he walks on. This is because he obeyed the 
DEU.1.37	The 
DEU.1.38	‘But your servant Joshua, the son of Nun, will go into the country. You must make him strong by good words. He will lead Israel's people into the country. It will become their country. 
DEU.1.39	Your children, too, will go into the country. These children do not yet know the difference between good and bad. You said that they would become slaves. I say that they will go into the country. I will give it to them and it will become their country. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn round. Begin your journey towards the 
DEU.1.41	Then you answered, ‘We have done wrong things against the 
DEU.1.42	But the 
DEU.1.43	So I repeated the 
DEU.1.44	The 
DEU.1.45	You came back and you wept. But the 
DEU.1.46	And so you stayed in Kadesh for many days. You remained there for a long time.
DEU.2.1	Then we turned back. We began to walk towards the 
DEU.2.2	Then the 
DEU.2.3	‘You have walked round this hill for a long time. Now turn to the north. 
DEU.2.4	These are my words to the 
DEU.2.5	‘“Do not make them angry so that they fight against you. I will not give any of their country to you, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given the hills in Seir to Esau. 
DEU.2.6	You must pay money to his 
DEU.2.7	The 
DEU.2.8	So we went on. We passed the 
DEU.2.9	Then the 
DEU.2.10	Some people called the Emites once lived there. There were many of them and they were as strong and tall as the 
DEU.2.11	Many people called the Emites and the Anakites, ‘Rephaites’. But the people from Moab called them Emites. 
DEU.2.12	Before this time, the people called the Horites lived in Seir, but the 
DEU.2.13	And the 
DEU.2.14	38 years had passed since we left Kadesh-Barnea. All the fighting men of that 
DEU.2.15	The 
DEU.2.16	When the last one of these fighting men had died, the 
DEU.2.17	This is what he said: 
DEU.2.18	‘Today you will pass by the country called Moab at Ar. 
DEU.2.19	You will meet the people from Ammon. Do not make them angry so that they fight against you. I will not give you any of their country. I have given it to the 
DEU.2.20	(This country also belonged to the 
DEU.2.21	There were many Zamzummites and they were as tall and strong as the 
DEU.2.22	The 
DEU.2.23	Also, people from the island called Crete came. And they killed the 
DEU.2.24	And God said, ‘Now go! Cross the River Arnon. Look, I have given the country of Sihon the 
DEU.2.25	Today I will begin to make all the people in the world afraid of you. They will hear reports about you and they will be very frightened. You will cause them trouble.’
DEU.2.26	We were in the 
DEU.2.27	‘Please let us travel through your country. We will walk along your widest road. We will not turn to the right or to the left. 
DEU.2.28	Please sell us food to eat and water to drink. We will pay you with 
DEU.2.29	The 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon, king of Heshbon, refused to let us travel through his country. He was angry with us and he would not listen. The 
DEU.2.31	The 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon and all his army came out to fight against us at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	The 
DEU.2.34	At that time we took all his towns and destroyed them completely. We killed men, women and children. We left no one alive. 
DEU.2.35	But we kept the animals and the good things from every town for ourselves. 
DEU.2.36	The 
DEU.2.37	But you obeyed the word of the 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned and went up, along the road towards Bashan. Og, king of Bashan, marched out to fight against us. He brought his whole army with him to Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	But the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	At that time, we marched into all of his cities. He had 60 cities and we marched into all of them. This was all the land called Argob in Bashan, where King Og ruled. 
DEU.3.5	Every city had high walls and gates, which the people locked. There were also very many villages without walls. 
DEU.3.6	We destroyed them completely, as we had done to the cities of Sihon, king of Heshbon. We destroyed every city and killed all the men, women and children. 
DEU.3.7	But we kept all the animals and the good things from the cities for ourselves.
DEU.3.8	So, at that time, we marched into the countries of these two kings of the 
DEU.3.9	(The people from Sidon call 
DEU.3.10	We marched into all of the towns in the high, flat land and the whole of Gilead. We marched into all of Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei. These are towns in the country of Og, in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(Only Og, king of Bashan, from the 
DEU.3.12	When we marched into the country, I gave certain parts to the 
DEU.3.13	The other half of Gilead I gave to one half of the tribe of Manasseh. I also gave to them Bashan, the country that Og had ruled. (All the country of Argob in Bashan had been called the country of the 
DEU.3.14	A man called Jair, of the 
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gilead to Machir, from the 
DEU.3.16	But to the 
DEU.3.17	The edge of their land on the west was the River Jordan. This is from Arabah and Chinnereth to the Salt Sea, below 
DEU.3.18	At that time I said to you, ‘The 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, your children and your animals can stay in your towns. (I know that you have many animals.) 
DEU.3.20	You must travel with the other 
DEU.3.21	At that time, I 
DEU.3.22	Do not be afraid of them. The 
DEU.3.23	At that time, I asked the 
DEU.3.24	‘
DEU.3.25	Please let me go over the River Jordan! Please let me see the good country, the hills, the mountains and Lebanon!’
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of 
DEU.3.28	Now you must tell Joshua what to do. Give him help. Teach him to be brave. He will lead Israel's people over the river. He will be the leader in the fight against their enemies. Together they will march into the country that you are going to look at.’
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley near Beth-Peor.
DEU.4.1	Listen, Israel's people, to the rules and 
DEU.4.2	Do not put anything new into these rules and do not remove anything from them. But obey the rules of the 
DEU.4.3	You saw with your own eyes what the 
DEU.4.4	But every one of you who obeyed the rules of the 
DEU.4.5	Look! I have taught you the 
DEU.4.6	Obey them carefully. They will show people in other countries that you understand right and good ways. These people will hear about all your rules. Then they will say, ‘These great people really do understand right and good ways.’
DEU.4.7	But the 
DEU.4.8	And people from other countries do not have the good rules that you have in this 
DEU.4.9	But be careful. Always think about what you do. Do not forget the things that your eyes have seen. Remember these things for as long as you live. Tell your children and your grandchildren about the things that God has done. 
DEU.4.10	Remember when you stood in front of the 
DEU.4.11	You came and stood at the edge of the mountain. You saw that it was on fire. The sky was full of black clouds and there was no light. 
DEU.4.12	Then from the fire, the 
DEU.4.13	He explained to you his 10 special rules and he wrote them on two flat pieces of stone. He 
DEU.4.14	At that time, the 
DEU.4.15	You did not see any shape at all when the 
DEU.4.16	Do not change to do very bad things. Do not make a false god for yourselves, because that is wrong. Do not copy the shape of a man or a woman, 
DEU.4.17	or the shape of any animal or bird.
DEU.4.18	Do not copy the shape of anything that moves along the ground. Do not copy the shape of any fish that swims in the water. 
DEU.4.19	When you look up at the sky, you see the sun, the moon and the stars. They are all shining in the sky. But do not 
DEU.4.20	But you are different. The 
DEU.4.21	The 
DEU.4.22	I will die in this country. I will not cross the River Jordan. But you will soon cross over and God will give to you that good country. 
DEU.4.23	Be careful! Do not forget the 
DEU.4.24	That is because the love of the 
DEU.4.25	Even when you have lived in the country for many years, be careful. Do not start to do wrong things. When you have children and grandchildren, do not make a false god in any shape. This would make the 
DEU.4.26	I want everyone on earth and in 
DEU.4.27	He will send you away to live in other countries. Only a few of you will stay alive in the countries where the 
DEU.4.28	There you will obey gods that men have made out of wood and stone. These gods cannot see or hear. They cannot use their mouths or their noses. 
DEU.4.29	But even then, if you look for the 
DEU.4.30	When trouble happens to you in future days, you will return to him. When all these bad things have happened to you, you will obey him again.
DEU.4.31	This is because the 
DEU.4.32	Ask me now about the things that happened many years ago. Ask about the days before you were alive. Ask how God made men and women on the earth. Ask people from every country in the world. Nothing as great as this has ever happened. People have never heard of anything like this. 
DEU.4.33	Only you, the 
DEU.4.34	No other god has tried to take one special 
DEU.4.35	The 
DEU.4.36	God let you hear his voice. He spoke to you so that he could teach you. Here on earth he let you see his great fire. He spoke to you from that fire. 
DEU.4.37	He brought you out of Egypt because he loved your 
DEU.4.38	He sent away the people of other countries who are greater and stronger than you. He sent them away in front of you. He did this to give you their country. This country now belongs to you.
DEU.4.39	Remember today and never forget that the 
DEU.4.40	Obey his 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses chose three special cities to the east of the River Jordan. 
DEU.4.42	These were safe places for any person who killed another person. But only if he did not want to kill him. If the killer was not the enemy of the man, the killer could run into one of the cities. There he would be safe from death. 
DEU.4.43	Moses chose Bezer, in the flat 
DEU.4.44	This is the 
DEU.4.45	These are the rules, the 
DEU.4.46	At that time they were in the valley, near to Beth-Peor. That is east of the River Jordan. This was the country of Sihon, king of the 
DEU.4.47	They marched into his country, which then became their own country. They also marched into the country of Og, king of Bashan. These two kings of the 
DEU.4.48	This country was from Aroer, on the edge of the River Arnon, to 
DEU.4.49	This country included all the land east of the River Jordan. To the south, it was to the Dead Sea and to 
DEU.5.1	Moses called all the 
DEU.5.1	Listen, Israelites, to the rules that I explain to you today. You can hear what I am saying. Learn the rules and obey them. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	He did not make this promise to our fathers. He made it to us, to all of us who are alive here today. 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(At that time, I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	‘I am the 
DEU.5.7	You will have no other gods except Me.
DEU.5.8	You will not make a false god for yourself. Do not make the shape of anything that is in the sky above nor on the earth beneath. Do not make the shape of anything that lives in the water. 
DEU.5.9	You must not bend down to them or obey them. I, the 
DEU.5.10	But I show my love to thousands (1000s) of families who love me. These families will obey me.
DEU.5.11	You must not use the name of the 
DEU.5.12	Always make the 
DEU.5.13	Work hard for 6 days and do all the necessary work. 
DEU.5.14	But the 7th day is a day for rest which the 
DEU.5.15	You must remember that you were slaves in Egypt. But I, the 
DEU.5.16	Always be very kind to your father and mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	You must not kill anyone because you are angry with him. That is murder.
DEU.5.18	You must not have sex with the wife or husband of another person.
DEU.5.19	You must not take another person's things.
DEU.5.20	You must not say things that are not true about anyone.
DEU.5.21	You must not want another man's wife. You must not want the house or the field of another person. You must not want his slaves or his animals or anything that is his.’
DEU.5.22	These are the rules that the 
DEU.5.23	There was no light when you heard the voice of God. The mountain burned with fire. Then your leaders and your older men came to me.
DEU.5.24	And they said, ‘The 
DEU.5.25	But now, we do not want to die. This great fire will kill us. We will die if we continue to hear the voice of our God. 
DEU.5.26	No other person has ever heard the voice of God and lived. We heard him speak out of the fire. And we are still alive! 
DEU.5.27	Please go near to the 
DEU.5.28	The 
DEU.5.29	I really want them to obey me and to love my rules always! If they do that, everything will always be well for them and for their children. 
DEU.5.30	Now tell them to return to their 
DEU.5.31	But I want you to stay here with me. I will give you all the rules and 
DEU.5.32	So you must be careful to obey the 
DEU.5.33	You must live as the 
DEU.6.1	These are all the rules. The 
DEU.6.2	You and your children and your grandchildren must be afraid to make the 
DEU.6.3	Listen, 
DEU.6.4	Listen, 
DEU.6.5	Love the 
DEU.6.6	Remember with love all these rules that I give to you today. 
DEU.6.7	Teach them and explain them every day to your children. Talk about them when you sit at home. Talk about them when you walk along the road. Repeat them when you lie down. Repeat them when you get up. 
DEU.6.8	Tie them like signs on your hands and round your heads. 
DEU.6.9	Write them over the doors of your houses and on your gates. 
DEU.6.10	The 
DEU.6.11	There are houses there full of good things that you did not put into them. There are wells of water that you did not dig. There are fields of 
DEU.6.12	But be careful that you do not forget the 
DEU.6.13	You must be afraid to make the 
DEU.6.14	Do not obey the other gods of the people who live round you. 
DEU.6.15	The 
DEU.6.16	Do not make the 
DEU.6.17	Be careful! Obey the rules of the 
DEU.6.18	Do what is right and good. And give pleasure to the 
DEU.6.19	He will help you to beat all your enemies, as he has said.
DEU.6.20	Some day your son may say to you, ‘The 
DEU.6.21	Then you must tell him this: ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt. But the 
DEU.6.22	We watched him do great and powerful things to Egypt. And he did them to Pharaoh and to the people who lived in his house. 
DEU.6.23	But the 
DEU.6.24	The 
DEU.6.25	We must be careful to obey all the rules of the 
DEU.7.1	The 
DEU.7.2	When the 
DEU.7.3	You must not marry any of these people. Do not let your daughters marry their sons. Do not take their daughters to marry your sons. 
DEU.7.4	This is because they will turn your sons away from God's rules. Then your sons will begin to obey other gods. The 
DEU.7.5	This is what you must do to the people of these countries. Break the stone tables where they offer animals to their gods. Cut down the very tall sticks there that they have used to 
DEU.7.6	Do this because you are special people. You belong to the 
DEU.7.7	The 
DEU.7.8	But it was because the 
DEU.7.9	Remember that the 
DEU.7.9	If they obey him, he will love them and all their children for thousands (1000s) of years. 
DEU.7.10	But,
DEU.7.10	he will kill those who hate him;
DEU.7.10	he will not be slow to 
DEU.7.11	So be careful! Obey all the rules that I am teaching you today.
DEU.7.12	Listen to these rules and obey them. If you do that, the 
DEU.7.13	He will love you and he will stay with you always. He will give you many children and he will be with your babies. He will make good food grow in your fields. He will give you plenty of food and drink. He will be with all your animals and give you many cows and sheep. He will do this in the country that he is giving to you. He made this promise to your 
DEU.7.14	God will make you greater than anyone else on the earth. You will all have children and none of your animals will be without young animals. 
DEU.7.15	The 
DEU.7.16	You must kill the people in every 
DEU.7.17	Perhaps you will say to each other, ‘The people in these 
DEU.7.18	But do not be afraid of them. You must remember what the 
DEU.7.19	You saw it all with your own eyes. You saw the great troubles, the strange and powerful things that happened there. And you saw the 
DEU.7.20	Also, the 
DEU.7.21	Do not let anyone frighten you. The 
DEU.7.22	The 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	He will give their kings to you and no one will remember them any more. No one will be able to beat you. You will kill them all. 
DEU.7.25	You must burn their false gods in a fire. You must not want to keep the 
DEU.7.26	Do not bring anything that God hates into your house. If you do, he will put a mark on you, to destroy both you and the bad thing. God has said that he will destroy it. So you must hate it also.
DEU.8.1	Be careful! Obey every rule that I am giving to you today. If you do that, you will live. And you will have many children. You will be able to go into the country. It will become your country. This is the country that the 
DEU.8.2	Remember how the 
DEU.8.3	He caused you to be hungry and then he fed you with special food called 
DEU.8.4	Your clothes did not become too old to wear. Your feet did not become too painful to walk on during all those 40 years. 
DEU.8.5	So you can certainly know that the 
DEU.8.6	Obey the rules of the 
DEU.8.7	Do this because the 
DEU.8.8	It is a country full of good food that grows in the fields. A lot of fruit is hanging on the trees. 
DEU.8.9	It is a country where there is enough bread for everyone. You will have everything that you need. It is a country where the stones are full of iron. You can dig other metals out of the hills.
DEU.8.10	You can eat all the food that you want. Then remember to thank the 
DEU.8.11	Be careful that you do not forget the 
DEU.8.12	In a future time, you will have all the food that you can eat. You will build beautiful houses to live in. 
DEU.8.13	You will have many cows and sheep and a lot of gold and 
DEU.8.14	Then be careful! You may begin to think too well about yourselves. Then you will forget the 
DEU.8.15	He led you through the large and frightening 
DEU.8.16	He gave 
DEU.8.17	Perhaps you will say to yourself, ‘I have got all these good things by myself because I am strong!’
DEU.8.18	But you must always remember the 
DEU.8.19	Do not ever forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the 
DEU.9.1	Moses said:
DEU.9.1	Listen, 
DEU.9.2	The people there are strong and tall. They are called Anakites! You know about them. You have heard people say, ‘No one can beat the Anakites.’
DEU.9.3	But you can be sure today that the 
DEU.9.4	After the 
DEU.9.4	No, it is because these people are doing wrong things. That is why the 
DEU.9.5	It is not because you are doing right things. It is not because you always obey God. This is not the reason that God will give their country to you. The 
DEU.9.6	You must understand this. The 
DEU.9.7	You must never forget how you made the 
DEU.9.8	When you were at 
DEU.9.9	I climbed the mountain to receive the two flat stones from the 
DEU.9.10	Then the 
DEU.9.11	After the 40 days and nights, the 
DEU.9.12	Then the 
DEU.9.13	And the 
DEU.9.14	Do not try to stop me. I will kill them and no one on the earth will remember them. Then I will make you into a 
DEU.9.15	So I turned and I went down the mountain. It was burning with fire and the two stones with the promise were in my hands. 
DEU.9.16	I looked at you. I saw that you had 
DEU.9.17	So I threw the two flat stones on the ground. They broke in pieces in front of you.
DEU.9.18	Then again I fell down on my face, in front of the 
DEU.9.19	I was afraid because the 
DEU.9.20	The 
DEU.9.21	Then I took that 
DEU.9.22	You also made the 
DEU.9.23	Then, when the 
DEU.9.23	But you refused to obey the words of the 
DEU.9.24	You have refused to obey the 
DEU.9.25	So I lay on my face in front of the 
DEU.9.26	So I prayed to the 
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Please 
DEU.9.28	For if you do not 
DEU.9.29	But they are your people and they belong to you. You are so strong and powerful that you brought them out.’
DEU.10.1	At that time, the 
DEU.10.2	I will write on these stones the words that I wrote on the first stones. You broke the first stones, but you must put the new stones into the box.’
DEU.10.3	So I made an 
DEU.10.4	The 
DEU.10.5	Then I came down from the mountain. I put the stones into the special box, the 
DEU.10.6	(The 
DEU.10.7	Then they travelled on to Gudgodah and Jotbathah, a country where there are many streams of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time, the 
DEU.10.9	That is why the 
DEU.10.10	I stayed on the mountain for 40 days and nights, as I did the first time. The 
DEU.10.11	And the 
DEU.10.12	And now, 
DEU.10.13	And you should obey his rules and 
DEU.10.14	The whole of the sky, far beyond what you can see, belongs to the 
DEU.10.15	But the 
DEU.10.16	So you must obey the 
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	He is very kind to women whose husbands have died. He is very kind to children who have no fathers. They need his help and he loves them. He loves people who are living in a foreign country. He gives them the things that they need. 
DEU.10.19	You too must love strangers, because once, you were strangers in Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Always be ready to obey the 
DEU.10.21	Tell God how great and important he is. He is your God. He did great and powerful things for you, which you saw with your own eyes. 
DEU.10.22	Only 70 of your 
DEU.11.1	Love the 
DEU.11.2	Remember this today! Your children have not seen all the great things that God has done. He can 
DEU.11.3	You saw the things that God did to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to all his people. They were not usual things, but powerful things. 
DEU.11.4	You saw it when God removed the whole army of Egypt, with all their horses. They were marching quickly to catch you. But God caused them to drown in the Red Sea. 
DEU.11.5	Your children did not see all the things that the 
DEU.11.6	Your children did not see what he did to Dathan and Abiram. These men were sons of Eliab, from the 
DEU.11.7	It was you, not your children. It was you who saw God do all these great things.
DEU.11.8	Now you must obey all the rules that I give to you today. If you do that, you will be strong and brave. You will cross the River Jordan and you will march into the country. Then it will become your country. 
DEU.11.9	You will live for a long time in this country. The 
DEU.11.10	This country is not like Egypt, where you lived before. There, when you planted seeds, you had to give them water to make them grow. 
DEU.11.11	But the country into which you will go has mountains and valleys. These receive rain that God gives. 
DEU.11.12	The 
DEU.11.13	So you must obey the rules that I am giving to you today. I tell you to love the 
DEU.11.14	If you do that, he will send rain on your country at the right time, in autumn and in spring. Then you can take home the food and the fruit that will grow in your fields.
DEU.11.15	God will make grass grow in your fields for your cows. And you will have all the food that you want. 
DEU.11.16	But be careful! Do not let anything cause you to forget the 
DEU.11.17	If you do that, the 
DEU.11.18	Keep my words always in your minds. Write them on pieces of cotton and then tie them on to your hands. Tie them round your heads also. Then they will be like signs for you and you will remember them. 
DEU.11.19	Teach my words to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house. Talk about them when you walk along the road. Talk about them when you go to your bed. Talk about them when you get up. 
DEU.11.20	Write them above the doors of your house and on your gates. 
DEU.11.21	If you do that, you and your 
DEU.11.22	Be careful! Every day, you must obey the rules that I am giving to you. These are the rules:
DEU.11.22	Love the 
DEU.11.22	Do everything that he 
DEU.11.22	Stay close to him.
DEU.11.23	If you do that, the 
DEU.11.24	Every place on which you walk will be yours. All the country from the 
DEU.11.25	God will not let anyone stop you. The 
DEU.11.26	Today I am telling you to choose. God can cause either good things or bad things to happen to you. 
DEU.11.27	Good things will happen if you obey these rules from the 
DEU.11.28	And bad things will happen if you do not obey these rules. Then you will go away from God. You will obey gods that you do not know. 
DEU.11.29	The 
DEU.11.30	You know that these mountains are west of the River Jordan. They are in the country of the 
DEU.11.31	Soon you will cross the River Jordan. Soon you will take for yourself the country that the 
DEU.11.32	Then be careful and remember! You must obey all the rules and 
DEU.12.1	These are the rules and 
DEU.12.2	You must destroy completely all the places where the people in other 
DEU.12.3	You must break the tables and the things that they have made from stones for their gods. You must burn their special tall sticks and you must cut down their false gods. And you must remove the names of those gods from these places.
DEU.12.4	Do not pray to the 
DEU.12.5	But you must look for the special place that the 
DEU.12.6	to bring your 
DEU.12.7	You and your families will eat and be happy there. You will be with the 
DEU.12.8	When that time happens, you must live in a different way. Today, everyone is doing the things that he likes. 
DEU.12.9	You have not yet reached the country where you can rest. This is the country that the 
DEU.12.10	But you will cross the River Jordan and begin to live in that country. He will give you rest from all your enemies round you. You will be safe. 
DEU.12.11	Then the 
DEU.12.12	And there you will all be happy, with the 
DEU.12.13	Be careful! Do not offer your 
DEU.12.14	You must only offer your 
DEU.12.15	But you can kill and eat your animals in any of your towns. You can eat as much meat as you want. The 
DEU.12.16	But you must not eat the blood. You must pour it on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	Do not eat any of your gifts to the 
DEU.12.18	Instead, you must eat these things in front of the 
DEU.12.19	Be careful never to forget the 
DEU.12.20	The 
DEU.12.21	The place that God has chosen may be too far away from you. If it is, you can kill an animal. And you can eat meat at home. The 
DEU.12.22	You can eat them in the same way as you eat wild animals. People who are obeying God can eat them. But people who have not yet made themselves ready for God can also eat them. 
DEU.12.23	But be careful not to eat the blood. The life of the animal is in the blood. You must not eat the life together with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	You must not eat the blood. You must pour it on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	Do not eat it! If you obey this rule, everything will be well for you and your family. You will do what is right and give pleasure to the 
DEU.12.26	Take all the special gifts that you have chosen. Take also the gifts that you have promised. Bring them to the place that the 
DEU.12.27	Take your 
DEU.12.28	Be careful to obey all these rules that I am giving to you. If you do that, you and your children will always do well. This is good and right, and you will give God pleasure.
DEU.12.29	When you march into the country, the 
DEU.12.30	But when you have killed them, be careful! Do not let their false gods become important to you. Do not say, ‘How did these people pray to their gods? How did they obey them? We will do the same as they did!’
DEU.12.31	You must not do as they do. When they pray, they do many bad things. The 
DEU.12.32	Be careful to do everything that I 
DEU.13.1	There may appear among you a person who dreams about future events. He may promise that something special will happen. 
DEU.13.2	This is because he wants you to stop thinking about the 
DEU.13.3	But you must not listen to him. The 
DEU.13.4	You must follow the 
DEU.13.5	The man who dreams false dreams about future events must die. He has taught you to say ‘No!’ to the 
DEU.13.6	If anyone says secretly to you, ‘Let us pray to some other gods,’ DO NOT LISTEN! This may be your own brother or one of your children. It may be your wife whom you love. It may be a friend who is near to you. 
DEU.13.7	(The people round you may pray to these other gods. They may be near to you or far from you. They are gods that neither you nor your fathers have known.) 
DEU.13.8	Do not do what your family suggests. Do not listen to your friend when he talks about other gods. Do not be sorry for him or try to save him. 
DEU.13.9	You must kill him! You must be the first person to throw stones at him. Then all the people must do the same thing. 
DEU.13.10	You must throw stones at him until he dies. He tried to stop you from thinking about the 
DEU.13.11	Then all Israel's people will hear about this. They will be afraid and no one will do such a bad thing again.
DEU.13.12	You will live in the towns that the 
DEU.13.13	Very bad men from among you may have led the people in one town in a false way. They may have said, ‘Let us go and pray to other gods!’ (These are gods that you do not know.)
DEU.13.14	Then you must be very careful to check this news. You must discover if it is true or false. You must know whether people really have done this bad thing among you. 
DEU.13.15	If the news is true, you must kill everyone in that town. Kill all the people and the animals. 
DEU.13.16	You must bring together all the things that the people of the town have. Put the things in the square place in the middle of the town. Then burn the town and everything in it as a 
DEU.13.17	You must not keep any of the things for yourselves. Burn them all, as I am telling you. If you do that, the 
DEU.13.18	This will happen if you obey the 
DEU.14.1	You belong to the 
DEU.14.2	You are special people because you are the family of the 
DEU.14.3	Do not eat anything that God hates. 
DEU.14.4	These are the animals that you can eat: the cow, the sheep, the goat, 
DEU.14.5	the deer, the wild goat, the mountain goat, the antelope and the wild sheep. 
DEU.14.6	You can eat any animal with feet that grow in two halves. These animals must also bring their food back into their mouths and eat it again. 
DEU.14.7	But you must not eat these animals: the camel, the rabbit and the rock badger. They bring back their food but they do not have feet in two halves. For this reason they are not good food for you. 
DEU.14.8	The pig is not good food either. It has feet in two halves but it does not bring back its food. You must not eat any of these animals. You must not even touch their dead bodies.
DEU.14.9	You can eat any fish that has 
DEU.14.10	But there are things in the water that do not have 
DEU.14.11	You can eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.12+DEU.14.13+DEU.14.14+DEU.14.15+DEU.14.16+DEU.14.17+DEU.14.18	But these birds you must not eat: eagles, vultures, crows, owls, hawks, falcons, buzzards, ostriches, sea-gulls, storks, herons, pelicans, cormorants, hoopoes and bats. 
DEU.14.19	Some insects 
DEU.14.20	But you can eat any clean thing that has 
DEU.14.21	You must not eat anything that you find dead already. You can give it to a foreign person in any of your towns. He can eat it. Or you can sell it to him. But you are special people. You are special to the 
DEU.14.21	You must not cook a young goat in the milk from its mother.
DEU.14.22	You must put away in a special place, a 10th part of all the food that grows in your fields. You must be careful to do this every year. 
DEU.14.23	Then take it to that special place that the 
DEU.14.24	But that special place may be too far from your home. Your regular gifts of food may be too heavy to carry, if you have grown a lot of food. (And the special place may be too far away.) 
DEU.14.25	If that is true, you can sell your regular gifts for money. Take the money with you to the place that the 
DEU.14.26	Then you can use the money to buy whatever you choose: cows, sheep, 
DEU.14.27	Always remember the 
DEU.14.28	Every third year, store in your towns, a 10th part of the food that you have grown in your fields. 
DEU.14.29	This food is for the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every 7 years you must forget about every debt.
DEU.15.2	This is how you must do it. Every person who has lent money must forget about this amount of money. He must not demand his money from any 
DEU.15.3	You can demand your money from a foreign person. But you must forget about every amount of money that you have lent to another 
DEU.15.4	If you obey the 
DEU.15.5	if you obey him completely. So, be careful to obey all the rules that I give to you today. 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.7	Perhaps you will meet a poor man among the 
DEU.15.8	Instead, you must be kind to him and lend him whatever he needs.
DEU.15.9	Be careful not to think this bad thought: ‘The 7th year will happen soon. That is the year when I must forget about debts!’ You must not be cruel to that poor 
DEU.15.10	Be very happy to give to that 
DEU.15.11	There will always be poor people in the country. Give to other 
DEU.15.12	Someone may sell you another 
DEU.15.13	And when you let him go, you must not send him away with nothing in his hands. 
DEU.15.14	Give him gifts of sheep, food and drink. Give good things to him as the 
DEU.15.15	Remember that you too were slaves in Egypt. But the 
DEU.15.16	But perhaps your servant will say to you, ‘I do not want to leave you!’ He may say this because he loves you and your family. He is happy with you. 
DEU.15.17	If he says that, you must take a metal stick with a sharp point. Push it through his ear, into the door. This will make him your servant for his whole life. Do the same thing for your female servant.
DEU.15.18	You must not be sorry to make your servant free. Remember, that he has worked well for you for 6 years. He has been worth twice as much as a servant whom you pay. And the 
DEU.15.19	You must keep separate every male animal that is the first to be born from any animal among your animals. They are for the 
DEU.15.20	Each year, you and your family must eat these special animals in front of the 
DEU.15.21	But you must not give to the 
DEU.15.22	You can eat these animals at home. People that are obeying God can eat them. But people that are not yet ready for God can eat them also. You can eat them as you would eat 
DEU.15.23	But you must not eat the blood. You must pour it on the ground like water.
DEU.16.1	The month Abib is a special month for you. In this month, you must remember the 
DEU.16.2	You must go to the special place that the 
DEU.16.3	At this party, do not eat bread that you make with 
DEU.16.4	No one must keep any 
DEU.16.5	You must not kill the animal for the 
DEU.16.6	You must go to the place that he will choose for himself. You must kill the animal for the 
DEU.16.7	Cook the meat and eat it in the special place. The 
DEU.16.8	For the next 6 days, you must eat bread that you make without 
DEU.16.9	Count 7 weeks from the first day that you bring in the food from your fields. 
DEU.16.10	Then enjoy the party of Weeks with the 
DEU.16.11	You and your family will be happy in front of the 
DEU.16.12	Remember! You were slaves in Egypt, so obey these rules carefully.
DEU.16.13	When you have brought in the food from your fields, enjoy the party of 
DEU.16.14	Be happy at your party with your family, your servants and the 
DEU.16.15	Enjoy this party with the 
DEU.16.16	All your men must come to the 
DEU.16.17	This gift can be large or small, as the 
DEU.16.18	You must choose 
DEU.16.19	You must do what is right for every person. You must not accept a gift. A gift makes it difficult for a 
DEU.16.20	Always be good and fair when you 
DEU.16.21	Do not put any special tall sticks that you make from wood next to the 
DEU.16.22	And do not put up a false god, because the 
DEU.17.1	You must bring good gifts to the 
DEU.17.2	Perhaps a person living in one of your towns may do something bad against the 
DEU.17.3	He has not obeyed my words, because he has followed other gods. He has obeyed these gods, or he has prayed to the sun, moon or stars. 
DEU.17.4	If you hear about this, you must check the report. If this bad thing has happened in 
DEU.17.5	you must take the bad man or woman to the gate of the town. Then you must throw stones at that person until he or she dies. 
DEU.17.6	But two or three people must agree that he has done the bad thing. You must never kill anyone because of the words of only one person. 
DEU.17.7	These people must throw the first stones at the bad person. Then everyone else must throw stones. You must completely remove this very bad thing from among you.
DEU.17.8	It may be difficult for the 
DEU.17.9	You must go to the 
DEU.17.10	Then you must obey them, in the place that the 
DEU.17.11	You must do the things that they teach you. You must agree to what they decide. Obey their words completely. 
DEU.17.12	You must kill any man who will not obey the 
DEU.17.13	Then all the people will hear about it and they will be afraid. They will not refuse to listen to the 
DEU.17.14	You are going into the country that the 
DEU.17.15	Be careful! You must accept the king that the 
DEU.17.16	The king must not get a lot of horses for himself. And he must not send his people back to Egypt to get more horses. The 
DEU.17.17	The king must not marry many wives. They will stop him from thinking about the 
DEU.17.18	When he becomes king, he must copy the 
DEU.17.19	He must keep this 
DEU.17.20	He must not think that he is better than other 
DEU.18.1	The 
DEU.18.2	They will have no land. This makes them different from other 
DEU.18.3	When you bring to God a cow or a sheep as a gift, remember the 
DEU.18.4	You must give to them the first food and drink that you bring from your fields. Give to them also the first hair that you cut from your sheep. 
DEU.18.5	The 
DEU.18.6	Any 
DEU.18.7	If he really wants to, he can work as a servant to the 
DEU.18.8	He may have received money when he sold some of his valuable things. But he must still receive the same amount of food and other good things as the other 
DEU.18.9	When you go into the country that the 
DEU.18.10	You must not burn your child in a fire, as a gift to a false god. You must not become a servant of 
DEU.18.11	They are cruel and they often frighten people. They also try to speak to dead people. 
DEU.18.12	God hates anyone who does these things. It is because of these very bad practices that the 
DEU.18.13	You must live in a right way, and always obey the 
DEU.18.14	The people who live in your country listen to the servants of 
DEU.18.15	He will send you a 
DEU.18.16	Do this because you spoke to the 
DEU.18.17	Then the 
DEU.18.18	I will give them a 
DEU.18.19	I myself will 
DEU.18.20	Perhaps a 
DEU.18.21	You may say to yourselves, ‘How can we know when a message has not come from the 
DEU.18.22	The thing that he speaks about may not happen. If it does not happen, that message was not a true message. The 
DEU.19.1	The 
DEU.19.2	Then you must choose three cities. Each city must be in a central place in your country. 
DEU.19.3	Make the country into three separate parts and build roads to each city. So then anyone who kills a person can run there. And then that person can be safe.
DEU.19.4	This is the rule for anyone who has killed another person. If it was a mistake, he can run to the city. He will be safe there because the man was not an enemy. 
DEU.19.5	For example, two men may go to the forest to cut wood. As one man cuts wood, the metal part of his axe flies off. It hits the other man and kills him. The first man can run to the nearest special city. He will be safe there. 
DEU.19.6	If there was only one city, a policeman might catch the killer on his way. The policeman might be so angry that he kills the man. But the man had made a mistake. He killed his friend, who was not an enemy. 
DEU.19.7	So I 
DEU.19.8	The 
DEU.19.9	You must love him and you must obey his rules. If you do that, he will give the whole country to you. That is what he has promised. If he does that, you must choose three more cities. 
DEU.19.10	You must do this. So then people who are not bad will not die in your country. You must not kill people for murder, when they have made a mistake. Do not do this in the country that the 
DEU.19.11	But perhaps one man may hate another man. He may hide himself and wait for that man. He may kill him and then he may run to one of the cities. 
DEU.19.12	If he does that, the leaders of his own town must fetch him back. They must bring him to the policeman and he must die. 
DEU.19.13	Do not be sorry for him. You must remove completely from 
DEU.19.14	There may be a stone at the edge of your 
DEU.19.15	The report of one man is not enough to check a wrong thing or a 
DEU.19.16	Perhaps a cruel person may say that a man has done something wrong. 
DEU.19.17	Then both the men must stand in front of the 
DEU.19.18	Then the 
DEU.19.19	If that is true, you must do this: You must do to him the things that he wanted to do to the other 
DEU.19.20	So then all the people will be afraid when they hear about this. And this very wrong thing will never happen again among you. 
DEU.19.21	Do not be sorry for people who do what is wrong. You must demand:
DEU.19.21	a life for a life
DEU.19.21	an eye for an eye
DEU.19.21	a tooth for a tooth
DEU.19.21	a hand for a hand
DEU.19.21	a foot for a foot.
DEU.20.1	Do not be afraid when you go out to fight against your enemies. You may meet larger armies with more horses and 
DEU.20.2	Just before you begin to fight, the 
DEU.20.3	He must say, ‘
DEU.20.4	The 
DEU.20.5	Then the officers will say to the soldiers, ‘Has anyone built a new house but has not yet made it ready for God? He must go home. If he does not, he may die in the fight. And someone else may make his house ready. 
DEU.20.6	Has anyone planted a field with 
DEU.20.7	Has anyone promised to marry a woman? If he has not married her yet, he must go home. He may die in the fight and then another man will marry her.’
DEU.20.8	Then the officers must also say, ‘Is anyone afraid? Does anyone not feel brave? He must go home. If he does not, he will make other men afraid too.’
DEU.20.9	When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they must choose leaders for it.
DEU.20.10	Before you attack a city, you must do this: Offer 
DEU.20.11	Perhaps they will open the gates and let you come in. If they do that, you must cause all the people to work hard for you, like slaves. 
DEU.20.12	But they may refuse to listen to you. They may even begin to fight you. If they do that, you must fight against that city. 
DEU.20.13	When the 
DEU.20.14	But you can take for yourselves the women, the children, the animals and everything else in the city. You can use all these things that God gives you from your enemies. 
DEU.20.15	You must do this to all the cities that are far from you.
DEU.20.16	You will take cities in the country that God is giving you. Then you must kill everything that is alive, people and animals. 
DEU.20.17	You must kill completely all the 
DEU.20.18	If you do that, they cannot teach you their bad practices. They cannot teach you to pray as they pray to their gods. If you did that, you would be 
DEU.20.19	Perhaps you are preparing to take a city. You must not cut down its fruit-trees, but you can eat the fruit. These trees are not your enemies; so do not cut them down. 
DEU.20.20	But you can cut down the other trees to use. You can make things from them that will help you to attack the city. You can do this until the city's people open its gates to you.
DEU.21.1	You may find the dead body of a man that is lying in a field. Someone has killed him, in the country that the 
DEU.21.2	You may not know who has killed him. If you do not know, you must do this: Your leaders and 
DEU.21.3	Then the leaders from the nearest town must take a young cow that has never pulled a plough. 
DEU.21.4	They must lead her down to a valley that no one has ploughed or planted. There must be a stream full of water. There they must break her neck.
DEU.21.5	The 
DEU.21.6	All the leaders of that town must wash their hands over the cow whose neck they have broken. 
DEU.21.7	And they will say, ‘We did not kill the man. We did not see anyone kill him. 
DEU.21.8	Please accept this animal as a gift, 
DEU.21.9	You will show that you have made yourselves right with God. You have not done this bad thing. And God has seen that you have done the right thing.
DEU.21.10	When you go to war against your enemies, the 
DEU.21.11	You may see among them a beautiful woman that you like. If you do see one, you can make her your wife. 
DEU.21.12	You must bring her into your home. Then she must cut off her hair and cut the hard material at the end of her fingers. 
DEU.21.13	And she must change her clothes. Let her live in your house and weep for her parents for a whole month. Then you can become her husband and she can become your wife. 
DEU.21.14	You may not like her. You must let her go where she wants. You must not sell her or make her into a slave. You must not do that because she has had sex with you, as your wife.
DEU.21.15	A man may have two wives but he may love only one of them. Each wife may give birth to a son. The first son may be the son of the wife that he does not love. 
DEU.21.16	But the man must make this promise: After his own death, the first son will have twice as many of his good things as the second son. This is because that son was born first. The man must not promise twice as much to the son of the wife that he loves. Her son was not born first. 
DEU.21.17	The man must remember the son of the wife that he does not love. This son was born first and he must have twice as many of his father's good things. He has a special place in the family because he was born first.
DEU.21.18	Perhaps a man has a bad son who will not obey his parents. They try to teach him right things. But he refuses to listen to them. 
DEU.21.19	If that is true, his parents must take him to the leaders of his town. 
DEU.21.20	They must say to the leaders, ‘This is our son. He wants to do bad things and he will not obey us. He is a drunk and he wastes our money.’ 
DEU.21.21	Then all the men in his town must throw stones at him until he is dead. You must remove these bad things from among you. Then all 
DEU.21.22	You may have killed a man who has 
DEU.21.23	you must not leave it there during the night. Be careful to bury it on the same day. This is because God is very angry with anyone who is hanging on a tree. You must not let bad things destroy your own good country. This is the country that God is giving to you.
DEU.22.1	You may see the cow or sheep of another 
DEU.22.2	Perhaps the man does not live near you. Perhaps you do not know him. If you do not know him, take the animal to your home. And then keep it safe. When the man comes to look for it, give it to him. 
DEU.22.3	You must do the same thing if you find a 
DEU.22.4	Perhaps you see another 
DEU.22.5	A woman must not wear the clothes of a man. A man must not wear the clothes of a woman. For the 
DEU.22.6	You may find the home of a bird in a tree or on the ground. You must not take away the bird, whether she is sitting on eggs or on young birds. 
DEU.22.7	You can take the young birds. But you must let the mother go free. If you do that, everything will be well with you. And you will have a long life.
DEU.22.8	When you build a new house, you must make a wall round the edge of the roof. Even if you have done that, someone may fall from the roof. But even if that person dies, you will not have done anything wrong.
DEU.22.9	You must not plant two different kinds of seed in your field. If you do that, nothing will grow well in that field. The fruit will not be good.
DEU.22.10	You must not tie a cow and a 
DEU.22.11	You must not mix different materials together to make clothes.
DEU.22.12	You must sow 
DEU.22.13	A man may marry a girl. Then he may decide that he does not like her. 
DEU.22.14	So he says wrong things about her and gives her a bad name. He even says, ‘I married this girl. Then I discovered that she had already had sex. She had sex before I married her.’ 
DEU.22.15	Then the parents of the girl must bring the blanket. It shows that she had not had sex before. They must bring it to the leaders of the town. 
DEU.22.16	And the father of the girl will say to the leaders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But now he does not like her. 
DEU.22.17	He says wrong things about her. He says, “Your daughter had sex before I married her.” But here is the blanket. This shows that she had never had sex before.’ Then her parents must hold up the blanket in front of the leaders of the town. 
DEU.22.18	Then the leaders must take the man and 
DEU.22.19	They must make him pay 100 
DEU.22.20	But perhaps the husband has spoken true words. Perhaps his wife cannot show that she had not had sex before. 
DEU.22.21	If she cannot do that, the leaders must bring her to her father's house. There, the men of the town must throw stones at her until she dies. She has done a very bad thing in 
DEU.22.22	You may find a man who is having sex with another man's wife. If you find them, you must kill both the man and the woman. You must remove this bad thing from 
DEU.22.23	Perhaps a man may meet a girl in a town. She has already promised to marry another man, but they have sex together. 
DEU.22.24	You must take both of them to the gate of that town. There you must throw stones at both of them until they die. The girl must die because she did not scream for help in the town. The man must die because he had sex with the future wife of another man.
DEU.22.25	But perhaps a man may meet a girl in a country place. He has sex with her because he is too strong for her. But she has already promised to marry another man. Only the man who has done that must die. 
DEU.22.26	Do not hurt the girl. She has not done a 
DEU.22.27	This man made the girl have sex with him in a country place. She screamed for help, but there was no one to save her.
DEU.22.28	Perhaps a man may make a girl have sex with him. The girl has not had sex with anyone before and someone discovers them. She has not yet promised to marry anyone. 
DEU.22.29	If that has happened, the man must pay 50 
DEU.22.30	A man must not marry his father's wife or have sex with her. This is a bad thing to do against his father.
DEU.23.1	Perhaps someone has destroyed the sex parts of a man. That man cannot join with the people of the 
DEU.23.2	No one can join with the people of the 
DEU.23.3	These people cannot join with the people of the 
DEU.23.4	They refused to give bread and water to you when you left Egypt. And they paid Balaam the son of Beor to say very bad things about you. He came from Pethor in Mesopotamia. 
DEU.23.5	But the 
DEU.23.6	Do not agree to stop fighting with these people. Do not be friendly with them as long as you live.
DEU.23.7	Do not hate anyone from Edom, because he has the same 
DEU.23.8	The third 
DEU.23.9	Keep away from everything that God would not like. Do this even when you are fighting your enemies. 
DEU.23.10	While a man is asleep, something may come out of his sex part. If that happens, he must go away beyond the 
DEU.23.11	In the evening, he must wash himself. Then at sunset he can return to the 
DEU.23.12	You must choose a special place beyond the 
DEU.23.13	Always carry with you a small spade. Dig a hole and bury in it the dirt from inside your body. 
DEU.23.14	For the 
DEU.23.15	A slave may come to you to be safe. If that happens, keep him with you. Do not give him back to his master. 
DEU.23.16	He can live among you in any place that he likes. Let him choose his own town. Do not be cruel to him.
DEU.23.17	No 
DEU.23.18	Some people will pay money to a man or a woman for sex. You must not bring this money into the house of the 
DEU.23.19	You can lend money or food or anything else to another 
DEU.23.20	You can ask anyone from a foreign country to do that. But you must not do this to another 
DEU.23.21	If you promise a gift to the 
DEU.23.22	But if you do not promise to do anything, that will not be a 
DEU.23.23	Whatever you say, you must be careful to do. You chose to say the words to the 
DEU.23.24	If you go into your 
DEU.23.25	If you go into your 
DEU.24.1	Perhaps a man will marry a woman and then discover something bad in her. He does not like her, so he writes a letter. This letter finishes the marriage. He gives it to his wife and he sends her out of his house. 
DEU.24.2	Perhaps, after she has left his house, she marries another man.
DEU.24.3	Perhaps her second husband also discovers that he does not like her. So he also gives her a letter that finishes the marriage. He sends her away, or perhaps he dies. 
DEU.24.4	But her first husband must not marry her again. That is because she has been the wife of another man. To marry her again would be a 
DEU.24.5	When a man has just married, do not send him to fight in a war. Do not give him any special duties. He should stay at home for one year and make his new wife happy.
DEU.24.6	When you lend money to a man, do not take away his large stones. Do not even take the top one. This is because he needs these stones to make flour from his 
DEU.24.7	Perhaps you will catch a man who is carrying away another 
DEU.24.8	Perhaps you have the illness that is called 
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	Your 
DEU.24.11	You must wait outside. Let him bring the 
DEU.24.12	If the man is poor, you must not keep his 
DEU.24.13	You must give him his coat again before sunset. He can wear it and he can keep himself warm at night. He will ask God to do good things for you. And you will give pleasure to the 
DEU.24.14	Always be kind to a poor servant who needs many things. Do this whether he is an 
DEU.24.15	You must pay him his money every day before sunset because he is poor. He needs to have the money. If you do not pay him, he may ask the 
DEU.24.16	You must not kill fathers for the 
DEU.24.17	Remember to be completely fair to the foreign person and those who are without fathers. Do not take the coat of any woman whose husband has died, as a 
DEU.24.18	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the 
DEU.24.19	When you bring in the food from your field, perhaps you will leave some of the 
DEU.24.20	When you knock down the 
DEU.24.21	When you pick your 
DEU.24.22	Remember! You were slaves in Egypt. That is why I tell you to do this.
DEU.25.1	When two men cannot agree, they must both go to the 
DEU.25.2	The 
DEU.25.3	But he must not hit him more than 40 times. So then you will not all feel that another 
DEU.25.4	Do not tie up the mouth of a cow while she walks on your 
DEU.25.5	Perhaps two brothers are living together. One of the brothers may die and leave no son. If that happens, his wife must not marry outside the family. The second brother must take the wife and he must marry her. He is doing what is right for his dead brother. 
DEU.25.6	The first son that is born to them will be called the same name as the dead brother. So everyone in 
DEU.25.7	But a man may not want to marry his dead brother's wife. If he does not want to do it, she should go to the leaders at the gate of the town. She should say, ‘My dead husband's brother refuses to do his duty for me. He does not want people to remember my dead husband. He does not want to give my husband's name to our son.’ 
DEU.25.8	Then the leaders of the town must call the man to them and they must talk to him. Perhaps he will continue to say, ‘I do not want to marry her!’
DEU.25.9	If that happens, his brother's wife must go to him, in front of the leaders. She must pull off one of his shoes and 
DEU.25.10	Then everyone will call the family of the living brother, ‘the family of the man who lost his shoe.’
DEU.25.11	Perhaps two men are fighting each other. The wife of one of them comes to save him. She takes hold of the sex parts of his enemy. 
DEU.25.12	If that happens, you must cut off her hand. Do not be sorry for her.
DEU.25.13	Do not have in your bag two different things with which to measure weight, one heavy and one light. 
DEU.25.14	Do not have in your house two different jars with which to measure, one large and one small.
DEU.25.15	You must have true and honest things with which to measure and to weigh. If you do that you will live for a long time in your country. It is the country that the 
DEU.25.16	The 
DEU.25.17	Remember what the 
DEU.25.18	They met you when you were tired and weak. They killed all the people who could not walk fast. They were not afraid of God. 
DEU.25.19	The 
DEU.26.1	You are going into the country that the 
DEU.26.2	Take a basket. Put into it some of the first food that you have grown in your fields. This is the country that the 
DEU.26.3	Say to the man who is a 
DEU.26.4	Then the 
DEU.26.5	Then you must say, in front of the 
DEU.26.6	But the people in Egypt were cruel to us. They made us work very hard. 
DEU.26.7	Then we prayed to the 
DEU.26.8	So the 
DEU.26.9	He brought us to this place. He gave to us this country that is full of good food and drink. 
DEU.26.10	and now, I bring the first food that has grown in my fields. You, 
DEU.26.11	And so you and the 
DEU.26.12	Every third year you must give a 10th part of the food that grows in your fields. Give it to the 
DEU.26.13	Then you can say to the 
DEU.26.14	I did not eat any of the 10th part of the food while I was sad and crying. I did not move any of it while I was not ready for God. I have not put any of it as a gift, in front of a dead person. I have obeyed the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from your home, the special place where you live. Come near to your people, Israel's people and give us your help. Do good things also to the country that you have given to us. It is a country full of good food and drink. You promised our 
DEU.26.16	‘Today, the 
DEU.26.17	Today, you have said that the 
DEU.26.18	Today the 
DEU.26.19	He says that he will make you greater and more famous than every other 
DEU.27.1	Moses and the leaders of 
DEU.27.2	You will cross the River Jordan and go into the country that the 
DEU.27.3	Then write on them all the words of this 
DEU.27.4	And when you have crossed the river, you must put these stones on 
DEU.27.5	You must build there an 
DEU.27.6	Build this table for the 
DEU.27.7	You can also offer 
DEU.27.8	And you must write all these rules on the stones that you have put there. You must write the rules very clearly.’
DEU.27.9	Then Moses and the 
DEU.27.10	Obey the 
DEU.27.11	On the same day, Moses said to the people:
DEU.27.12	After you have crossed the Jordan, these 
DEU.27.13	And these 
DEU.27.14	The 
DEU.27.15	‘God will cause bad things for the man who makes any false god. The 
DEU.27.16	‘God will cause bad things for the man who does bad things to his parents.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.17	‘God will cause bad things for the man who moves the stone at the edge of his 
DEU.27.18	‘A man may lead a person who cannot see, along a wrong path. This path does not go to the place that he wants. God will cause bad things for the cruel man who does this.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.19	‘A man may refuse to do right things for the stranger, the woman whose husband has died, or her children. God will cause bad things for this man.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.20	‘God will cause bad things for the man who has sex with his father's wife. It is very wrong for him to make his father's bed dirty.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.21	‘God will cause bad things for the man who has sex with any animal.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.22	‘God will cause bad things for the man who has sex with his sister. She may be the daughter of his father or of his mother.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.23	‘God will cause bad things for the man who has sex with his wife's mother.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.24	‘Perhaps a man may kill his 
DEU.27.25	‘Perhaps a man may accept money to kill another person. This other person has done nothing wrong. God will cause bad things for the man who accepts the money.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.27.26	‘God will cause bad things for the man who does not obey all God's words and rules.’ Then everyone must say, ‘Yes! I agree.’
DEU.28.1	Today, I am telling you this! You must obey the 
DEU.28.2	If you obey the 
DEU.28.3	The 
DEU.28.4	The 
DEU.28.5	The 
DEU.28.6	The 
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	So everyone in the world will see that the 
DEU.28.11	The 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	The 
DEU.28.14	Do not refuse any of the rules that I give you today. Do not do wrong things. It is wrong to want other gods. You must not have other gods or pray to them.
DEU.28.15	But if you do not obey the 
DEU.28.16	Bad things will happen to you, whether you are in the city or in the fields.
DEU.28.17	Bad things will happen to the food that is growing in your fields. Even the bread that you make will not be good.
DEU.28.18	Bad things will happen to your children, the food that grows in your fields, your young cows and your sheep.
DEU.28.19	Bad things will happen to you when you come into your homes. And bad things will happen to you when you leave them.
DEU.28.20	If you do not obey the words of the 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	The sky above your head will be like hard metal. The ground under your feet will be like iron. 
DEU.28.24	There will be no rain on your country. There will only be dry sand that is flying about in the air. It will come down from the sky until it has destroyed you.
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	Your dead bodies will be food for all the birds and the animals. No one will send them away. 
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	You will fall as you walk at midday. You will be like someone who cannot see. You will not do well in anything. Every day, people will rob you and be cruel to you. No one will save you.
DEU.28.30	A woman may promise to marry you. But another man will take her and have sex with her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a garden, but you will never eat the fruit from it. 
DEU.28.31	Someone will kill your cow in front of you, but you will not eat any of the meat. Someone will take away your 
DEU.28.32	The people from another country will take your children for slaves. You will look for them every day, but you cannot bring them back to you. 
DEU.28.33	Strangers will eat the food from your fields. People will be cruel to you all the days of your life. 
DEU.28.34	The things that you see will destroy your minds. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	The 
DEU.28.38	You will plant many seeds in your fields, but you will not bring in much food. Hungry insects will eat it. 
DEU.28.39	You will plant gardens for 
DEU.28.40	 trees will grow everywhere in your country, but you will have no oil from them. The fruit will drop off the trees.
DEU.28.41	You will have sons and daughters, but you will lose them. Enemies will take them away from you and keep them. 
DEU.28.42	Insects will eat all your trees and the food from your fields.
DEU.28.43	Foreign people who live in your country will become stronger and stronger. But you will become weaker and weaker. 
DEU.28.44	They will lend money to you, but you will not lend money to them. And, in the end, they will rule over you.
DEU.28.45	All these bad things will happen to you. They will be like an enemy that runs after you and catches you. They will destroy you because you did not obey the 
DEU.28.46	The bad things that happen to you will be a sign to you and your children for always. They will show that God is very angry with you. 
DEU.28.47	The 
DEU.28.48	So now you must work for the enemies that the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	They will have cruel faces. They will neither do good things for your old people, nor be kind to your children. 
DEU.28.51	They will eat your young animals and the food from your fields, until they have destroyed you. They will not leave any food, 
DEU.28.52	They will attack all the cities in your country. You will build high walls to keep yourselves safe. But they will fall.
DEU.28.53	When your enemies attack your cities, you will have no food. You will become very, very hungry. Then you will eat the children that the 
DEU.28.54	Even the best and kindest man among you will do this. He will be so hungry that he will not be sorry for any of his family. He will not even be sorry for his own brother. He will not be sorry for his wife that he loves. And he will not be sorry for his children. 
DEU.28.55	He will not give to one of them any of the meat that he is eating. This meat is the body of his child. He will not give any to his brother, or to his wife, or to his children that remain alive. He will have nothing to eat except his children, because your enemies will take away your food. 
DEU.28.56	Even the best and kindest woman, who never has to walk anywhere, will do the same thing. 
DEU.28.57	She will become so hungry that she will eat her new baby. She will even eat the thing that came out of her body after the baby. She will do this as a secret thing. She will not give any of these things to her husband or to her other children. These things will happen to you when your enemies attack your cities.
DEU.28.58	Be careful! Obey all these rules that I have written in this 
DEU.28.59	If you do not, the 
DEU.28.60	He will cause you to have all the illnesses that made you afraid in Egypt. These illnesses will remain with you. You will not become well again.
DEU.28.61	The 
DEU.28.62	You were once as many as the stars in the sky. But you will become only a few people because you did not obey the 
DEU.28.63	Once, the 
DEU.28.64	Then the 
DEU.28.65	You will not be happy there. You will not find any place to rest. The 
DEU.28.66	You will be afraid all the time, both in the day and at night. You will always be afraid of death. 
DEU.28.67	Every morning you will say, ‘I want it to be evening very soon!’ And every evening you will say, ‘I want it to be morning very soon!’ You will be so afraid of everything that you see. 
DEU.28.68	I told you that you would never return to Egypt. But the 
DEU.29.1	The 
DEU.29.2	Moses caused all the people to come together. Then he said to them:
DEU.29.2	You have seen what the 
DEU.29.3	You saw with your own eyes all the great and powerful things that he did. 
DEU.29.4	But until now the 
DEU.29.5	The 
DEU.29.6	You did not eat bread or drink any alcohol. I am the 
DEU.29.7	When we arrived here, Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, fought against us. But we beat them. 
DEU.29.8	We marched into their country and we gave it to the 
DEU.29.9	Be careful to obey the words of this promise. If you do that, everything will be good for you. Everything that you do will be good.
DEU.29.10	You are all standing today in front of the 
DEU.29.11	Your children, your wives and the foreign people are all here. The foreign people live with you. They cut wood and carry water for you. 
DEU.29.12	You are standing here to agree to a promise with the 
DEU.29.13	He tells you again today that you are his own people. He has promised to be your God. He made the same promise to your 
DEU.29.14	I am making this promise, using serious and powerful words. It is not only for you. 
DEU.29.15	You are standing here with us today, in front of the 
DEU.29.16	You know how we lived in Egypt. You remember how we travelled through other countries on the way here. 
DEU.29.17	You saw their gods, which the 
DEU.29.18	Be very careful that no one forgets the 
DEU.29.19	Everyone who hears these serious words must obey them. He must not say to himself, ‘I will be safe, whatever happens. I will do whatever I want!’ If you say that, very bad things will destroy you and your fields. This will happen to both good and bad people. 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	In future days, your children and your grandchildren will see your troubles. Foreign people also will see your many illnesses and troubles. And they will know that the 
DEU.29.23	The whole country will become a 
DEU.29.24	All the people in the country will ask, ‘Why has the 
DEU.29.25	And the answer will be: ‘Because these people stopped obeying their promise to the 
DEU.29.26	They went away and prayed to other gods. They obeyed these strange gods that he had not given to them. 
DEU.29.27	So the 
DEU.29.28	The 
DEU.29.29	Some secret things belong only to the 
DEU.30.1	I have told you to choose between good things and bad things. When they happen to you, you will remember my words. When God has caused you to go out of your country, you will remember my words. When you have to live among people in other countries, you will remember my words. 
DEU.30.2	Then you and your children will come back to the 
DEU.30.3	If you do that, the 
DEU.30.4	Perhaps he may have sent you to countries that are very far away. Even from there, he will cause you to come together and he will bring you back. 
DEU.30.5	He will bring you to your fathers' country and it will be yours. He will do greater things for you than he did for your fathers. He will make you more in number than your fathers. 
DEU.30.6	The 
DEU.30.7	Then the 
DEU.30.8	You will obey the 
DEU.30.9	If you do that, the 
DEU.30.10	This will happen if you obey all the rules and 
DEU.30.11	The thing that I am 
DEU.30.12	It is not in God's home. So you do not have to ask, ‘Who will go up to God's home and bring it down to us? Then we can understand his words and obey them.’
DEU.30.13	Nor is it across the sea. So you do not have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to fetch it? Then we can understand his words and obey them.’
DEU.30.14	No! God's word is very near to you. It is in your mouth and in your mind, so that you can obey it.
DEU.30.15	Look! I offer you today, life and good things, or death and very bad things. You must choose which you will have. 
DEU.30.16	I say this because I am 
DEU.30.17	But you may think about other things and refuse to listen. If you do that, people will lead you to other gods. You will obey them and pray to them. 
DEU.30.18	If you do that, God will certainly destroy you. I am saying that to you today. You will not live for many years in your country that is across the River Jordan.
DEU.30.19	Today, I want the sky and the earth to hear my words. I am shouting them aloud. For I have offered you, life or death, good things or bad things. Choose life! If you do that, you and your children will live. 
DEU.30.20	Then you will love the 
DEU.31.1	Then Moses went out and he spoke to all the 
DEU.31.2	‘I am now 120 years old and I cannot continue to lead you. The 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	The 
DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and be brave! Do not be afraid of them, because the 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses fetched Joshua. He spoke to him in front of all the people and he said, ‘You must go with these people into their country. So be strong and be brave. The 
DEU.31.8	The 
DEU.31.9	So Moses wrote these rules in a 
DEU.31.10	Then Moses said to them, ‘You must read this 
DEU.31.11	Everybody will come together to stand in front of the 
DEU.31.12	Bring all the men, women and children together. And remember also to bring the foreign people who live in your towns. Then they can listen. They can learn to obey the 
DEU.31.13	Their children do not know these rules, so they must hear them. If you do that, they will learn to obey the 
DEU.31.14	The 
DEU.31.15	Then the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	On that day, I will become angry with them. I will go away from them. I will not stay with them, but I will destroy them. Many troubles and difficulties will happen to them. Then they will say, “These troubles and difficulties have happened to us because our God is not with us.”
DEU.31.18	And I will certainly refuse to help them on that day. This is because they have done a very bad thing. They have obeyed other gods and prayed to them.
DEU.31.19	Now write this song and teach the 
DEU.31.20	I will take them into this country, which is full of good food and drink. I promised their 
DEU.31.21	Many troubles and difficulties will happen to them. Then this song will cause them to remember. They will remember the bad things that they have done. Their children will not forget it. Even now, I know what they are thinking. I know it, even before I take them into their country. This is the country that I promised to them, with serious words.’
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote this song on that day. Then he taught it to the 
DEU.31.23	Then the 
DEU.31.24	So Moses finished writing the whole 
DEU.31.25	Then he said to the 
DEU.31.26	‘Take this 
DEU.31.27	I know that you like bad things very much. You do not want to obey God's rules. You enjoy doing wrong things. You have been like this, against the 
DEU.31.28	Bring to me all the leaders of your 
DEU.31.29	I know that you will become completely bad after my death. You will refuse the good 
DEU.31.30	Then Moses spoke the words of this song, from the beginning to the end. And all Israel's people listened to him.
DEU.32.1	Sky and earth, hear my words! Listen to me!
DEU.32.2	When I teach people, it will be like the rain when it falls.
DEU.32.2	My words will do good things to them, like water does to the fields.
DEU.32.2	They will be like rain on young plants and on new grass.
DEU.32.3	I will pronounce the name of the 
DEU.32.3	Oh, tell everyone how great and important our God is!
DEU.32.4	He is The Rock that is strong. It does not move away.
DEU.32.4	His work is completely good. All the things that he does are fair.
DEU.32.4	He is a God who keeps his promises. He never does anything that is wrong.
DEU.32.4	He does what is fair and good.
DEU.32.5	But you have done wrong things. You cannot continue to be his people.
DEU.32.5	You are neither fair nor good. You enjoy doing bad things.
DEU.32.6	This is not the right way to live. The 
DEU.32.6	You are fools and not people who understand.
DEU.32.6	He is your Father and he made you. He himself made you from his own plan.
DEU.32.7	Remember the days that are past.
DEU.32.7	Think of all the people who have died. Ask your father and he will tell you.
DEU.32.7	Ask the old men. They will explain what happened.
DEU.32.8	The powerful God, who is very important, gave their own place to the people in each country. He decided where the edges of each country should be. And when he was doing that, he was thinking about the number of the 
DEU.32.9	But the 
DEU.32.9	He chose the 
DEU.32.10	The 
DEU.32.10	He was careful about them and he loved them.
DEU.32.10	He did not let anyone hurt them, because they were so valuable to him.
DEU.32.11	He was like a large bird. A bird teaches its young birds to fly.
DEU.32.11	The large bird flies below them and catches them.
DEU.32.11	It carries them on its back. They do not fall.
DEU.32.11	The 
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.13	The 
DEU.32.13	He fed them with fruit that grows in the fields. He gave to them 
DEU.32.13	He gave to them oil from a place that was full of stones.
DEU.32.14	Their cows and their sheep gave plenty of milk.
DEU.32.14	The people ate the best meat that they found in Bashan.
DEU.32.14	They ate the very best bread and they drank fresh 
DEU.32.15	Then the 
DEU.32.15	They were full of food. But they did not want to obey the God who made them.
DEU.32.15	They refused to obey God, their Rock.
DEU.32.15	But he is the God who saved them.
DEU.32.16	They made the 
DEU.32.16	They made their own gods, which he hated.
DEU.32.17	They obeyed very bad gods and prayed to them.
DEU.32.17	These are not God. These are new gods, which they had not known.
DEU.32.17	Even your father was not afraid of them.
DEU.32.18	You refused to obey God, your Rock and your Father.
DEU.32.18	You forgot the God who caused you to be born.
DEU.32.19	When the 
DEU.32.19	He looked away from his sons and daughters and he said,
DEU.32.20	‘I will not continue to be with them. Then I will see what happens to them in the end.
DEU.32.20	They are children who do not obey me. They refuse to give me pleasure.
DEU.32.21	They made me angry with their false gods. These gods have no value.
DEU.32.21	So I will make them angry because of those who are not a 
DEU.32.21	I will make them angry, by a 
DEU.32.22	My 
DEU.32.22	You will meet with it everywhere that you go. You will meet with it in everything that you do.
DEU.32.22	Even on the day when you die, you will meet with it.
DEU.32.22	Even the great things that I have made will know the heat of my 
DEU.32.23	I will cause them to have many kinds of trouble. I will attack them.
DEU.32.24	They will become very thin because they have no food. They will have many cruel illnesses.
DEU.32.24	Wild animals will attack them. Snakes will bite them and they will die.
DEU.32.25	War will cause people to die in the streets. War will kill their children.
DEU.32.25	Even in their homes, they will be afraid.
DEU.32.25	Young men and young women will die. Babies and old men will also die.
DEU.32.26	I would have caused them to go out of their country completely. So nobody would remember them.
DEU.32.27	But that would give their enemies pleasure. They would not understand.
DEU.32.27	They would say, “We have destroyed these people! The 
DEU.32.29	If they were 
DEU.32.29	They would know what will happen to them in the end.
DEU.32.30	One man runs after 1000 men!
DEU.32.30	Two men make 10,000 men run away!
DEU.32.30	This could only happen if God, their strong Rock, had made them slaves.
DEU.32.30	This could only happen if the 
DEU.32.31	Our enemies know that their own gods are weak.
DEU.32.31	They are not like the God of 
DEU.32.32	Our enemies are bad and cruel, like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	They are like 
DEU.32.33	They make their 
DEU.32.34	I, the 
DEU.32.35	I have authority over them. And I will make bad things happen to them because of what they have done. I will 
DEU.32.35	The time will come when they will fall in front of their enemies.
DEU.32.35	It will soon be the day for their trouble. My plans will happen quickly.
DEU.32.36	The 
DEU.32.36	He will save them when he sees them, weak and without help.
DEU.32.37	Then the 
DEU.32.38	You fed them with the best part of your gifts of food. You gave them good 
DEU.32.39	Remember this: I, and I alone, am God. Other gods are false.
DEU.32.39	I kill and I give life. I have hurt you, but I can make you well again.
DEU.32.39	Nobody can stop what I am doing.
DEU.32.40	I am the God who lives for all time.
DEU.32.40	I raise my hand to 
DEU.32.41	to make my big knife sharp. I will use it to 
DEU.32.41	I will 
DEU.32.41	I will do this to everybody who hates me.
DEU.32.42	Their blood will drop from my 
DEU.32.42	This will be the blood of the dead people and of the slaves and of the enemy's leaders.’
DEU.32.43	All you people in every country, be happy with God's people!
DEU.32.43	He will 
DEU.32.43	But he will pay the price himself for all the bad things that his people have done.
DEU.32.44	Moses came with Joshua, the son of Nun, and he spoke all the words of this song. And all the 
DEU.32.45	When Moses had finished speaking these words, 
DEU.32.46	he said to all the people, ‘Remember every word that I have said to you today. You must repeat them to your children. Tell them that they must obey all the words of this 
DEU.32.47	These words are not silly words. They are the most important things in your life. If you obey them, you will live for many years in the country across the Jordan. It will be your own country.’
DEU.32.48	On the same day, the 
DEU.32.49	‘Go to the Abarim mountains in the country called Moab and climb 
DEU.32.50	You will die on that mountain and join your 
DEU.32.51	This is because both of you failed to obey me in front of the 
DEU.32.52	So you will only see the country from far away. You cannot go into the country that I am giving to the 
DEU.33.1	Before his death, Moses, the man who knew God so well, spoke these good words to all the 
DEU.33.2	And he said:
DEU.33.2	‘The 
DEU.33.2	He shone on his people from 
DEU.33.2	Thousands (1000s) of 
DEU.33.2	In his right hand, there was a burning 
DEU.33.3	We pray to you. We 
DEU.33.4	We obey your rules, which Moses gave to us.
DEU.33.4	They are the special gift that you gave to all the 
DEU.33.5	You became our king when the leaders of the people and all the 
DEU.33.6	Cause the 
DEU.33.7	And Moses said about the 
DEU.33.7	‘
DEU.33.7	They fight for themselves.
DEU.33.8	About the 
DEU.33.8	‘Your 
DEU.33.8	You checked them at Massah and you argued with them at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	Levi loved and obeyed you more than his parents, more than his brothers or his children.
DEU.33.9	He studied your words and your promise was very special to him.
DEU.33.10	The 
DEU.33.10	They offer powder that has a sweet smell to you, on your 
DEU.33.11	Make all their work give you pleasure.
DEU.33.11	Destroy all their enemies completely.’
DEU.33.12	About the 
DEU.33.12	‘The 
DEU.33.12	The 
DEU.33.13	About the 
DEU.33.13	‘
DEU.33.13	Send rain from the sky above,
DEU.33.13	and water from under the earth.
DEU.33.14	Make good fruit grow in their fields,
DEU.33.14	the best fruit of each season.
DEU.33.15	Send them good gifts from the mountains and the hills that are so old.
DEU.33.15	Make the hills full of good fruit.
DEU.33.16	Fill their country with everything that is good.
DEU.33.16	Make them very happy with the love of the 
DEU.33.16	the God who lived in the burning bush.
DEU.33.16	Send all these good things to the 
DEU.33.16	the man who was special among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	Joseph is as strong as a 
DEU.33.17	All the strong men from Ephraim and Manasseh are his 
DEU.33.17	With them, he attacks the people of other countries.
DEU.33.17	He pushes them to the edges of the world.’
DEU.33.18	About the 
DEU.33.18	‘Be happy, Zebulun, as you go out of your home.
DEU.33.18	Be happy, Issachar, in your home.
DEU.33.19	They ask foreign people to come to their mountain.
DEU.33.19	Then these people will offer the right gifts there.
DEU.33.19	They eat good things from the sea. They find special things in the sand.’
DEU.33.20	About the 
DEU.33.20	‘Happy is the man who makes Gad's land wider!
DEU.33.20	Gad lives there like a 
DEU.33.21	He took the best part of the country for himself.
DEU.33.21	Moses gave to Gad's 
DEU.33.21	When Israel's people came together, the 
DEU.33.21	They did what the 
DEU.33.22	About the 
DEU.33.22	‘The 
DEU.33.23	About the 
DEU.33.23	‘The 
DEU.33.23	They are full of the good things that the 
DEU.33.23	They will have all the land, as far as to the south of Lake Galilee.’
DEU.33.24	About the 
DEU.33.24	‘The 
DEU.33.24	Their brothers will say that they are very important.
DEU.33.24	They will be rich enough to bathe their feet in oil.
DEU.33.25	They will make the gates of their towns from iron and yellow metal.
DEU.33.25	They will always be strong.
DEU.33.26	He rides across the sky to help you.
DEU.33.26	He travels to you on the clouds, with great authority.
DEU.33.27	He is the God who has always been alive. He is the safe place where you can hide.
DEU.33.27	And his strong arms are always under you, to hold you.
DEU.33.27	He will send away your enemies in front of you.
DEU.33.27	He says to you, “Destroy them!”
DEU.33.28	So 
DEU.33.29	The 
DEU.33.29	He is like a strong wall in front of you. He is like a big, sharp knife against your enemies.
DEU.33.29	He helps you.
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will be very afraid of you. And you will destroy the special places where they pray to their gods.’
DEU.34.1	Then Moses climbed 
DEU.34.2	He saw all the places that would belong to Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh and Judah. He saw all the land, as far as the Mediterranean Sea. 
DEU.34.3	He saw the south part of Judah. He saw the valley from Zoar to Jericho. Jericho is the city of tall trees. 
DEU.34.4	Then the 
DEU.34.5	And Moses, the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	And the 
DEU.34.7	Moses was 120 years old when he died. But he could still see well and his body was still strong. 
DEU.34.8	Then the 
DEU.34.9	Then God filled Joshua, the son of Nun, with his own 
DEU.34.10	There has never been another 
DEU.34.11	The 
DEU.34.12	No other man has shown such powerful authority or done such great things. And Moses did these things in front of all the 
JOS.1.1	Moses, the man who had 
JOS.1.2	‘Moses, my servant, is dead. Now you and all these people must get ready to cross the river Jordan. You, the people of Israel, will go into the land that I am going to give you’, he said. 
JOS.1.3	‘I have given you every part of the ground that you walk upon. I promised Moses that I would do this. 
JOS.1.4	You will have all the land from the 
JOS.1.5	No one can stop you from taking this land as long as you live. As I was with Moses, I will always be with you. I will never leave you alone.
JOS.1.6	Be strong and do not be afraid. You will lead these people to take the land. That is the land that I promised to give to their fathers. 
JOS.1.7	Be strong and do not be afraid. Be careful to do all the things that Moses told you. Remember to do everything that he told you. Then everything will go well with you. You will win, everywhere you go. 
JOS.1.8	You must keep on speaking about the words of God's 
JOS.1.9	Remember that I have told you to do this. So be strong and do not be afraid. Do not be weak but be brave. I, the 
JOS.1.10	So Joshua spoke to the leaders of the people. 
JOS.1.11	‘Go through all the places where the people live’, he said. ‘Tell them to get food ready for a journey. In 3 days or less, you will cross the river Jordan to begin to take the land for yourselves. This is the land that the 
JOS.1.12	Moses had given land east of the Jordan to the 
JOS.1.13	‘Remember what Moses, the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, children and animals can stay in this land that Moses gave you, east of the Jordan. But your fighting men must cross the river, with their arms. They must go in front of their brother 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	‘We will do whatever you tell us. And we will go everywhere that you send us’, they answered Joshua.
JOS.1.17	‘As we always obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. The 
JOS.1.18	Someone might not agree with your word. He might not obey it. We will make sure that he dies. But be very strong and be brave. Do not be afraid.’ 
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua sent out two men from Shittim. He sent them in secret to see what the land was like. ‘Go’, he said, ‘Look at all the country, and look well at the city of Jericho’. When they came to the city, they went into the house of Rahab. They stayed there. She was a woman who had men to stay with her.
JOS.2.2	People spoke to the king of Jericho, ‘Look! Some of the people of Israel have come here tonight to see what our land is like’, they said. 
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab. ‘Bring out the men who are staying in your house. They have come to see what all our land is like!’ he said.
JOS.2.4	But the woman had hidden the two men. ‘Yes, some men did come to me. I did not know where they had come from’, she said. 
JOS.2.5	‘When it was getting near the time to close the gate of the city, they left. I do not know where they went. If you go after them quickly, you may catch them.’ 
JOS.2.6	(But she had taken them up to the roof. She had hidden them under some plants that she was drying there.) 
JOS.2.7	So the king's men went out to try to find the two 
JOS.2.8	Rahab went up to the roof. She spoke to the men as they prepared to sleep. 
JOS.2.9	‘I know that the 
JOS.2.10	We heard how you came out of Egypt. And the 
JOS.2.11	When we heard all this, we felt very weak. We were very frightened. This is because the 
JOS.2.12	Now, please make me a promise. I have been kind to you. So, say that you will be kind to my family. As you believe in the 
JOS.2.13	Show me that you will save the lives of my family. Save my mother, father, brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them. Please do not let anyone kill us.’
JOS.2.14	‘We will give you your life if you save ours. Do not tell the king about us. When the 
JOS.2.15	So Rahab put a 
JOS.2.16	‘Go to the hills’, she told them. ‘The men who are looking for you will not find you there. Hide there for 3 days until they return here. Then you can go back to your people.’
JOS.2.17	‘We will keep the promise that we have given to you’, the men said to her. 
JOS.2.18	‘This is what you must do. Tie this red 
JOS.2.19	If anyone goes out into the street, he may die. That will be his own bad mistake. And you will know that we kept our promise. But if anyone in the house with you dies, then we should be 
JOS.2.20	It would be different if you told anyone about this. Then we would not have to keep the promise that we have given you.’ 
JOS.2.21	Rahab agreed with the men, and sent them away. When they had gone, she tied the red 
JOS.2.22	The two 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed the river Jordan. They went to Joshua. They told him everything that had happened. 
JOS.2.24	‘We are sure that the 
JOS.3.1	Early in the morning, Joshua and all the 
JOS.3.2	Three days later, their leaders went to every 
JOS.3.3	‘You will see the 
JOS.3.4	They will show you the way to go because you have never been here before. But stay about 1000 metres behind the 
JOS.3.5	Joshua told the people to make themselves 
JOS.3.6	‘Take up the 
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	The 
JOS.3.9	Joshua said to the 
JOS.3.10	Your God is alive. He is going to show you that he is with you. He will show you how powerful he is. He will certainly push the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites from this land. 
JOS.3.11	See the 
JOS.3.12	Now choose 12 men, one from each 
JOS.3.13	The 
JOS.3.14	So the 
JOS.3.15	There was a lot of water coming down the river at that time of the year. But as soon as the 
JOS.3.16	the water stopped coming. It stopped a long way up the river, at a town called Adam near Zarethan. The water going down to the Salt Sea stopped completely. So, the people crossed the river near Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	While the people walked across on dry ground, the 
JOS.4.1	When all the people of Israel had crossed the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	‘Choose 12 men from the people, one from each 
JOS.4.3	‘Tell them to take up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan. Take them from where the 
JOS.4.4	So Joshua called the 12 men that he had chosen, one from each 
JOS.4.5	He said to them, ‘Go in front of the 
JOS.4.6	This will be like a special mark for you. In years to come, your children will ask you, “What do these stones mean?” 
JOS.4.7	Then you will tell them that the waters of the river Jordan stopped moving. That was while the 
JOS.4.8	So the 12 men obeyed Joshua. They took 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan as the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua also put 12 stones from the Jordan in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the 
JOS.4.10	The 
JOS.4.10	The people crossed the river quickly. 
JOS.4.11	As soon as everybody was on the other side, the 
JOS.4.12	The 
JOS.4.13	About 40,000 men, ready to fight, crossed to the flat land near Jericho. 
JOS.4.14	This is what the 
JOS.4.15	Then the 
JOS.4.16	‘Tell the 
JOS.4.17	So Joshua said to the 
JOS.4.18	And the 
JOS.4.19	The people went from the Jordan and put their 
JOS.4.20	At Gilgal, Joshua put the 12 stones that they had taken out of the Jordan. 
JOS.4.21	He said to the people of Israel, ‘Your children will ask, in later years, “What do these stones mean?” 
JOS.4.22	Then you must tell them, “Israel went across the river Jordan on dry ground.” 
JOS.4.23	The 
JOS.4.24	He did this so that all the peoples of the world would see how powerful he was. He did it so that you would always 
JOS.5.1	All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan, and all the Canaanite kings heard how the 
JOS.5.2	The 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made the knives and 
JOS.5.4	All the men who came out of Egypt had died. So Joshua did this. All the men old enough to fight had died in the 
JOS.5.5	All the people who came out of Egypt had been 
JOS.5.6	The 
JOS.5.7	Joshua 
JOS.5.8	All of them were 
JOS.5.9	The 
JOS.5.9	So, the place was called Gilgal and it still has that name. (Gilgal means ‘taken away’.)
JOS.5.10	The 
JOS.5.11	The next day they ate food grown in Canaan for the first time. They ate dry seed and flat bread. 
JOS.5.12	The ‘
JOS.5.13	While Joshua was near Jericho, a man appeared, standing in front of him. The man had a sword (a sharp metal stick to fight with) in his hand. Joshua went up to him, ‘Are you one of our soldiers, or an enemy?’ he asked.
JOS.5.14	‘I am neither’, he answered. ‘I am here as the captain of the 
JOS.5.14	Joshua fell on the ground to 
JOS.5.15	The captain of the 
JOS.6.1	The people of Jericho kept their gates shut. They watched to see that the 
JOS.6.2	‘I am going to give you Jericho’, the 
JOS.6.3	You and all your soldiers must march round the city once each day, for 6 days. 
JOS.6.4	Seven (7) 
JOS.6.5	Then they will make one long loud noise. As soon as you hear this, all the men must give a loud shout. The city walls will fall down. Then the whole army will go straight into the city.’ 
JOS.6.6	Joshua called the 
JOS.6.7	He told the people to start marching round the city, with a group of fighting men going in front of the 
JOS.6.8	Joshua finished speaking to the people. Then the 7 
JOS.6.9	Some strong fighting men went in front of the 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua had said to the people, ‘Do not shout or make a noise. Do not say a word until I tell you to shout. I will tell you to shout one day, then shout!’ 
JOS.6.11	Joshua made them carry the 
JOS.6.12	Joshua got up early the next morning, and the 
JOS.6.13	The 7 
JOS.6.14	This is how they marched round the city on the second day. They did this once and returned to their 
JOS.6.15	On the 7th day they got up at dawn and marched round the city in the same way, but for 7 times. 
JOS.6.16	The 7th time, the 
JOS.6.17	The city and all that is in it belongs to the 
JOS.6.18	Keep away from the things that belong to God. If you take any of them, you will die. You would make trouble for the people of Israel, and could cause the 
JOS.6.19	All the things made of 
JOS.6.20	When the 
JOS.6.21	They gave the city to the 
JOS.6.22	Joshua spoke to the two men that Rahab had hidden. ‘Go into her house. Bring her out with all who are with her’, he said. ‘This is what you promised to her.’ 
JOS.6.23	So the young men who had been to look at the city went and brought out Rahab and her whole family. They brought out her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They gave them a place outside the 
JOS.6.24	Then they burned the whole city and everything in it. They put the gold, 
JOS.6.25	But Joshua saved Rahab and her family and all who belonged to her. Joshua had sent to find out about the city. And Rahab had hidden those men. She still lives among the 
JOS.6.26	At that time, Joshua made this serious promise. ‘The 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	The people of Israel did not do as God had told them through Joshua. Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zimri, son of Zerah of the 
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua had sent men from Jericho to Ai. This is a city near to Beth Aven, and east of Bethel. He said to them, ‘Go up and look at the land near there, in secret.’ So, the men went to see what they could find out.
JOS.7.3	The men came and spoke to Joshua. ‘There are not many men there. Do not make all the people tired. 2000 or 3000 men should be enough to take the city.’ 
JOS.7.4	So about 3000 men went up to Ai. But the men of Ai made them run away. 
JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai killed about 36 of the 
JOS.7.6	Joshua tore his clothes to show that he was very sad. He fell with his face to the ground in front of the 
JOS.7.7	‘
JOS.7.8	, what can I say now that the enemies of Israel have won the fight? 
JOS.7.9	The Canaanites and other 
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has 
JOS.7.12	That is why the 
JOS.7.13	‘Get up. Tell the people to make themselves 
JOS.7.14	So tell them that in the morning they will come before me, one 
JOS.7.15	I will choose the man who has taken the things. Then you will burn him with the things that he has taken. You are to burn him and all that he has and all his family. He has caused great trouble to Israel. He made them ashamed, because he did not obey me.’ 
JOS.7.16	Early the next morning, Joshua made the 
JOS.7.17	Groups of the 
JOS.7.18	Joshua made each man of the family of Zimri come in front of him, and the 
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua spoke to Achan. ‘My son’, he said, ‘give 
JOS.7.20	Achan replied, ‘It is true! I have 
JOS.7.21	I found a beautiful coat from Babylon and about two kilos of 
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent people with a message. They ran to the 
JOS.7.23	They took the things from the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all the people took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the coat, the gold and the 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, ‘Why did you cause us so much trouble? The 
JOS.7.26	They put many big stones over him, that are still there. That is why the place is still called ‘Trouble Valley’. Then the 
JOS.8.1	Then the 
JOS.8.2	You must destroy the city and its king as you did Jericho and its king. But this time you may take their good things and all their animals for yourselves. Hide some of your men behind the city.’ 
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose 30,000 of the best fighting men and sent them out by night. 
JOS.8.4	‘Listen with great care’, he said. ‘You are to go and hide behind the city. Stay near to it. Be sure to stay awake! 
JOS.8.5	I will march towards the city with all the other soldiers. The men will come out of the city to fight us, as they did before. Then we will run away. 
JOS.8.6	They will run after us, until we have gone from the city. They will say, “They are running away from us, as they did before”. So, when we run from them, 
JOS.8.7	you must get out from your hiding place. You will take the city. The 
JOS.8.8	When you have taken the city, start to burn it. Do what the 
JOS.8.9	Then Joshua sent the men off. They went to wait and hide to the west of Ai, between Bethel and Ai. But Joshua stayed with the people that night.
JOS.8.10	Early the next morning, Joshua took all the men together to march towards Ai. He and the leaders of Israel went in front. 
JOS.8.11	The whole army marched up to the city and stopped in front of it. They put their 
JOS.8.12	Joshua had hidden about 5000 men to the west of the city, between Bethel and Ai. 
JOS.8.13	All the soldiers took their places, ready to fight. Some were north of the city, by their 
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw Joshua's men, the king and his men hurried out of the city. It was early in the morning. They wanted to meet Israel at the same place as before. And they wanted to fight Israel there. But the king of Ai did not know that there were 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and his army let the men of Ai push them back, and they ran towards the 
JOS.8.16	The king told all the men of Ai to run after them. So they ran after Israel and away from their city. 
JOS.8.17	Not one man remained in Ai or Bethel. They all ran after the 
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.18	So Joshua held out his throwing stick towards Ai.
JOS.8.19	As soon as he did this, the men hiding behind the city came out at once. They quickly ran into the city. They took it and immediately made it burn. 
JOS.8.20	The men of Ai looked back and saw smoke rise over the city. But they could not run away. The 
JOS.8.21	Joshua and his army had seen that they had taken the city. The men that he had hidden had taken it. Joshua's army saw the smoke from the burning city. So they turned round and began to fight the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	The 
JOS.8.23	The only person that they did not kill was the king of Ai. They took him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	The 
JOS.8.25	All the men and women of Ai died on that day. 12,000 people died then. 
JOS.8.26	Joshua had kept pointing his throwing stick at Ai until his army had killed every person who lived there. 
JOS.8.27	But the 
JOS.8.28	Joshua burnt the city and broke it down. It is still like that today. 
JOS.8.29	He hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left his body there until evening. At sunset, Joshua told them to cut the body down and throw it in front of the city gate. They covered it with many stones. These stones are still there today.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an 
JOS.8.31	He made it as Moses had told the 
JOS.8.32	The 
JOS.8.33	All the 
JOS.8.34	Then Joshua read the whole 
JOS.8.35	Joshua read every word to the people of Israel. Moses had told him what to read. Joshua read it to the whole people, including the women, children and the foreign people who lived with them. 
JOS.9.1	When all the kings who lived west of the Jordan heard about these things, they joined together. They were the kings in the hills to the west, and all the places near the Great Sea, as far as Lebanon. (They were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.) 
JOS.9.2	They joined together to fight Joshua and Israel.
JOS.9.3	The people of Gibeon heard about what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai. 
JOS.9.4	So they had a clever idea. Some of their men put old bags of food and broken and mended skins of wine (a drink) on their donkeys (animals like small horses for carrying things). 
JOS.9.5	They had old mended shoes on their feet, and they wore old clothes. The bread that they took for food was dry. It was going bad. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to Joshua in the 
JOS.9.7	But the men of Israel answered the Hivites, ‘Perhaps you live close to us. How then can we make a promise not to destroy you?’
JOS.9.8	‘We want to 
JOS.9.8	‘Who are you? Where do you come from?’ Joshua asked.
JOS.9.9	They answered, ‘Your servants have come from a country a very long way away. We heard about your great God. We have heard all about the things that he did in Egypt. 
JOS.9.10	And we heard what he did to the two kings of the Amorites. Those kings ruled cities east of the Jordan. They were Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan. They ruled in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	Our leaders and the people of our land told us to come to see you. Our leaders said, “Take food and wine (a drink) for your journey. Go to meet them, and speak to them. Say to them, ‘We want to 
JOS.9.12	This bread of ours was warm when we put it in our bags. That was on the day that we left home to come to you. But see how bad and dry it has become. 
JOS.9.13	And these skins of wine (a drink) were new, but see how old and mended they are. And our clothes are now old, and our shoes are very thin and mended. They have become old as we made our long journey.’
JOS.9.14	The men of Israel looked at the food and other things, but they did not ask the 
JOS.9.15	Then Joshua agreed that they would not kill the people of Gibeon. The leaders of Israel also said that they would keep Joshua's promise.
JOS.9.16	So Joshua and the 
JOS.9.17	The 
JOS.9.18	The 
JOS.9.18	All the people of Israel were angry with their leaders. 
JOS.9.19	The leaders said to them, ‘We have promised the 
JOS.9.20	But this is what we will do. We will let them live, so that God will not 
JOS.9.21	Let them live, but make them cut wood and carry water for us’, they said. This is how the leaders kept their promise to the Gibeonites.
JOS.9.22	Joshua told the Gibeonites to come to him. ‘Why did you tell me those lies? You said that you lived a long way from us. But you really live near to us’, he said. 
JOS.9.23	‘Now you will be 
JOS.9.24	They answered Joshua, ‘The 
JOS.9.25	You must decide what to do with us. Do what you think is right and good.’
JOS.9.26	So Joshua did not let the 
JOS.9.27	They made the Gibeonites cut wood and fetch water for them. And they would do this for the 
JOS.10.1	The king of Jerusalem, Adoni-Zedek, heard what Joshua had done to Ai and to Jericho and to their kings. He heard that Joshua had destroyed them. He also heard that Israel had promised not to kill the people of Gibeon. They lived near to Joshua
JOS.10.2	The king and his people were very afraid, because Gibeon was an important city. It was like a king's city and bigger than Ai. All its men fought well. 
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, asked some other kings to come with him to attack Gibeon. They were Hoham, king of Hebron, Piram, king of Jarmuth, Japhia, king of Lachish and Debir, king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.4	Adoni-Zedek said to them, ‘Gibeon has promised not to fight Joshua and the 
JOS.10.5	Then the 5 kings of the Amorites joined together. They were the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. They took their soldiers near to Gibeon, and attacked it.
JOS.10.6	Then the Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua in the 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua marched his whole army up from Gilgal. He included all his best fighting men. 
JOS.10.8	The 
JOS.10.9	They marched all night from Gilgal, and Joshua surprised his enemies. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	The 
JOS.10.12	Joshua stood in front of Israel and spoke to the 
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until Israel had 
JOS.10.13	The sun stopped in the middle of the sky, and did not go down for about a whole day. 
JOS.10.14	The 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua and all Israel went back to the 
JOS.10.16	Now the 5 kings had run away. They had hidden in a hole in the hill at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	Joshua heard that they were hiding there. 
JOS.10.18	He said to his men, ‘Cover the front of the hole with big stones. And put some men there to keep them safe. 
JOS.10.19	But do not stop. Go on running after your enemies. Attack them from behind, and do not let them reach their cities. Remember that the 
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the 
JOS.10.21	The whole army returned to Joshua in the 
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, ‘Take away the stones from the hole in the hill. Bring the 5 kings out to me.’ 
JOS.10.23	So they brought out the kings. They were the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	They brought the kings to Joshua, and he told the men of Israel to come to him. ‘Put your feet on the necks of the kings’, he said to the officers who had come with him. They did as he told them.
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. Be very strong and brave. This is what the 
JOS.10.26	Then he hit and killed the kings. The 
JOS.10.27	At sunset, Joshua told his men to take the kings down from the trees. ‘Throw them into the hole in the hill where they were hiding’, he said. They put big stones over the front of the hole, and they are still there.
JOS.10.28	That day Joshua attacked Makkedah and took it, with its king. He destroyed everyone in it. He did not leave anyone alive. He did to the king of Makkedah what he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	After this, Joshua and his army went on from Makkedah to Libnah, and attacked it. 
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	After this, Joshua and all the 
JOS.10.32	The 
JOS.10.33	King Horam of Gezer came to help Lachish. But Joshua fought and destroyed him and his army. He killed them all.
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua and his army went from Lachish to Eglon. They went round it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.35	They took it on the same day. They killed everyone in that city, as they had at Lachish.
JOS.10.36	After this, Joshua and his army went from Eglon to Hebron in the hills. They attacked 
JOS.10.37	and took it. They killed the king and all the people there, and the people in the towns near to it. Joshua destroyed the whole city, as he had done to Eglon. He did not leave anyone alive.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and his army went back to Debir and attacked it
JOS.10.39	He attacked it and took it with all the towns near to it. They killed everyone there. Joshua did to Debir and its king what he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua took the whole land. He took the hill country, the hills of the east and the west and the dry country in the south. He took them with their kings. He killed all the people who lived there. He did not leave anyone alive. The 
JOS.10.41	Joshua had fought from Kadesh Barnea in the south to Gaza near the sea. This included all of Goshen as far as Gibeon in the north. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua won this long list of fights with all these kings and their cities. He won them because the 
JOS.10.43	After this, Joshua and his army went back to the 
JOS.11.1	Jabin, king of Hazor, heard what had happened. So, he sent messengers (people with a message) to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the kings of Shimron and of Acshaph. 
JOS.11.2	And he sent to the kings of the mountains in the north, in the Arabah, south of Kinnereth. And he sent messengers to the little hills in the west, and Naphoth Dor on the west. 
JOS.11.3	Messengers went to the Canaanites in the east and in the west. They went to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hills. And he sent them to the Hivites who lived by Hermon near Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	All these kings came with their soldiers and many horses and 
JOS.11.5	The kings all joined together and made a 
JOS.11.6	‘Do not be afraid of them’, the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all his army went to fight them at the Waters of Merom. They quickly attacked them 
JOS.11.8	and the 
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as the 
JOS.11.10	Then Joshua went back and took Hazor. He killed its king. (Hazor had been most important 
JOS.11.11	The 
JOS.11.12	Joshua took all these cities and killed all their kings. He destroyed them all, as the 
JOS.11.13	But Israel did not burn all the cities built on small hills, except Hazor. Joshua did burn this one. 
JOS.11.14	The 
JOS.11.15	The 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all these places. He took the hills, the dry country in the south, all of Goshen and the little hills in the west. He took the Arabah and the mountains and hills of Israel. 
JOS.11.17	These were from 
JOS.11.18	Joshua was fighting these kings for a very long time. 
JOS.11.19	He only left alive the Hivites living in Gibeon, because he had made them a promise. 
JOS.11.20	The 
JOS.11.21	Joshua went at that time to fight the Anakites from the hills. They came from Hebron, Debir and Anab and all the hills of Judah and Israel. Joshua destroyed them all, and all their towns. 
JOS.11.22	He killed all the Anakites in Israel, except for a few in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole country, as the 
JOS.11.23	Then the people did not have to fight any more. 
JOS.12.1	Israel killed these kings. They destroyed them and took their land. It was east of the Jordan, from the Arnon valley to 
JOS.12.2	Sihon, king of the Amorites, was king of Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer by the middle of the Arnon valley to the Jabbok River. This is near the land of the Ammonites. It included half of Gilead. 
JOS.12.3	Sihon ruled the east of the Arabah from the sea of Kinnereth to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea). And he ruled as far as Beth Jeshimoth and to where 
JOS.12.4	Og, king of Bashan, was one of the last Rephaites. He ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
JOS.12.5	And he ruled 
JOS.12.6	Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	Joshua and the 
JOS.12.8	This was in the hills and in the little hills in the west. And they ruled the Arabah, the sides of the mountains, and the 
JOS.12.9	They took the land of the kings of Jericho, Ai (near Bethel), 
JOS.12.10	Jerusalem, Hebron, 
JOS.12.11	Jarmuth and Lachish. 
JOS.12.12	And they took the land of the kings of Eglon, Gezer, 
JOS.12.13	Debir, Geder, 
JOS.12.14	Hormah, Arad, 
JOS.12.15	Libnah, Adullam, 
JOS.12.16	Makkedah and Bethel. 
JOS.12.17	And they took the land of the kings of Tappuah, Hepher, 
JOS.12.18	Aphek, Lasharon, 
JOS.12.19	Madon, Hazor, 
JOS.12.20	Shimron Meron and Acshaph. 
JOS.12.21	They also took Taanach, Megiddo, 
JOS.12.22	Kedesh, Jokneam in Carmel, 
JOS.12.23	Dor (in Naphoth Dor), Goyim in Gilgal, 
JOS.12.24	and Tirzah. They took all the land of these 31 kings. 
JOS.13.1	Joshua was very old and had lived for many years. The 
JOS.13.2	There is all the land of the Philistines and Geshurites 
JOS.13.3	and of the Avvim on the south. (The land from the Shihor river east of Egypt to the edge of Ekron's land on the north was part of Canaan. The Philistines lived in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.) 
JOS.13.4	You must take all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah, (which belonged to the people of Sidon). This is the land as far as Aphek, by the edge of the land of the Amorites. 
JOS.13.5	You have to take the land of the Gebalites and all of Lebanon to the east. That is from Baal Gad below 
JOS.13.6	The 
JOS.13.7	Each of the 9 
JOS.13.8	Moses had already given land to the Reubenites, Gadites and the other half of Manasseh. It was east of the Jordan, as Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.13.9	It was from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon valley and the town in the middle of the valley. It included all the flat land of Medeba to Dibon. 
JOS.13.10	And it included all the towns of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. It went to the edge of the land of the Amorites
JOS.13.11	It included the land of Gilead, and of the people of Geshur and Maacah. And it included all of 
JOS.13.12	(That was the 
JOS.13.13	But the 
JOS.13.14	Moses had given no land to the 
JOS.13.15	This is the part of the land that Moses gave to the families of the Reubenites.
JOS.13.16	He gave them the land from Aroer by the edge of the Arnon valley and the town in the middle of the valley. 
JOS.13.17	And he gave them all of the flat land past Medeba in Heshbon. It included Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz and Kedemoth. And it included Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah and Zereth Shahar. Zereth was on a hill in the middle of the valley. 
JOS.13.20	Moses gave Beth Peor, and the sides of 
JOS.13.21	And he gave them all the towns on the flat land. He gave them all the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites. Sihon had ruled from Hebron. But Moses had won the fight with him, and the Midianite kings, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba. These kings had lived in that place, and ruled with Sihon. 
JOS.13.22	The 
JOS.13.23	The end of the land of the Reubenites was by the river Jordan. Moses gave these towns and their villages to the 
JOS.13.24	This is the land that Moses gave to the 
JOS.13.25	He gave them the land of Jazer, the towns of Gilead and half the land of the Ammonites. 
JOS.13.26	This was from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the land of Debir. 
JOS.13.27	Moses gave Gad the towns in the valley: Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth and Zaphon. He gave them the rest of the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon. (This was on the east of the Jordan, to the end of the sea of Kinnereth.) 
JOS.13.28	Moses gave these towns and villages to the 
JOS.13.29	This is the land that Moses gave to half the 
JOS.13.30	He gave them the land from Mahanaim, the land of Bashan, all the land ruled by Og, king of Bashan. It included all the 60 towns of Jair in Bashan. 
JOS.13.31	And it included half of Gilead, Ashtaroth and Edrei. (These were the cities that belonged to Og in Bashan.) This was for half the sons of Makir, son of Manasseh, family by family.
JOS.13.32	Moses gave land to these 
JOS.13.33	Moses gave no land to the 
JOS.14.1	Eleazar the 
JOS.14.2	The leaders used 
JOS.14.3	Moses had already given the two and a half 
JOS.14.4	(The 
JOS.14.5	The leaders of the 
JOS.14.6	Some of the men of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb, son of Jephunneh, spoke to Joshua. He said, ‘You know what the 
JOS.14.7	I was 40 years old when Moses sent me from there to explore the land. And I brought him a report that was true, and I was sure that we could take the land. 
JOS.14.8	The other men who went with us made the people afraid. But I did only what the 
JOS.14.9	So Moses made me a promise on that day. Moses said, “The land that your feet have walked on will always belong to you and to your children. This is because you have done everything as the 
JOS.14.10	Caleb said to Joshua, ‘The 
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong as I was on the day that Moses sent me out. I can fight as well now as I could then. 
JOS.14.12	Now then, give to me this hill country that the 
JOS.14.13	Then Joshua 
JOS.14.14	So Hebron has belonged to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite since that day. He had done everything as the 
JOS.14.15	(Hebron had been called ‘Kiriath Arba’ after Arba, the most important man among the Anakites.)
JOS.14.15	The fighting in the land ended after this.
JOS.15.1	Joshua gave the land from the edge of Edom to the 
JOS.15.2	The south edge of Judah's land was from the south end of the Salt Sea, 
JOS.15.3	across the south side of the Scorpion valley, to Zin. He also gave them land south of Kadesh Barnea, as far as Hebron. The edge of their land continued past Addar, round to Karka 
JOS.15.4	and to Azmon. The dry valley of Egypt leading to the sea was the south edge of Judah.
JOS.15.5	The Salt Sea was the edge of Judah to the east as far as the mouth of the river Jordan.
JOS.15.5	The north edge of Judah was from the mouth of the Jordan 
JOS.15.6	to Beth Hoglah. Then it went north of Beth Arabah to the stone of Bohan. (Bohan was the son of Reuben.) 
JOS.15.7	The edge of Judah's land went from the valley of Achor to Debir. Then it went north to Gilgal. Gilgal is opposite the path of Adummim on the south side of the valley. The edge of Judah then reached to the water 
JOS.15.8	From there it went through the valley of Hinnom to the south side of a hill by the Jebusite city of Jerusalem. The edge of Judah continued to the top of the hill on the west side of the Hinnom valley. This was at the north end of the valley of Rephaim. 
JOS.15.9	From there it went to the 
JOS.15.10	From there it went round Baalah towards the hills of Edom. It went north of 
JOS.15.11	The edge of Judah went out to the hills north of Ekron, then towards Shikkeron. It went past 
JOS.15.12	The sea was the west edge of Judah's land.
JOS.15.12	The families of the 
JOS.15.13	The 
JOS.15.14	Caleb pushed out the 3 sons of Anak from Hebron. Their names were Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. 
JOS.15.15	From there he marched to fight the people of Debir (also called Kiriath Sepher). 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, ‘If a man attacks and takes Kiriath Sepher, he can marry my daughter, Acsah.’ 
JOS.15.17	Othniel was the son of Caleb's brother, Kenaz. He took Kiriath Sepher, so Caleb gave him his daughter to marry.
JOS.15.18	Acsah spoke to Othniel one day. She wanted him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey (an animal like a small horse). ‘What can I do for you?’ Caleb asked her.
JOS.15.19	‘Be very kind to me’, she said. ‘You have given me land in the dry country in the south, so please will you give me some 
JOS.15.20	This is the land that Joshua gave to the families of the 
JOS.15.21	The towns in the south of Judah were near the edge of Edom. They were:

JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain and Rimmon. He gave them 29 towns with their villages.

JOS.16.1	Joshua gave some land east of Jericho to the 
JOS.16.2	The edge of their land went from Bethel (that is, Luz) to the land of the Arkites in Ataroth. 
JOS.16.3	Their land continued to the west, to the land of the Japhletites by lower Beth Horon. It ended near the sea, by Gezer. 
JOS.16.4	Joshua gave this land to Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph. It was for them and their families.
JOS.16.5	Joshua gave this land to the families of Ephraim:
JOS.16.5	The edge of their land was from Ataroth Addar in the east to Beth Horon. 
JOS.16.6	Then it continued to the west. Michmethath was north of their land. East of Michmethath, the edge of their land went past Taanath Shiloh on the east to Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	From there it went to Ataroth and Naarah and through Jericho to the river Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah, the edge of their land continued to the west to the little river Kanah. From there, it continued to the sea. Joshua gave all this land to the families of the 
JOS.16.9	He also gave them some towns and villages that were in the land of Manasseh. 
JOS.16.10	But the 
JOS.17.1	Joshua gave part of the land west of the river Jordan to some families of the 
JOS.17.2	He gave land west of the Jordan to all the other families of Manasseh. These were: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. They were all sons of Manasseh, and heads of their families.

JOS.17.6	They gave some daughters of Manasseh land as well as his sons. They gave the land of Gilead to the rest of the families of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The edge of the land of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath east of Shechem. It went south to include En Tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	Manasseh had the land near Tappuah, but the town of Tappuah belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	The edge of Manasseh's land went down to the little river of Kanah. The cities south of the river that belonged to Ephraim were in Manasseh's land. The edge of Manasseh's land was along the north side of the river to the sea. 
JOS.17.10	Ephraim was south of the river, and Manasseh to the north. The sea was to the west of them both. Asher was north and west of them, and Issachar to the north and east. 
JOS.17.11	Beth Shan and Ibleam and the towns near them that belonged to Manasseh were in the lands of Issachar and Asher. Dor (by the sea), Endor, Taanach, Megiddo and the towns near them also belonged to Manasseh. 
JOS.17.12	But the people of Manasseh could not push out the people who lived in those cities. So the Canaanite people went on living there. 
JOS.17.13	Some of them continued to live there, even when the people of Israel became strong. But the 
JOS.17.14	Joseph's sons asked Joshua, ‘Why have you given us only one part of the land to live in? The 
JOS.17.15	Joshua said to them, ‘If there are so many of you, and the hills of Ephraim are too small for you, take more land. Cut down trees in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.’
JOS.17.16	They replied, ‘The hills are not big enough for us. But the Canaanites in Beth Shan and its towns and in the valley of Jezreel have iron 
JOS.17.17	Joshua said to the 
JOS.17.18	You will have the hills. They are full of trees, but you will cut them down. You will take the land from one end to the other. I know that the Canaanites are a strong people. They have iron 
JOS.18.1	All the people of Israel met together at Shiloh. There they put up the 
JOS.18.2	But Joshua still had not given 7 
JOS.18.3	Joshua asked them, ‘The 
JOS.18.4	Choose 3 men from each 
JOS.18.5	You must make it into 7 parts. Judah is to stay in its land to the south, and Joseph's people are to remain in their land in the north. 
JOS.18.6	You must write down what each of the 7 parts look like. Then I will ask God to help me to choose which part I will give to each 
JOS.18.7	The 
JOS.18.8	The chosen men started to go to describe the land. ‘Go and look at the land. Write down what you find’, Joshua told them. ‘Then come back to me in Shiloh. I will use the 
JOS.18.9	So the men left and went all through the land. They wrote about each town in a book. They wrote about each of the 7 parts of the land. Then they went back to Joshua in the 
JOS.18.10	At Shiloh, Joshua stood in front of the 
JOS.18.11	The

JOS.18.13	The edge of their land went on to the south of Luz (that is Bethel) to Ataroth Addar. That is on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
JOS.18.14	From this hill, the edge of their land went south along the west side to Kiriath Baal (that is Kiriath Jearim). This town belonged to the people of Judah. This was the west edge of Benjamin's land.

JOS.19.47	(But the people of Dan could not take their land, so they went to attack Leshem. They took it and killed its people and lived there themselves. They called the city Dan, after their father.)
JOS.19.48	Joshua gave these towns and their villages to the families of Dan's 
JOS.19.49	When Joshua had given all the 
JOS.19.50	This is what the 
JOS.19.51	This is the list of all the lands that they gave to each 
JOS.20.1	Then the 
JOS.20.2	He said, ‘Tell the people of Israel to choose special cities. I told you this through Moses. 
JOS.20.3	Anyone can be safe in these cities if he has killed someone. But he will only be safe if he had not meant to kill that person. The person who killed a man or woman can run to that city. The person will be safe. They will not let the brother of the dead person kill him there (Numbers 35:6-34). 
JOS.20.4	The man who killed someone must go to the city. When he arrives, he must stand in the gate of the city. There he must tell the leaders what he has done. Then they must let him go in. And they must give him a place to live and stay there. 
JOS.20.5	The brother of the dead person may follow the man who killed his brother or sister. The leaders must not let the brother hurt that man. This is because he did not mean to kill the dead man. He did not want to hurt him. 
JOS.20.6	The man who killed must stay in that city. He may have told them what is true. The 
JOS.20.7	So they chose these towns: Kedesh in Galilee, in the hills of Naphtali, Shechem in the hills of Ephraim, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hills of Judah.
JOS.20.8	They chose other cities east of the river Jordan and to the east of the flat land near Jericho: Bezer in the flat 
JOS.20.9	Any 
JOS.21.1	The fathers of the 
JOS.21.2	They met at Shiloh in Canaan. ‘The 
JOS.21.3	So the 
JOS.21.4	They gave towns first to the Kohathite family. They gave them 13 towns from the 
JOS.21.5	They gave to the other Kohathites, towns from the 
JOS.21.6	Then they gave 13 towns to the family of Gershon. The 
JOS.21.7	They gave 12 towns to the families of Merari. The 
JOS.21.8	So the people of Israel gave these towns and the land and fields near to them to the families of Levi's 
JOS.21.9	These are the names of the towns that the 
JOS.21.10	They gave them to the Kohathites, of Aaron's family, because God chose them first.
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath Arba (or Hebron), with land near to it, in the hills of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.) 
JOS.21.12	But the fields and villages near Hebron belonged to Caleb, son of Jephunneh. 
JOS.21.13	So they gave the city of Hebron (a safe city) to the sons of Aaron. They also gave them Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh with their land and fields. These two 
JOS.21.17	They gave them Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth and Almon with their fields. These 4 towns were from the 
JOS.21.19	They gave the 
JOS.21.20	They gave to the 
JOS.21.21	They gave them Shechem, a safe city, in the hills of Ephraim, and Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim and Beth Horon with their fields. They gave them 4 towns. 
JOS.21.23	The 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon. They gave them these 4 towns with their fields. 
JOS.21.25	The half 
JOS.21.26	They gave the families of Kohath all these 10 cities.
JOS.21.27	They gave the 
JOS.21.28	They gave them 4 cities from the 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth and En Gannim, with their fields. 
JOS.21.30	The 
JOS.21.31	Helkath and Rehob, with their fields. 
JOS.21.32	The 
JOS.21.33	They gave the families of Gershon all these 13 cities.
JOS.21.34	The other 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah and Nahalal. They gave to them 4 towns with their fields.
JOS.21.36	The 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth and Mephaath, with their fields. 
JOS.21.38	The 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon and Jazer, with their fields.
JOS.21.40	So they gave to these 
JOS.21.41	The 
JOS.21.42	Each of these towns had its own fields round it.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	The 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called together the 
JOS.22.2	Joshua said, ‘You have done all that Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	You have helped your brothers, for a long time. You have stayed even to this day. And you have done the work that the 
JOS.22.4	Now your brothers have finished fighting for their land, as the 
JOS.22.5	But you must be very careful to keep the rules and the 
JOS.22.6	Joshua then 
JOS.22.7	(But Joshua had given land on the west side of the Jordan to the other half of the 
JOS.22.8	‘Go back to your homes with the good things that you took from your enemies’, he said. ‘Take many animals, gold and other metals and rich clothes. You and your brothers must each have a part of these things.’
JOS.22.9	So the 
JOS.22.10	The two and a half 
JOS.22.11	When the other 
JOS.22.12	They all came together at Shiloh to fight the two and a half 
JOS.22.13	So the 
JOS.22.14	They sent 10 of the leaders with him. They chose one man from each of the 
JOS.22.15	They spoke to the 
JOS.22.16	They said, ‘You have not obeyed the 
JOS.22.17	The 
JOS.22.18	Now you seem to be doing another thing that is wrong.’
JOS.22.18	The leaders said, ‘You might do something that is wrong today. The 
JOS.22.19	If your land here is not 
JOS.22.20	When Achan, son of Zerah, took things that belonged to God, he became angry with all the people of Israel. Achan was not the only one that died’ (Joshua 7:1).
JOS.22.21	Reuben, Gad and the half 
JOS.22.22	They said, ‘God, the 
JOS.22.23	We did not build our own 
JOS.22.24	They also said, ‘No! We had a very different idea. We were afraid that in later times, your children might speak to ours. They might say, “You have nothing to do with the 
JOS.22.25	The 
JOS.22.26	That is why we said, “Let us build an 
JOS.22.27	But it will help us and you, and our children and your children, to remember to 
JOS.22.28	We said, “If they say this to us, we will answer them. We will say ‘Look at this 
JOS.22.29	We never wanted to turn away from the 
JOS.22.30	Phinehas the 
JOS.22.31	They said to them, ‘You have not done anything that would not please the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the 
JOS.22.33	They were happy to hear about it, and gave thanks to God. They did not talk about fighting them any more. They would not destroy the land where the two and a half 
JOS.22.34	Reuben and Gad gave the 
JOS.23.1	After many years had passed, Joshua was very old. The 
JOS.23.2	Joshua called all the people to him with their leaders, 
JOS.23.3	You, yourselves, have seen what the 
JOS.23.4	Remember how I have given each of your 
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	Be very strong. Do everything that Moses told you to do in his Book of the 
JOS.23.7	Do not become friends of the peoples who are near you. Do not call out to their gods. Do not use their names to show that you mean what you say. You must not 
JOS.23.8	But you must always obey the 
JOS.23.9	The 
JOS.23.10	One of you has sent away 1000 men. This is because the 
JOS.23.11	You must be very careful to love the 
JOS.23.12	Joshua said to all the people:
JOS.23.12	‘But you may turn away to join with other peoples, those that are left among you. Perhaps you will marry some of them, or mix with them. 
JOS.23.13	Then you may be sure that the 
JOS.23.14	Now I am going to die, as all men do. The 
JOS.23.15	The 
JOS.23.16	He will do this if you do not keep the rules that he gave you. If you do not obey the 
JOS.24.1	Joshua called all the 
JOS.24.2	Joshua spoke to the people. He said, ‘This is what the 
JOS.24.3	But I took Abraham from that land and brought him all through Canaan. I gave him many sons and daughters. I gave him Isaac, 
JOS.24.4	and I gave to Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. I gave the hill country of Seir (Edom) to Esau, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
JOS.24.5	I sent Moses and Aaron to the 
JOS.24.6	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you reached the Red Sea. The Egyptians went after them with men on horses and in 
JOS.24.7	But your fathers cried to the 
JOS.24.8	I brought you to the land of the Amorites, east of the river Jordan. They fought you, but I helped you to win the fight. I destroyed them in front of you, and you took their land. 
JOS.24.9	Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, got ready to fight you. When he did this, he asked Balaam, son of Beor, to ask me to hurt you. 
JOS.24.10	But I would not listen to Balaam. So Balaam 
JOS.24.11	Then you went across the Jordan and came to Jericho. You fought with the people of Jericho and with the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites. I helped you to win all those fights. 
JOS.24.12	I made them very afraid of you so they ran away from you. And so did the two kings of the Amorites. You did not do this on your own. 
JOS.24.13	So I gave you a land that you had not worked for. I gave you houses that you did not build. You live in the houses. You eat fruit from plants and trees that you did not plant.” ’
JOS.24.14	Joshua said, ‘Now you must give 
JOS.24.15	But if you do not want to 
JOS.24.16	The people answered Joshua, ‘We would never leave the 
JOS.24.17	We and our fathers were slaves in Egypt. But the 
JOS.24.18	The 
JOS.24.19	Joshua answered them, ‘But you cannot 
JOS.24.20	If you leave the 
JOS.24.21	‘No!’ the people said. ‘We will 
JOS.24.22	Joshua said, ‘You yourselves have chosen to 
JOS.24.22	They replied, ‘Yes, we will watch ourselves with great care.’
JOS.24.23	‘Now then’, Joshua said, ‘throw away the false gods, the gods of other peoples, that you still keep. And give yourselves completely to the 
JOS.24.24	The people said to Joshua, ‘We will 
JOS.24.25	Joshua and the people made these important promises on that day. There at Shechem, he made a list of their rules and 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these things in the Book of the 
JOS.24.27	‘See this stone!’ he said to all the people. ‘It will help you to remember the promise that you have made. It will make you feel bad if you do not obey your God.’
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own part of the land.
JOS.24.29	After this, Joshua died, at the age of 110. 
JOS.24.30	The 
JOS.24.31	The people of Israel 
JOS.24.32	The people of Israel had brought the body of Joseph up from Egypt (Genesis 50:22-26). They buried it at Shechem. This was the land that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Jacob paid them 100 pieces of 
JOS.24.33	Eleazar, son of Aaron, died and people buried him at Gibeah. This was the town in the hills of Ephraim that belonged to his son Phinehas.
JDG.1.1	After Joshua had died, the 
JDG.1.2	God told them to send the people of Judah first. 
JDG.1.3	The men of Judah asked their cousins, the men of Simeon, to help them. They agreed to go together. They would fight for lands for the 
JDG.1.4	At Bezek, the 
JDG.1.5	They found Adoni-Bezek there (the king of Bezek). 
JDG.1.6	He ran away. They followed him and cut off his

JDG.1.8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem. They took and burnt the city and killed the people.
JDG.1.9	After this the men of Judah fought the 
JDG.1.10	They attacked the people of Hebron, that used to be called Kiriath Arba, and beat Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	Then they fought the people who lived in Debir. It was called Kiriath Sepher at that time. 
JDG.1.12	Caleb asked his big family to attack Kiriath Sepher. He promised to give his daughter to the one who took the city. His daughter was called Achsah. 
JDG.1.13	Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, beat Kiriath Sepher. So Caleb gave Achsah to him as a wife. 
JDG.1.14	Othniel told Achsah to ask her father for a field. She got off her 
JDG.1.15	She replied, ‘Father, please give me water for the land that you gave me.’ So Caleb gave her more land. This contained two pools of water.
JDG.1.16	The 
JDG.1.17	Then the men of Judah went with the people of Simeon to attack Zephath. They destroyed the city. They called it Hormah (this means destroyed).
JDG.1.18	The men of Judah also won Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron in the fight. They won the cities and all their land. 
JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	Caleb received Hebron as Moses had promised. He sent away the 3 sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	The people of Benjamin could not send away the 
JDG.1.22	The 
JDG.1.23	Some 
JDG.1.24	They found a man who was leaving the city. They told him that he would be safe. But they said, ‘You must tell us how to get into the city’. 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them. The two 
JDG.1.26	Then the man went to the land of the 
JDG.1.27	But the men of Mannaseh could not send away the peoples of 5 cities. These were Beth Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam and Megiddo. The 
JDG.1.28	When 
JDG.1.29	The people of Ephraim did not send the 
JDG.1.30	Nor did Zebulun send the 
JDG.1.31	Nor did Asher send away the people of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek or Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	Because of this, the people of Asher lived in the land with the 
JDG.1.33	The people of Naphthali did not send away the 
JDG.1.34	The 
JDG.1.35	The 
JDG.1.36	The land of the 
JDG.2.1	The 
JDG.2.2	You must not have a 
JDG.2.3	This is what I will do. I will not send the 
JDG.2.4	When the 
JDG.2.5	They called the place Bokim (people who cry). They offered gifts there to the 
JDG.2.6	Joshua sent the people to go to their land. Each

JDG.2.10	When all the older men had died, younger men became leaders. They forgot the 
JDG.2.11	Then 
JDG.2.12	They did not obey the 
JDG.2.13	because they 
JDG.2.14	So the 
JDG.2.15	 went to fight their enemies. But the 
JDG.2.16	Then the 
JDG.2.17	But the people would not listen to the 
JDG.2.18	When the 
JDG.2.19	But when the 
JDG.2.20	Because of this, the 
JDG.2.21	I will not send the 
JDG.2.22	I will use them to see if you will try to obey me. Your fathers obeyed me’. 
JDG.2.23	Some of the 
JDG.3.1	The 
JDG.3.2	He did this to teach the 
JDG.3.3	These 
JDG.3.4	They were to 
JDG.3.5	The 
JDG.3.6	Some 
JDG.3.7	The 
JDG.3.8	The 
JDG.3.9	When they cried to the 
JDG.3.10	The 
JDG.3.11	So the land of 
JDG.3.12	Once again the 
JDG.3.13	The 
JDG.3.15	Again the 
JDG.3.16	He hid a knife that was sharp on both sides, under his clothes. It was about as long as his arm. He carried the knife against the top of his right leg. 
JDG.3.17	First, he gave the money to king Eglon, who was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	Ehud sent back the men who had carried the money. 
JDG.3.19	At Gilgal, Ehud turned back to see the king. He said, ‘I have a secret message for you, O King!’ The king sent away all his servants. 
JDG.3.20	Then Ehud went near to the king, who was sitting in his big room. There was nobody with him. Ehud said, ‘I have a message from God for you’. The king started to get up. 
JDG.3.21	Then Ehud took the knife in his left hand and pushed it into the king's stomach. The whole knife went in. 
JDG.3.22	The king's fat covered the handle. The point came out behind the king. Ehud did not pull out the knife, and the fat covered it. 
JDG.3.23	Ehud left the room and locked the doors. 
JDG.3.24	The servants came and found the doors locked. They thought that the king was at his toilet. 
JDG.3.25	They waited for a long time. But the king did not open the doors. So they opened them with a key. They saw that their king was dead on the floor. 
JDG.3.26	While they were waiting, Ehud went past the stones that people 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived, he made a loud noise with a 
JDG.3.28	He told them to follow him. He said that the 
JDG.3.29	They killed 10,000 strong 
JDG.3.30	The rest of the 
JDG.3.31	After this, Shamgar, son of Anath, ruled 
JDG.4.1	The 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	He had 900 
JDG.4.4	Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was then leading 
JDG.4.5	She sat under a 
JDG.4.6	Deborah told Barak, son of Abinoam to come to her. He came from Kedesh in Naphtali. She gave him a message from the 
JDG.4.7	I will make Sisera (captain of Jabin's army) go to the Kishon river. He will bring the army and their 
JDG.4.8	Barak said to Deborah, ‘I will go if you will come with me. I will not go unless you come with me’. 
JDG.4.9	Deborah said, ‘Yes, I will go with you. But the 
JDG.4.9	So Deborah went with Barak to Kadesh. 
JDG.4.10	Barak told the men from Zebulun and Naphtali to come to him. He led 10,000 men. And Deborah went with him.
JDG.4.11	Heber, the 
JDG.4.12	They told Sisera that Barak (the son of Abinoam) had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	Sisera and all his soldiers were at Harosheth Haggoyim. They went with 900 iron 
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah told Barak, ‘Go! This day the 
JDG.4.14	So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with his soldiers. 
JDG.4.15	When they came near to Sisera, the 
JDG.4.16	Barak and his men ran after Sisera, his soldiers and his 
JDG.4.17	Sisera ran to Jael's 
JDG.4.18	Jael came out. She asked Sisera to come into the 
JDG.4.19	Sisera asked her for some water. She gave him a drink of milk, and covered him again. 
JDG.4.20	Sisera said, ‘Stand in front of the door. If someone asks if anyone is here, say, “No” ’.
JDG.4.21	But Jael took a sharp stick and a hammer. She hit the stick right through Sisera's head while he was asleep. It went into the ground and he died. 
JDG.4.22	Barak came running after Sisera. Jael went out to meet him. She said, ‘Come and I will show you the man you are looking for’.
JDG.4.22	He went with her and there was Sisera – dead. The stick was through his head. 
JDG.4.23	On that day God made Jabin (the 
JDG.4.24	The 
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak, son of Abinoam, sang this song:
JDG.5.2	‘When the leaders of 
JDG.5.3	Hear this, you kings! Listen you rulers! I will sing to the 
JDG.5.5	The mountains (even Sinai) shook in front of the 
JDG.5.6	The roads were empty in the days of Shamgar, son of Anath. There was no one on them in the days of Jael. People walked on secret paths.
JDG.5.7	Nobody lived in the little towns. No one lived there until I came. I, Deborah, became a mother to 
JDG.5.8	When they chose new gods, there was fighting near the city. No one in 
JDG.5.9	I will make strong the leaders of 
JDG.5.10	Listen, you rich people as you ride on white horses. Listen while you sit on your animals. And listen you that walk along the road.
JDG.5.11	Hear the singing voices, where you stop for water. They speak about all the 
JDG.5.12	Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up and sing. Get up Barak! Lock up your enemies, son of Abinoam.
JDG.5.13	The men who remained went back to their leaders. The people of the 
JDG.5.14	Some came from Ephraim, where Amalek lived. Benjamin followed you. Makir (Manasseh) came too. The leaders of Zebulun came.
JDG.5.15	The leaders of Issachar were with Deborah. Yes, Issachar joined Barak. They ran after him into the valley. Many in Reuben were afraid and did nothing.
JDG.5.16	The men of Reuben stayed with the sheep. Many in Reuben were troubled.
JDG.5.17	Gilead stayed in his land. Dan stayed by the sea. Asher remained near the sea. They hid near its edge.
JDG.5.18	But the people of Zebulun were not afraid to fight. And Naphtali came from the mountains.
JDG.5.19	Kings came and fought. The kings of Canaan fought. They fought at Tannach near the water at Megiddo. But they took no gold or rich gifts.
JDG.5.20	The stars from the sky fought. They fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The very old river Kishon carried away Sisera's soldiers. River Kishon, be strong and do not stop fighting.
JDG.5.22	The horses' feet made a loud noise. They ran fast, their strong legs ran and ran.
JDG.5.23	The 
JDG.5.24	Jael is 
JDG.5.25	He asked for water, and she gave him milk. She brought him milk in a lovely dish.
JDG.5.26	Her hand found the pointed stick. Her right hand took the hammer. She hit Sisera, she hit his head. Her stick went through his head.
JDG.5.27	He fell at her feet. He stayed there and died.
JDG.5.28	Sisera's mother looked out of the window. She cried out as she looked. “His 
JDG.5.29	Her clever ladies replied, and she herself thought:
JDG.5.30	“They are finding riches to bring home and women to please the men. They are finding rich clothes for Sisera. They will find clothes of many colours and win all these riches for him.”’
JDG.5.31	May all your enemies die like Sisera, O 
JDG.5.31	There was no more fighting for 40 years.
JDG.6.1	The 
JDG.6.2	They were very cruel to the 
JDG.6.3	They planted seeds to grow food. But then the 
JDG.6.4	They took all their food, and animals too. They left nothing for 
JDG.6.5	Many enemies came with all their animals. They came like a cloud of insects. They were too many to count. They took everything from the land. 
JDG.6.6	The 
JDG.6.7	The 
JDG.6.8	The 
JDG.6.9	I saved you from being slaves to the 
JDG.6.10	I said to you, ‘I am the 
JDG.6.11	Joash, the 
JDG.6.12	The 
JDG.6.13	Gideon replied, ‘But sir, if the

JDG.6.15	‘But sir’, Gideon asked, ‘How can I save

JDG.6.17	Gideon replied, ‘If I am special to you, please make me sure that you really are the 
JDG.6.18	Please stay here and I will bring you an 
JDG.6.19	Gideon cooked a young goat and made many flat cakes of bread. He used an ephah (34-45 pounds weight) of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the soup in a pot. He gave them to the 
JDG.6.20	God's 
JDG.6.21	The 
JDG.6.22	Gideon knew then that he had been an 
JDG.6.23	But the 
JDG.6.24	So Gideon built an 
JDG.6.25	That same night, the 
JDG.6.26	Build a proper 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took 10 of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	The next day, the men of the town saw that Baal's 
JDG.6.29	They asked each other, ‘Who has done this?’ Then they found that Gideon, son of Joash, had done it.
JDG.6.30	The men of the town told Joash to bring Gideon out to them. They said that Gideon must die because he had destroyed Baal's 
JDG.6.31	Joash replied to the angry men. He said, ‘Are you trying to save Baal? You do not need to save him. If you fight for him, you will die today. If Baal really is a god, he can fight for himself. He will 
JDG.6.32	Then they called Gideon ‘Jerub-Baal’ (Baal must fight for himself). This was because Gideon had broken down Baal's 
JDG.6.33	The 
JDG.6.34	The Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	He sent men to the 
JDG.6.36	Gideon said to God, ‘I want to save 
JDG.6.37	Look, I will put the hair of a sheep out on a dry, stone floor. Please make it wet by the morning, but let the ground stay dry. Then I will know that you will use me’. 
JDG.6.38	That is what happened. The next morning the hair contained enough water to fill a large cup.
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God. ‘Please do not be angry. Let me ask one more thing. This time could you please make the ground wet, but keep the hair dry’. 
JDG.6.40	That night God did so. The ground was wet, but the sheep's hair stayed dry. 
JDG.7.1	Gideon and his men were in 
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Tell the men that they may go back if they are afraid. They may leave Mount Gilead’. So 22,000 men left. But 10,000 remained.
JDG.7.4	The 
JDG.7.5	So Gideon took the men to the water. The 
JDG.7.6	300 men stood and drank from their hands. The other soldiers all went on their knees. 
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	Gideon took the food and 
JDG.7.8	The 
JDG.7.9	That night the 
JDG.7.10	Perhaps you are afraid to fight. Then go down to their camp (tents). Take Purah your servant with you. 
JDG.7.11	Listen to what the 
JDG.7.12	The valley was full of 
JDG.7.13	When Gideon arrived, he heard a man tell his friend about a dream. The man said, ‘I saw a loaf of bread rolling into the 
JDG.7.14	The friend replied, ‘This must be the work of Gideon, the son of Joash. God has given him power to rule us. He will make us all his slaves’.
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard this, he thanked God. He returned to the 
JDG.7.16	He put the 300 men into 3 groups. He gave each man a 
JDG.7.17	‘Watch me’, he said. ‘Follow me. When we get near to their 
JDG.7.18	I and my men will blow our 
JDG.7.19	They reached the 
JDG.7.20	All three groups of 
JDG.7.21	Then all the 
JDG.7.22	When Gideon's men blew the 300 
JDG.7.23	Gideon called 
JDG.7.24	He sent men into the hills of Ephraim. He told them not to let the 
JDG.7.25	They caught 2 of the 
JDG.8.1	The 
JDG.8.2	Gideon said that they had done much more than he had. His part was only small. 
JDG.8.3	God had given them Oreb and Zeeb. Ephraim's part was much bigger than Gideon's. When Gideon said this, the 
JDG.8.4	Gideon and his 300 men were very tired. But they crossed the Jordan and ran after the 
JDG.8.5	He asked the men of Succoth for bread to feed his soldiers. He said that they were tired. But they wanted to catch Zebah and Zalmunna. These were the two Kings of Midian. 
JDG.8.6	The leaders of Succoth said, ‘You have not yet caught Zebah and Zalmunna. We will not give you bread’. 
JDG.8.7	Gideon replied, ‘I will return when I have taken Zebah and Zalmunna. Then I will 
JDG.8.8	Gideon went on to Peniel. He asked their people for bread. But they gave the same answer as the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.9	Gideon said to the men of Peniel, ‘When I have won the fight with my enemies, I will return. Then I will destroy your strongest building’.
JDG.8.10	Zebah and Zalmunna had 15,000 men with them in Karkor. They were the only men left of their great army from the east. 120,000 of their soldiers had died. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon followed a quiet, country path to Karkor. He went east of Nobah and Jogbehah. He made a surprise attack on the army there. 
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna ran away. Gideon ran after the two kings and caught them. The whole 
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon, son of Joash returned towards 
JDG.8.14	He caught a young man from Succoth. He made the young man write the names of 77 leaders. 
JDG.8.15	Gideon showed Zebah and Zalmunna to the men of Succoth. He said, ‘You refused to give us bread because we had not already caught Zebah and Zalmunna’. 
JDG.8.16	He took the leaders of Succoth and beat them with sharp branches. He taught them to do as he told them. 
JDG.8.17	He also destroyed the building at Peniel, and killed the men of the town.
JDG.8.18	Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna what kind of men they had killed at Tabor. The kings answered, ‘Men like you, men who stood like kings’. 
JDG.8.19	Gideon replied, ‘These were my brothers. They were my mother's sons. As sure as the 
JDG.8.20	He turned to his oldest son, Jether. ‘Kill them’, he said. But Jether stood still. He was afraid because he was only a boy. 
JDG.8.21	Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, ‘Kill us yourself. You are strong’. So Gideon went to them and killed them. He took the valuable 
JDG.8.22	The 
JDG.8.23	But Gideon said to them, ‘I will not rule over you. Nor will my son rule over you. The 
JDG.8.24	He said, ‘I will ask for one thing. Will each of you give me one ear-ring from the riches you have taken?’ (The 
JDG.8.25	They answered, ‘We are happy to give them to you’. So they put a coat on the ground. Every man threw a ring on to it. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of all the rings was 1700 shekels (about 40 pounds or 19 kilos in weight). They also had many other valuable things. They had 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made the gold into a beautiful 
JDG.8.28	Midian could not fight 
JDG.8.29	Gideon, son of Joash, went back home to live. 
JDG.8.30	He had many wives and 70 sons. 
JDG.8.31	Gideon visited a woman who lived in Shechem. They had a son called Abimelech.
JDG.8.32	Gideon, son of Joash, lived for a long time. Then he died and they put his body into the ground with that of his father, Joash. This was in Ophrah of the 
JDG.8.33	As soon as Gideon had died, the 
JDG.8.34	They forgot the 
JDG.8.35	Nor were 
JDG.9.1	Abimelech, the son of Gideon in Shechem, spoke to his mother's brothers and all her family.
JDG.9.2	He told them to ask the men of Shechem who they wanted as a ruler. He asked if they wanted Gideon's 70 sons or just one man to rule them. He said, ‘Remember that I belong to your family’.
JDG.9.3	Abimelech's brothers told all this to the men of Shechem. They decided that they wanted Abimelech as their ruler. They said, ‘He is our brother’. 
JDG.9.4	They gave him 70 shekels (about 1.75 pounds or 0.8 kilos in weight) of 
JDG.9.5	He went to his father's house in Ophrah. There he killed Gideon's 70 sons on one rock. They were his brothers. But Jotham, the youngest son hid himself. He did not die.
JDG.9.6	The men of Shechem and Beth Millo met together. They met at the tree by the tall rock in Shechem. There they made Abimelech king.
JDG.9.7	When he heard this, Jotham climbed up Mount Gerizim. He shouted to the men of Shechem, ‘Listen to me, so that God may listen to you. 
JDG.9.8	One day, the trees decided to make a king for themselves. They said to the 
JDG.9.9	But the 
JDG.9.10	Next, the trees said to the 
JDG.9.11	The 
JDG.9.12	Then the trees said to the 
JDG.9.13	But the 
JDG.9.14	At last, the trees said to the 
JDG.9.15	The 
JDG.9.16	You have made Abimelech king. You have not been good to Gideon's family. You have hurt them. 
JDG.9.17	But Gideon fought for you. He did not think about his own life. He saved you from being slaves to the 
JDG.9.18	Today you threw out my father's family. You have killed his 70 sons. You have made Abimelech king because he is your brother. He is the son of my father's slave-girl. 
JDG.9.19	If you have been good to Gideon, I hope that Abimelech will make you happy! I hope that you will make him happy, too! 
JDG.9.20	If you have not, I hope that Abimelech will destroy you. And I hope that you men of Shechem and Beth Millo will burn Abimelech!’
JDG.9.21	Jotham ran away to Beer because he was frightened of his brother, Abimelech. 
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled 
JDG.9.23	Then God caused the people of Shechem to argue with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.24	God was 
JDG.9.25	The people of Shechem did not obey Abimelech. They put men on the top of the hills near Shechem. They took money and valuable things from everyone who went past. Abimelech heard about this.
JDG.9.26	Gaal son of Ebed went to live in Shechem with his brothers. The people of Shechem began to want Gaal as their leader. 
JDG.9.27	They picked the fruit of the 
JDG.9.28	Gaal, son of Ebed, said, ‘We should not let Abimelech lead us. He is Gideon's son and Zebul is his officer. We should let men of Hamor (Shechem's father) lead us. 
JDG.9.29	If I led this people I would not let Abimelech be king. I would say to him, “Call out your whole army!” ’
JDG.9.30	They told Zebul what Gaal, son of Ebed, had said. Zebul ruled the city, and he was very angry.
JDG.9.31	Zebul sent men to Abimelech by hidden paths. They told him, ‘Gaal and his brothers are making the men of Shechem want to fight us. They are causing trouble. 
JDG.9.32	Come in the night with your men. Hide in the fields until sunrise. 
JDG.9.33	Then, in the morning, attack the city. When Gaal and his men come out, fight your best’.
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all his army came at night. They hid near Shechem in four groups.
JDG.9.35	Gaal was standing outside the city gates. Abimelech and his men came out from where they were hiding. 
JDG.9.36	Gaal saw them. He said to Zebul, ‘Look, there are men coming from the tops of the mountains’. Zebul replied, ‘You are wrong. You are looking at shadows’. 
JDG.9.37	Gaal said again, ‘Look, there are two groups of people. Some are coming from the centre of the land. Other men are coming from the 
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul spoke to Gaal, ‘Where are your big words now? You said that Abimelech should not rule us. These are the men that you said were no use. Now go out and fight them!’
JDG.9.39	Gaal led the people of Shechem out to fight Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech ran after him. Many men were hurt. They fell all along the way to the city gate. 
JDG.9.41	Abimelech stayed in Arumah. Zebul made Gaal and his brothers leave Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day, the people of Shechem went out into the fields. Men told Abimelech about this. 
JDG.9.43	He took his men and put them into three groups. When the people came out of the city, he attacked them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and his soldiers ran to stand at the city gate. The other two groups ran and killed the people in the fields.
JDG.9.45	Abimelech fought hard all day. He won the fight and killed the people. Then he destroyed the city. He put salt all over it.
JDG.9.46	The people in the strong building of Shechem heard the news. The strong place was in the house (
JDG.9.47	Men told Abimlelech about the people in the strong building.
JDG.9.48	He took his men up to Mount Zalmon. He cut branches off a tree with an axe. He put the branches on his shoulders. He shouted to his men, ‘Be quick! Do as you have seen me do!’ 
JDG.9.49	So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech. They put the branches round the strong building. Then they put fire to them. There were about 1000 men and women of Shechem in the building. They all died.
JDG.9.50	Abimelech went to Thebez next. He and his men attacked it. They won the fight for the city. 
JDG.9.51	All the people of the city hid in a strong building. The building was inside the city. They locked the door. They went on to the roof. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelech and his men attacked the strong building. He went near to the door, to burn it. 
JDG.9.53	A woman dropped a very heavy stone on his head and broke his bones. 
JDG.9.54	Abimelech said to his army servant, ‘Be quick. Kill me. I do not want people to say that a woman killed me!’ So his servant killed him with a sharp knife.

JDG.10.14	Call to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you from your trouble!’
JDG.10.15	The 
JDG.10.16	Then they destroyed all the foreign gods of wood and stone. They began to

JDG.10.18	The leaders of the people of Gilead made a promise. They said, ‘The man who will lead the fight against the 
JDG.11.1	Jephthah of Gilead was a brave soldier. His father was Gilead, but his mother was not Gilead's wife. 
JDG.11.2	The sons of Gilead's wife became men and sent Jephthah away. They said, ‘You will not get any of Gilead's things, because you are the son of another woman’. 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah ran away from his brothers. He went to live in the land of Tob. Other men joined him there. They were a small group of fighting men. Jephthah was their leader.
JDG.11.4	The 
JDG.11.5	Then the leaders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	‘Come and lead our army’, they said. ‘Then we can fight the 
JDG.11.7	Jephthah answered, ‘You made me leave my father's house. You did not like me. Why do you come to me now that you are in trouble?’
JDG.11.8	The men of Gilead replied, ‘But we are asking you to come back to us. Please fight the 
JDG.11.9	Jephthah said, ‘What if you take me back to fight for you, against the 
JDG.11.10	The leaders of Gilead said, ‘The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went back with them to Gilead. The people made him their ruler and leader. He repeated all that he had said, at Mizpah, in front of the

JDG.11.28	The king of Ammon refused to listen to the message sent to him by Jephthah.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the

JDG.11.31	Whatever comes first out through the door of my house when I return, I will kill and give to you. I will burn it as an

JDG.11.33	He destroyed 20 towns from Aroer to Minnith, as far as Abel Karamim. This is how 
JDG.11.34	Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah. His only daughter came out to meet him, dancing to music. He had no other son or daughter. 
JDG.11.35	He cried out when he saw her, and tore his clothes. He said, ‘My daughter, you have made me very very sad. I have made a promise to the 
JDG.11.36	‘Father’, she said, ‘You have made your promise to the 
JDG.11.37	But give me this one thing. Give me two months to walk in the hills and to cry with my friends. I am sad that I will never marry’.
JDG.11.38	‘You may go’, he said. And he let her go away for two months. She and the girls went to the hills. They cried because she would never marry. 
JDG.11.39	She returned after two months, and Jephthah kept his promise. The girl had never had sex with a man. This is why 
JDG.11.40	the young women of 
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim joined together. They crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, ‘Why did you go to fight the

JDG.12.11	After him, Elon from Zebulun led 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon died, and they buried him in Aijalon. This was in the land of Zebulun.

JDG.13.11	Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, ‘Are you the person who talked to my wife?’ ‘I am’, he said.
JDG.13.12	So Manoah asked, ‘When your words come true, how is the boy to live? What rules must he obey?’
JDG.13.13	The 
JDG.13.14	She must not eat anything from the 
JDG.13.15	Manoah said to him, ‘Please stay here. We would like to make a meal for you. We will kill and cook a young goat’.
JDG.13.16	The 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah asked the 
JDG.13.18	He replied, ‘Why do your ask my name? You could not understand it’. 
JDG.13.19	Then Manoah took a young goat and some 
JDG.13.20	As the fire burnt up, the 
JDG.13.21	They did not see the 
JDG.13.22	‘We are sure to die!’ Manoah said to his wife. ‘We have seen God’.
JDG.13.23	But his wife answered, ‘The

JDG.14.8	Later, Samson returned to marry the girl. He turned off the path to look at the 
JDG.14.9	He took the 
JDG.14.10	Samson's father went to see the young woman. Samson prepared a party meal there. All the men did this when they married. 
JDG.14.11	30 young men came to him when he was ready.
JDG.14.12	Samson said to them, ‘Let me ask you a difficult question. Give me an answer in the 7 days of my party. Then I will give you 30 valuable coats and 30 sets of clothes. 
JDG.14.13	If you cannot tell me the answer, you will give me 30 good coats and 30 sets of clothes’. The young men said, ‘Let us hear your question. Do tell us’.
JDG.14.14	Samson replied, ‘Out of the 
JDG.14.15	On the fourth day they spoke to Samson's wife. ‘Get your husband to tell you the answer for us. If you do not, we will burn you and all in your father's house. You will die. Did you want to take our money when you asked us to your marriage?’
JDG.14.16	Then Samson's wife started to cry. She threw herself at Samson. She shouted, ‘You 
JDG.14.16	‘I have not told even my father or mother’, he replied. ‘So why should I tell you?’
JDG.14.17	His wife cried all the 7 days of the party. So Samson told her the answer on the seventh day. She had made him very tired. Then she told her people the answer to his question.
JDG.14.18	Then the people of the town went to Samson. It was before sunset of the seventh day. They said, ‘What is sweeter than 
JDG.14.18	Samson said, ‘You would not have found the answer on your own. You made my wife ask me’.
JDG.14.19	The 
JDG.14.20	And his wife's father gave her to the friend who had stood by him at his marriage. 
JDG.15.1	Later, Samson went to visit his wife. The 
JDG.15.2	He said, ‘I was so sure that you hated her. I have given her to your friend. Her young sister is more beautiful. Take her instead’.
JDG.15.3	Samson said, ‘This time you have given me a powerful reason to hurt the

JDG.15.10	The men of Judah asked, ‘Why have you come to fight us?’ ‘We have come to take Samson away’, they replied. ‘We want him because he has hurt us’.
JDG.15.11	3000 men of Judah went to the place where Samson was. They said, ‘You must know that the 
JDG.15.11	He answered, ‘I only did to them as they did to me’.
JDG.15.12	They said to him, ‘We have come to tie you up. We must give you to the 
JDG.15.12	Samson said, ‘Promise that you will not kill me’.
JDG.15.13	‘We agree’, they said, ‘We will only tie you up and give you to them. We will not kill you’. So they tied him up with two new

JDG.15.19	God made a hole in the ground near Lehi. Water came out of it. Samson drank from it and he became strong again. The name of this water was En Hakkore (water of the one who shouted); it is still in Lehi.
JDG.15.20	Samson led 
JDG.16.1	One day, Samson went to Gaza. He went to have sex with a woman there. 
JDG.16.2	The people of Gaza heard that Samson was there. The men waited for him all night at the gate of the city. They said, ‘We will stay here. We will kill him at dawn’.
JDG.16.3	But Samson only stayed with the woman until the middle of the night. Then he got up. He took the doors from the gate of the city. He tore them from the walls, with the wood at their edges. He carried them to the top of the hill towards Hebron.
JDG.16.4	Some time later Samson began to love a woman called Delilah. She lived in the valley of Sorek. 
JDG.16.5	The rulers of the 
JDG.16.6	Delilah said to Samson, ‘Tell me the secret. What makes you so strong? How can you be tied up and kept quiet?’
JDG.16.7	Samson replied, ‘You must tie me with 7 new leather 
JDG.16.8	The rulers of the 
JDG.16.9	She hid 
JDG.16.10	Delilah said to Samson, ‘You have made me look like a fool. Your words were not true. Come on, tell me how someone can really tie you’.

JDG.16.13	Delilah then said to Samson, ‘Your words were not true. You have made me look silly. Tell me how someone can really tie you’. He replied, ‘If you work the 7 tails of my hair into the cloth you are making I will become weak. You must tie it well and I will be like other men’. Delilah did this while he was asleep. She took the 7 tails of his hair and tied them in with the cloth she was making. 
JDG.16.14	She fixed them with a piece of wood. Again she shouted to him, ‘Samson, the 
JDG.16.15	Delilah said to him, ‘You cannot really love me, when you will not tell me your secret. This is the third time that you have made me look like a fool. You have not told me why you are so strong’. 
JDG.16.16	She kept on saying the same thing again and again. Her questions made Samson very tired.
JDG.16.17	So Samson told her everything. ‘I have never cut my hair’, he said. ‘When I was born, God chose me to be a 
JDG.16.18	Delilah saw that he had told her everything. So she sent a message to the rulers of the 
JDG.16.19	Delilah made Samson sleep with his head on her knees. She asked a man to cut off the 7 tails of his hair. This was to make him weak. He was not strong any more.
JDG.16.20	Then she shouted, ‘Samson, the

JDG.16.23	The rulers of the 
JDG.16.24	When the people saw Samson, they 
JDG.16.25	The people were all very happy. They shouted, ‘Bring out Samson. He can dance for us’. So they brought Samson out of the prison. He had to do as they asked.
JDG.16.25	They took Samson among the 
JDG.16.26	A servant held Samson's hand. Samson said, ‘Put me against the

JDG.18.2	The men went into the hill country of Ephraim. They came to Micah's house and stayed there for a night. 
JDG.18.3	As they came near to Micah's house, they recognised the voice of the young 
JDG.18.4	He told them what Micah had done for him. He said, ‘He pays me to be his 
JDG.18.5	They said to him, ‘Please ask God if our journey will have a good result’.
JDG.18.6	The 
JDG.18.7	So the 5 men left and went to Laish. They saw that it was a safe, quiet place. The people of Laish thought that they would never have to fight. The people of Sidon (the

JDG.18.9	They answered, ‘Let us go and attack them. The land is very good. You must do something. Do not be afraid to go there. We can win it. 
JDG.18.10	The people there think that they are safe. You will find a large land. It has everything. God has given it to you’.

JDG.18.20	Then the 
JDG.18.21	The people put their little children and animals in front of them. They took all their own things. Then they left.
JDG.18.22	The men who lived near Micah came together. They ran after the 
JDG.18.23	They shouted after the 
JDG.18.24	Micah replied, ‘You have taken the gods that I made. You have taken my

JDG.19.3	Then her husband went to visit her. He asked her to return to him. He took his servant and two 
JDG.19.4	The girl's father asked him to stay there. So he stayed for 3 days. He ate and drank there and slept there also.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day they got up early and were ready to leave. The girl's father said, ‘Have something to eat, and then you may go’. 
JDG.19.6	So the two men sat down. They ate and drank together. Then the girl's father asked him to stay that night. He wanted him to enjoy himself. 
JDG.19.7	The man got up to go. But the girl's father made him stay. 
JDG.19.8	On the morning of the fifth day the girl's father said, ‘Have something to eat and drink. Wait until this afternoon and you can go’. So the two of them ate together.
JDG.19.9	The man and woman were ready to go, with the servant. Then her father said, ‘It is nearly evening. Sleep here tonight. The day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. You can leave early tomorrow and go home’. 
JDG.19.10	But the man did not want to stay for another night. So he left with his two 
JDG.19.11	When they came near to Jebus, the day was nearly over. The servant said, ‘Let us stay in this city of the 
JDG.19.12	His master replied, ‘No, we will not go into a foreign city. These people are not 
JDG.19.13	He said, ‘Let us try to reach Gibeah or Ramah. Then we can stay in one of those cities for the night’. 
JDG.19.14	It was sunset when they came near to Gibeah in Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They stayed there for the night. They sat in the centre of the city. But no one took them in for the night.
JDG.19.16	That evening, an old man from the hill country of Ephraim (but who was living in Gibeah) returned from his work. 
JDG.19.17	When he saw the traveller in the square, he asked, ‘Where are you going? Where did you come from?’
JDG.19.18	The 
JDG.19.19	We have food and material for our animal's beds. We have bread and 
JDG.19.20	The old man said, ‘Please come into my house. I can give you whatever you need. But do not stay in the open city’. 
JDG.19.21	So he took him into his house, and fed the 
JDG.19.22	They were enjoying themselves. Then some bad men came from the city and stood all round the house. They hit the door hard and shouted to the old man. They said, ‘Bring out the man who came to your house. We want to have sex with him’.
JDG.19.23	The old man went outside to them. He said, ‘Friends, do not be so very, very bad. This man is in my house. You would be doing a very bad thing.
JDG.19.24	Here is my daughter, who has never had sex with a man, and this man's woman. I will bring them to you and you can use them as you want. But do not do such a bad thing to this man’.
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the traveller took his woman, and sent her out to them. They made her have sex with them and hurt her all night long. At dawn, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	She went back to the house where the man was staying. She fell at the door. She lay there until it was light.
JDG.19.27	Her master got up and opened the door in the morning. He was ready to continue his journey. He saw the woman lying there. Her hands were reaching towards the door.
JDG.19.28	He said to her, ‘Get up. Let us go!’ But she did not answer. Then he put her on his 
JDG.19.29	When he reached home, he cut the woman's body into 12 parts. He sent these to all the 
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw it said, ‘Nothing as bad as this has ever happened before. Never since the 
JDG.20.1	Then all the 
JDG.20.2	The leaders of all the 
JDG.20.3	(The 
JDG.20.4	So the 
JDG.20.5	The men of Gibeah came and stood round the house. They wanted to kill me. They made my woman have sex with them, and she died.

JDG.20.13	Send out to us the bad men of Gibeah. Then we can kill them. This will make our people clean from the wrong that the men of Gibeah have done’.
JDG.20.13	But the 
JDG.20.14	They came from their towns and met at Gibeah to fight them. 
JDG.20.15	They had 26,000 fighting men from their towns. And they had 700 chosen men from Gibeah. 
JDG.20.16	Among all these soldiers were 700 men who used their left hands. They could use a leather

JDG.20.26	Then all the 
JDG.20.27	They wanted to ask the 
JDG.20.28	They asked, ‘Should we go up again to fight Benjamin, our brother, or not?’ The 
JDG.20.29	Then 
JDG.20.30	On the third day they went out to fight Benjamin as before.

JDG.20.37	The men who were hiding ran into Gibeah and went through the whole city. They killed all the people. 
JDG.20.38	The leaders had told them to make a big cloud of smoke in the city. 
JDG.20.39	Then the other 
JDG.20.39	The 
JDG.20.40	Then they turned and saw the smoke rising from their city to the sky. 
JDG.20.41	The men of 
JDG.20.42	So they ran towards the 
JDG.20.43	They were all round the 
JDG.20.44	18,000 strong 
JDG.20.45	Other men ran through the 
JDG.20.46	On that day, 25,000 
JDG.20.47	But 600 men turned and ran to the rock of Rimmon. They stayed there for 4 months. 
JDG.20.48	The 
JDG.21.1	The men of 
JDG.21.2	The people went to Bethel. They sat there until evening, weeping. They cried to the 
JDG.21.3	‘Why has this happened to

JDG.21.6	Now the

JDG.21.9	When they counted the people, there were no men from Jabesh Gilead among them.
JDG.21.10	So the 
JDG.21.11	‘This is what you are to do’, they said. ‘Kill every male, and every married woman’. 
JDG.21.12	They found 400 young women in Jabesh Gilead. These girls had not had sex with anyone. The 
JDG.21.13	Then all the 
JDG.21.14	So the 
JDG.21.15	The people were very sad for Benjamin. This was because the 
JDG.21.16	The 
JDG.21.17	The men of Benjamin that are alive must have children. If they do not, their 
JDG.21.18	We cannot give them our daughters as wives. We promised that we would not do this. We said, “God will

JDG.21.22	When their fathers or brothers get angry, they will come to us. Then we will say, “Please help the 
JDG.21.23	So that is what the 
JDG.21.24	Then the 
JDG.21.25	In those days, 
RUT.1.1+RUT.1.2	There was a time when 
RUT.1.3	Elimelech died while they were living in Moab. Naomi and her two sons remained there and 
RUT.1.4	Naomi's sons married women from Moab. Mahlon married a woman called Ruth. And Kilion married a woman called Orpah. 
RUT.1.5	Both Mahlon and Kilion died after they had all lived in Moab for about ten years. Naomi was completely alone, without her husband or her sons. 
RUT.1.6	Naomi received news from Judah that God had helped his people. There was now enough food in Judah again. Naomi decided to return to Judah. 
RUT.1.7	She and her sons' wives left their home in Moab. They began to travel together along the road towards Judah.
RUT.1.8	On the way to Judah, Naomi spoke to Ruth and Orpah. She said, ‘Return to your mothers' homes and stay there. Your husbands are dead now. But you were kind to them when they were alive. And you have been kind to me. I pray that God will be as kind to you. I also pray that God will give each of you another husband and a new home.’ 
RUT.1.9	Naomi kissed them and Ruth and Orpah began to cry.
RUT.1.10	They said to Naomi, ‘No! We will go with you to your people.’
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, ‘Return to your own country, my daughters. You should not want to come with me. I will not have other sons. You cannot marry them. 
RUT.1.12	Return to your own country, my daughters. I am too old to have another husband. Think about this. I might even marry another husband tonight. Then I might give birth to sons. Those sons would grow up and they would become men. Then you could marry them. 
RUT.1.13	But I am sure that you do not want to wait for so many years, my daughters. This is painful for you. It is more painful for me. God has caused bad things to happen to me.’
RUT.1.14	Ruth and Orpah wept again. Orpah kissed Naomi and she said goodbye. But Ruth would not leave Naomi. She held on to Naomi.
RUT.1.15	Naomi said to Ruth, ‘Orpah has returned to her family. She has returned to the gods of Moab. Go with her.’
RUT.1.16	Ruth said to Naomi, ‘Do not say that I must leave you. I want to go with you. I want to live with you. You belong to Israel's people. I will belong to them also. Your God will be my God. 
RUT.1.17	I want to die in the place where you die. I want someone to bury me there. Even when I die, I want to be with you. I must not leave you before I die. If I do, God should be very angry with me.’ 
RUT.1.18	Naomi understood that Ruth would not return to her own country. Then Naomi stopped saying that Ruth should leave her.
RUT.1.19	Naomi and Ruth travelled together to Bethlehem. The people in Bethlehem were very surprised when they saw them. The women from the town said, ‘Is this really Naomi?’
RUT.1.20	Naomi said to them, ‘Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara. God has made my life very sad. 
RUT.1.21	I left here with my husband and my two sons. God has brought me back here without them. You should not call me Naomi. God has caused trouble to happen to me.’ 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned from Moab with Ruth. Ruth was from Moab, and she was the wife of Naomi's son Mahlon. Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem when the people were cutting down 
RUT.2.1	Boaz was an important man. He was in the 
RUT.2.2	Ruth, the woman from Moab, said to Naomi, ‘Let me go to the fields. I will walk behind anyone who lets me. Then I will pick up the 
RUT.2.3	So she went to the fields. And she began to pick up the 
RUT.2.4	Just then, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and he spoke to the workers. ‘I ask God to be with you’, he said. ‘We pray that God will do good things for you’, they said.
RUT.2.5	Boaz asked the leader of his workers, ‘Whose young woman is that?’
RUT.2.6	The leader said, ‘She is that young woman from Moab, who returned from Moab with Naomi. 
RUT.2.7	She asked, “Please let me walk behind the workers. Then I can pick up the 
RUT.2.8	Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Young woman, listen to me. Do not go and pick up 
RUT.2.9	Watch where the men work. And walk behind the girls. I have said that the workers should not touch you. The workers have filled the jars with water. When you need water, go to those jars. And drink from the jars.’
RUT.2.10	Ruth went down on her knees in front of Boaz. She said, ‘Why did you choose to be kind to me? I am a foreign woman.’
RUT.2.11	Boaz said, ‘People have told me all about you. When your husband died, you did many things for Naomi. You left your father and your mother and your country. You came to live with people who were strangers to you. 
RUT.2.12	You have done many good things. I pray that God will do good things for you. You have come to Israel to be safe. I pray that the God of Israel will give you many good things.’
RUT.2.13	Ruth said, ‘Master, you have caused me to feel good by your kind words. I am not as important as one of your servant girls. But you have been kind to me. I hope that you will continue to be kind to me.’
RUT.2.14	When it was time to eat, Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Come here. Take some bread and make it wet with the 
RUT.2.14	When she sat down with the workers, Boaz gave her some food. It was 
RUT.2.15	After this, she returned to work in the field. Boaz said to his workers, ‘If she picks up 
RUT.2.16	It would be good to help her. You can let some 
RUT.2.17	Ruth worked in the field until evening. Then she hit her 
RUT.2.18	She carried the seeds to the town. Naomi saw how much Ruth had picked. Ruth also gave to Naomi the 
RUT.2.19	Naomi asked her, ‘Where did you work today? I want God to do good things for the man who was kind to you.’ Then Ruth told Naomi about the man that she had worked with. ‘The man that I worked with today is called Boaz’, she said.
RUT.2.20	‘I pray that God will do good things for him’, said Naomi to Ruth. ‘God has not stopped being kind to people who are alive. He is kind to those who are dead too. That man is in my husband's 
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth, the woman from Moab, said, ‘He even said to me, “Stay with my workers until they have finished the work.” ’
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth, ‘It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls. The workers in another field might hurt you.’
RUT.2.23	So Ruth worked next to Boaz's servant girls until they finished the work. She lived with Naomi.
RUT.3.1	One day, Naomi said to Ruth, ‘My daughter, I must find a home for you. There you will have everything that you need. 
RUT.3.2	You have worked with Boaz's servant girls. Boaz is in our 
RUT.3.3	‘Wash yourself’, said Naomi. ‘Put oil that has a beautiful smell on yourself. Put on your best clothes. Then go down to the 
RUT.3.4	After that, he will lie down. Then you will see where he is lying. Go and lift the cloth from his feet. Lie down. Then he will say what you should do.’
RUT.3.5	‘I will do whatever you say’, said Ruth. 
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the 
RUT.3.7	Boaz was happy when he had finished his food and drink. He had put the 
RUT.3.8	In the middle of the night, something caused Boaz to feel afraid. He moved. Then he saw a woman who was lying at his feet.
RUT.3.9	‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am your servant Ruth’, she said. ‘Put the corner of the cloth that covers your feet over me. You are a 
RUT.3.10	‘Young woman, I pray that God will do good things for you’, he replied. ‘You were kind to Naomi earlier. Now you have been more kind to me. You have seen young men who are rich. And you have seen young men who are poor. You have not tried to marry any of these. 
RUT.3.11	And now, young woman, do not be afraid. All the people in this town know that you are a good woman. So I will do everything for you that you ask. 
RUT.3.12	It is true that I am in your 
RUT.3.13	Stay here for the night. In the morning, if he wants to help you, let him do it. If he will not do it, I will do it. As God is alive, I will do it. Lie here until the morning.’
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up before anyone could see her. Boaz said to her, ‘Nobody must know that a woman came to the 
RUT.3.15	He also said, ‘Bring me your small coat that you are wearing.’ She brought the coat to him and Boaz poured 
RUT.3.16	When Ruth returned, Naomi asked, ‘Ruth, what happened in the night?’ Then Ruth told her everything that Boaz had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	Then she said, ‘He also gave me all this 
RUT.3.18	Naomi said, ‘Ruth, you must wait. Soon you will know what will happen. The man will be sure that he finishes everything today.’
RUT.4.1	In the morning, Boaz went up to the gate of the town and he sat down. The 
RUT.4.2	Boaz chose ten important men from the town and he said, ‘Sit here.’ So they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	Then he said to the 
RUT.4.4	I thought that I should tell you about this. Now I ask you, in front of these important people, will you buy this land? If you want to buy it, then you should buy it. If you do not want to buy it, then you must tell me. Then I will know what you want to do. It is right for you to buy it. If you do not buy the land, then I can buy it.’ The 
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, ‘On the day that you buy the land from Naomi and Ruth, you must marry Ruth. Then the name of Elimelech will stay with the land.’
RUT.4.6	When Boaz said that, the 
RUT.4.7	At this time, in Israel, when a man sold land he removed his shoe. Then he gave it to the man who had bought the land. So then, everyone could see that the first man had sold the land. They had agreed this in the 
RUT.4.8	So the 
RUT.4.9	Boaz said to all the important people, ‘You have all seen today that I have bought the land from Naomi. I have bought all the land of Elimelech, Kilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	I will also marry Ruth, from Moab, who was the wife of Mahlon. His name and his land will stay together. Now his name will remain in his 
RUT.4.11	Then the important men and all the other people at the gate said, ‘We have seen all that has happened. We want God to be good to the woman who is coming into your home. We pray that he will make her like Rachel and Leah. They made the 
RUT.4.12	God gave children to Perez. Perez was the son of Tamar and Judah. We pray that God will give children to you by this young woman like that.’ 
RUT.4.13	Boaz married Ruth. God did good things for her and she had a son. 
RUT.4.14	The women said to Naomi, ‘Thank God! Today, he did not let you have no 
RUT.4.15	He will cause you to feel young again. He will be good to you when you are old. Ruth loves you. And she is better for you than seven sons would be. And now she has had this boy.’
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the child. She held him in her arms. She was good to him as she would be to her own son. 
RUT.4.17	The women who lived there said, ‘Naomi has a son.’ They called him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
RUT.4.18	So this is the 
RUT.4.18	Perez was the father of Hezron.
RUT.4.19	Hezron was the father of Ram.
RUT.4.19	Ram was the father of Amminadab.
RUT.4.20	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.
RUT.4.20	Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
RUT.4.21	Salmon was the father of Boaz.
RUT.4.21	Boaz was the father of Obed.
RUT.4.22	Obed was the father of Jesse.
RUT.4.22	Jesse was the father of David.
1SA.1.1	There was a man whose name was Elkanah. He lived in the town called Ramathaim-zophim (Ramah). This town was in the hills. It was in a place that God had given to Ephraim's 
1SA.1.2	Elkanah had two wives. One wife was called Hannah and the other wife was called Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah did not have any children.
1SA.1.3	Every year, Elkanah left Ramathaim and he went up to the town called Shiloh. He went there to 
1SA.1.4	Elkanah gave his 
1SA.1.5	Elkanah loved Hannah. But she had no children because the 
1SA.1.6	Peninnah was not kind to Hannah. She said things that would cause Hannah to feel sad. She did this because the 
1SA.1.7	This happened every year when they went to the 
1SA.1.8	Hannah's husband, Elkanah said to her, ‘I do not know why you are crying. I do not know why you are not eating. You should not be sad. I am better than 10 sons.’ 
1SA.1.9	One day they were at Shiloh. They had finished eating and drinking. Hannah stood up. Eli the 
1SA.1.10	Hannah was very, very sad. She cried very much and she prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	And she said a promise to God. She prayed, ‘You are the 
1SA.1.12	Hannah continued to pray to the 
1SA.1.13	Hannah was praying inside herself. Her lips moved but Eli could not hear her voice. So he thought that she had drunk too much alcohol. 
1SA.1.14	He said to her, ‘Stop drinking so much. Put away your 
1SA.1.15	Hannah said to Eli, ‘No, sir, I have not drunk 
1SA.1.16	Please do not think that I am a bad woman. I am praying here because I am sad. And I feel bad inside.’
1SA.1.17	Eli answered Hannah and he said, ‘Go and let your mind rest. I ask the God of 
1SA.1.18	Hannah said, ‘I will try always to do the things that will cause you pleasure.’ Then Hannah went away and she ate something. Her face was not sad now.
1SA.1.19	Elkanah and his family got up early the next morning. They 
1SA.1.20	Hannah discovered that she would soon have a baby. She had a son and she called him Samuel. She said, ‘His name is Samuel because I asked the 
1SA.1.21	Every year Elkanah went to Shiloh to give 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, ‘I will not go until the boy is older. When he can eat proper food, I will take him to the house of the 
1SA.1.23	Elkanah said to Hannah, ‘You must do what seems right to you. Stay here until the boy begins to eat proper food. The 
1SA.1.24	When Samuel was eating proper food, Hannah took him to Shiloh. She took him to the 
1SA.1.25	They killed the male cow for the 
1SA.1.26	Hannah spoke to Eli. ‘Please believe me sir. I am the woman that was standing here. You saw me here. I was praying to the 
1SA.1.27	I prayed for this boy and the 
1SA.1.28	Now I give this child back to the 
1SA.1.28	And Samuel 
1SA.2.1	Hannah prayed and she said,
1SA.2.1	‘I am very happy when I think about the 
1SA.2.1	The 
1SA.2.1	I can say that I am stronger than my 
1SA.2.1	I am happy because you, 
1SA.2.2	Nobody else is 
1SA.2.2	There is no other God except you.
1SA.2.2	You are the only powerful God.
1SA.2.3	You people must not say that you are very great.
1SA.2.3	Stop saying that you are important.
1SA.2.3	The 
1SA.2.3	And he knows whether people are doing good things or bad things.
1SA.2.4	The bows of strong soldiers break.
1SA.2.4	But people who fall will become strong.
1SA.2.5	Now the people who had plenty of food have to work for it.
1SA.2.5	But the people who were hungry are not hungry any longer.
1SA.2.5	The woman who could not have any children now has 7 children.
1SA.2.5	But the woman who had many children has become weak.
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.6	He causes people to die. And he raises people up.
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.7	He makes some people not important and he makes other people great.
1SA.2.8	The 
1SA.2.8	He lifts up the people who need help.
1SA.2.8	He lets poor people be friends with king's sons.
1SA.2.8	And he puts poor people in places of 
1SA.2.8	The deep places of the earth are the 
1SA.2.8	He built the world on them.
1SA.2.9	He saves the people who obey him.
1SA.2.9	But he keeps bad people quiet in dark places.
1SA.2.9	Men will not win wars only because they are strong.
1SA.2.10	The 
1SA.2.10	His voice against them is like the noise of a storm from the sky.
1SA.2.10	The 
1SA.2.10	He will give power to his king.
1SA.2.10	He will 
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But Samuel stayed in Shiloh. He lived with Eli the 
1SA.2.12	But the sons of Eli were very bad men. They did not give 
1SA.2.13	People brought 
1SA.2.14	He pushed a fork into the pot. And the 
1SA.2.15	Often, the servant of the 
1SA.2.16	Sometimes, the person said, ‘You must burn the fat meat first. Then you can take what you want.’ The servant would reply, ‘No. Give the meat to me now. If you do not give it to me, I will take it from you.’
1SA.2.17	The 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel was the 
1SA.2.19	Every year, Samuel's mother made a little coat for him. She took it to him when she went to Shiloh. She and her husband went there every year to give their 
1SA.2.20	Then Eli 
1SA.2.21	The 
1SA.2.22	Eli was very old now. People told him about everything that his sons did in all Israel. Eli's sons had sex with some women servants. Those women worked at the door of the 
1SA.2.23	Eli said to his sons, ‘I do not know why you do these 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons, the 
1SA.2.25	If you do something bad to another person, God can help you. But if you do something against the 
1SA.2.26	The boy Samuel continued to grow bigger. And he continued to give pleasure to the 
1SA.2.27	A man of God came and he spoke to Eli. This is what he said: ‘The 
1SA.2.28	I chose him and his family from all of the 
1SA.2.29	I said that my people must give these 
1SA.2.30	Because of what you have done, the 
1SA.2.31	It will be the time soon when you will die. Also, I will let men kill the young men in your family. Nobody in your family will ever become old.
1SA.2.32	I will cause trouble for the 
1SA.2.33	But I will not completely stop your family working for me at my 
1SA.2.34	Hophni and Phinehas, your two sons, will die on the same day. That will show everyone that I have spoken only true words.
1SA.2.35	I will choose a 
1SA.2.36	Everyone in your family who continues to live will bend his body down to this 
1SA.3.1	The boy Samuel became the 
1SA.3.2	Eli now had bad eyes and he could not see well. One night, he was lying down to sleep in his usual place. 
1SA.3.3	The 
1SA.3.4	Then the 
1SA.3.5	He ran to Eli and he said, ‘You said my name. Here I am.’ But Eli said, ‘I did not say your name. Lie down again.’ So Samuel lay down again. 
1SA.3.6	Again the 
1SA.3.7	Samuel did not know the 
1SA.3.8	Then the 
1SA.3.9	So Eli said to Samuel, ‘Lie down again. If he says your name again, you must say, “Speak, 
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.11	This is what the 
1SA.3.12	I will do everything to Eli and his family that I have said. I will start at the beginning and I will go on to the end. 
1SA.3.13	I told Eli that I would 
1SA.3.14	So I decided to show them that I was very angry. I said to Eli's family, “I will never 
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay down until the morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	But Eli 
1SA.3.17	Eli asked, ‘What did the 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told Eli everything. He did not hide any of it. Then Eli said, ‘He is the 
1SA.3.19	The 
1SA.3.20	All the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	When Samuel spoke, all the 
1SA.4.1	The 
1SA.4.2	The 
1SA.4.3	The 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent men to Shiloh and they brought back the 
1SA.4.5	The men brought the 
1SA.4.6	The 
1SA.4.6	Then the 
1SA.4.7	They were afraid. They said, ‘A 
1SA.4.8	This will be very bad for us. Nobody can save us from these powerful 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, 
1SA.4.10	So the 
1SA.4.11	And the 
1SA.4.12	That day a man from the 
1SA.4.13	Eli was by the side of the road when the man arrived in Shiloh. Eli was sitting on his chair. He was waiting for news. He was not happy because they had taken God's 
1SA.4.14	Eli heard the people crying. He asked, ‘What is all this noise about?’ The man quickly went to tell Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Eli was now 98 years old and he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	The man from Benjamin said, ‘I have come from the fight. Today I ran from it to you.’ Eli asked, ‘What happened, my son?’
1SA.4.17	The man who brought the news said, ‘The 
1SA.4.18	Eli was sitting next to the gate. When the man spoke about God's 
1SA.4.19	Phinehas had a wife. She would soon have a baby. It was nearly time for the baby to be born. People told her that the 
1SA.4.20	She was dying. Some women helped her to give birth. Just before she died, they said, ‘Do not be afraid. You have a son.’ But she did not answer them or listen to them.
1SA.4.21	She called the boy Ichabod. She said, ‘The 
1SA.4.22	She said, ‘The 
1SA.5.1	The 
1SA.5.2	They carried it into the 
1SA.5.3	The next morning, the people in Ashdod got up early and they went to their 
1SA.5.4	They got up early the next morning and they went to the 
1SA.5.5	Dagon's 
1SA.5.6	The 
1SA.5.7	The men in Ashdod saw what was happening. They said, ‘God's 
1SA.5.8	So the 
1SA.5.8	The kings answered, ‘Take it to Gath.’ So the men moved it to the 
1SA.5.9	After they had moved the 
1SA.5.10	So the people sent God's box to the 
1SA.5.10	When the 
1SA.5.11	So they asked the 
1SA.5.12	Many people died and all the other people had 
1SA.6.1	The 
1SA.6.2	Then they asked their 
1SA.6.3	The 
1SA.6.4	The 
1SA.6.4	The 
1SA.6.5	Make the 
1SA.6.6	Do not be like the people from Egypt and Pharaoh their king. They would not change their minds and obey God. So God 
1SA.6.7	You must make a new 
1SA.6.8	Put the 
1SA.6.9	But continue to watch it. God's 
1SA.6.10	So the 
1SA.6.11	They put the 
1SA.6.12	The cows went in a straight path towards Beth-shemesh. They kept on the road and they did not turn to the right or to the left. All the way, they made a lot of noise. The 
1SA.6.13	The people from Beth-shemesh were in the valley. They were taking in their 
1SA.6.14+1SA.6.15	The cows pulled the 
1SA.6.16	When the 5 
1SA.6.17	The

1SA.6.19	But some of the men from Beth-shemesh looked inside the 
1SA.6.20	The men at Beth-shemesh said, ‘When God is present, people cannot stand. The 
1SA.6.21	So they sent people to Kiriath-jearim with a message. They said, ‘The 
1SA.7.1	So men came from Kiriath-jearim to fetch the

1SA.7.3	Then Samuel said to all the 
1SA.7.4	So the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, ‘Meet together at the town called Mizpah. I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	So they all met at Mizpah. They got water from the ground and they poured it out in front of the 
1SA.7.7	People told the 
1SA.7.8	The 
1SA.7.9	So Samuel gave a young sheep as a whole 
1SA.7.10	While Samuel was giving the

1SA.7.12	After that, Samuel took a stone and he put it up between Mizpah and Shen. He called the stone Ebenezer. He said, ‘The

1SA.8.2	His first son was Joel and his second son was Abijah. They were rulers in the town called Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But Samuel's sons did not do good things as Samuel had done. They tried to get money in ways that were not right. They accepted money from bad people when nobody was looking. Then they would not

1SA.8.5	They said to Samuel, ‘You are old. Your sons do not do good things as you have done. Give to us a king who will rule over us. The other 
1SA.8.6	Samuel was not happy that the leaders asked for a king. So he prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	The 
1SA.8.8	Today they are doing what they have always done. I brought them out of the country called Egypt. But they left me and they 
1SA.8.9	Listen to the people. But tell them what will happen. Tell them what their kings will do to them.’
1SA.8.10	Samuel spoke to the people who had asked him for a king. He told them everything that the 
1SA.8.11	Samuel said, ‘The king will rule over you. And this is what he will do. He will take your sons to be his soldiers. They will drive his horses and 
1SA.8.12	The king will make some of your sons leaders of 1000 soldiers each. Other sons will be leaders of groups of 50 soldiers. The king will cause some of your sons to plough his ground. Then they will have to bring to him the food that they have caused to grow. Other sons will have to make 
1SA.8.13	The king will take your daughters. They will make him oils that have good smells. They will also cook and bake his food. 
1SA.8.14	The king will take your best fields. He will take the places where you find the best 
1SA.8.15	Then he will take a 10th part of all your seeds and 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male and female servants. He will take your best young men and your 
1SA.8.17	He will take a 10th of all your sheep. And he will cause you to be his servants too. 
1SA.8.18	Then you will shout to the 
1SA.8.19	But the people would not listen to Samuel. They said, ‘No. We want a king to rule us. 
1SA.8.20	We want to be like all the other 
1SA.8.21	Samuel listened to all that the people said. Then he went and he told the 
1SA.8.22	The

1SA.9.2	Kish had a son whose name was Saul. He was a very handsome young man. No other

1SA.9.5	They reached the fields near Zuph. Saul said to his servant, ‘We must return to our home now. My father was afraid that he had lost the 
1SA.9.6	The servant replied, ‘There is a man of God in this town. Everything that he says becomes true. So people give 
1SA.9.7	Saul said to his servant, ‘If we go to visit this man we must give a gift to him. But we do not have a gift. We do not even have any food. What can we give to him?’
1SA.9.8	The servant answered, ‘I have a small piece of

1SA.9.10	Saul said to his servant, ‘That is good. We should visit this man of God.’ So, they went to the town where he was.
1SA.9.11	They went up the hill to the town. Some young women came out of the town to get some water. Saul and his servant said, ‘Is the

1SA.9.14	Saul and his servant went up to the town. When they went into the town, Samuel came towards them. He was going to the place for 
1SA.9.15	God had spoken to Samuel the day before this. God said, 
1SA.9.16	‘Tomorrow I will send a man to you. He comes from the land of Benjamin. He will arrive at about this time of day. 
1SA.9.17	Samuel saw Saul. God said to Samuel, ‘Here is the man that I told you about. He will rule my people.’
1SA.9.18	Samuel was near the gate of the town. Saul went to him and said, ‘Please tell me where the 
1SA.9.19	Samuel said, ‘I am the 
1SA.9.20	Do not think about the 
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, ‘I belong to the 
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the place where he would make the 
1SA.9.23	Samuel spoke to the cook. He said, ‘Please bring me the piece of meat that I gave to you. I said that you must keep it separate.’
1SA.9.24	So the cook took the leg of meat and he put it down in front of Saul. Samuel said to Saul, ‘I kept this piece of meat for you. Eat it because this is a special meal. When I first asked the other men, I kept this piece of meat for you.’ So, Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	They left the place for 
1SA.9.26	They got up at dawn the next day. Saul was on the roof of the house. Samuel shouted up to him. He said, ‘Get up and get ready to leave. I will send you on your journey.’ Saul got ready to leave. Saul and Samuel went out into the street. 
1SA.9.27	They walked to the edge of the town. Samuel said, ‘Say to your servant that he must go on in front of us. But you must stay, because I have a message from God for you.’
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a jar of oil and he poured the oil over Saul's head. He kissed Saul. He said:
1SA.10.1	‘The 
1SA.10.2	After you leave me today, you will meet two men. They will be near the place where Abraham buried Rachel's dead body. This is on the edge of Benjamin's land at Zelzah. The men will say:
1SA.10.2	“Someone has found the 
1SA.10.3	‘Then you will go on from there until you reach the big tree at Tabor. Three men will meet you there. They are going to the town called Bethel to 
1SA.10.4	They will speak to you and they will offer you two loaves of bread. You must accept the bread. 
1SA.10.5	Then you must go to the place for 
1SA.10.6	The Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	All these things will happen. Then do whatever you need to do. God is with you.
1SA.10.8	Go in front of me to the town called Gilgal. I will certainly come down to you there. And I will burn 
1SA.10.9	Saul left Samuel and went on his journey. When Saul was leaving, God made him a new person inside. And everything happened in the way that Samuel had spoken about. 
1SA.10.10	They arrived at Gibeah and a group of 
1SA.10.11	There were some people who had known Saul for a long time. They saw him when he was 
1SA.10.12	A man who lived there asked, ‘Who is the leader of these 
1SA.10.13	When Saul stopped 
1SA.10.14	Saul's father's brother asked Saul and his servant, ‘Where have you been?’ Saul said, ‘We were looking for the 
1SA.10.15	Saul's father's brother said, ‘What did Samuel say to you?’
1SA.10.16	Saul said, ‘He told us that someone had found the 
1SA.10.17	Samuel sent a message to all 
1SA.10.18	He said to them, ‘This is a message from the 
1SA.10.19	God saved you from all your troubles and from people who hurt you. Now you have refused to obey your God. You said, “No. We want a king to rule us.” So, come and stand in front of the 
1SA.10.20	Each 
1SA.10.21	Each family group from the 
1SA.10.22	So they asked the 
1SA.10.23	So they ran to Saul and they brought him out. When Saul stood with the people, you could see his head and shoulders above everyone else's head. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, ‘Here is the man that the 
1SA.10.25	Samuel explained to the people all that a king should be. And he explained all that a king should do. He wrote everything in a 
1SA.10.26	Saul went to his home at Gibeah. A group of brave men went with him. They went with Saul because God caused them to want to do that. 
1SA.10.27	There were some other men who caused trouble. They said, ‘We do not think that this man can save us.’ They did not

1SA.11.4	The men took the message to the town called Gibeah. Saul lived in this town. When they told the news to the people, the people started to cry aloud. 
1SA.11.5	Saul had been in his field. Now he was returning to his home with the cows. He heard the people crying. He asked, ‘What has happened? Why are the people crying?’ They told Saul what the men from Jabesh had said. 
1SA.11.6	When people told Saul the news, the Spirit of God made him very powerful. Saul became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	He killed two of his cows. He cut them into pieces. He gave the pieces to the men from Jabesh. He said that they must take the pieces to all the towns in 
1SA.11.8	They met together with Saul at the town called Bezek. There were 300000 men from 
1SA.11.9	Saul spoke to the men who had brought the news from Jabesh. He said to them, ‘Return to Jabesh and tell the people this message: “Our people will save you. They will do it tomorrow before midday.” ’ So, the men went and they gave the message to them. All the people in Jabesh were very happy. 
1SA.11.10	The men from Jabesh went and they spoke to Nahash. They said, ‘Tomorrow we will come out to you. Then you can do anything that you want with us.’
1SA.11.11	The next day Saul put his soldiers into three groups. At dawn, they attacked the 
1SA.11.13	Saul said, ‘No, you must not kill anyone today because the 
1SA.11.14	Samuel said to the people, ‘We will all go to the town called Gilgal. Then we will agree again that Saul is our king.’ 
1SA.11.15	So everyone went to Gilgal. They went to the place for 
1SA.12.1	Samuel said to all the 
1SA.12.2	Now you have a king to be your leader. I am old and my hair is grey. My sons are here with you. I have been your leader from the days when I was young until now. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. I have not done any wrong things. If I have, you must tell the 
1SA.12.4	The 
1SA.12.5	Samuel said to the 
1SA.12.5	They replied, ‘He has heard.’
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to all the people, ‘The 
1SA.12.7	You must stand up now. Then I will show you what you are doing. I will tell you again about all the good things that the 
1SA.12.8	He sent 
1SA.12.9	But your 
1SA.12.10	Then the 
1SA.12.11	So the 
1SA.12.12	But then you saw that Nahash, the king of the 
1SA.12.13	Now here is the king that you chose. He is the man that you asked for. The 
1SA.12.14	You should give 
1SA.12.15	You might not obey the 
1SA.12.16	Now stand where you are. See the great thing that the 
1SA.12.17	The 
1SA.12.18	Samuel prayed to the 
1SA.12.19	All the people said to Samuel, ‘We are your servants. Pray to the 
1SA.12.20	Samuel said, ‘Do not be afraid. It is true that you have 
1SA.12.21	Do not

1SA.12.23	As for me, I will not stop praying on your behalf. I will

1SA.13.4	They told all the people in 
1SA.13.5	The 
1SA.13.6	The 
1SA.13.7	Some of the 
1SA.13.7	Saul stayed at Gilgal. All the people with him were so afraid that their bodies 
1SA.13.8	Samuel had told Saul that he must wait for him. Saul waited for 7 days as Samuel had said. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal. The men with Saul began to leave him. 
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, ‘Bring the 
1SA.13.10	Samuel arrived a very short time after he had finished. Saul went to speak to Samuel.
1SA.13.11	Samuel asked, ‘What have you done?’
1SA.13.11	Saul replied, ‘The soldiers were leaving me. You said that you would be here at a certain time. But you did not arrive at that time. The 
1SA.13.12	I thought that they would come. I thought that they would attack me at Gilgal. But I had not asked God to help me. So I thought that I ought to offer the 
1SA.13.13	Samuel said, ‘You have been a fool. You have not obeyed the word of the 
1SA.13.14	But that will not happen now because you did not obey the 
1SA.13.15	Samuel left Gilgal. He went to the town called Gibeah in the land of Benjamin. Saul counted the men who were with him. There were about 600 men.
1SA.13.16	Saul, his son Jonathan and the men who were with them were in the town called Geba. Geba is in the land of Benjamin. The 
1SA.13.17	The 
1SA.13.18	The second group went towards the town called Beth-horon. The third group went to another place. There they could see across the Valley of Zeboim towards the 
1SA.13.19	There were no 
1SA.13.20	The 
1SA.13.21	The 
1SA.13.22	When the fight started, only Saul and Jonathan each had a 
1SA.13.23	A group of 
1SA.14.1	A young man carried Jonathan's 
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying under a big fruit tree at Migron near Gibeah. There were about 600 men with Saul. 
1SA.14.3	Ahijah was with Saul. He wore an 
1SA.14.4	Jonathan had to go along a narrow valley. It was in the mountains at Michmash. There was a high wall of rock on both sides of the road. The name of the wall on one side was ‘Bozez’. The name of the other wall was ‘Seneh’. 
1SA.14.5	One rock wall was on the north side of the road, near Michmash. The other was on the south side, near Geba.
1SA.14.6	Jonathan spoke to the young man who carried his 
1SA.14.7	The young man said, ‘You do anything that you want to do. I will go with you all the way.’
1SA.14.8	Jonathan said, ‘We will go across and we will let the 
1SA.14.9	They may ask us to wait for them because they will come across to us. If they say that, we will stay here. 
1SA.14.10	But they may ask us to go to them. That will mean that the 
1SA.14.11	Jonathan and his young man stood where the 
1SA.14.12	The 
1SA.14.12	Jonathan said, ‘Follow me. The 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan climbed up the rock wall. He was using his hands and his feet to climb up. His young man climbed up behind him. Jonathan attacked and killed some 
1SA.14.14	Jonathan and his young man killed about 20 men in that small space. This was the first time that they attacked the enemy.
1SA.14.15	All the 
1SA.14.16	Saul was at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin. Some of Saul's soldiers were watching the 
1SA.14.17	Saul said to his army, ‘Count our soldiers. Find out who is not here.’ They counted the soldiers. Jonathan and the young man who carried his 
1SA.14.18	Saul said to Ahijah the 
1SA.14.19	Saul was talking to the 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all his men went to fight the 
1SA.14.21	Before this time, some of the 
1SA.14.22	Many 
1SA.14.23	They fought all the way to Beth-aven and beyond it. That day the 
1SA.14.24	But the men among 
1SA.14.25	The 
1SA.14.26	The men saw all the 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard what his father had said. He put the end of his stick into the 
1SA.14.28	One of the soldiers told Jonathan, ‘Your father said a promise to all the soldiers. He will 
1SA.14.29	Jonathan said, ‘My father has made trouble for the people. I feel so much better because I ate some of the 
1SA.14.30	The men took food from their enemies today. It would have been much better if they had eaten some of it. If they had done that, they would have killed many more 
1SA.14.31	That day, the 
1SA.14.32	They took sheep, cows and young cows from the 
1SA.14.33	Someone said to Saul, ‘Look at the people. They are

1SA.14.34	Then Saul said, ‘Go to the people. Tell them that each man must bring his cow or his sheep here. They must kill and eat the animals here. Do not 
1SA.14.34	So, every man took his animal and he killed it there. 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an 
1SA.14.36	Saul said, ‘We will go and we will attack the 
1SA.14.36	The men answered, ‘You decide what seems the best thing to do. Then do that.’
1SA.14.36	But the 
1SA.14.37	Saul asked God, ‘Should I attack the 
1SA.14.38	So Saul said to all the leaders of the people, ‘Come here. We must find out who has 
1SA.14.39	The 
1SA.14.40	Saul said to all the 
1SA.14.40	The people answered, ‘You decide what seems the best thing to do. Then do that.’
1SA.14.41	Then Saul prayed to the 
1SA.14.42	Saul said, ‘Who has 
1SA.14.43	Saul said to Jonathan, ‘Tell me what you have done.’
1SA.14.43	Jonathan told him, ‘I only ate a little 
1SA.14.44	Saul said, ‘Jonathan, I ask God to

1SA.14.47	When Saul became king of 
1SA.14.48	He fought the 
1SA.14.49	Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malchishua. Merab was Saul's older daughter. Michal was his younger daughter. 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam. She was the daughter of Ahimaaz. Abner was the leader of Saul's army. Abner was the son of Ner. Ner was a brother of Saul's father. 
1SA.14.51	Saul's father was Kish. Abner's father was Ner and Ner's father was Abiel. 
1SA.14.52	Saul fought strongly against the 
1SA.15.1	Samuel said to Saul, ‘The 
1SA.15.2	This is what the 
1SA.15.3	Go and attack the 
1SA.15.4	So Saul 
1SA.15.5	Saul and his army went to a town in the country of Amalek. They waited in a valley to catch their enemy. 
1SA.15.6	Saul said to the people from the 
1SA.15.7	Then Saul attacked the 
1SA.15.8	Saul brought back their king, Agag, alive. Saul's soldiers killed all the people with their 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people let Agag live. They did not kill the best old and young sheep or the fat cows. They let all the good animals live. They did not want to kill all the animals. But they killed all the animals that were weak or worth nothing.
1SA.15.10	Then the 
1SA.15.11	‘I am sorry that I made Saul king. He has stopped doing the things that cause me pleasure. He has not obeyed my words.’ Samuel was very sad. He prayed aloud to the 
1SA.15.12	Samuel got up early the next morning. He went to meet Saul. Someone told Samuel, ‘Saul went to the town called Carmel. He put up a tall stone to give 
1SA.15.13	Samuel went to find Saul. Saul said to Samuel, ‘I ask the 
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, ‘Why can I hear the noises of sheep and cows?’
1SA.15.15	Saul answered, ‘The people took them from the 
1SA.15.16	Samuel said to Saul, ‘Stop talking. I will tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	Saul said, ‘Tell me.’
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, ‘In past days you thought that you were not an important person. Now you are the leader of all of the 
1SA.15.18	The 
1SA.15.19	Why did you not obey the 
1SA.15.20	Saul said, ‘I did obey the 
1SA.15.21	But the people did not kill the best sheep and cows. They brought them to 
1SA.15.22	But Samuel replied,
1SA.15.22	‘Is the 
1SA.15.22	The 
1SA.15.23	You 
1SA.15.23	You think that you know better than God. That is a 
1SA.15.23	You refused to obey what the 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, ‘I have 
1SA.15.25	Now I am asking you to

1SA.15.27	Samuel turned away from Saul and left. But Saul pulled the edge of Samuel's coat and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, ‘The 
1SA.15.29	The 
1SA.15.30	Saul replied, ‘I have

1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, ‘Bring Agag, king of the 
1SA.15.32	Agag came to Samuel. Agag was happy because he thought, ‘I am sure that now I will not feel the strong pain of death.’
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said, ‘You have killed many people. Now some mothers do not have any children that are still alive. Now your mother will have no children.’ And Samuel cut Agag into pieces in front of the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel left Gilgal and he went to his home in Ramah. But Saul went to his home in Gibeah. 
1SA.15.35	Until Samuel died, he never saw Saul again. But Samuel was very sad about Saul. And the 
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, ‘If I go, people will tell Saul about it. Then he will kill me.’
1SA.16.2	The 
1SA.16.3	Say to Jesse, “Come to the 
1SA.16.4	Samuel obeyed the 
1SA.16.5	Samuel replied, ‘Yes. I have come to offer a

1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse 
1SA.16.9	Jesse caused his son Shammah to walk past Samuel. But Samuel said, ‘The 
1SA.16.10	Jesse caused 7 of his sons to walk past Samuel. But Samuel said, ‘The 
1SA.16.11	Samuel asked Jesse, ‘Do you have any more sons?’
1SA.16.11	Jesse answered, ‘I have one more son. He is the youngest. He is 
1SA.16.11	Samuel said, ‘Ask him to come here. We will not sit down to eat until he arrives.’
1SA.16.12	So Jesse asked them to fetch him and Jesse took him to Samuel. This young man was handsome and strong and he had beautiful eyes.
1SA.16.12	The 
1SA.16.13	The name of the young man was David. Samuel took the 
1SA.16.14	But the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	Saul's servants said to him, ‘We know that God sent an 
1SA.16.16	If you will let us, we will go. We will look for a man who can make music on a 
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, ‘Find someone who can make good music with a 
1SA.16.18	One of the servants said, ‘Jesse lives in Bethlehem. He has a son who makes good music. This son is a strong, brave soldier. He thinks carefully before he speaks. He is handsome. The 
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent men to Jesse with a message. He said, ‘Ask your son David to come to me. That is the son who is with the sheep.’ 
1SA.16.20	So Jesse took some loaves of bread, a leather bag that was full of 
1SA.16.21	David came to Saul. He became Saul's servant. Saul loved David. David became one of the men who carried Saul's 
1SA.16.22	Saul sent a message to Jesse. He said, ‘David gives very much pleasure to me. Let him stay to become my servant.’
1SA.16.23	So, when the 
1SA.17.1	The 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the 
1SA.17.3	The 
1SA.17.4	The 
1SA.17.5	He wore a 
1SA.17.6	He had pieces of metal round the front of each leg. He had a 
1SA.17.7	The handle of his 
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and he shouted to the 
1SA.17.9	If he can kill me, the 
1SA.17.10	Then Goliath said again, ‘I am not afraid to stand against the army of 
1SA.17.11	Saul and the 
1SA.17.12	David was the son of Jesse. Jesse was from the family of Ephratah. He came from the town called Bethlehem which was in the land of 
1SA.17.13	Jesse's three oldest sons had gone to the war with Saul. Eliab was Jesse's oldest son. Abinadab was Jesse's second son. Shammah was Jesse's third son. 
1SA.17.14	David was Jesse's youngest son. Jesse's three oldest sons were with Saul. 
1SA.17.15	Sometimes David was with Saul. But sometimes he had to return to Bethlehem. He returned to 
1SA.17.16	Goliath shouted to the 
1SA.17.17	One day, Jesse said to his son David, ‘Here are 10 kilos (22 pounds) of 
1SA.17.18	Take these 10 cheeses to the officer who is the leader of their group. Find out whether your brothers are well. Bring me back news about them. 
1SA.17.19	Your brothers are with Saul and the 
1SA.17.20	So David got up early the next morning. He left the sheep with another 
1SA.17.21	The 
1SA.17.22	David left all his things with the officer who kept the army's food. David ran to the 
1SA.17.23	While David was talking to his brothers, Goliath, the great 
1SA.17.24	When the 
1SA.17.25	The 
1SA.17.26	David said to the men who were standing near him, ‘If a man kills Goliath, 
1SA.17.27	The men told David what they had said. They said, ‘This will be done to pay the man who kills Goliath.’
1SA.17.28	Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard David speaking with the men. Eliab was angry with David and Eliab asked him, ‘Why have you come here? You have a few sheep in the 
1SA.17.29	David said, ‘I do not know what I have done wrong. I only asked a question.’ 
1SA.17.30	So David went and he asked other people the same question. All the men gave the same answer. 
1SA.17.31	Some of the men had heard what David said. They went and they told Saul. Saul asked David to come to see him.
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, ‘I am your servant. Do not think that Goliath will bring trouble to Israel. I will go and I will fight him.’
1SA.17.33	Saul replied, ‘You cannot go and fight Goliath. You are only a young man. Goliath has been a strong soldier all of his life.’
1SA.17.34	But David said, ‘I have 
1SA.17.35	I ran after the 
1SA.17.36	I, your servant, have killed 
1SA.17.37	The 
1SA.17.37	Saul said to David, ‘Go. And I ask the 
1SA.17.38	Saul put his own clothes on David. He put his 
1SA.17.39	David put on the 
1SA.17.39	David said to Saul, ‘I cannot wear all this 
1SA.17.40	David picked up his 
1SA.17.41	Goliath walked towards David. A man walked in front of Goliath and the man was carrying Goliath's 
1SA.17.42	He saw that David was a handsome young man with brown skin. That made Goliath very angry.
1SA.17.43	He said to David, ‘I do not know why you have come with a stick. Perhaps you think that I am a dog.’ Then he asked his 
1SA.17.44	Then Goliath said, ‘Come here. I will feed the birds and the wild animals with your dead body.’
1SA.17.45	David said, ‘You have come to fight me with a 
1SA.17.46	Today the 
1SA.17.47	The 
1SA.17.48	Goliath started to move nearer to David to attack him. David ran quickly to meet him. 
1SA.17.49	David took a stone from his bag. He put the stone into the 
1SA.17.50	So David used a 
1SA.17.51	David ran and stood next to him. He took Goliath's 
1SA.17.52	The men from 
1SA.17.53	The 
1SA.17.54	David took Goliath's head into Jerusalem. But he put Goliath's 
1SA.17.55	Saul had watched David when he went out to fight Goliath. Abner was the most important officer in Saul's army. Saul said to Abner, ‘Abner, whose son is that young man?’
1SA.17.55	Abner replied, ‘My great king, I do not know.’
1SA.17.56	The king said, ‘Find out whose son he is.’
1SA.17.57	David returned after he had killed Goliath. Abner brought David to Saul. David was still holding Goliath's head.
1SA.17.58	Saul asked him, ‘Young man, who is your father?’
1SA.17.58	David answered, ‘I am the son of your servant Jesse who comes from Bethlehem.’
1SA.18.1	David finished talking with Saul. Then Jonathan, Saul's son, became a very good friend of David. Jonathan loved David as much as Jonathan loved himself. 
1SA.18.2	Saul kept David with him from that day. He did not let David go to his home in his father's house. 
1SA.18.3	Jonathan loved David so much that he made a special 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan was wearing a coat. He took the coat off and he gave it to David. He also gave his 
1SA.18.5	David did whatever Saul asked him to do. And he always did it well. So Saul made David an important officer in his army. That gave pleasure to all of Saul's officers and people.
1SA.18.6	After David had killed Goliath, he and the soldiers returned to their homes. Women came out from all the towns in 
1SA.18.7	They sang this while they danced:
1SA.18.7	‘Saul has killed thousands of his enemies.
1SA.18.7	And David has killed tens of thousands of his enemies.’
1SA.18.8	Saul did not like this song. He became very angry. He thought, ‘The women say that David has killed tens of thousands of men. But they say that I have only killed thousands of men. Perhaps they will want David as their king.’ 
1SA.18.9	Saul had bad thoughts about David after that. He watched David carefully.
1SA.18.10	The next day an 
1SA.18.11	Saul threw the 
1SA.18.12	The 
1SA.18.13	So Saul sent David away from him. He made David the leader of 1000 soldiers. David was their leader in their fights. 
1SA.18.14	David won all his fights because the 
1SA.18.15	Saul saw that David was a great soldier. Saul became more afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	All the people in Israel and Judah loved David because he was a good leader.
1SA.18.17	Saul said to David, ‘Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will let you marry her. But you must be a brave soldier and you must fight for the 
1SA.18.18	But David said to Saul, ‘I, my family and my father's 
1SA.18.19	When it was the time for Merab to marry David, Saul gave her to Adriel from Meholah, instead, as his wife.
1SA.18.20	Saul's daughter Michal loved David. When somebody told Saul about this, he was very happy. 
1SA.18.21	He thought, ‘I will let David marry her. She will cause danger for him. I will cause him to fight the 
1SA.18.22	Saul asked his servants to talk to David in a secret place. He asked them to say, ‘You have given pleasure to the king. His servants like you. You should now marry his daughter.’
1SA.18.23	Saul's servants said this to David. But David said, ‘It is a great 
1SA.18.24	Saul's servants told Saul what David had said. 
1SA.18.25	Saul said, ‘Tell David this. The king does not want him to pay money for his wife. He can pay for her with the 
1SA.18.26	Saul's servants told David these things. It made David happy to think that he could marry the king's daughter. They decided when they would marry each other. 
1SA.18.27	Before this time, David and his men went and they killed 200 
1SA.18.28	Saul understood that the 
1SA.18.29	Saul became more afraid of him. Saul was David's 
1SA.18.30	The 
1SA.19.1	Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and to all his servants. ‘You must kill David’, he said. But Jonathan liked David very much. 
1SA.19.2	So he told David, ‘My father Saul is trying to kill you. Be careful tomorrow morning. Hide in a secret place and stay there. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out. And I will stand with my father in the field where you are hiding. I will talk to him about you. Then I will tell you what I find out.’
1SA.19.4	Jonathan spoke to his father Saul. Jonathan said good things about David. Jonathan said, ‘The king should not do anything that is wrong. He should not 
1SA.19.5	David was not afraid to die when he killed Goliath the 
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to Jonathan. Then Saul said a promise in the 
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan 
1SA.19.8	The war with the 
1SA.19.9	But an 
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to push his 
1SA.19.11	Saul sent some of his servants to watch David's house. Saul said that they must kill David in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him about Saul's idea. She said, ‘You must go away tonight. If you do not go away, someone will kill you tomorrow.’ 
1SA.19.12	So Michal helped David to get down through a window. He ran away and they did not catch him. 
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took an 
1SA.19.14	Saul sent some men to bring David to him. Michal told them that David was ill. 
1SA.19.15	Saul told the men that they must return to David. And Saul said, ‘Bring David to me on his bed so that I can kill him.’ 
1SA.19.16	The men returned to David's house. They found the 
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, ‘You should have told me what was true. You let my enemy go away. He has run away.’ Michal replied, ‘David asked me to help him. He said, “I will kill you if you do not help me.” ’
1SA.19.18	David ran away and he was safe. He went to visit Samuel at Ramah. David told Samuel everything that Saul had done to him. Then David and Samuel went to Naioth and they stayed there.
1SA.19.19	Somebody told Saul that David was in Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.20	So Saul sent men to bring David to him. When the men arrived, they saw a group of 
1SA.19.21	When people told Saul about this, he sent more men. But they 
1SA.19.22	Then Saul himself went to Ramah. He went as far as the large well at Secu. He asked the people, ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ The people replied, ‘They are at Naioth in Ramah.’
1SA.19.23	Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God came and he caused even Saul to 
1SA.19.24	Then he took off his clothes and he 
1SA.20.1	Then David ran away from Naioth at Ramah. He went to Jonathan and asked him, ‘What bad things have I done? What have I done to hurt your father? Why is he trying to kill me?’
1SA.20.2	Jonathan replied, ‘No. You will not die. My father tells me everything that he does, even the little things. So it is not true! He would not hide this from me.’
1SA.20.3	But David answered, ‘Your father knows that you like me. He decided not to tell you. He knew that you would not be very happy. I promise that my words are true. I think that I will soon be dead.’
1SA.20.4	Jonathan said to David, ‘I will do anything that you want me to do.’
1SA.20.5	David said to Jonathan, ‘Tomorrow we have a special meal because of the new moon. I ought to go and eat this meal with the king. Instead, I will go and hide in the fields. I will stay there until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	Your father might see that I am not at the meal. If he does, you say, “David asked me to let him go to his home in Bethlehem. His father and brothers offer a 
1SA.20.7	Your father may say, “That is good.” If he says that, I am safe. And I will know that I am safe. But he may become very angry. If he does become angry, he has decided to hurt me. And you will know that he wants to do that. 
1SA.20.8	Jonathan, please be a good friend and be kind to me, your servant. The 
1SA.20.9	Jonathan said, ‘No, that will not happen. I will find out if my father wants to kill you. If he does, I will tell you.’
1SA.20.10	David said, ‘If your father gets angry tomorrow, how will you tell me?’
1SA.20.11	Jonathan said, ‘We should go out into the fields.’ So they went there together.
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, ‘I say this promise to you and to the 
1SA.20.13	But my father may want to hurt you. I promise the 
1SA.20.14	The 
1SA.20.15	The 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a 
1SA.20.17	Again, Jonathan asked David to say that he loved him. Jonathan loved David as much as Jonathan loved himself.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, ‘Tomorrow we will have the special meal because of the new moon. Nobody will be sitting in your chair. People will see that you are not there. 
1SA.20.19	Return to the place where you hid at the beginning of this trouble. Go there on the day after tomorrow. Wait by the rock called Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three 
1SA.20.21	Then I will send a boy to find the 
1SA.20.22	But I may say to the boy, “Look, the 
1SA.20.23	Always remember the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the field. Then it was time for the special meal because of the new moon. The king sat down to eat the meal. 
1SA.20.25	He sat by the wall in his usual place. Jonathan sat with his face towards him. Abner sat next to Saul. David's seat was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Saul did not say anything about it that day. Saul thought, ‘Perhaps something has happened to David that has made him not 
1SA.20.27	The next day was the second day of the month. David's seat was still empty at the meal. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, ‘Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal? He did not come yesterday or today.’ 
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered, ‘David asked me to let him go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, “Let me go. My family is having a 
1SA.20.30	Saul became very angry with Jonathan. Saul said, ‘You have done a very bad thing and you do not obey me. I know that you are David's friend. You have made your mother ashamed. You should be ashamed yourself. 
1SA.20.31	You will never be king while David is alive. You will never rule the people. Go and bring David to me now. He must die.’
1SA.20.32	Jonathan said, ‘Why must David die? What has he done that is wrong?’ 
1SA.20.33	But Saul threw a 
1SA.20.34	Jonathan was very angry. He got up from the table. He did not eat anything on that second day of the month. He was very sad because Saul had not given 
1SA.20.35	In the morning, Jonathan went out to the field to meet David. Jonathan took a young boy with him. 
1SA.20.36	He said to the boy, ‘Run. And find the 
1SA.20.37	The boy reached the place where the 
1SA.20.38	Then he shouted, ‘Hurry up. Go quickly. Do not stop.’ The boy picked up the 
1SA.20.39	(The boy did not know what this meant. Only Jonathan and David knew.) 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his bow and 
1SA.20.41	So the boy left. David came out from the south side of the rock. He went down on his knees in front of Jonathan. He put his face down on the ground three times. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other and they cried together. But David cried more than Jonathan did.
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, ‘Go and God will keep you safe. We promised the 
1SA.21.1	David went and he visited Ahimelech the 
1SA.21.2	David answered, ‘The king has asked me to do something special. He said to me, “Do not say to anyone where I have sent you. Do not say what you have to do.” And I have sent my men to meet me at a certain place. 
1SA.21.3	Do you have anything to eat here? Give to me 5 loaves of bread or anything else that you have.’
1SA.21.4	The 
1SA.21.5	David replied, ‘We have not been near women since we started our journey. The young men always keep themselves 
1SA.21.6	So the 
1SA.21.7	One of Saul's servants was there that day. He had to remain for a longer time than usual near the place where the 
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelech, ‘Do you have a 
1SA.21.9	Ahimelech answered, ‘The 
1SA.21.9	David said, ‘Give it to me. There is no 
1SA.21.10	Saul did not catch David that day. David went to Achish who was the king of the town called Gath. 
1SA.21.11	But the servants of King Achish said to him, ‘This man is David, the king of the 
1SA.21.12	David became very serious. He thought about what the servants said. Then he became very afraid of Achish, king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	When David was near the king or his servants, David did strange things. He was like a man with a sick mind. He made marks on the doors of the gate. He did not keep water in his mouth but he let it go all down his beard.
1SA.21.14	Achish said to his servants, ‘Look at that man. He is like a crazy man. Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	I have enough crazy men already. I do not need to see another one. And I do not want this man to come into my house.’
1SA.22.1	David left Gath and he went to a big hole in the rock near Adullam. His brothers and his father's family discovered where he had gone. So they all went to visit him. 
1SA.22.2	Everybody who had troubles went to David. Everybody who had debts also went to him. And everyone who was not happy went to him. About 400 men went to David and he became their leader. 
1SA.22.3	David then went to the town called Mizpah. It was in the country called Moab. David said to the king of Moab, ‘Please let my father and my mother stay with you for a short time. I need to learn how God will help.’ 
1SA.22.4	So David left his parents with the king of Moab. They stayed with the king all the time that David hid in the safe place.
1SA.22.5	Gad the 
1SA.22.6	Then people told Saul that someone had found David and his men. Saul was on the hill near Gibeah. He was sitting under a large tree. He was holding a 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to them, ‘Men from the 
1SA.22.8	So I do not know why you have decided to go against me. Nobody tells me when my son says a special promise with the son of Jesse. Nobody thinks about what could happen to me. Nobody tells me that my son is now against me. He has agreed that one of my servants should kill me.’
1SA.22.9	But Doeg, from the country called Edom, was standing with Saul's officers. Doeg said, ‘I saw the son of Jesse. He came to the town called Nob and he visited Ahimelech. Ahimelech is the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech asked the 
1SA.22.11	Then King Saul asked them to bring to him the 
1SA.22.12	Saul said, ‘Listen to me, son of Ahitub.’
1SA.22.12	Ahimelech answered, ‘Yes, master.’
1SA.22.13	Saul said to him, ‘You and the son of Jesse seem to be trying to kill me! You gave bread and a 
1SA.22.14	Ahimelech answered, ‘David is the most 
1SA.22.15	I have prayed to God on David's behalf many times in past times. This was not the first time. King Saul, do not say that my family or I have done anything wrong. We do not know anything about what is happening.’
1SA.22.16	King Saul said, ‘Ahimelech, you and all your brothers and their families must die.’
1SA.22.17	Then the king said to the officers who were round him, ‘Go and kill the 
1SA.22.17	But the king's officers refused to attack the 
1SA.22.18	So the king said to Doeg, ‘Go and kill the 
1SA.22.19	He also killed all the people in the town called Nob, which was the town of the 
1SA.22.20	But the king did not catch Abiathar. He was a son of Ahimelech (who was the son of Ahitub). Abiathar ran away and he met David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the 
1SA.22.22	David said to him, ‘When I went to the town called Nob, Doeg was there too. I knew that he would tell Saul about me. I have caused the death of everybody who lives in your father's house. 
1SA.22.23	Stay here with me. Do not be afraid. Saul wants to kill you and he wants to kill me too. You will be safe with me.’
1SA.23.1	The 
1SA.23.2	So David asked the 
1SA.23.2	The 
1SA.23.3	But David's men said to him, ‘We are afraid here in 
1SA.23.4	So David asked the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah. They fought the 
1SA.23.6	(When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech ran away, he came to David at Keilah. And he brought the 
1SA.23.7	Someone told Saul that David was now at Keilah. Saul said, ‘God has given David to me. David has gone into a town that has a strong gate. He cannot leave.’ 
1SA.23.8	So Saul caused all his soldiers to join him. They prepared to go to Keilah and to attack David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	Somebody told David that Saul was preparing to attack him. David said to Abiathar, ‘Bring the 
1SA.23.10	David prayed, ‘
1SA.23.11	Will the people in Keilah give me to Saul? Will Saul really come here? 
1SA.23.11	The 
1SA.23.12	David asked the 
1SA.23.12	And the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his 600 men left Keilah. They had to move from one place to another all the time. People told Saul that David had left Keilah. So Saul did not go there.
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the safe places in the 
1SA.23.15	David was at Horesh in the empty places near Ziph. And somebody told him that Saul was coming to kill him. 
1SA.23.16	Jonathan, Saul's son, went to visit David at Horesh. He told David that God would help him to be strong. 
1SA.23.17	Jonathan said to David, ‘Do not be afraid. My father will not hurt you. My father knows that you will be the next king of 
1SA.23.18	Jonathan and David said a promise together with the 
1SA.23.19	Some people from Ziph went to visit Saul at Gibeah. They said to Saul, ‘David is hiding among us. He is on the hill at Hachilah. He is there in the safe place at Horesh. It is south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.20	Now, King Saul, you can come to our land at any time. We must help you to catch David.’
1SA.23.21	Saul replied, ‘I ask the 
1SA.23.22	Return to your homes and make sure about David. Find out where he usually stays. Find the people who have seen him there. People have told me that David is very clever. 
1SA.23.23	Find all the places where he hides. Then return. Tell me everything that you have discovered. Then I will come with you. I will find David if he is still near here. I will look all through the land of 
1SA.23.24	So the people returned to Ziph before Saul. David and his men were in the 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his men started to look for David. Somebody told David about this. He and his men stayed in the 
1SA.23.26	Saul and his men were going along one side of the mountain. David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. They were trying to hide from Saul. Saul and his army were getting nearer to David and his men. They were all round David and his men. They wanted to catch them. 
1SA.23.27	But a man came and he gave this message to Saul, ‘Come quickly. The 
1SA.23.28	So Saul stopped running after David. Instead, Saul went to fight the 
1SA.23.29	David left that place and he lived in the safe places at Engedi.
1SA.24.1	When Saul had finished fighting the 
1SA.24.2	So Saul chose 3000 of the best soldiers in 
1SA.24.3	Saul came to the places where they kept the sheep, near to the road. There was a big hole in the hill near to this place. Saul went into it to use it as a toilet. David and his men were sitting at the back of this hole and they were hiding. 
1SA.24.4	The men said to David, ‘This is the day that the 
1SA.24.5	After that, David felt sorry that he had cut a piece of cloth from Saul's coat. 
1SA.24.6	David said to his men, ‘I am praying that the 
1SA.24.7	David spoke like this so that his men would not attack Saul. David did not let them do it. Saul left the hole in the hill and he continued to go on his journey.
1SA.24.8	Then David went out of the hole and he shouted to Saul, ‘My master and my king!’ Saul looked behind him. David went down on his knees. He bent down so that his face touched the ground. 
1SA.24.9	David said to Saul, ‘You should not listen to the people who say, “David wants to hurt you.” 
1SA.24.10	Today the 
1SA.24.11	Look, my father. I have a small piece of your coat. I cut this off the corner of your coat but I did not kill you. Please know that I have not 
1SA.24.12	The 
1SA.24.13	You know that people often say, “
1SA.24.14	I do not know whom you have come to fight. I do not know whom you are running after. Perhaps you think that I am like a dead dog or a little insect! 
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	When David stopped speaking, Saul asked, ‘Is that really you, David my son?’ Then Saul started to cry aloud. 
1SA.24.17	Saul said, ‘You are a better man than I am. You have been good to me. But I have done bad things to you. 
1SA.24.18	You have told me all the good things that you did to me. The 
1SA.24.19	If a person finds his 
1SA.24.20	Now I know that you will be the king of 
1SA.24.21	Please promise the 
1SA.24.22	So David promised that to Saul. Saul went to his home. But David and his men returned to the safe place.
1SA.25.1	Then Samuel died. All the 
1SA.25.2+1SA.25.3	A very rich man lived at Paran. His name was Nabal. He came from the family of Caleb. His wife's name was Abigail. Nabal had some land near Carmel. He had 3000 sheep and 1000 goats. He was cutting the hair from his sheep at Carmel. Abigail was a beautiful and clever woman. But Nabal was a cruel man who did not give anything to anybody.
1SA.25.4	David was in the 
1SA.25.5	So David sent 10 young men to the town called Carmel. He said that they must find Nabal. Then they must tell him that David said ‘hello’. 
1SA.25.6	David asked the young men to say, ‘David hopes that you are well. He wants you to have no trouble. He wants your family to have no trouble. He wants everything that you have to be safe. 
1SA.25.7	People told David that you were cutting the hair from your sheep. Your 
1SA.25.8	Your servants will tell you that, if you ask them. We have come on the day when you have a special meal. So, please be kind to David's young men. And please give whatever you can to the young men and to your son David.’
1SA.25.9	David's men arrived at Carmel and they gave the message to Nabal. They waited for Nabal to reply. 
1SA.25.10	Nabal answered David's young men, ‘I do not know who David is. Nobody has told me about this son of Jesse. Many slaves run away from their masters these days. 
1SA.25.11	I have bread and water. And I have killed some animals. But this is all for the men who are cutting the hair from my sheep. I will not give anything to men that I do not know.’
1SA.25.12	David's men returned to David. They told him everything that Nabal had said. 
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, ‘Put your 
1SA.25.14	One of Nabal's servants spoke to Abigail (Nabal's wife). He said, ‘David sent some of his men from the 
1SA.25.15	These men were very good to us. They did not hurt us. They did not take anything from us while we were out in the fields with them. 
1SA.25.16	They kept us safe while we stayed with the sheep. They kept us safe during the day and at night. 
1SA.25.17	Please think about this. And decide what to do. Very great trouble will happen to our master and to all his family and servants. Our master is such a bad man that he will not listen to anyone.’
1SA.25.18	Abigail quickly got some food. She got 200 loaves of bread, 2 animal skins of 
1SA.25.19	She said to her servants, ‘You go first and I will follow you.’ But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
1SA.25.20	Abigail rode her 
1SA.25.21	David had just said, ‘I do not know why I kept Nabal's people and animals safe in the 
1SA.25.22	I will certainly go and kill all the men in Nabal's family by tomorrow morning.’
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David she quickly got off her 
1SA.25.24	She was near his feet. She said to David, ‘My master, be angry only with me. I am your servant. Please listen to what I say. 
1SA.25.25	Please do not think about that bad man Nabal. His name means fool and he is a fool. I, your servant, did not see the young men that you sent. 
1SA.25.26	Now the 
1SA.25.27	My master, please accept this gift that I have brought for you and for your men. 
1SA.25.28	I am your servant. I have done wrong things. Please 
1SA.25.29	Someone may run after you and try to kill you. But the 
1SA.25.30	One day the 
1SA.25.31	When that happens, you will not feel sorry about anything. You have not killed good people. And you have not tried to 
1SA.25.32	David said to Abigail, ‘I 
1SA.25.33	I pray that the 
1SA.25.34	The 
1SA.25.35	David accepted Abigail's gift. He said to her, ‘Go to your home and do not be afraid. I have listened to what you have said. And I will do what you have asked for.’
1SA.25.36	Abigail returned to Nabal. He had prepared a big meal. It was so good that a king could eat it. He had drunk too much 
1SA.25.37	The next morning Nabal was well again. So Abigail told him all that had she had done. Nabal's heart failed and he became like a stone. 
1SA.25.38	About 10 days after that, the 
1SA.25.39	Somebody told David that Nabal had died. David said, ‘I 
1SA.25.39	Then David sent a message to Abigail. He asked her to marry him. 
1SA.25.40	David's servants went to Carmel and they said to Abigail, ‘David has sent us to you. We must take you to David so that he can marry you.’
1SA.25.41	Abigail went on her knees and her face touched the ground. She said, ‘I am his servant. I will wash the feet of David's servants.’ 
1SA.25.42	Abigail quickly got on to a 
1SA.25.43	David had married Ahinoam from the town called Jezreel. So these two women became his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Saul's daughter Michal had been David's wife. But Saul had given her to Palti as his wife. Palti was the son of Laish who came from the town called Gallim.
1SA.26.1	Some men from Ziph went to visit Saul at Gibeah. They said, ‘David is hiding on the hill called Hachilah which is across the valley from Jeshimon.’
1SA.26.2	So Saul went to the 
1SA.26.3	Saul and his men came to the hill called Hachilah They put their 
1SA.26.4	So David sent some men to see if that was true. They discovered that Saul was at Hachilah.
1SA.26.5	David went to the place where Saul was staying. Saul was asleep in the middle of the 
1SA.26.6	David spoke to Ahimelech and Abishai. Ahimelech came from the 
1SA.26.6	Abishai said, ‘I will come with you.’
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai went among Saul's 
1SA.26.8	Abishai said to David, ‘Tonight God has given your 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, ‘Do not kill Saul. The 
1SA.26.10	I know that the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the 
1SA.26.13	David and Abishai went across the valley to the other side of the hill. David went to the top of the hill. He was a long way away from Saul's soldiers. 
1SA.26.14	David shouted to Saul's army. He shouted to Abner, who was the son of Ner, ‘Abner, can you hear me?’
1SA.26.14	Abner replied, ‘Who is shouting to the king? Who are you?’
1SA.26.15	David replied to Abner, ‘Are you really a great man in 
1SA.26.16	You have failed to keep him safe. I know that you and your men ought to die. The 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognised David's voice. Saul said, ‘Is that you David, my son?’
1SA.26.17	David answered, ‘Yes my master and my king. I am David.’ 
1SA.26.18	David also said, ‘Why are you running after me, my master? What have I done? Have I done something that is wrong? 
1SA.26.19	My master and my king, please listen to me. Has the 
1SA.26.20	Do not let me die a long way away from the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, ‘I have 
1SA.26.22	David said, ‘Here is your 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	I did not want to kill you today. I pray that the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, ‘I pray that the 
1SA.26.25	So David continued to go on his journey and Saul returned to his home.
1SA.27.1	Then David thought, ‘I am sure that Saul will kill me one day. But I have a good idea. I will go to the country of the 
1SA.27.2	So David and his 600 men left 
1SA.27.3	David, his men, and their families lived in Gath with Achish. David had his two wives with him. One wife was Ahinoam. She came from the town called Jezreel. His other wife was Abigail, whose husband Nabal was dead. She came from the town called Carmel. 
1SA.27.4	People told Saul that David had run away to Gath. So Saul stopped looking for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, ‘Are you happy with me? If you are, I do not need to live in the king's town with you. Please let me have a town somewhere else in this country where I can live.’
1SA.27.6	That day, King Achish gave the town called Ziklag to David. Since then Ziklag has been part of the king of 
1SA.27.7	David lived in the country of the 
1SA.27.8	During that time David and his men attacked the 
1SA.27.9	When David attacked them, he killed all the men and women. But he took all their sheep, cows, 
1SA.27.10	Achish asked David, ‘Which place did you go and attack today?’ Sometimes David would tell him that he had gone to the south part of 
1SA.27.11	David killed everyone in the places that he attacked. He never took anyone back to the town called Gath. So nobody could tell Achish what David had really done. 
1SA.27.12	Achish believed what David had said. Achish thought, ‘The 
1SA.28.1	After that, the 
1SA.28.2	David said, ‘Yes, I am your servant. You will see what I can do.’
1SA.28.2	Achish replied, ‘Good. Until you die, you will stay near to me to keep me safe.’
1SA.28.3	Samuel was dead by this time. All the 
1SA.28.4	The 
1SA.28.5	Saul saw the 
1SA.28.6	Saul asked the 
1SA.28.7	So Saul said to his servants, ‘Go. Find a woman who can talk with dead people. I will go to her. I will ask her what will happen.’
1SA.28.7	His servants said, ‘There is a woman at the town called Endor who can do that.’
1SA.28.8	Saul changed his clothes. So nobody recognised that he was the king. At night, Saul and two of his men went to see the woman. Saul said, ‘Bring up a certain dead man. Talk to him on my behalf.’
1SA.28.9	But the woman said, ‘You know what King Saul has done. He has removed all the people who try to talk to dead people from 
1SA.28.10	Then Saul said a serious promise to the woman. He said, ‘Nobody will 
1SA.28.11	The woman said, ‘Whom should I bring here?’
1SA.28.11	Saul replied, ‘Bring Samuel.’
1SA.28.12	The woman screamed when she saw Samuel. She said to Saul, ‘You did not say what was true. You are King Saul.’
1SA.28.13	King Saul said to her, ‘Do not be afraid. Tell me what you can see.’
1SA.28.13	She said, ‘I can see a 
1SA.28.14	Saul asked, ‘What kind of person?’
1SA.28.14	She said, ‘An old man is coming up from the ground. He is wearing a special coat.’
1SA.28.14	Saul knew that this was Samuel. Saul went on his knees and his face touched the ground.
1SA.28.15	Samuel said, ‘Why have you caused me to come to you? Why have you brought me back?’
1SA.28.15	Saul said, ‘I have a lot of trouble. The 
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, ‘The 
1SA.28.17	I told you what the 
1SA.28.18	The 
1SA.28.19	The 
1SA.28.20	Saul immediately fell on his face to the ground. He was afraid because of what Samuel had said. Saul was also very weak because he had eaten nothing all that day and night.
1SA.28.21	Then the woman came to Saul. She saw that he was very afraid. She said, ‘I, your servant, have obeyed you. I did what you asked me to do. And I might have died because I did it. 
1SA.28.22	Please listen to me now. I want to give you some food to eat. Then you will be stronger. And you will be able to travel.’
1SA.28.23	Saul refused and he said, ‘I will not eat.’
1SA.28.23	But the woman and Saul's servants repeated that he must eat. So Saul did what they said. He got up from the ground and he sat down on a bed.
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fat young cow. She went quickly and she killed it. Then she took some flour and she made some flat bread. 
1SA.28.25	She gave the food to Saul and to his men and they ate it. They left her house while it was still night.
1SA.29.1	The 
1SA.29.2	The 
1SA.29.3	The 
1SA.29.3	Achish said, ‘This is David. He was King Saul's servant. But he came to me more than a year ago. I have not found anything that was wrong with David since then.’
1SA.29.4	But the 
1SA.29.5	The 
1SA.29.5	“Saul has killed thousands of his enemies.
1SA.29.5	And David has killed tens of thousands of his enemies”.’
1SA.29.6	So Achish asked to meet David. He said, ‘I know that the 
1SA.29.7	So return to your home and be happy. Do not make the other 
1SA.29.8	David said, ‘What have I done that is wrong? Have you found anything wrong in me since I joined you? You are my master, the king. I want to go and to fight your enemies.’
1SA.29.9	Achish said, ‘I know that you are as good as an 
1SA.29.10	You and your master's servants must leave early tomorrow morning. You must get up early in the morning. Then, when it is light, you must go.’
1SA.29.11	So David and his men got up early in the morning. They returned to Ziklag. And the 
1SA.30.1	David and his men arrived at Ziklag three days after they left Achish. The 
1SA.30.2	They took women and everyone whether they were important or not important. They took them away but they did not kill anyone.
1SA.30.3	David and his men arrived at Ziklag. They saw that the 
1SA.30.4	David and his men cried aloud. They continued to cry until they were too weak to cry any more. 
1SA.30.5	David had two wives. One wife was Ahinoam from Jezreel. The other wife was Abigail. She had been the wife of Nabal from Carmel. The 
1SA.30.6	David was very, very sad because his men wanted to throw stones at him. They wanted to kill him. His men were very angry because they had lost their sons and their daughters. But David believed that the 
1SA.30.7	Then David spoke to Abiathar the 
1SA.30.8	David asked the 
1SA.30.8	The 
1SA.30.9+1SA.30.10	So David and his 600 men went out. They arrived at the Besor valley. Some of the men were too tired to go on across the valley. So 200 men remained by the river. David and 400 men continued to run after the 
1SA.30.11	David's men found a man from Egypt in a field. They took him to David. They gave to the man some water to drink and food to eat. 
1SA.30.12	They gave to him some 
1SA.30.13	David asked the man, ‘Who is your master? Where do you come from?’
1SA.30.13	He answered, ‘I come from the country called Egypt. I am a slave of an 
1SA.30.14	We attacked the south part of the land of the people called Cherethites. And we attacked the land of 
1SA.30.15	David said, ‘Can you take me to where these men are now?’
1SA.30.15	The man from Egypt answered, ‘I will do it if you say a promise to me. Do it while God watches us. Promise that you will not kill me. And promise that you will not send me back to my master.’
1SA.30.16	So he took David to the 
1SA.30.17	That evening, David fought the 
1SA.30.18	David got back everything that the 
1SA.30.19	The people had lost nothing. David brought everyone back, the young people and the old people, the sons and the daughters. He also brought back the valuable things and everything that the 
1SA.30.20	David took all the sheep and cows and animals. His men caused all these animals to go on in front of them. They said, ‘These animals are for David.’
1SA.30.21	David returned to the 200 men who had stayed by the Besor valley. These men had been too tired to go with David. David met the men at the river valley and he said ‘hello’ to them. 
1SA.30.22	But some of the men with David were bad men. They wanted to cause trouble. They said, ‘These men did not come with us. We will not give to them any of the things that we have brought back. Each man can have only his wife and his children. Then he must go.’
1SA.30.23	David replied, ‘No, my brothers. You cannot do that. The 
1SA.30.24	Nobody will agree with what you say. Each person will receive an equal part. Some men stayed with the 
1SA.30.25	David made this rule into a 
1SA.30.26	David arrived at Ziklag with all the things that they had taken from the 
1SA.30.27+1SA.30.28+1SA.30.29+1SA.30.30+1SA.30.31	David sent some gifts to the leaders in all these places:

1SA.30.27+1SA.30.28+1SA.30.29+1SA.30.30+1SA.30.31	David and his men had lived in many places. So, David sent some gifts to the people who lived in all those places.
1SA.31.1	The 
1SA.31.2	The 
1SA.31.3	The 
1SA.31.4	Saul spoke to the officer who carried his 
1SA.31.5	The officer saw that Saul was dead. So, the officer fell on the sharp end of his

2SA.1.1	David won the fight with the 
2SA.1.2	The next day, a man came from Saul's 
2SA.1.3	‘Where have you come from?’ David asked him.
2SA.1.3	‘I have run from the 
2SA.1.4	‘Tell me what happened’, David said.
2SA.1.4	The man replied, ‘The men ran away and the enemy killed many of them. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.’
2SA.1.5	Then David asked the young man who had said this, ‘How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?’
2SA.1.6	The young man said, ‘I was on the mountain called Gilboa. And I saw Saul. He was only standing up with the help of his 
2SA.1.7	He turned round and he saw me. He shouted to me. I said “What can I do for you?”
2SA.1.8	“Who are you?” he asked me.
2SA.1.8	“I am an 
2SA.1.9	“Stand over me and kill me”, he said. “I am nearly dead but I am still alive.”
2SA.1.10	He would die if he fell down. I knew that. So I stood over him and I killed him. And I took the 
2SA.1.11	Then David and all the men that were with him took their clothes. And they tore them. 
2SA.1.12	They cried and they wept until the evening. And they did not eat any food. They were very sad about Saul and Jonathan and the 
2SA.1.13	‘Where are you from?’ David asked the young man who had brought him the report.
2SA.1.13	‘I am the son of a foreign man, an

2SA.1.18	He said that the people in Judah should teach this war song to all Judah's men. (It is written in the Book of Jashar.) 
2SA.1.19	‘They have killed the best men from Israel on the mountains.

2SA.2.1	David asked, ‘Where should I go?’
2SA.2.1	‘To Hebron’, the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there with his two wives. They were Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, Nabal's

2SA.2.4	Then the men in the 
2SA.2.5	So David sent men to them with a message. The message was, ‘You were kind to Saul your master; you buried his dead body. So I pray that the 
2SA.2.6	I pray that the 
2SA.2.7	Now be strong and brave because Saul, your master, is dead. And the people of Judah have chosen me as king over them.’
2SA.2.8	Abner, son of Ner, was the ruler of Saul's army. He took Ishbosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.9	He caused him to rule over Gilead, Asher and Jezreel. He also caused him to rule over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was 40 years old when he became king over Israel. And he ruled Israel for two years. But Judah's people let David rule over them. 
2SA.2.11	David remained in Hebron as king of Judah for 7 years and 6 months.
2SA.2.12	Then Abner, son of Ner, left Mahanaim and he brought the servants of Saul's son, Ishbosheth to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab, Zeruiah's son, went with David's men to meet them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat on one side of the pool while the other group sat on the other side.
2SA.2.14	Then Abner spoke to Joab. ‘I think that some of the young men should stand up. And they should fight in front of us’, he said.
2SA.2.14	‘Yes, they can do that’, said Joab.
2SA.2.15	So they stood up. They counted 12 men for Benjamin and Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and 12 men for David. 
2SA.2.16	Then each man took hold of his enemy's head and pushed his sharp knife into his side. So they fell down together. So people called that place, which is in Gibeon, Helkath Hazzurim. 
2SA.2.17	They fought very strongly on that day. And David's men won the fight with Abner's men from Israel.
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there. They were Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as the fastest wild animal. 
2SA.2.19	He ran after Abner and he did not turn away from him. He did not turn to the right or to the left. 
2SA.2.20	Abner looked behind him and he asked, ‘Is that you, Asahel?’
2SA.2.20	‘It is’, he answered.
2SA.2.21	Then Abner said to him, ‘Turn away to the right or to the left and follow a young man. If you do that, you can take his arms.’ But Asahel would not stop running after Abner.
2SA.2.22	Abner spoke again. ‘Stop running after me. I do not want to knock you down to the ground and kill you. I would never be able to look at your brother Joab again!’
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to stop following Abner. So Abner pushed the end of his 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai continued to run after Abner. They came to the hill of Ammah near Giah when it was almost the end of the day. That was near to the 
2SA.2.25	Then Benjamin's men came to be with Abner and they all became one group. And they stood together at the top of a hill.
2SA.2.26	Abner shouted to Joab, ‘We might continue to kill like this for all time! The end of this will only make us all very sad. Surely you should tell your men that they must stop killing their brothers now.’
2SA.2.27	‘God lives!’ Joab replied. ‘If you had not spoken, our men would have stopped following yours in the morning.’
2SA.2.28	So Joab caused the 
2SA.2.29	Abner and his men marched all that night through the Arabah and they crossed the River Jordan. They continued to march through the valley to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	Then Joab returned and he brought all his men together. And Asahel and 19 other servants of David were not there because they were dead. 
2SA.2.31	But David's men had killed 360 men from Benjamin who were with Abner. 
2SA.2.32	They took Asahel's dead body and they buried it next to his father's dead body at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and they arrived at Hebron at sunrise.
2SA.3.1	David's people and Saul's people continued to fight each other and there was war for a long time. David became stronger and stronger but Saul's people became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	While David was in Hebron he had several sons.
2SA.3.2	First was Amnon, son of Ahinoam from Jezreel.
2SA.3.3	The second son was Chileab, son of Abigail, Nabal's 
2SA.3.3	The third son was Absalom, son of Maacah. Maacah was the daughter of Talmai, King of Geshur.
2SA.3.4	The fourth son was Adonijah, son of Haggith.
2SA.3.4	The fifth son was Shephatiah, son of Abital.
2SA.3.5	The sixth son was Ithream, son of David's wife, Eglah.
2SA.3.5	David had these sons in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	Abner was trying to make himself more important to Saul's people. He did that while Saul's people were fighting against David's people. 
2SA.3.7	Saul had had among his women one woman called Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. Ishbosheth asked Abner, ‘Why did you sleep with my father's woman?’ 
2SA.3.8	Abner was very angry because of what Ishbosheth had said. ‘You cannot think that I would leave you to become David's servant! I have always been a servant to Saul and to his family and his friends to this day. I have helped you in your fight against David. But now you think that I have turned against you because of this woman. 
2SA.3.9	Now I will help David to get what the 
2SA.3.10	The 
2SA.3.11	And Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he did not speak another word to him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent men to David with this message: ‘Who should rule this country? If you and I can agree a 
2SA.3.13	‘Good!’ said David. ‘I will agree a 
2SA.3.14	Then David sent men to Ishbosheth, son of Saul with this message: ‘Give me my wife, Michal. I paid 100 
2SA.3.15	So Ishbosheth sent men to take her from her husband, Paltiel son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	But her husband came with her. He wept while he followed her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, ‘Return to your home!’ So he returned.
2SA.3.17	Abner and the leaders of Israel talked together. He said, ‘You wanted David to be your king before now. 
2SA.3.18	So now do it! Remember that the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also went himself to speak to the men from Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron. He went to tell David what Israel's people and the 
2SA.3.20	Abner came to David in Hebron and 20 men came with him. And David prepared a 
2SA.3.21	Then Abner spoke to David. ‘Let me go now to bring all the people in Israel together for my 
2SA.3.22	David's men and Joab were attacking some of the enemy's soldiers. Then they returned. They brought with them a lot of things that they had taken from the enemy. But Abner had left Hebron because David had sent him away in 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all his soldiers arrived, they told him, ‘Abner, the son of Ner has come to the king. And he has sent him away in 
2SA.3.24	Joab went to the king. He said, ‘I do not understand what you have done. Abner came to you. You should not have let him go. Now he is gone. 
2SA.3.25	You know what this son of Ner is like. He came to find out everything possible about what you were doing. He wanted you to think that he was your friend.’
2SA.3.26	Then Joab left David and Joab sent men to run after Abner with a message. They brought him from the well at Sirah. But David did not know that. 
2SA.3.27	Abner returned to Hebron. Then Joab took him away from the other people. He brought him inside the gate to speak with him alone. There Joab pushed his knife into Abner's stomach. He did it to 
2SA.3.28	After that, people told David about it. He said, ‘The 
2SA.3.29	I hope that this will cause Joab and all his father's family to have trouble! There should always be someone in his family with a bleeding place on his body or 
2SA.3.30	Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel. He killed Asahel in the fight at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	David spoke to Joab and to all the people with him. ‘Tear your clothes and put on rough clothes. Then walk in front of Abner's dead body to show how sad you are’, he said. King David himself walked behind Abner's dead body. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron. And the king wept loudly when they put Abner's dead body under the ground. And all the people wept.
2SA.3.33	The king sang a sad song for Abner.
2SA.3.33	‘Abner should not have died like a fool.
2SA.3.34	Nobody had tied your hands or your feet.
2SA.3.34	You have fallen like someone that 
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept again for him.
2SA.3.35	Then all the people came and they asked David to eat some food before the end of the day. But David said, ‘God should 
2SA.3.36	All the people heard this, and it gave them pleasure. Like everything that the king did, it gave pleasure to all the people. 
2SA.3.37	So, on that day all the people in Israel knew that David had not caused the death of Abner. (Abner was the son of Ner.)
2SA.3.38	The king said to his servants, ‘You must understand that a great leader has died today in Israel. 
2SA.3.39	I am the king that God has 
2SA.4.1	People told Saul's son that Abner had died in Hebron. Then he became very afraid. And all the people in Israel were afraid. 
2SA.4.2	Saul's son had two men, Baanah and Rechab, who were leaders of small groups of soldiers. Their father was Rimmon from Beeroth, of Benjamin's 
2SA.4.3	The people from Beeroth ran away to Gittaim. So Beeroth's people still live there but they are like foreign people. 
2SA.4.4	Saul's son, Jonathan had a son with two bad feet. When he was 5 years old, the news from Jezreel about Saul and Jonathan reached them. His nurse lifted the boy into her arms and she ran away. But as she ran, he fell. And his feet became hurt. His name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	The sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, called Rechab and Baanah, left to go to Ishbosheth's house. They arrived in the hot time of the day. And Ishbosheth was resting on his bed at midday. 
2SA.4.6	They went inside the house and they were carrying some 
2SA.4.7	Ishbosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom when they went into his house. When they had killed him they cut off his head. They took it with them and they went through the Arabah. They travelled all night. 
2SA.4.8	They brought Ishbosheth's head to David in Hebron. They said to the king, ‘Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, who was always attacking you. Saul tried to kill you. Today the 
2SA.4.9	David spoke to Rechab and his brother Baanah, Rimmon's sons from Beeroth, ‘The 
2SA.4.10	When a man told me, “Saul is dead”, he thought that he was bringing me good news. But I took him and I caused my servants to kill him in Ziklag. That was the gift that I gave him for his news. 
2SA.4.11	But you 
2SA.4.12	So David told his young men that they must kill them. So they did kill them. They cut off their hands and their feet. They hung the dead bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took Ishbosheth's head and they buried it next to Abner's dead body in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	All the 
2SA.5.2	When Saul was king over us, some time ago, you were the leader of his army in the wars. And the 
2SA.5.3	David agreed with the leaders of Israel when they came to him at Hebron. They made promises to each other in front of the 
2SA.5.4	David was 30 years old when he became king. And he was king over Israel for 40 years. 
2SA.5.5	He ruled over Judah in Hebron for 7 years and 6 months. And in Jerusalem he ruled over all Israel and Judah for 33 years.
2SA.5.6	The king and his soldiers marched to Jerusalem. They wanted to win it from the 
2SA.5.6	They thought, ‘David cannot get in here.’
2SA.5.7	But they were wrong! David did win the strong city, Zion, that he called ‘The City of David’.
2SA.5.8	On that day, David said, ‘Some enemies cannot see and some enemies cannot walk well. David 
2SA.5.8	That is why people say, ‘Anybody who cannot see must not go into the house. And anybody who cannot walk well must not go into the house.’
2SA.5.9	Then David came to live in the strong tall building and he called it the City of David. He built more houses round it to the edge of the hill. 
2SA.5.10	David became more and more powerful because the 
2SA.5.11	Then Hiram, King of Tyre, sent men to David with wood from 
2SA.5.12	So David knew that the 
2SA.5.13	After he had left Hebron, David married more wives. And he took more ladies to live with him. They lived in Jerusalem and they gave David more sons and daughters. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	People told the 
2SA.5.18	The 
2SA.5.19	Then David asked the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he won the fight. He said, ‘The 
2SA.5.21	The 
2SA.5.22	Again the 
2SA.5.23	So David asked the 
2SA.5.24	When you hear a noise in the tops of the trees like marching men, go quickly to attack them. Do that because the 
2SA.5.25	So David did as the 
2SA.6.1	David chose 30,000 of the best soldiers in Israel. 
2SA.6.2	David brought them with him to Baalah in Judah. He wanted to bring God's 
2SA.6.3	They put the 
2SA.6.4	And they took the 
2SA.6.5	David and all Israel's people were singing as well as they could. And they were dancing as well as they could. They meant that the 
2SA.6.6	They came to the place where Nacon always hit his 
2SA.6.7	The 
2SA.6.8	Then David was angry because the 
2SA.6.9	On that day, David became afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	He did not want to take the 
2SA.6.11	The 
2SA.6.12	People told King David, ‘The 
2SA.6.13	The men who were carrying it walked 6 steps. Then David 
2SA.6.14	David wore a 
2SA.6.15	That is how he and all Israel brought the 
2SA.6.16	While they where bringing the 
2SA.6.17	David had put up a 
2SA.6.18	After he finished this, he 
2SA.6.19	Then he gave a gift to every man and woman in the crowd of the 
2SA.6.20	When David returned to his home to 
2SA.6.21	David said to Michal, ‘I was 
2SA.6.22	I will make myself even less important than this, and I will make myself seem very small to myself. But I will seem very great to the slave girls that you spoke about.’
2SA.6.23	And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no children all her life.
2SA.7.1	The king was living in his special king's house. And the 
2SA.7.2	Then the king spoke to Nathan the 
2SA.7.3	Nathan replied to the king, ‘Do what you think is right. The 
2SA.7.4	But that night the 
2SA.7.5	‘Go and speak to my servant David. Tell him that the 
2SA.7.5	“You are not the man to build a house for me to live in. 
2SA.7.6	I have never lived in a house from the time that I brought Israel's people out of Egypt. And I am still not living in a house today. While we moved from place to place I lived in a 
2SA.7.7	I have moved about to many places with the 
2SA.7.8	Now speak to my servant David. Tell him that the 
2SA.7.8	‘I took you from the fields where you were following the sheep in the fields. I took you from there to be the ruler of my people Israel. 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you in every place that you went. I took away all your enemies. Now I will make your name great. It will be as great as the names of the greatest men on the earth. 
2SA.7.10	And I have chosen a place for my people Israel to live. They can live there and they can be safe. 
2SA.7.11	 men have done that since I chose leaders for my people Israel until now. But I will cause you to have no trouble from your enemies. And the 
2SA.7.11	“I will give 
2SA.7.12	You will die and people will bury you with your 
2SA.7.13	He is the man who will build a house for my Name. And his 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father and he will be my son. If he does wrong things, I will 
2SA.7.15	I stopped being good and kind to Saul so that you could rule. But I will not stop being good and kind to your son. 
2SA.7.16	You will always have 
2SA.7.17	Nathan told David everything that God had said to him. And Nathan told David everything that God had shown to him.
2SA.7.18	David went into the 
2SA.7.18	He said, ‘I am not a special person and my family is not important. But you have done very much for me. 
2SA.7.19	But you have promised to do more than this for my 
2SA.7.20	I cannot say anything more. You know me, your servant, 
2SA.7.21	Because of your promise you have decided to do all these great things to teach me. 
2SA.7.22	You are very great, 
2SA.7.23	There is no other 
2SA.7.24	You have chosen Israel as your own people for all time. And you, 
2SA.7.25	Now, 
2SA.7.26	And then your name will be great for all time. People will say, “The 
2SA.7.29	I pray that it will give you pleasure to be good to your servant's family. And so it will be able to continue for all time. 
2SA.8.1	Some time after that, David fought and he won a fight with the 
2SA.8.2	He also won a fight with the 
2SA.8.3	Also David fought Hadadezer, Rehob's son, king of Zobah. This was because Hadadezer had tried to have power again over the land next to the Euphrates River. 
2SA.8.4	David took from him 1700 riders of horses and 20,000 soldiers who walked. He kept 100 of the 
2SA.8.5	The 
2SA.8.6	David put soldiers to live among the 
2SA.8.7	Hadadezer's officers had 
2SA.8.8	Tebah and Berothai were Hadadezer's towns and David took a lot of 
2SA.8.9	Then people told Toi, the king of Hamath, that David had won the fight with all Hadadezer's army. 
2SA.8.10	Hadadezer had fought against Toi. So Toi sent his son, Joram to tell David what a good thing he had done. And he wanted to ask for 
2SA.8.11	David took these things and he gave them to the 
2SA.8.12	He had won fights with Edom, Moab and the 
2SA.8.13	David went to the Valley of Salt. There, his army beat 18,000 men from Edom. Many people knew about that. 
2SA.8.14	He put soldiers' 
2SA.8.15	David ruled over all Israel. He did everything that was right and good for his people. 
2SA.8.16	Zeruiah's son, Joab was over the army. And Ahilud's son, Jehoshaphat recorded the important things that happened. 
2SA.8.17	Ahitub's son Zadok and Abiathar's son Ahimelech were 
2SA.8.18	Jehoiada's son Benaiah was leader of the two groups of men who kept David safe. And David's sons helped him to rule.
2SA.9.1	David asked, ‘Does anyone know if there is anyone still alive from Saul's family?’ I want to be kind to them because Jonathan was my friend.
2SA.9.2	Saul's family had a servant called Ziba. So they asked him to come to see David. The king said to him, ‘Are you Ziba?’
2SA.9.2	‘I am your servant’, he replied.
2SA.9.3	The king asked him, ‘Is there anyone still alive from Saul's family? I want to be kind to them as God is kind.’
2SA.9.3	Ziba replied, ‘There is still a son of Jonathan. He has two bad feet, so he cannot walk well.’ 
2SA.9.4	‘Where is he?’ the king asked.
2SA.9.4	Ziba answered, ‘He lives in the house of Ammiel's son Machir in Lo-debar.’
2SA.9.5	So David sent servants to bring him from the house of Ammiel's son Machir in Lo-debar.
2SA.9.6	Then Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, grandson of Saul, came to David. He lay on the floor. He was 
2SA.9.6	David said, ‘Mephibosheth!’
2SA.9.6	‘I am your servant’, he replied.
2SA.9.7	‘Do not be afraid,’ David said to him, ‘because I want to be kind to you. I want to be kind to you because your father Jonathan was my friend. I will give you back all Saul's land and I want you to eat here with me always.’
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth bent his head very low. He said, ‘I am not as important as a dead dog. So I do not know why you should be so good to me!’
2SA.9.9	Then David sent men to fetch Saul's servant Ziba. He said to him, ‘I have given everything that was Saul's or his family's to your master's grandson. 
2SA.9.10	You and your sons and your servants must work on the land for him. You must get the food that grows there. And you must bring it to him. Then he will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, will always eat at my table.’ (Also, Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.)
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, ‘I am your servant. I will do as my 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son called Mica. And Ziba and all his family and servants became servants to Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth came to live in Jerusalem because he always ate at the king's table. He had two bad feet, so he could not walk well.
2SA.10.1	Some time after that, the king of the 
2SA.10.2	David thought, ‘I will be kind to Hanun, because Nahash his father was kind to me.’ David was sorry that Nahash had died. So David sent a group of his officers to tell Hanun that he was sorry. So David's men came to the 
2SA.10.3	The most powerful 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David's officers and he cut off half the hair from their beards. And he cut off the lower half of their clothes and he sent them away.
2SA.10.5	When somebody told David about this, he sent servants to meet the men. They were very ashamed. The king said, ‘Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown again. And then return here.’
2SA.10.6	Then the 
2SA.10.7	People told David about this. Then he sent out Joab with all the soldiers in his army. 
2SA.10.8	The 
2SA.10.9	Joab saw that there were the enemy's soldiers in front and behind him. So he took some of the best of Israel's soldiers and he caused them to look towards the 
2SA.10.10	He asked his brother Abishai to take all the other men to attack the 
2SA.10.11	Joab said, ‘If the 
2SA.10.12	Be strong. We must be brave when we fight for our people and for God's cities. The 
2SA.10.13	Then Joab and his group went to fight the 
2SA.10.14	The 
2SA.10.15	But then the 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer got more 
2SA.10.17	His servants told David what was happening. And he took all Israel's men across the River Jordan to Helam. The 
2SA.10.18	But they ran away from Israel's men. And David killed 700 of the men in 
2SA.10.19	Israel had beaten all the kings that Hadadezer ruled. And all those kings knew that Israel had beaten them. So, they said that they did not want to fight against Israel after that. They became the servants of the 
2SA.11.1	Kings fight each other in the spring. So David sent Joab with the whole 
2SA.11.2	One evening, David got out of bed and he walked on the roof of the king's house. From the roof he saw a woman who was washing herself. She was very beautiful. 
2SA.11.3	And David sent a servant to ask who she was. Someone said, ‘She is Eliam's daughter, Bathsheba. And she is the wife of Uriah the 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent servants to fetch her. She came to him and he slept with her. (She had cleaned herself from her monthly blood loss.) Then she returned to her home. 
2SA.11.5	Bathsheba now had David's baby inside her. So she sent a message to tell David about it.
2SA.11.6	David sent a message to Joab. He said, ‘Send Uriah the 
2SA.11.7	Uriah arrived. Then David asked him how Joab was. And David asked him how the soldiers were. And he asked him about the war. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, ‘Now go to your house and wash your feet.’ So Uriah left the king's house and David sent a gift after him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with his master's servants. He did not go to his house.
2SA.11.10	David's servants told him that Uriah had not gone to his house. So David asked him, ‘You have had a long journey. Why did you not go to your house?’
2SA.11.11	Uriah spoke to David. ‘Israel and Judah and the 
2SA.11.12	David said, ‘Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will let you leave.’ So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day. 
2SA.11.13	David asked him to eat and to drink with him and David caused him to drink too much 
2SA.11.14	In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and Uriah carried it to Joab. 
2SA.11.15	In it he wrote, ‘Put Uriah in front of all the soldiers, where it is most dangerous. Then pull your men away from him so that he is alone. And so the enemy will kill him.’
2SA.11.16	So while Joab's soldiers were round the city, Joab put Uriah in front of all the other soldiers. And that was where the enemy was strongest. 
2SA.11.17	When some of the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, some of David's men died. And Uriah the 
2SA.11.18	Joab wrote to David to tell him all about the war. 
2SA.11.19	He spoke to the man with the message. ‘When you have finished giving my report to the king, 
2SA.11.20	the king may be angry. He may ask you, “Why did you get so near to the city? Surely you knew that they would shoot 
2SA.11.21	Remember what a woman did to Jerub-besheth's son, Abimelech, in Thebez. She threw a heavy stone from the city wall and she killed him. You should not have gone so near to the wall.” If he does ask you that, say, “Your servant, Uriah the 
2SA.11.22	The man that Joab sent went to David. And he said everything that Joab had sent him to say. 
2SA.11.23	The man said to David, ‘The men were certainly stronger than us and they came out of the city to fight. But we pushed them into their own city gate. 
2SA.11.24	Some of them shot 
2SA.11.25	‘Say this to Joab’, David said to the man that Joab had sent. ‘Do not be too sad, any man can die in a fight. He must fight more strongly and win the city. And he must destroy it. That should help Joab to feel better.’
2SA.11.26	People told Uriah's wife that her husband was dead. And she was very sad and she cried about it very much. 
2SA.11.27	Then it was time to stop crying so much. Then David sent men to bring her to his king's house. He married her and she had a baby son. But the 
2SA.12.1	The 
2SA.12.2	‘The rich man had very many sheep and cows. 
2SA.12.3	But the poor man had only one young, little female sheep. He had bought it and he had fed it. It had grown up with his children. It ate and it drank with him. It even slept with him. It was like a daughter to him.
2SA.12.4	Then the rich man had a visitor. But the rich man did not kill his own sheep or cow to make a meal for the visitor. Instead, he took the poor man's little sheep to feed his visitor.’
2SA.12.5	David became very angry with the rich man. ‘As truly as the 
2SA.12.6	‘He did this cruel thing and he was not sorry for the poor man. So he must certainly pay the poor man for 4 sheep because he did that.’
2SA.12.7	‘You are the man!’ Nathan said to David. ‘This is what the 
2SA.12.8	I gave your master's house and his wives to you. I gave the people in Israel and in Judah to you. And I would have given you even more than that, if you wanted more. 
2SA.12.9	But you did not obey the word of the 
2SA.12.10	So now your family will always have wars and death. You thought that I was not important. And so you took Uriah's wife to be your own wife. So I will 
2SA.12.11	This is what the 
2SA.12.12	What you did was a secret. But I will cause this to happen in the light of the sun and in front of all Israel.” ’
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, ‘I have 
2SA.12.13	Nathan replied, ‘The 
2SA.12.14	But because of what you have done, the 
2SA.12.15	Nathan went home. Uriah's wife had given a son to David but after this the child became ill. 
2SA.12.16	David asked the 
2SA.12.17	His servants stood round him. And they tried to help him to get up. But he refused and he would not eat anything with them.
2SA.12.18	After 7 days, the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him. They thought, ‘David did not seem to hear us when we spoke to him. That was when the child was alive. So we cannot tell him that the child is dead. He might do something really bad.’
2SA.12.19	But David saw that his servants were speaking to each other in a quiet way. Then he understood that the child was dead. ‘Is the child dead?’ he asked his servants.
2SA.12.19	‘Yes’, they replied. ‘He is dead.’
2SA.12.20	Then David got up and he washed himself. He put on clean clothes and special oil that had a good smell. He went into the 
2SA.12.21	His servants said to him, ‘Why are you doing these things? You ate nothing while the child was alive. And you wept. But now that he is dead you get up. And you eat!’
2SA.12.22	David replied, ‘While the child was alive I wept. And I did not eat anything. I thought that perhaps the 
2SA.12.23	But I do not need to do this now that the child is dead. I cannot bring him back to me. I will go to him but he cannot come to me.’
2SA.12.24	Then David went to help his wife, Bathsheba to feel better. He slept with her and she had a son. They called him Solomon, and the 
2SA.12.25	The 
2SA.12.26	At this time, Joab was fighting against the 
2SA.12.27	So Joab sent men to David with a message. The message was, ‘I have fought against Rabbah. And I have got the river that gives water to it. 
2SA.12.28	Now bring the army that is with you to stand round the city. And win the city. If you do not, then I will win the city. And so it will have my name.’
2SA.12.29	So David took all his army and he went to Rabbah. They attacked and they won it. 
2SA.12.30	He took the 
2SA.12.31	And he brought out the people from the city. He caused them to cut wood. And they had to work with sharp iron tools and with iron axes. And he sent them into the place where people made 
2SA.13.1	After some time, David's son, Amnon, began to love Tamar. She was the beautiful sister of David's son, Absalom. 
2SA.13.2	Amnon became ill because he wanted his sister Tamar so much. But she had never slept with a man and it seemed difficult for Amnon to do anything to her.
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend called Jonadab. He was the son of David's brother Shimeah. And he seemed to know what to do about anything. 
2SA.13.4	He asked Amnon, ‘Why do you seem so sad every morning? Tell me about your trouble.’
2SA.13.4	Amnon said to him, ‘I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.’
2SA.13.5	‘Go to bed. Say that you are ill’, said Jonadab. ‘Your father will come to see you. Then you can ask him that your sister Tamar might come to give you something to eat. Say, “Please let me see her make food. And then let her feed me with it.” ’
2SA.13.6	So Amnon went to bed. He said that he was ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon spoke to him. ‘Please let my sister Tamar come. I want her to make some special bread while I watch her. Then she can feed me with it.’
2SA.13.7	David sent a servant to Tamar. ‘Go to your brother Amnon and make some food for him’, he said. 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house. He was in his bed. She took flour and water and she mixed them well. She made cakes while he watched her. And she baked them.
2SA.13.9	Then she took some and she gave them to him. But he would not eat them.
2SA.13.9	‘Send everyone out of here’, Amnon said. So everyone left him. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, ‘Bring the food here into my bedroom so that you can give it to me with your own hands.’ So Tamar took the cakes that she had made. And she brought them to Amnon in his bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	But when she went to him he took hold of her. And he said, ‘Come to bed with me, my sister.’
2SA.13.12	‘Do not do it, my brother’, she said. ‘Do not cause me to do a wrong thing like that. We in Israel should not do things like that. It is an 
2SA.13.13	Think about me. Nobody would 
2SA.13.14	But he refused to listen to her and he was stronger than she. So he took her and he had sex with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon 
2SA.13.16	‘No!’ she said to him. ‘To send me away would be a worse thing to do. It would be worse than the bad thing that you have already done to me.’
2SA.13.16	But he refused to listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	He shouted for his special servant. He said to him, ‘Take this woman out of here and lock the door behind her.’ 
2SA.13.18	So the servant put her out and he locked the door behind her. She was wearing a very beautiful dress. All the king's daughters who were not yet married wore these beautiful clothes. 
2SA.13.19	Tamar put dirt on her head. And she tore the beautiful dress that she was wearing. She put her face in her hands. And she wept aloud when she went away.
2SA.13.20	When her brother Absalom saw her he said, ‘I think that my brother Amnon has hurt you! Now be quiet; he is your brother. Do not let it make you angry.’ And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house. She was sad and lonely.
2SA.13.21	When someone told King David about all this, he was very, very angry. 
2SA.13.22	Absalom 
2SA.13.23	After two years, Absalom's servants were cutting the 
2SA.13.24	He spoke to the king. ‘Your servant has men with him to cut the sheep's 
2SA.13.25	‘No, my son’, the king replied. ‘We should not all go. It would cause you too much trouble.’ Absalom asked him again. He refused again, but he gave his 
2SA.13.26	‘If you will not come, will you let my brother Amnon come?’ Absalom asked.
2SA.13.26	The king said, ‘I do not know why he should go with you.’ 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom asked more strongly, so he sent Amnon with the other king's sons.
2SA.13.28	Absalom told his servants what they must do. He said, ‘When Amnon has drunk a lot of 
2SA.13.29	So Absalom's men obeyed him. Then all the king's other sons ran to their 
2SA.13.30	While they were returning, men said to David, ‘Absalom has attacked all the king's sons. Not one son is still alive.’ 
2SA.13.31	The king stood up and he tore his clothes. Then he fell on the ground and all his servants stood round him. They had torn their clothes, too.
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab, son of David's brother, Shimeah spoke. ‘My 
2SA.13.33	My 
2SA.13.34	While this was happening, Absalom had run away.
2SA.13.34	A man was standing on the wall of Jerusalem. He watched. And he saw that many people were coming down the hill. They came from the west. He went and he told the king, ‘I saw men towards Horonaim, on the side of the hill.’
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, ‘See, the king's sons are here. It is as I said.’
2SA.13.36	While he was speaking, the king's servants came in. They were weeping loudly. The king and all his servants were also weeping. They were very, very sad.
2SA.13.37	Absalom ran to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. But King David continued to weep for his son every day.
2SA.13.38	After Absalom had run to Geshur he stayed there for three years. 
2SA.13.39	And the king wanted very much to go to see Absalom. He had stopped being very sad about Amnon's death.
2SA.14.1	Zeruiah's son, Joab knew how much the king wanted to see Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	So he sent a servant to Tekoa to bring a 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king. This is what you must say to him.’ Then Joab told her the words.
2SA.14.4	So the woman from Tekoa went to the king. She fell on the floor in front of him because she wanted to 
2SA.14.5	The king asked her, ‘What is your trouble?’
2SA.14.5	She said, ‘My husband is dead 
2SA.14.6	and I had two sons. They were fighting in the fields and there was nobody near to stop them. One son hit the other son. And he killed him. 
2SA.14.7	Now the whole family is against me. They want me to give to them the son who killed his brother. They want to 
2SA.14.8	The king said, ‘Go to your house. I will tell them that they must not kill him.’
2SA.14.9	Then the woman from Tekoa spoke. ‘My 
2SA.14.10	The king replied, ‘If anyone says anything bad to you, bring him to me. After that, he will not cause you any more trouble.’
2SA.14.11	Then she said, ‘I do not want the man who should 
2SA.14.11	‘I promise the living 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman spoke again. ‘Can I say one more thing to my 
2SA.14.12	‘Speak’, he replied.
2SA.14.13	Then the woman said, ‘Why have you done such a wrong thing to God's own people? You have not let your own son return to his home. He is still in a foreign city. You are like someone who has done a wrong thing. I can say that because of what you have just said. 
2SA.14.14	We are like water that falls on the ground. We cannot put it into the pot that it fell out of. We must all die. But God does not kill us. He thinks of a way to bring a man back from the place where he sent him away.
2SA.14.15	I am saying this to the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, “I will speak to the king. Perhaps he will do what I ask. 
2SA.14.16	Perhaps he will save me from the man who wants to kill my son. So that man will not take our family from the land that God gave to us.”
2SA.14.17	Now I say, “I pray that your promise will keep us safe.” That is because the king is like an 
2SA.14.18	Then the king spoke to the woman. ‘You must answer to me this one question. Say only what is true. Do not hide anything.’
2SA.14.18	‘Ask me anything, sir’, she replied.
2SA.14.19	‘Has Joab told you what to say?’ he asked.
2SA.14.19	‘I cannot hide the answer to your question, my 
2SA.14.20	He did it to change things. My 
2SA.14.21	The king spoke to Joab. ‘I have decided to do what you want. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.’
2SA.14.22	Joab fell with his face to the ground in front of the king because he wanted to 
2SA.14.23	Then Joab went to Geshur and he brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	But the king said, ‘He must go to his own house. I do not want him to come to see me.’ So Absalom went to his own house. He did not see the king.
2SA.14.25	Everyone in Israel thought that Absalom was the most handsome man in the whole country. In his body, everything from head to toe was completely good to look at. 
2SA.14.26	Sometimes he cut his hair because it was too heavy. The hair that he cut off weighed about 4 pounds (2 kilos).
2SA.14.27	Absalom had three sons and one daughter. He called her Tamar and she became a very beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	For two whole years Absalom lived in Jerusalem. But he never saw the king. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent a servant to Joab with a message. He wanted Joab to come and to see him. But Joab would not come. So he sent another servant but Joab refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	Then Absalom spoke to his servants. ‘Joab's field is next to mine. And 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab did go to Absalom's house. ‘Why did your servants burn my field?’ he asked.
2SA.14.32	Absalom replied, ‘I sent my servants to ask you to come. But you did not come to see me. I wanted to send you to the king. I wanted you to ask him why he had brought me from Geshur to Jerusalem. It would have been better for me to stay there! Now I want to go to see the king. So he can say himself if I have done anything wrong. Then he can kill me for any wrong thing that I have done.’
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and he told the king about it. Then the king sent servants to bring Absalom to him. He came in and he bent down in front of the king. He put his face to the ground. And the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	Some time after that, Absalom bought a 
2SA.15.2	He got up early in the morning. Then he went to stand at the side of the road by the city's gate. He shouted to anyone who was coming to see the king. Then he asked, ‘Where have you come from?’ The man would tell Absalom which 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say, ‘I am sure that you are right and not the other man. But there is nobody of the king's officers to listen to you.’ 
2SA.15.4	And Absalom would also say, ‘If I became a 
2SA.15.5	The man would bend down because he wanted to 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did this to all the people who came to ask the king for a 
2SA.15.7	After 4 years, Absalom spoke to the king. ‘Please let me go to Hebron. I have promised something to the 
2SA.15.8	I did it while I was living in Geshur in Aram’, he said. ‘I promised to 
2SA.15.9	The king said, ‘Go in 
2SA.15.10	Then Absalom sent men with a message secretly to all the 
2SA.15.11	But 200 men from Jerusalem had gone with Absalom. He had asked them to go as friends. They did not know what Absalom would do. 
2SA.15.12	Absalom burnt his 
2SA.15.13	A servant came and he told David, ‘Israel's men have turned away from you to follow Absalom.’
2SA.15.14	Then David spoke to the officers who were with him in Jerusalem. ‘Come, we must run away. If we do not do that, Absalom will beat us all. We must leave now. If we do not do that, he will kill everyone in the city.’
2SA.15.15	The king's servants answered, ‘We will do anything that our 
2SA.15.16	So the king went out with all his servants and family. But he did not take 10 of his lady friends so that they would be able to keep the king's house safe. 
2SA.15.17	He went out and all the people were following him. They stopped at the last house that was near Jerusalem. 
2SA.15.18	All his men marched past him with the 
2SA.15.19	The king spoke to Ittai from Gath. ‘Why are you coming with us? Return and stay with King Absalom. You are from another country. 
2SA.15.20	You only came here a short time ago. You do not need to run away with us. I do not even know where I am going! Return and take your people with you. I pray that the 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai replied to the king, ‘I promise that I will go with you. As surely as the 
2SA.15.22	‘March on then’, said David. So Ittai marched on with all his men and their families.
2SA.15.23	All the people that they passed wept with a loud voice. The king crossed the Kidron Valley and all the people moved towards the 
2SA.15.24	Zadok the 
2SA.15.25	Then the king spoke to Zadok ‘Take the 
2SA.15.26	But if not, I am ready. He must do what seems best to him.’
2SA.15.27	Again the king spoke to Zadok the 
2SA.15.28	I will wait at the place where we crossed the river. I will wait there until you send me news.’ 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the 
2SA.15.30	But David continued to go up the hill called the Hill of 
2SA.15.31	They had told David that Ahithophel was with Absalom. So David prayed, ‘
2SA.15.32	David arrived at the top of the hill where he 
2SA.15.33	David said, ‘Do not come with me because you might cause me trouble. 
2SA.15.34	Return to the city. You can say to Absalom, “You are the king and I will be your servant. I was once your father's servant, but now I will be your servant.” Then you can help me. You can give opposite 
2SA.15.35	The 
2SA.15.36	Their two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan are with them. Send them to me with anything that you hear.’
2SA.15.37	So, when Absalom had just gone into the city, David's friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	When David began to walk down the mountain, he met Mephibosheth's servant Ziba. Ziba was waiting for him with two 
2SA.16.2	The king asked Ziba, ‘Why have you brought these?’
2SA.16.2	Ziba answered, ‘The 
2SA.16.3	The king asked, ‘Where is your master's grandson?’
2SA.16.3	Ziba answered, ‘He is staying in Jerusalem. He thinks that they will give him back his grandfather Saul's 
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, ‘All that Mephibosheth had is now yours.’
2SA.16.4	‘I am your servant’, said Ziba. ‘I hope that I will always give you pleasure.’
2SA.16.5	Shimei, son of Gera, came out to meet David. David was coming near to the city called Bahurim. Shimei was from the same family as Saul. Soldiers and David's special men were all round David. But Shimei shouted bad words about David as he came. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David and at all his officers. 
2SA.16.7	He said, ‘Get out! Get out! You are a man who has killed many people. So you are a 
2SA.16.8	You killed a lot of Saul's people. And this is how the 
2SA.16.9	Then Zeruiah's son, Abishai, said to the king, ‘This man is like a dog. He should not say these bad things to you. There is no reason for us to let him live. Can I go there and cut off his head?’
2SA.16.10	‘You and I think about this in a different way, you sons of Zeruiah’, said the king. ‘He might be saying these bad things because the 
2SA.16.11	Then David spoke to Abishai and to all his officers. ‘My son, my own son is trying to kill me. So it is not a surprise that this 
2SA.16.12	Perhaps the 
2SA.16.13	David and his men continued to walk along the road. Shimei walked along the hill, where he could see them. He shouted. And he threw stones and dirt at them as he walked. 
2SA.16.14	The king and all his men were very tired when they reached the River Jordan. So they rested there.
2SA.16.15	So now all Israel's men had come to Jerusalem with Absalom. And Ahithophel was with him. 
2SA.16.16	Then David's friend, Hushai from the place called Archi, went to Absalom. He said, ‘I pray that the king will live for all time! I pray that the king will live for all time!’
2SA.16.17	Absalom asked Hushai, ‘Is this how you show your love for your friend? Why did you not go with him?’
2SA.16.18	Hushai replied, ‘No, I will follow the man that the 
2SA.16.19	Clearly, I should work for the son. As I worked for your father, so I will work for you.’
2SA.16.20	Absalom said to Ahithophel, ‘Have you any ideas? What do you think that we should do?’
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel answered, ‘Sleep with your father's lady friends that are here in his house. Then all the people in Israel will know that you have made your father very angry. Then they will want to help you much more.’ 
2SA.16.22	So they put up a 
2SA.16.23	In those days, men thought that Ahithophel's words were like the word of God. David and Absalom both believed that.
2SA.17.1	Ahithophel spoke to Absalom, ‘I would go tonight to attack David. Please let me choose 12,000 men. 
2SA.17.2	I will go after him while he is tired and weak. This will make him afraid, then all the people with him will run away. I will kill only the king. 
2SA.17.3	Then I will bring all the people back to you. If we kill this man you will cause all the people to come to you.’
2SA.17.4	This seemed a very good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	But Absalom said, ‘Send Hushai from the place called Archi to me. Let us hear what he has to say.’
2SA.17.6	Absalom spoke to Hushai when he arrived. ‘Ahithophel has suggested that we do this. What do you think? If you do not agree, please give us your ideas.’
2SA.17.7	Hushai replied to Absalom, ‘This time Ahithophel's idea is not good. 
2SA.17.8	You know that your father and his men are all fighters. They fight like a mother 
2SA.17.9	Even now he is hiding in a hole in the hill or another place like that. He might attack your soldiers first. Someone who saw it would tell other people. He would say, “They have killed Absalom's men!” 
2SA.17.10	Then even your bravest soldier would become afraid. He might be as brave as a 
2SA.17.11	Hushai said, ‘This is what I suggest. Bring here all the men in Israel who live in all the country from Dan to Beersheba. Their numbers are as great as the pieces of sand by the side of the sea. Then you yourself should lead them into the fight. 
2SA.17.12	In this way we can attack him in any place that we find him. He will not even know that we have found him. He and his men will all die. 
2SA.17.13	If he goes into a city, we can pull it down into the valley below. Only small pieces will remain on the hill.’
2SA.17.14	Absalom and all Israel's men said, ‘Hushai's idea is better than Ahithophel's.’ (The 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai told the 
2SA.17.16	‘Now send servants to David immediately’, he said. ‘They must tell him that he should not stay this side of the river in the 
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl went to tell them what had happened. Then they went and they told it to King David. They did not want anybody to see them as they were going into the city. That was important. 
2SA.17.18	But a young man saw them and he told Absalom. So they left quickly and they went to a man's house in Bahurim. He had a well in his yard and they climbed down into it.
2SA.17.19	His wife took a lid and she put it over the top of the well. Then she threw a lot of seeds on it, so nobody knew anything about it.
2SA.17.20	Absalom's men came to the house. They asked the woman, ‘Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?’
2SA.17.20	The woman answered, ‘They went across the river.’ The men looked everywhere but they did not find anyone. So they returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well. They went to see David. They said to him, ‘Go now and cross the river.’ And they told him what Ahithophel had suggested. 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people left immediately and they crossed the river. When it was dawn they had all gone across the river.
2SA.17.23	Ahithophel got on his 
2SA.17.24	David went to Mahanaim and Absalom crossed the River Jordan with all Israel's men. 
2SA.17.25	Joab had been the leader of all Israel's soldiers. But Absalom had made Amasa the 
2SA.17.26	Absalom and his army put their 
2SA.17.27	When David came to Mahanaim, three men helped him. One man was Nahash's son Shobi from Rabbah. The people called Ammonites lived in Rabbah. The other men were Ammiel's son Machir from Lo-Debar and Barzillai from Rogelim in Gilead. 
2SA.17.28+2SA.17.29	They brought beds and pots and cups. They also brought 
2SA.18.1	David brought together all the men who were with him. He chose some to lead hundreds and some to lead thousands of them. 
2SA.18.2	He sent them out in three groups. Joab led one group. His brother, Abishai, led another group and Ittai from Gath led the third group. The king said to them all, ‘I will go with you myself.’
2SA.18.3	But the men replied, ‘You must not go out. If we have to run away they may kill half of us. But they will really want only to kill you. You are worth 10,000 of us. You can send help to us from the city.’
2SA.18.4	‘I will do whatever you think is best’, the king answered. Then he stood by the side of the gate. And his men marched out in their groups of hundreds and of thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king spoke strongly to Joab, Abishai and Ittai. ‘Do not hurt the young man Absalom if you love me’, he said. And all the soldiers heard him say this to the three officers.
2SA.18.6	The army marched out to fight Israel. They fought in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	There David's men won the fight with Israel's men. Many men died. There were 20,000 dead men. 
2SA.18.8	They fought over all the land in and round the forest. More men died in the forest than in the fight.
2SA.18.9	And Absalom met some of David's men. He was riding on a 
2SA.18.10	A man saw it and he told Joab, ‘I have seen Absalom. He is hanging from an 
2SA.18.11	Joab said to the man, ‘If you saw him, why did you not kill him? I would have given you 10 
2SA.18.12	But the man replied, ‘I would not hurt the king's son, even for 25 pounds (11 kilos) of 
2SA.18.13	If I had killed Absalom, It would have been very dangerous for me. The king knows everything and then he would have killed me. And you would not have saved me.’
2SA.18.14	Joab said, ‘I cannot stand here and talk with you.’ And he took three 
2SA.18.15	Ten of Joab's own men came round Absalom. They hit him and they killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab made a sound with his 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom's dead body and they put it in a big hole in the forest. They put a lot of stones over it. At the same time, all the 
2SA.18.18	While Absalom was alive he built a tall 
2SA.18.19	Zadok's son Ahimaaz spoke to Joab. ‘Let me run to give the king the news that the 
2SA.18.20	‘You must not take any good news today’, said Joab. ‘You can take it another day, but not today. The king's son is dead.’
2SA.18.21	Then Joab spoke to a man from Ethiopia, ‘Go to the king. Tell him what you have seen.’ The man bent down in front of Joab and then he ran off.
2SA.18.22	Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again, ‘I am not afraid of what may happen. Please let me run after the man from Ethiopia.’
2SA.18.22	But Joab replied, ‘Why do you want to do it? The king will not give you a gift for this news.’
2SA.18.23	He said, ‘But I do want to go, whatever happens.’
2SA.18.23	So Joab said, ‘Run!’ Then Ahimaaz ran across the flat ground. And he went faster than the man from Ethiopia.
2SA.18.24	David was sitting between the two city gates. A man stood over the gate by the wall. He was watching the road. As he looked he saw a man. The man was running towards the city. He was running alone. 
2SA.18.25	The man on the roof shouted to the king to say what he had seen.
2SA.18.25	The king said, ‘If he is alone, the news is good.’ And the man came closer and closer.
2SA.18.26	Then the man on the roof saw another man who was running. He called down to the man at the gate, ‘Look, another man is also running alone!’
2SA.18.26	The king said, ‘He will bring good news, too.’
2SA.18.27	The man said, ‘The first man is running like Zadok's son Ahimaaz.’
2SA.18.27	‘He is a good man’, the king said. ‘He will bring good news.’
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz shouted to the king, ‘It is good news!’ And he bent down with his face to the ground and he said, ‘
2SA.18.29	The king asked, ‘Is the young man Absalom safe?’
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, ‘When your officer Joab sent me I saw many people together. They seemed to be confused. But I did not see what had caused it.’
2SA.18.30	The king said, ‘Stand at the side and wait here.’ So Ahimaaz stepped to the side and he waited.
2SA.18.31	Then the man from Ethiopia arrived. He said, ‘My 
2SA.18.32	The king asked the man from Ethiopia, ‘Is the young man Absalom safe?’
2SA.18.32	The man from Ethiopia replied, ‘I hope that all your enemies will be like that young man. And I want the same thing to happen to all those who are against you’
2SA.18.33	The king became so sad that he left the room over the gate. And he wept loudly. As he went, he said, ‘My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! You should not have died. I should have died instead, Absalom, Absalom my son!’
2SA.19.1	People told Joab that the king was weeping for Absalom. He was very sad because Absalom was dead. 
2SA.19.2	So the whole army was sad too. They had won an important fight. But they could not be happy and they could not have a party. They had heard men say, ‘The king is sad because his son is dead.’ 
2SA.19.3	The soldiers were quiet as they came into the city. Men are ashamed when they have run away from a fight. They came in like that. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face and he cried, ‘Absalom, Absalom my son, my son!’
2SA.19.5	Then Joab went into the king's house. He spoke to the king. ‘Today you have made your men ashamed. But they have saved your life and the lives of your sons, daughters and lady friends. 
2SA.19.6	You seem to love those who 
2SA.19.7	Now go out and speak to the men. Tell them that they have fought well. If you do not do that, not one man will remain here tonight. It is as sure as the 
2SA.19.8	So the king got up and he went to sit in his seat by the city gate. They told the men, ‘The king is sitting by the gate.’ Then they all came to stand in front of him. By this time, the people had run to their homes.
2SA.19.9	Then the people in their different 
2SA.19.10	We 
2SA.19.11	People told David what the people were saying. So he sent the 
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers, my family. So I do not know why you are the last to bring back the king. 
2SA.19.13	And say to Amasa, “You belong to my family. From this time on Joab will not be the most important officer in my army. You will be that, instead. I want God to 
2SA.19.14	All the men from Judah turned like one man to follow David. They sent servants to the king. And they asked him to return with all his soldiers. 
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned and he went to the River Jordan.
2SA.19.15	The men from Judah had come to Gilgal to meet the king. They wanted to bring him across the river.
2SA.19.16	Gera's son Shimei came quickly down from Bahurim to meet the king. He came with the men from Judah but he was from Benjamin's 
2SA.19.17	He brought 1000 men from his 
2SA.19.18	They crossed where the water was not deep. And they brought the king and his people with them. They wanted to do whatever the king wanted.
2SA.19.18	When Shimei had crossed the River Jordan he fell down in front of the king. 
2SA.19.19	He said to him, ‘Please will you 
2SA.19.20	I am your servant. And I know that I have 
2SA.19.21	Then Abishai, Zeruiah's son said, ‘We should kill Shimei. He said 
2SA.19.22	David replied, ‘I am not like you and your brother Joab. You will not kill anybody today. This day I have become king over Israel.’ 
2SA.19.23	So the king gave a promise to Shimei. ‘You will not die’, he said.
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not washed his feet or his clothes since David left Jerusalem. And he had not cut his beard. 
2SA.19.25	When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, David spoke to him. ‘Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?’ he asked.
2SA.19.26	He said, ‘My 
2SA.19.27	And what he has said to you is not true. But you are like an 
2SA.19.28	My 
2SA.19.29	The king said, ‘Do not say any more about these things. I have decided that you and Ziba must each have half of the fields.’
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, ‘He can take them all. I am only happy that you are still safe.’
2SA.19.31	Barzillai from Gilead came down from Rogelim to cross the River Jordan with the king. He wanted to send him on to Jerusalem from there. 
2SA.19.32	But Barzillai was a very old man, about 80 years old. He had helped David while David was in Mahanaim. He had given to David much that he had needed. He did that because he was a very rich man. 
2SA.19.33	David said to him, ‘Cross with me. And come and stay with me in Jerusalem. I can give to you all that you might want.’
2SA.19.34	Barzillai answered the king, ‘I will not live many more years. Why should I go to Jerusalem with the king? 
2SA.19.35	I am already 80 years old. And I cannot tell what is good or bad. I cannot taste what I eat. And I cannot taste what I drink. And I cannot still hear people when they sing. I would only cause trouble to you. 
2SA.19.36	I will come with you for a short way on the other side of the river, but I cannot accept your gift. 
2SA.19.37	Let me, your servant, return to die in my own town. Then they can bury me near the place where they buried my father and my mother. Here is my son Chimham. Let him go across with you. Please do for him whatever you choose. And I hope that it will give you pleasure.’
2SA.19.38	The king said, ‘Chimham can go across with me. And I will do for him whatever you want. And I will do whatever you want me to do for you.’
2SA.19.39	So all the people went across the River Jordan and the king followed them. The king kissed Barzillai and 
2SA.19.40	When the king went across the river to Gilgal, Chimham went with him. All Judah's army and half of Israel's men took him across the river. 
2SA.19.41	Then all the men from Israel came to ask the king, ‘Why did our brothers, the men from Judah, take you and your people away across the River Jordan?’
2SA.19.42	The men from Judah answered, ‘We did it because he belongs to our family. Do not be angry. We have not eaten any of his food and he has not given us anything.’
2SA.19.43	The 
2SA.19.43	But the words that the men from Judah spoke were even more angry than the words of the 
2SA.20.1	A man called Sheba was in Gilgal. He was Bichri's son, from Benjamin's 
2SA.20.2	So the 
2SA.20.3	David returned to the king's house in Jerusalem. Then he took the 10 lady friends. They had stayed there when he left Jerusalem. Now he shut them away safely in a special house. People were watching them carefully. He gave to them all that they needed. But he did not sleep with them. They stayed there. And they lived like 
2SA.20.4	The king spoke to Amasa. ‘Bring all the men from Judah to me here during the next three days. And come with them yourself.’ 
2SA.20.5	Amasa went to fetch them but he was away for more than three days. 
2SA.20.6	David said to Abishai, ‘Now Bichri's son Sheba will cause us more trouble than Absalom. Take my men and go after him. If you do not catch him they may hide in towns with strong walls. He might get away from us.’ 
2SA.20.7	So Abishai took Joab's men, the 
2SA.20.8	Amasa came to meet them at the big rock in Gibeon. Joab was dressed for the fight and a 
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, ‘How are you my brother?’ And he took Amasa by his beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa did not see the 
2SA.20.10	Then Joab and his brother Abishai went on. They were following after Sheba.
2SA.20.11	A man stood by Amasa's dead body. The man belonged to Joab's soldiers. He shouted, ‘Everyone who wants to follow David, follow Joab!’ 
2SA.20.12	Amasa's dead body was in the road, covered in his blood. Everyone who saw him stopped there. The man had seen that they stopped. So he pulled the dead body into a field and he covered it with a cloth. 
2SA.20.13	After he had taken Amasa's dead body from the road, the men went on with Joab. They were going after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	Sheba went through all the 
2SA.20.15	Some people told Joab's men that Sheba was there. So they went and they stood all round the city. They built the ground up high near to its walls. And they dug under the walls to cause them to fall down. 
2SA.20.16	A 
2SA.20.17	He went towards her. ‘Are you Joab?’ she asked.
2SA.20.17	‘I am’, he answered.
2SA.20.17	‘Listen to what I have to say’, she said.
2SA.20.17	‘I am listening’, he replied. 
2SA.20.18	Then she said, ‘A long time ago, people said, “Get your answer at the city called Abel.” And that is what they did. 
2SA.20.19	We are a 
2SA.20.20	‘I would never do that!’ Joab answered. ‘I would never hurt or destroy your city. 
2SA.20.21	That is not what we want. But a man called Sheba, son of Bichri, has come there from the hills of Ephraim. He has said that he will not follow King David. If you will give me this one man, I will leave your city. I will not destroy it.’
2SA.20.21	The woman said to Joab, ‘I will throw his head to you from the wall.’
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went to all the people in the city. She told them why they should kill Sheba. So they cut off the head of Bichri's son Sheba and they threw it to Joab. Then he made a noise with his 
2SA.20.23	Joab was the officer who led all Israel's army. Jehoiada's son led the 
2SA.20.24	Adoniram ruled over the men that had to work for the king. Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat wrote down all that the king did. 
2SA.20.25	Sheva was another writer, and Zadok and Abiathar were 
2SA.20.26	Ira from the town called Jair was a 
2SA.21.1	For three years together no food grew in Israel. So David asked the 
2SA.21.2	The king asked the 
2SA.21.3	David asked the 
2SA.21.4	The 
2SA.21.4	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ David asked them.
2SA.21.5	They answered the king, ‘There was a man who destroyed us. He wanted to kill all of us who were living in Israel. 
2SA.21.6	Will you give to us 7 of his male 
2SA.21.6	‘I will give them to you’, the king said.
2SA.21.7	The king did not choose Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan. That was because of David's promise to Saul's son Jonathan. David used the name of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, who were called Armoni and Mephibosheth. Saul was their father. And he took the 5 sons of Saul's daughter Merab. They had grown up as sons of Michal, her sister. They were the sons of Adriel, son of Barzillai from Meholath. 
2SA.21.9	He gave them to the 
2SA.21.10	Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, put a cloth over a rock for herself. She stayed there from that time until it rained. The rain came down from the sky on the dead bodies. She kept the birds away from them during the day and she kept the wild animals away during the night.
2SA.21.11	They told David what Rizpah, Saul's lady friend, had done. 
2SA.21.12	Then he went to fetch the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the people at Jabesh Gilead. (Their men had taken them from the square in Beth Shan. The 
2SA.21.13	David took the bones of Saul and Jonathan and also the bones of the 7 men who had been hung.
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan with those of Kish, Saul's father, in Zela in Benjamin's land. The king had told them what they should do. And they did it all. Then God answered their 
2SA.21.15	Israel's people were fighting the 
2SA.21.16	A 
2SA.21.17	But Zeruiah's son Abishai saved David. He hit the 
2SA.21.18	Some time after that, Israel fought with the 
2SA.21.19	In another fight with the 
2SA.21.20	In another fight, a great big man fought for the 
2SA.21.21	When he shouted bad things about the 
2SA.21.22	David and his men killed all these 4 
2SA.22.1	David wrote this song when the 
2SA.22.2	This is what he sang.
2SA.22.2	‘The 
2SA.22.3	My God is the rock that I can hide in.
2SA.22.3	He is my 
2SA.22.3	He is my strong 
2SA.22.3	You have saved me from men who would have hurt me.
2SA.22.4	I shout to the 
2SA.22.4	He has saved me from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	Death was like water that was all round me.
2SA.22.5	Strong waters covered me over.
2SA.22.6	I felt that they were burying me.
2SA.22.7	I was afraid so I cried to the 
2SA.22.7	I shouted to my God.
2SA.22.7	From his 
2SA.22.7	My loud noise reached his ears.
2SA.22.8	The ground moved and it 
2SA.22.8	And the sky 
2SA.22.8	They 
2SA.22.9	Smoke came out of his nose.
2SA.22.9	Burning fire came out of his mouth.
2SA.22.9	Materials started to burn as a result.
2SA.22.10	He broke through the sky and he came down.
2SA.22.10	He stood on dark clouds.
2SA.22.11	He flew on the backs of 
2SA.22.11	He went like the wind.
2SA.22.12	He made the air dark all round him
2SA.22.12	with the rain clouds of the sky.
2SA.22.13	From his bright body
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	His great voice was everywhere.
2SA.22.15	He shot 
2SA.22.15	His 
2SA.22.16	The waters of the sea ran from their deep places.
2SA.22.16	Men could see the deepest places of the earth.
2SA.22.16	He caused this by the smoke from his mouth
2SA.22.16	because he was angry.
2SA.22.17	His hand came out from the sky to hold me.
2SA.22.17	He pulled me from the deep waters.
2SA.22.18	He saved me from my powerful enemy.
2SA.22.18	He saved me from those who were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	When troubles were all round me,
2SA.22.19	he held me up.
2SA.22.20	He brought me into a safe place.
2SA.22.20	He saved me because he loved me very much.
2SA.22.21	I do what is right. The 
2SA.22.21	He 
2SA.22.22	That is because I have obeyed his 
2SA.22.22	It is because I have not turned away from him.
2SA.22.23	I have obeyed all his 
2SA.22.23	I have not turned away from them.
2SA.22.24	I have done only what is right. He knows that.
2SA.22.24	I have not 
2SA.22.25	I do what is right. So the 
2SA.22.25	I want only what is good. And he sees that.
2SA.22.26	You are 
2SA.22.26	You are completely good to those who are good.
2SA.22.27	All good people know how good you are.
2SA.22.27	But you are against those who are 
2SA.22.28	You save 
2SA.22.28	But you bring down 
2SA.22.29	You are like a light in my hand.
2SA.22.29	You turn dark into light.
2SA.22.30	You make me strong to fight my enemies.
2SA.22.30	With you, my God, I can jump over a wall.
2SA.22.31	All that God does is 
2SA.22.31	The 
2SA.22.31	He is like a 
2SA.22.32	The 
2SA.22.32	He is the rock that holds us up.
2SA.22.33	It is God who makes me strong.
2SA.22.33	He makes my path safe.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like goat's feet
2SA.22.34	so that I can stand on high hills.
2SA.22.35	He teaches my hands to fight
2SA.22.35	so that I can bend an iron bow.
2SA.22.36	You keep me safe in the fight.
2SA.22.36	Your help has made me great.
2SA.22.37	You have saved me from my enemies
2SA.22.37	and I have never fallen.
2SA.22.38	I ran after my enemies and I beat them.
2SA.22.38	I did not turn back until they were all gone.
2SA.22.39	I knocked them down and they could not get up.
2SA.22.39	They fell under my feet.
2SA.22.40	You made me strong for the fight.
2SA.22.40	You caused those that I fought to bend down in front of me.
2SA.22.41	You caused my enemies to turn and so they ran away from me.
2SA.22.41	And I killed all those who were against me.
2SA.22.42	They shouted for help but nobody came to save them.
2SA.22.42	They shouted to the 
2SA.22.43	I hit them until they were like small stones.
2SA.22.43	I beat them and I walked over them like the ground.
2SA.22.44	You have saved me when my people were attacking me.
2SA.22.44	You have made me the ruler of many 
2SA.22.44	People that I did not know obey me.
2SA.22.45	Foreign men come and they bend down to me.
2SA.22.45	They hear me speak and they obey me immediately.
2SA.22.46	They are not brave now.
2SA.22.46	They are very afraid as they leave their strong cities.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.47	Tell people how great he is. He is the strong God who saves me.
2SA.22.48	He helps me to beat my enemies;
2SA.22.48	he causes me to rule over the 
2SA.22.49	He saves me from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You made me stronger than those who were against me.
2SA.22.49	And you save me from those who would hurt me.
2SA.22.50	So I will 
2SA.22.50	I will sing 
2SA.22.51	God wins big and important fights for his king.
2SA.22.51	He is always kind to the king that he has 
2SA.22.51	to David and to his 
2SA.23.1	God chose David, Jesse's son for people to 
2SA.23.2	‘The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	My mouth speaks his words.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel has spoken.
2SA.23.3	He who keeps Israel safe said to me,
2SA.23.3	“A king who rules over men properly is afraid to make God angry.
2SA.23.4	That kind of king is like morning light when the sun rises.
2SA.23.4	Yes, he is like a morning when there are no clouds in the sky.
2SA.23.4	He is like light after rain
2SA.23.4	that causes the grass to seem bright.”
2SA.23.5	God will 
2SA.23.5	That is because he has given a promise to me.
2SA.23.5	And that promise will be for all time.
2SA.23.5	He will not change his promise.
2SA.23.5	And he will do what he has promised to do.
2SA.23.5	That is all that I want. And he will keep me safe.
2SA.23.6	But he will throw out 
2SA.23.6	Some weeds will hurt your hands if you touch them.
2SA.23.6	And those men are like those weeds.
2SA.23.7	The man who wants to touch them needs an iron tool or a strong stick.
2SA.23.7	But men will burn them completely.’
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David's best soldiers.
2SA.23.8	Josheb-Basshebeth the son of Hachmon was the first of the ‘Three’. He stood against 800 men with his 
2SA.23.9	Next was Dodai's son Eleazar from Ahoh's family. He belonged to the three strongest men. He was with David at Pas Dammim when they said words to make their 
2SA.23.10	but Eleazar stood there. And he hit the enemy until his hand was tired. And his hand could not easily leave his 
2SA.23.11	Next was Shammah the son of Agee from Harar. The 
2SA.23.12	But Shammah had stood in the middle of the field. He fought the 
2SA.23.13	The time to bring in the 
2SA.23.14	David was there at that time and the

1KI.1.49	When they heard this, all the people with Adonijah were afraid. They all went away. 
1KI.1.50	But Adonijah, because he was afraid of Solomon, went to the 
1KI.1.51	Then a servant told Solomon, ‘Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon. He is holding the points on the corners of the 
1KI.1.52	Solomon answered, ‘If he is a good man, not one hair from his head will fall to the ground. But if he is a bad man, he will die.’ 
1KI.1.53	Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought Adonijah down from the 
1KI.2.1	The day when David should die was near. Then this is what he told his son Solomon. 
1KI.2.2	David said, ‘Soon I will die like everyone else on the earth. So, be strong. And show people that you have grown into a man. 
1KI.2.3	Do what the 
1KI.2.4	And the 
1KI.2.4	“Someone from your 
1KI.2.4	Live properly.
1KI.2.4	Believe in me.
1KI.2.4	Try as much as they can to obey me about everything.”
1KI.2.5	Also, you know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me. He killed the two leaders of Israel's armies. He killed Abner, the son of Ner and Amasa, the son of Jether. He did it like there was a war. But there was no war! Their blood is on the belt round his body and on the shoes on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	So do the right thing as you thought. Do not let him die in 
1KI.2.7	But be kind to the sons of Barzillai, who lived in Gilead. Let them eat at your table. Do this because they were kind to me when I was running away from your brother Absalom. 
1KI.2.8	And remember, Shimei, the son of Gera, is with you. He came from Bahurim, in Benjamin. He prayed that really bad things would happen to me. He did that when I went to Mahanaim. But he did come down to meet me at the River Jordan. So I promised him, with the 
1KI.2.9	But do not think that he has done nothing wrong. You are a 
1KI.2.10	Then David died and they buried him in the 
1KI.2.11	David had ruled Israel for 40 years. He was 7 years in Hebron, then 33 years in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	So Solomon sat on the 
1KI.2.13	Adonijah was the son of Haggith. He went to Bathsheba, who was the mother of Solomon. And she said, ‘Do you come in 
1KI.2.14	Then he said, ‘I want to say something to you.’ ‘Say it’, she replied. 
1KI.2.15	And he said, ‘You know that I should be king. All Israel thought that I should be their king. But things changed, and now my brother is the king. The 
1KI.2.16	Now I have one thing to ask you. Do not refuse me.’ ‘Tell me’, she replied. 
1KI.2.17	So he said, ‘Ask King Solomon to give me Abishag, the girl from Shunem, as my wife. He will not refuse you.’ 
1KI.2.18	And Bathsheba said, ‘I will speak to the king on your behalf.’
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak on behalf of Adonijah. The king stood up to meet her. He was polite to her. Then he sat down on his 
1KI.2.20	‘I have one small thing to ask you’, she said. ‘Do not refuse me.’ And the king answered her, ‘Ask me, mother! I will not refuse you!’ 
1KI.2.21	So she said, ‘Let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem.’ 
1KI.2.22	And King Solomon said to his mother, ‘You are asking that Adonijah can marry Abishag. You are almost asking me that my older brother should become king! That is what Abiathar the 
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon promised this to the 
1KI.2.24	Now, as surely as the 
1KI.2.24	He has made me safe.
1KI.2.24	He has caused me to sit on the 
1KI.2.24	My children will be kings after me.’
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon 
1KI.2.26	The king said to Abiathar the 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon stopped Abiathar from being a 
1KI.2.28	Then the news about this came to Joab. Now Joab had talked with Adonijah, but not with Absalom. So Joab hurried to the 
1KI.2.29	And they told Solomon that Joab had hurried to the 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah went into the 
1KI.2.31	Then the king said to Benaiah, ‘Do as he says. Knock him down and bury him. So you will remove from me and from my father's 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.32	Abner, the son of Ner. He was the leader of Israel's army.
1KI.2.32	Amasa, the son of Jether. He was the leader of Judah's army.
1KI.2.33	So Joab and his children and their children will always have troubles because they killed those men. But David's children, their children and his 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went and he knocked down Joab. He killed him. Joab was buried in his own land in the country. 
1KI.2.35	And the king chose Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, to be the leader of the army instead of Joab. Also, the king chose Zadok the 
1KI.2.36	Then the king asked for Shimei to come to him. He said to Shimei, ‘Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live in it. Do not go out from it to anywhere else. 
1KI.2.37	On the day that you leave it to cross the Kidron Valley, you will die. You will die because of what you yourself have done.’ 
1KI.2.38	And Shimei said to the king, ‘Your words are good. Your servant will do as my master the king has said.’ So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days. 
1KI.2.39	But after three years, two of Shimei's slaves ran away. They went to Achish, who was the son of Maacah, the king of Gath. Someone told Shimei, ‘Your slaves are in Gath.’ 
1KI.2.40	So Shimei went out and he prepared his 
1KI.2.41	Someone reported to Solomon that Shimei had travelled from Jerusalem to Gath. Then he had returned. 
1KI.2.42	So the king asked for Shimei to come to him. He said to Shimei, ‘You spoke a very serious promise to the 
1KI.2.43	But you have not 
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shimei, ‘You know in your mind all the bad things that you did to my father David. Now the 
1KI.2.45	But good things will happen to King Solomon. The 
1KI.2.46	Then the king told Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, the thing to do. So he went out and he knocked Shimei down. And he killed him. So Solomon now ruled the country. Nobody could say that he was not the proper king.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made a 
1KI.3.1	his 
1KI.3.1	the 
1KI.3.1	the wall round Jerusalem.
1KI.3.2	But the people still 
1KI.3.3	Solomon showed that he loved the 
1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon to 
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon, Solomon saw the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon answered, ‘You were very kind to your servant, my father David. This was because he always believed in you. He was a good man and he was honest. You have continued to be very kind to him. You have given to him a son to sit on his 
1KI.3.7	Now, my 
1KI.3.8	Your servant is here, among the people that you have chosen. It is a great country. There are too many people to count, or to find out how many that there are. 
1KI.3.9	So give to your servant a mind that understands things. So I will be able to rule your people. I will be able to see who is right. And I will be able to see who is wrong. That is how I will be able to rule your great country.’
1KI.3.10	It made the Lord happy that Solomon had asked for this.
1KI.3.11+1KI.3.12	So God said to him, ‘I will give you what you have asked for. I will do it for these reasons:
1KI.3.11+1KI.3.12	You have asked for a mind that understands how to rule people fairly.
1KI.3.11+1KI.3.12	You have not asked for a long life or to be very rich.
1KI.3.11+1KI.3.12	You have not asked for the death of your enemies.
1KI.3.11+1KI.3.12	I will give to you a mind that is 
1KI.3.13	I will give you more than this. I will give to you the things that you did not ask for. I will make you rich. People will know that you are great. While you are alive, there will be no better king than you. 
1KI.3.14	Also, I will give to you a long life, if you live as I want you to live. Obey my rules and my 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke. And he knew that it was a dream. He returned to Jerusalem and he stood in front of the 
1KI.3.16	Then two women came and they stood in front of the king. The women were 
1KI.3.17	And one woman said, ‘Oh! My 
1KI.3.18	And three days after my child was born, she also had a baby. We were alone in the house. Only the two of us were there. There was no stranger there. 
1KI.3.19	But this woman lay on her son in the night and he died. 
1KI.3.20	So she got up at midnight and she took my son from my side. I, your servant, was asleep. She put him by her breast and she put her dead son by my breast. 
1KI.3.21	When I got up in the morning to feed my son, he was dead! So I looked carefully at him in the morning light. Then I saw that he was not my son. He was not the son that was born to me!’ 
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman said, ‘No! It is my son that is alive. Your son is dead!’ But the first woman answered, ‘No! The dead boy is yours. My son is alive!’ And so they argued in front of the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, ‘This woman says, “My son is alive and your son is dead.” But the other woman says, “No! Your son is dead and my son is alive.” ’ 
1KI.3.24	So the king said, ‘Bring me a 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, ‘Cut the child that is alive into two pieces. Give half to one woman and half to the other woman.’ 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose son was alive spoke. She really loved her son. So she said to the king, ‘My 
1KI.3.27	Then this was what the king decided. ‘Give the baby that is alive to the first woman. She is its mother. Do not kill it.’ 
1KI.3.28	Everybody in Israel heard what the king had decided. And they were really afraid of the king. They knew that he used the 
1KI.4.1	So King Solomon was the king of all Israel.
1KI.4.2	And these were his important officers:
1KI.4.2	Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah. They were the sons of Shisha. They wrote down what happened.
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud. Jehoshaphat looked after what was written.

1KI.4.20	There were very many people in Judah and Israel. There were as many of them as there are bits of sand by the sea. They ate and they drank. So they were very happy.
1KI.4.21	And Solomon ruled over all the 
1KI.4.22	And this is what his officers supplied to Solomon each day:
1KI.4.22	30 cors (6600 litres or 1700 gallons) of flour.

1KI.4.24	Solomon ruled all the land west of the River Euphrates. He ruled from Tiphsah to Gaza. There was no war in any of these places. 
1KI.4.25	While Solomon ruled, Judah and Israel were safe. Each person lived under their 
1KI.4.26	Solomon had 4000 buildings for horses that pulled 
1KI.4.27	The 12 officers supplied food for King Solomon and for everybody that ate with him. The king got everything that he needed. 
1KI.4.28	Each officer brought his part. They brought food and dry grass for the horses that pulled 
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon 
1KI.4.30	Solomon had more 
1KI.4.31	He had more 
1KI.4.32	He spoke 3000 
1KI.4.33	And he described many plants: he described large ones like the 
1KI.4.34	People came from all countries to listen to the 
1KI.5.1	Hiram was the king of Tyre. He heard that Solomon had become king after his father David. So Hiram sent his servants to Solomon, because Hiram had always been a friend of David. 
1KI.5.2	And Solomon sent this message to Hiram. It said, 
1KI.5.3	‘You know about my father David. He was unable to build a 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	So, I have decided to build a 
1KI.5.6	And you know that none of us can make wood from trees like the men from Sidon. So now, tell your men that they should cut down 
1KI.5.7	Hiram was very happy when he heard Solomon's message. And he said, ‘
1KI.5.8	So Hiram sent this message to Solomon. ‘I have received the message that you sent to me. I will do all that you ask. I will send you 
1KI.5.9	My men will pull them from Lebanon to the sea. And I will tie several trees together. And then I will pull them along the top of the sea to where you want them. There I will make them into separate trees again, and you will take them away. And you will supply food for my 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the 
1KI.5.11	Then Solomon supplied Hiram with 20,000 cors (4.4 million litres or 1 million gallons) of 
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	Then King Solomon caused 30,000 men from all Israel to work for him. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon in groups of 10,000 men each month. So, they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was the master of these men. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had 70,000 men that carried things. And he had 80,000 men that cut stones in the hills. 
1KI.5.16	He also had 3300 leaders. They told the workers what they should do. 
1KI.5.17	The king 
1KI.5.18	So the men that worked for Solomon and for Hiram prepared the stone and the wood to build the 
1KI.6.1	So, Solomon began to build the 
1KI.6.2	The 
1KI.6.3	The 
1KI.6.4	And Solomon made narrow windows near the tops of the 
1KI.6.5	Outside the walls of the 
1KI.6.6	The lowest 
1KI.6.7	When they made the 
1KI.6.8	The door to the lowest 
1KI.6.9	So Solomon built the 
1KI.6.10	And he built the rooms all along the sides of the 
1KI.6.11	And the 
1KI.6.12	‘You are building this 
1KI.6.12	Obey my 
1KI.6.12	Obey my rules.
1KI.6.12	Do everything that I 
1KI.6.13	If you do those things, I will live among the 
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the 
1KI.6.15	He put boards that his men made from 
1KI.6.16	Solomon made a Most 
1KI.6.17	The room in front of this Most 
1KI.6.18	They made the inside of the 
1KI.6.19	Solomon made the Most 
1KI.6.20	This Most 
1KI.6.21	Solomon covered everything inside the

1KI.8.15	And he said, ‘
1KI.8.16	“I brought my people Israel out from Egypt. Since then, I have not chosen a city in any 
1KI.8.17	My father really wanted to build a 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	You will not build the 
1KI.8.20	The 
1KI.8.21	I have made a place there for the 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood in front of the 
1KI.8.23	And Solomon said,
1KI.8.23	‘
1KI.8.24	You have done what you promised to do for your servant, my father David. Your mouth spoke the promise. Then your hands did the work, as we see today. 
1KI.8.25	Now 
1KI.8.26	So now I pray, God of Israel, “Cause what you promised to your servant, my father David, to happen.”
1KI.8.27	But surely God will not really live on the earth! Even 
1KI.8.28	But listen while I, your servant, pray to you, my 
1KI.8.29	Watch over this 
1KI.8.30	Hear the words of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they pray towards this place. Hear us from the place called 
1KI.8.31	Sometimes, a man does something that is wrong to somebody else. The man must come to this 
1KI.8.32	Then, listen from 
1KI.8.33	Perhaps an enemy will win a war against your people, Israel, because Israel has not obeyed you. Your people may then turn back to you. They may do these things:
1KI.8.33	say that your name is the name of their God.
1KI.8.33	pray to you.
1KI.8.33	ask you to 
1KI.8.34	If they do that, hear them from 
1KI.8.35	Sometimes, the skies will become dry and there will be no rain. This will be when your people have not obeyed you. Then, they may do these things:
1KI.8.35	pray towards this place.
1KI.8.35	say that your name is the name of their God.
1KI.8.35	turn from what they have done wrong, because you have hurt them.
1KI.8.36	If they do that, hear them from 
1KI.8.37	Sometimes, these things will happen in the country:
1KI.8.37	There will not be enough food.
1KI.8.37	The animals and plants and people will be ill.
1KI.8.37	There will be insects called locusts and grasshoppers.
1KI.8.37	There will be an enemy all round one of their cities.
1KI.8.37	Illness will hurt people and enemies will kill people.
1KI.8.38	Then, perhaps, only one person from among all of your people Israel will pray to you. He may feel that his heart hurts inside him. So, he will lift up his hands towards this 
1KI.8.39	If he does that, hear him. Hear him from 
1KI.8.40	So, everybody will be afraid of you, while they live in the country. This is the country that you gave to our 
1KI.8.41	Strangers, who do not belong to your people Israel, will come far from other countries. They will do this because they will hear about your name. 
1KI.8.42	People will hear about your great name and about your strong hand and about the arm that you lift up. The stranger will come and he will pray towards this 
1KI.8.43	When this happens, God, hear him from your home in 
1KI.8.44	Sometimes, your people will go to fight against their enemies. They will go to where you send them. And when they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	When they pray to you, listen to them from your home in 
1KI.8.46	There is nobody that does not 
1KI.8.47	Then, they may become sorry that they have 
1KI.8.48	They may turn back to you in the country of their enemies, who put them into prisons. They may want to obey you with all their minds and bodies. They may pray to you. And they will look towards the country that you gave to their 
1KI.8.49	Then hear them from your home in 
1KI.8.50	And 
1KI.8.51	Do this because they are your people. They belong to you. You brought them out of Egypt. And Egypt was like a very hot fire that could make iron like water.
1KI.8.52	I pray that your eyes will always be open:
1KI.8.52	to what your servant Solomon asks you.
1KI.8.52	to what your people, Israel, ask you.
1KI.8.52	I hope that you will always listen to them. Do this when they pray to you.
1KI.8.53	Do this because you chose them from all the countries in the world, to be your own people. This is what you promised to your servant Moses. You did it when you, 
1KI.8.54	So Solomon finished praying about everything that he wanted to ask the 
1KI.8.55	But now he stood up and he asked God to do good things to all the people in Israel. He said with a loud voice, 
1KI.8.56	‘
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	I pray that the 
1KI.8.59	I have prayed all these words to the 
1KI.8.60	So, all the people on the earth will know that the 
1KI.8.61	But you people really must want to be servants of the 
1KI.8.62	Then the king, and all Israel's people with him, offered 
1KI.8.63	These are the 
1KI.8.63	22,000 cows
1KI.8.63	120,000 sheep and goats.
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered these because he and the 
1KI.8.64	On that same day, the king gave the 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon had a 
1KI.8.66	The day after the party, Solomon sent the people away. They all said good things about the king and then they went home. They were very happy and they felt good inside themselves. This was because the 
1KI.9.1	Solomon had finished building the 
1KI.9.2	Then the 
1KI.9.3	The 
1KI.9.3	‘I have heard what you have prayed to me. And what you have asked me. I have made this 
1KI.9.4	I will do good things for you, if you will do these things:
1KI.9.4	Be my servant, as your father David was my servant.
1KI.9.4	Do everything that I ask you to do.
1KI.9.5	Then I will make someone from your 
1KI.9.6	But you and your sons must not turn away from me. You must not become servants of other gods and you must not 
1KI.9.7	If you do, I will remove Israel from their country. It is the country that I have given to them. Also, I will destroy this 
1KI.9.8	This 
1KI.9.9	And people will answer, “He has done it because they have not obeyed the 
1KI.9.10	Solomon was building the 
1KI.9.11	he gave 20 towns in Galilee to Hiram, the king of Tyre. He did this because Hiram had given him all that he needed. Solomon had given him 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram went from Tyre to Galilee, to see the towns that Solomon had given to him. But Hiram was not happy with them. 
1KI.9.13	‘These are not very good towns that you have given to me, my dear friend!’ he said. Hiram called them the Land of Cabul. They are still called that today. 
1KI.9.14	Hiram had sent to king Solomon 120 
1KI.9.15	Solomon caused slaves to work for him. They built the 
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh was the king of Egypt. He had attacked Gezer and it had become his. He had burnt it. He had killed the 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon built Gezer again. He also built the town called Lower Beth Horon. 
1KI.9.18	He also built Baalath and Tadmor. They were in his country, in places where there was much sand. 
1KI.9.19	And Solomon built cities and towns where he could store things. He also kept his 
1KI.9.20	Some people who were not 
1KI.9.21	The 
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make any of the 
1KI.9.23	And 550 people were leaders of the people that built things for Solomon. They told the men that did the work what to do.
1KI.9.24	Pharaoh's daughter came up from where she lived in the 
1KI.9.25	Three times every year Solomon offered 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber. This place is near Elath in Edom. It is by the Red Sea. 
1KI.9.27	Hiram had sailors who knew about the sea. He sent these men to sail with Solomon's sailors. 
1KI.9.28	They sailed to Ophir and they brought back 420 
1KI.10.1	The Queen of Sheba heard that Solomon was very famous. Also, she heard that he was a servant of the 
1KI.10.2	She arrived at Jerusalem with many servants. She had animals called camels. They carried 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing that was too difficult for the king to explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	The Queen of Sheba saw how 
1KI.10.5	She saw all the food that was on his table. She saw all the important men in his government when they met together. She saw all his servants in their beautiful clothes. She saw all the people that tasted 
1KI.10.6	She said to the king, ‘I heard in my country about what you had done. Also, I heard about how 
1KI.10.7	But I did not believe those things until I came here. Then I saw with my own eyes that it was true! Really, they told me less than half of what was true! You are very much 
1KI.10.8	I think that your men should be very happy! The people in your government, who are always with you, should be very happy too. They are always hearing how 
1KI.10.9	So, we must 
1KI.10.10	And she gave to the king 120 
1KI.10.11	Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir. They also brought from there large amounts of a special kind of wood called almug wood and valuable stones. 
1KI.10.12	The king used the almug wood to make things for the 
1KI.10.13	So King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba everything that she wanted. He gave her everything that she asked for. He also gave her valuable gifts. Then she left Solomon and she returned to her own country with her servants.
1KI.10.14	The weight of gold that Solomon received each year was 666 
1KI.10.15	This did not include money from these people:
1KI.10.15	people who bought and sold things to get money
1KI.10.15	all the kings of Arabia
1KI.10.15	the government in Solomon's own country.
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made 200 large 
1KI.10.17	Solomon also made 300 small 
1KI.10.18	Then the king made a large 
1KI.10.19	There were 6 steps up to the 
1KI.10.20	There were 12 more 
1KI.10.21	They made all King Solomon's 
1KI.10.22	The king had a number of ships that could sail as far as Tarshish. They sailed with Hiram's ships. Every 3 years they returned to Solomon. They carried gold, 
1KI.10.23	King Solomon was richer than all the other kings in the world. Also, he had more 
1KI.10.24	All the people in the whole world wanted to talk to Solomon. They wanted to hear the 
1KI.10.25	Every year, everyone who came to Solomon brought him a gift. They brought 
1KI.10.26	Solomon brought together many 
1KI.10.27	The king made 
1KI.10.28	Solomon's horses came from Egypt and from Kue. He sent people to Kue to buy the horses for him. 
1KI.10.29	They brought a 
1KI.11.1	Solomon loved Pharaoh's daughter who came from Egypt. But he also loved many other women from foreign countries. They were called Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites because of the countries that they came from. 
1KI.11.2	The 
1KI.11.3	He had 700 wives who were important ladies. Also, he had 300 other women who lived with him. His wives caused him to become the servant of other gods. 
1KI.11.4	This happened when Solomon got older. His wives caused him to love other gods. Solomon did not completely love the 
1KI.11.5	Solomon made Ashtoreth his god. She was the female god of the people in Sidon. He also made Molech his god. He was the really bad god of the people who lived in Ammon. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did what the 
1KI.11.7	There was a hill east of Jerusalem. Solomon built a high place there for Chemosh and Molech. They were really bad gods of the people who lived in Moab and in Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	Solomon did the same for all his foreign wives. They burned 
1KI.11.9	So the 
1KI.11.10	The 
1KI.11.11	So the 
1KI.11.12	But I will not do it while you are alive. This is because of the promise that I said to David your father. I will tear the 
1KI.11.13	But I will not tear the whole 
1KI.11.14	Then the 
1KI.11.15	David had fought against Edom a few years before. Then Joab was the leader of David's army. He had gone to Edom to bury the dead people. These were people from Israel who were killed in the battle. He killed all the men in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	Joab and all the army from Israel stayed in Edom for 6 months. They killed all the men in Edom. 
1KI.11.17	But Hadad was only a boy at this time. He ran away to Egypt, with some people from his father's government. 
1KI.11.18	They started from Midian and they went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and they went to Egypt. They went to Pharaoh the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house and land and food. 
1KI.11.19	Pharaoh was so happy with Hadad that he gave him a wife. She was the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 
1KI.11.20	Tahpenes's sister had a son with Hadad. They called him Genubath. He lived with Tahpenes in the king's 
1KI.11.21	In Egypt, Hadad heard that David had died. Also, Joab, the leader of David's army, was dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, ‘Let me return to my own country.’ 
1KI.11.22	Pharaoh asked him, ‘Why do you want to return to your own country? What have you not got here that you want?’ ‘Nothing’, Hadad replied, ‘but do let me go!’
1KI.11.23	And God brought another enemy against Solomon, called Rezon. He was the son of Eliada. Rezon had run away from his master, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24	Rezon had men with him and he became their leader. They wanted to fight David, after he had destroyed the army of Zobah. Rezon's men went to Damascus. They decided to live there. They became leaders in Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	Rezon was Israel's enemy all the time that Solomon was alive. Like Hadad, he caused trouble for Solomon. So Rezon ruled in Aram and he was an enemy of Israel.
1KI.11.26	Then, Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, started to fight against the king. He was one of Solomon's officers. Jeroboam came from Zeredah in Ephraim. His mother was a 
1KI.11.27	This happened when Jeroboam started to fight against the king. Solomon had built the 
1KI.11.28	Jeroboam was an important man. And Solomon saw that the young man Jeroboam did his work very well. So, Solomon made him the leader of all the workers from the 
1KI.11.29	At that time, Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem. He met Ahijah who was a 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah took off the new coat that he was wearing. He tore it into 12 pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said to Jeroboam, ‘Take 10 pieces for yourself, because the 
1KI.11.32	But for two reasons Solomon will have one 
1KI.11.32	I promised something to David.
1KI.11.32	I have chosen Jerusalem.
1KI.11.33	I will do this because Solomon has gone away from me. He has 
1KI.11.34	But I will not take all the 
1KI.11.35	I will take the 
1KI.11.36	I will give one 
1KI.11.37	But I will do this to you. You will rule everything that you want. You will be the king of Israel. 
1KI.11.38	But you must do everything that I 
1KI.11.39	David's 
1KI.11.40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam ran away to Egypt. He went to Shishak the king of Egypt. And he stayed there until Solomon died.
1KI.11.41	Other things happened while Solomon was king. They are all in the Book about Solomon. It includes his 
1KI.11.42	Solomon ruled all Israel from Jerusalem for 40 years. 
1KI.11.43	Then he rested with his 
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all the 
1KI.12.2	Now Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was still in Egypt. He had gone there when he ran away from King Solomon. But Jeroboam returned from Egypt when he heard about Rehoboam. 
1KI.12.3	Then the 
1KI.12.4	‘Your father caused us to work too much. Now, make it easier for us. If you make our work easier, we will be your servants.’ 
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam answered them, ‘Go away for three days. Then come back to me.’ So the people went away.
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam went to some older men. They had helped his father Solomon, when he was alive. ‘What answer should I give to these 
1KI.12.7	They said to him, ‘If you are like a servant to them today, they will always be your servants. If you speak kindly to them, they will always work for you.’ 
1KI.12.8	But Rehoboam did not believe what these older men said. He talked about it to some younger men. They had always been with him and they were his servants. 
1KI.12.9	He said to them, ‘What do you think that I should do? What answer should we give to the people who say this to me? “Make our work easier than your father made it.” ’ 
1KI.12.10	These young men had always been with Rehoboam. The young men said, ‘Say this to the people who said these things to you. “Your father caused us to do work that was not easy. Now make our work easier.” Say to them, “My little finger is thicker than my father's body. 
1KI.12.11	My father gave you work that was not easy. I will make it even less easy. My father hit you with 
1KI.12.12	Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam three days after that. That was because the king had said, ‘Return to me in three days.’ 
1KI.12.13	The king spoke words that were not kind to the people. He did not say what the older men had wanted him to say. 
1KI.12.14	He said what the young men had suggested. ‘My father gave you work that was not easy. I will make it even less easy. My father hit you with 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not do what the 
1KI.12.16	Then all the 
1KI.12.16	‘We do not want to be a part of David's country.
1KI.12.16	We do not want to belong to Jesse's son.
1KI.12.16	Now, David's son, you can rule your own people!’
1KI.12.16	So all the 
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam still ruled the people that lived in the towns in Judah. 
1KI.12.18	A man called Adoniram told the workers what they should do. Rehoboam sent him to do this. But the 
1KI.12.19	So the people that live in Israel have been against the 
1KI.12.20	All the 
1KI.12.21	Rehoboam arrived back in Jerusalem. He brought all the people that lived in Judah and Benjamin together. There were 180,000 of them that could fight. Rehoboam wanted to start a war against Israel. He wanted to get back the 
1KI.12.22	Then this word of God came to Shemaiah, a servant of God. 
1KI.12.23	‘Say this to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. Solomon was the king of Judah. Say it to everybody in Judah and in Benjamin. Say it also to everybody else. 
1KI.12.24	This is what the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam made Shechem into a strong city. He lived there, in the hills of Ephraim. Then he went to the city called Penuel and he made it stronger. 
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam thought inside himself, ‘Now, almost certainly, the 
1KI.12.27	The people from the north will go to Jerusalem. They will offer 
1KI.12.28	Jeroboam asked some people what he should do. Then king Jeroboam made two young cows out of gold. He said to the people that he ruled, ‘It is too difficult for you to go up to Jerusalem. These young cows are your gods, people of Israel. They brought you up out of Egypt.’ 
1KI.12.29	He put one young cow in Bethel and he put the other young cow in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	But that became a 
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam also built places on hills where people could 
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam started a special day on the 15th day of the 8th month. That was like the special day that they had in Judah. But he offered 
1KI.12.33	Jeroboam chose the 8th month in his own mind. On the 15th day of that month, he offered 
1KI.13.1	The 
1KI.13.2	God's servant shouted loudly against the 
1KI.13.3	The same day, God's servant said what else would happen. He said that it would be like a sign. ‘This is the sign that the 
1KI.13.4	Jeroboam heard what God's servant shouted loudly against the 
1KI.13.5	Also, the 
1KI.13.6	Then the king said to God's servant, ‘Pray for me. Pray to the 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to God's servant, ‘Come to my home with me. Have something to eat. Then I will give you a gift.’ 
1KI.13.8	But God's servant said to the king, ‘You might give to me half of what is yours. But still I would not go with you! I would not eat bread and I would not drink water here. 
1KI.13.9	That is because I was sent here by the 
1KI.13.10	So God's servant returned by another road. He did not go on the road by which he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now a certain old 
1KI.13.12	Their father asked his sons, ‘Which way did God's servant go?’ And his sons told him on which road God's servant from Judah had gone. 
1KI.13.13	Then the old 
1KI.13.14	Then he rode after God's servant. He found God's servant, who was sitting under an 
1KI.13.15	The old 
1KI.13.16	God's servant said, ‘I cannot come with you. I must not go back to Bethel. I cannot eat bread or drink water with you in that country. 
1KI.13.17	The 
1KI.13.18	The old 
1KI.13.19	So God's servant went with him. And he ate and drank in his house.
1KI.13.20	They were sitting together at the table. The 
1KI.13.21	The old 
1KI.13.21	‘This is what the 
1KI.13.22	You came here. He said to you, “You must not eat bread or drink water in that place.” But you ate bread and you drank water here. As a result, they will not bury your body in the same place as they buried your fathers' body.’
1KI.13.23	God's servant finished his food and his drink. Then the 
1KI.13.24	But when he went on his journey, a 
1KI.13.25	Some people, who passed it, saw the dead body. It lay on the road. The 
1KI.13.26	That was the old 
1KI.13.27	The old 
1KI.13.28	Then the old 
1KI.13.29	So the old 
1KI.13.30	He buried the body in the place that he had made for his own dead body. All the people were sad about it, and they said, ‘Oh! My dear friend!’ 
1KI.13.31	When they had buried him, the old 
1KI.13.32	This is why you must do it. Certainly the message that God's servant brought will become true. The message that he brought was by the 
1KI.13.33	Even after this, Jeroboam did not stop doing bad things. He made more 
1KI.13.34	This was a big 
1KI.14.1	Jeroboam's son was called Abijah. At that time, Abijah became ill. 
1KI.14.2	So Jeroboam said to his wife, ‘Cause yourself to seem different so people will not recognise you as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the 
1KI.14.3	Take 10 loaves of bread with you. Also take some cakes and a jar of 
1KI.14.4	So Jeroboam's wife did what he said to her. She went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh. Ahijah could not see because he was very old. 
1KI.14.5	But the 
1KI.14.6	So, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet on the ground, he said, ‘Come in, Jeroboam's wife! You need not cause yourself to seem like somebody else. The 
1KI.14.7	Go and tell this to Jeroboam. It is what the 
1KI.14.8	I tore the 
1KI.14.9	But you have done more really bad things than all the people that lived before you. You have made other gods for yourself. You have made 
1KI.14.10	Because of this, I will destroy the 
1KI.14.11	Dogs will eat any of Jeroboam's 
1KI.14.12	But you, Jeroboam's wife, go back home. The boy will die when your feet reach the city. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel will cry because of him and they will bury him. He is the only person from Jeroboam's 
1KI.14.14	The 
1KI.14.15	Also, the 
1KI.14.16	And the 
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam's wife stood up. She left the house and she went to Tirzah. When she walked through the door of her house, the boy died. 
1KI.14.18	They buried him and all Israel cried about his death. This is what the 
1KI.14.19	There is a book with reports about the kings of Israel. They wrote about everything else that King Jeroboam did, in this book. It includes his wars and how he ruled his people. 
1KI.14.20	Jeroboam was king for 22 years. Then he died and they buried him with his 
1KI.14.21	Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was the king of Judah. He was 41 years old when he became king. He ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the city that the 
1KI.14.22	The people in Judah did what the 
1KI.14.23	They also had made 
1KI.14.24	There were even

1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard this, he did not build again in Ramah. He brought his army back to Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa said that everyone in Judah must do this. They must carry away everything that Baasha was using in Ramah. This included stones and wood. King Asa used them to make Geba in Benjamin strong and also Mizpah.

1KI.16.22	But the half that wanted Omri was stronger than the other half. After 4 years, Tibni the son of Ginath died. Then Omri became the king of Israel. 
1KI.16.23	Omri became king of Israel when Asa had been king of Judah for nearly 31 years. Omri ruled the people for 12 years. He was in Tirzah for 6 of these years.

1KI.17.2	Then, the 
1KI.17.3	The 
1KI.17.4	You will drink water from the stream and the 
1KI.17.5	So Elijah obeyed the 
1KI.17.6	The 
1KI.17.7	There was no rain in the country of Israel, so the stream became dry after a time.
1KI.17.8	Then the 
1KI.17.9	‘Go immediately to Zarephath near Sidon. Stay there. I have said to a

1KI.17.11	While she was getting it, he said, ‘And bring me, please, a bit of bread.’ 
1KI.17.12	She replied, ‘As surely as the 
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, ‘Do not be afraid. Go home. And do what you have said. But first, make a small cake of bread for me. Use what you have got to make it. Then bring it to me. And after that, make something for yourself and for your son. 
1KI.17.14	This is what the 
1KI.17.15	Then the 
1KI.17.16	She did not use all the flour in the jar and she did not use all the 
1KI.17.17	Some time after that, the son of the woman who had the house became ill. He became worse and worse until he died. 
1KI.17.18	The woman said to Elijah, ‘Servant of God, why have you done this to me? Did you come to cause me to think about my

1KI.17.23	Elijah picked up the boy and he carried him downstairs. He took the boy from his room into the house. He gave the boy to his mother and he said, ‘Look! Your son is alive!’ 
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, ‘Now I know that God sent you. The 
1KI.18.1	Three years after that, the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to meet Ahab. It was a time when there was almost no food for the people in Samaria to eat. 
1KI.18.3	Ahab had asked Obadiah to meet him. Obadiah was the leader of the servants in Ahab's 
1KI.18.4	Jezebel had killed many of the 
1KI.18.5	Ahab had said to Obadiah, ‘Go through all the country. Go to all the valleys and to places where there is usually water. Maybe we can find some grass to feed the horses and other animals. If we do, we will not have to kill our animals.’ 
1KI.18.6	So Ahab and Obadiah went through the country. Ahab went in one direction and Obadiah went in another direction.
1KI.18.7	While Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognised Elijah and he bent in front of him. Obadiah said, ‘Is it really you, my 
1KI.18.8	‘Yes!’ Elijah replied. ‘Go. And tell your master that Elijah is here.’ 
1KI.18.9	‘Have I done something wrong?’ Obadiah asked. ‘Is that why you are sending me, your servant, to Ahab? Ahab will certainly kill me! 
1KI.18.10	As surely as the 
1KI.18.11	But now you want me to go to my master. And you want me to say, “Elijah is here!” 
1KI.18.12	I do not know where the 
1KI.18.13	Have you not heard what I have done? While Jezebel was killing the 
1KI.18.14	And now you want me to go to my master. And you want me to say, “Elijah is here!” He will kill me!’ 
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, ‘I am the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab. He told Ahab where Elijah was. And Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, ‘Is that really you? You are the person that is bringing trouble to Israel.’ 
1KI.18.18	‘I have not brought trouble to Israel’, Elijah replied. ‘You and your father's 
1KI.18.19	Now, fetch people from all over Israel. Say that they must meet me. They must meet me on the hill called Carmel. Also, bring the 450 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent the message through all Israel. He brought the 
1KI.18.21	Elijah stood up in front of the people and he said, ‘You should not have two ideas still about what you should do. If the 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to them, ‘I am the only 
1KI.18.23	Fetch two male cows for us. The 
1KI.18.24	Then, you pray to your god and I will pray to the 
1KI.18.25	Elijah said to the 
1KI.18.26	So the 
1KI.18.27	At noon, Elijah began to

1KI.18.29	They continued what they were doing through the afternoon. They did it until the time came for the evening 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, ‘Come here, near to me.’ When they came, Elijah mended the 
1KI.18.31	Elijah found 12 stones, one for each of the 
1KI.18.32	Elijah built an

1KI.18.34	‘Do it again’, he said. So they did it again. ‘Do it a third time’, he said. So they did it for the third time. 
1KI.18.35	The water poured down from the 
1KI.18.36	The time came for the evening 
1KI.18.37	Answer me, 
1KI.18.38	Then fire came down from the 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw this, they fell flat on the ground. They shouted, ‘The 
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said, ‘Catch the 
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, ‘Go. Eat and drink. Do it quickly, because there is the sound of a lot of rain.’ 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went to eat and to drink. But Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel. He bent down to the ground. He put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	He said to his servant, ‘Go and look towards the sea.’ So his servant went and looked. ‘There is nothing there’, he said. Elijah said 7 times, ‘Go back and look.’ 
1KI.18.44	The 7th time, the servant reported, ‘A cloud is rising up from the sea. It is as small as a man's hand.’ So Elijah said, ‘Go and say to Ahab, “Make your

1KI.18.46	Then the 
1KI.19.1	Then Ahab told Jezebel about everything that Elijah had done. He told her how Elijah had killed all the 
1KI.19.2	So Jezebel sent a message to Elijah. ‘By this time tomorrow, I will make your life like one of the 
1KI.19.3	Then Elijah was afraid. He ran away to save his life. He came to Beersheba in the country called Judah. He left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	Elijah himself went into the 
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down under the tree and he went to sleep. Soon, an 
1KI.19.6	And Elijah looked and he saw by his head a cake. Someone had baked it on a fire. Also, there was a jar of water. So he ate the cake and he drank the water. Then he lay down again to sleep. 
1KI.19.7	The 
1KI.19.8	So Elijah got up. He ate the food and he drank the water. The food made him strong enough to travel for 40 days and 40 nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.
1KI.19.9	Elijah went into a 
1KI.19.10	Elijah replied, ‘I have always been a very good servant of the 
1KI.19.11	Then the 
1KI.19.12	After the 
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard that, he put his coat over his face. He went out and he stood at the way into the 
1KI.19.14	Elijah said, ‘I have always been a very good servant of the 
1KI.19.15	The

1KI.20.2	He sent people with messages into the city. They came to Ahab, who was the king of Israel. They said to Ahab, ‘This is what Ben-hadad says. 
1KI.20.3	“Your 
1KI.20.4	This is what the king of Israel answered him. ‘It is as you say, my 
1KI.20.5	The people with messages came again. They said, ‘This is what Ben-hadad says. “I want your 
1KI.20.6	At this time tomorrow, I will send my officers to look in your 
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel said that all the leaders in his country must come to him. He said to them, ‘You must know this. This man wants to cause trouble! I did not refuse when he asked for my wives and my children, my 
1KI.20.8	The leaders and the people answered, ‘Do not listen to him. Do not agree to what he demands.’ 
1KI.20.9	So the king of Israel said to the people who brought messages from Ben-hadad, ‘Say this to my 
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-hadad sent another message to Ahab. He said, ‘I want the gods to be cruel to me, if I am not very cruel! And I pray that it will happen! I will leave very little dirt in Samaria. There will not be enough dirt to fill the hands of each of my soldiers.’ 
1KI.20.11	This was the king of Israel's answer. ‘Say to him, “If you put on a soldier's clothes, do not 
1KI.20.12	Ben-hadad received this message when he and his 
1KI.20.13	Then a 
1KI.20.14	‘But who will do this?’ asked Ahab. The 
1KI.20.15	So Ahab said that the young officers must come to him. There were 232 of them among the army leaders. Then he brought all the other 
1KI.20.16	They went out at noon to where the enemy's army was. Ben-hadad and his 32 
1KI.20.17	The young officers, from among the army leaders, went out first. Now Ben-hadad had put men to watch the enemy. They said, ‘Men are coming from Samaria.’ 
1KI.20.18	Ben-hadad said, ‘If they want to stop the war, catch them alive. If they want to fight, catch them alive.’ 
1KI.20.19	The young officers, from among the army leaders, marched out of the city called Samaria. The army marched behind them. 
1KI.20.20	Each of the soldiers killed an enemy. When that happened, the soldiers from Aram ran away. The 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel attacked the horses and 
1KI.20.22	After the fight, the 
1KI.20.23	Also, after the fight, some of the king of Aram's leaders spoke to him. ‘The gods of the 
1KI.20.24	Do this. Remove all the 
1KI.20.25	Also you must get an army the same size as the one that you lost. There must be the same number of horses and 
1KI.20.26	The next spring, Ben-hadad brought together his army of soldiers from Aram. They went to Aphek to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	Ahab brought all the 
1KI.20.28	God's servant came to the king of Israel. He told the king, ‘This is what the 
1KI.20.29	For 7 days, the two armies stayed in their

1KI.20.31	Some of his leaders said to Ben-hadad, ‘We have heard that the kings of the

1KI.20.33	So the men hoped that they would get a friendly answer. They answered him quickly. ‘Yes! Ben-hadad is like your brother’, they said. ‘Go and fetch him’, the king said. When Ben-hadad came out from Aphek, Ahab got him up into his 
1KI.20.34	Ben-hadad said, ‘I will give you the cities that my father took from your father. You can have your own markets in Damascus, as my father had in Samaria.’ Ahab answered, ‘We will agree to do this and you can go home a free man.’ So they agreed together, and Ahab let Ben-hadad go home.
1KI.20.35	The 
1KI.20.36	So the 
1KI.20.37	The 
1KI.20.38	Then the 
1KI.20.39	The king passed the 
1KI.20.40	But your servant was busy. He did several things. While he did them, the man ran away.’ ‘That is your problem’, the king of Israel said. ‘You have said yourself what will happen.’ 
1KI.20.41	Then the 
1KI.20.42	The 
1KI.20.43	So the king went to his 
1KI.21.1	Naboth lived in a town called Jezreel. He had a

1KI.21.5	Ahab's wife, Jezebel, came in to Ahab's room. She asked him, ‘Why are you so angry? Why will you not eat anything?’ 
1KI.21.6	Ahab answered her, ‘It is because I said to Naboth from Jezreel, “Sell your

1KI.21.8	Then Jezebel wrote letters. They seemed to come from Ahab, because she used his special mark. She sent them to the older men and the leaders that lived in Naboth's city with him. 
1KI.21.9	This is what she wrote in those letters. ‘Tell everybody that there will be a

1KI.21.11	So the older men and the leaders, who lived in Naboth's city, obeyed Jezebel. They did what she 
1KI.21.12	They said that there must be a

1KI.21.14	Then they sent a message to Jezebel. ‘The people threw stones at Naboth. He is dead.’ 
1KI.21.15	So Jezebel knew that Naboth was dead. He was dead because they threw stones at him. Then she said to Ahab, ‘Get up from your bed and take for yourself the 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab knew that Naboth was dead, he got up from his bed. He went to take for himself Naboth's 
1KI.21.17	When this had happened, the 
1KI.21.18	He said, ‘Go to meet King Ahab of Israel. He is the ruler of Samaria. He is now in Naboth's

1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, ‘You have found me, my enemy.’ Elijah answered, ‘I have found you because of all the bad things that you have done. You have decided to do everything that the 
1KI.21.21	The 
1KI.21.22	I will make your

1KI.21.24	Dogs will eat people who belong to Ahab's 
1KI.21.25	Ahab had decided to do everything that the 
1KI.21.26	Ahab did the worst things. He 
1KI.21.27	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes into pieces. He wore hairy clothes and he 
1KI.21.28	Then the 
1KI.21.29	‘You have seen that Ahab has become 
1KI.22.1	There was no war between Aram and Israel for three years. 
1KI.22.2	But after three years, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went to see the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	The king of Israel had said to his leaders, ‘You know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us. But we are not doing anything to take it from the king of Aram.’ 
1KI.22.4	So the king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat, ‘Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?’ Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ‘I am like you are. My people are your people and my horses are your horses.’
1KI.22.5	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, ‘First, we must know what the

1KI.22.9	So the king of Israel said to one of his officers, ‘Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah to me, quickly.’ 
1KI.22.10	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were wearing their kings' clothes. They sat on 
1KI.22.11	Zedekiah was the son of Kenaanah. He had used iron to make sharp points like a cow has on its head. Zedekiah said, ‘This is what the 
1KI.22.12	All the other 
1KI.22.13	The man who had fetched Micaiah said to him, ‘All the 400 
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, ‘I can only tell the king what the 
1KI.22.15	When he arrived at Samaria, the king asked him, ‘Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?’ He answered, ‘If you attack it, you will beat it. This is because the 
1KI.22.16	The king Ahab said to Micaiah, ‘I always have to 
1KI.22.17	Then Micaiah said,
1KI.22.17	‘I saw all the people of Israel.
1KI.22.17	They were moving about on the hills like sheep.
1KI.22.17	They did not have a leader.
1KI.22.17	The 
1KI.22.17	Let each of them go home and not fight.” ’
1KI.22.18	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ‘I told you what he would say! He will never say anything that is good about me. He will only say bad things.’ 
1KI.22.19	Micaiah also said, ‘So now listen to the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	In the end, a 
1KI.22.22	“How will you do it?” the 
1KI.22.23	So, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah went to Micaiah. Zedekiah hit Micaiah's face. Zedekiah asked Micaiah, ‘Which way did the 
1KI.22.25	Micaiah answered him, ‘You will know on the day that you go to hide in a secret room.’ 
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel said to his servants, ‘Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon. Amon is the ruler of the city. Send him also to Joash the king's son. 
1KI.22.27	Say to them, “This is what the king wants you to do. Put this man Micaiah in a prison. Give him only bread and water until I return 
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, ‘If you ever return 
1KI.22.29	So Ahab the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ‘I will go into the war and I will wear a soldier's clothes. People will not recognise me. But you wear your king's clothes.’ So the king of Israel caused himself to seem like somebody else. Then he went into the war. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram had said to his 32 
1KI.22.32	The 
1KI.22.33	Then the 
1KI.22.34	Then, someone shot an 
1KI.22.35	The soldiers fought all day. The king of Israel sat in his 
1KI.22.36	When the sun started to go behind the hills, people in the army shouted, ‘Every man must now go back to his town or to his farm.’
1KI.22.37	So the king of Israel died and they brought him to Samaria. They buried him there. 
1KI.22.38	They washed the 
1KI.22.39	There is a book with reports about the kings of Israel. People wrote in it everything that King Ahab did. It includes the 
1KI.22.40	They buried Ahab with his 
1KI.22.41	After Ahab had been king of Israel for nearly 4 years, Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became the king of Judah. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother's name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	Jehoshaphat was like his father Asa in everything that he did. He did not do anything that was wrong. He did what the 
1KI.22.44	Also Jehoshaphat did not fight against the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	There is a book with reports about the kings of Judah. People wrote in it everything that King Jehoshaphat did. It includes the wars that he fought. 
1KI.22.46	He also removed the male 
1KI.22.47	At this time there was no king in the country called Edom. Someone less important than a king ruled in Edom. 
1KI.22.48	Also, Jehoshaphat built some ships. He wanted them to bring back gold from Ophir. But they never went. A storm destroyed them at Ezion Geber. 
1KI.22.49	At that time, Ahaziah the son of Ahab had said to Jehoshaphat, ‘Let my men sail with your men.’ But Jehoshaphat refused. 
1KI.22.50	So Jehoshaphat died and they buried him with his 
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became the king of Israel in Samaria. This was nearly 17 years after Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah. Ahaziah ruled Israel for two years. 
1KI.22.52	He did things that the 
1KI.22.53	Ahaziah was the servant of 
2KI.1.1	After King Ahab's death, the country called Moab fought against Israel. 
2KI.1.2	King Ahaziah lived in Samaria. He fell from the window of an upstairs room. So, he became ill. So he sent people with this message: ‘Go to Baalzebub, the god in Ekron. Ask him if I will become well again after this illness.’ 
2KI.1.3	Then an 
2KI.1.4	So this is what the 
2KI.1.5	So the people with the message returned to the king. He asked them, ‘Why have you returned?’ 
2KI.1.6	They replied, ‘A man came to meet us. And he said to us. Go back to the king who sent you. Tell him, “This is what the 
2KI.1.7	The king asked them, ‘What kind of a man was it who came to meet you? Who told you this?’ 
2KI.1.8	They replied, ‘He was a man with hairy clothes and he wore a leather belt.’ Then the king said, ‘That was Elijah from Tishbe.’
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent 50 men with their captain to Elijah. Elijah was sitting on the top of a hill. The captain went up to Elijah. He said to Elijah, ‘
2KI.1.10	This was Elijah's answer to the captain of 50 men. ‘If I am a 
2KI.1.11	Then the king sent another captain and 50 men to Elijah. The captain said to him, ‘
2KI.1.12	Elijah answered, ‘If I am a 
2KI.1.13	So the king sent a third captain, with his 50 men. This third captain went up to Elijah. He fell to his knees in front of Elijah. ‘
2KI.1.14	Look! Fire fell from the sky. It burnt the first two captains and all their men, so that they died. But now, be kind to me.’ 
2KI.1.15	The 
2KI.1.16	Elijah said to the king, ‘This is what the 
2KI.1.17	So Ahaziah died. This is what the 
2KI.1.18	Many other things happened while Ahaziah was king. Also, he did many things. People wrote them in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’.
2KI.2.1	The 
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, ‘Stay here because the 
2KI.2.3	A group of 
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to Elisha, ‘Stay here because the 
2KI.2.5	A group of 
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to Elisha, ‘Stay here because the 
2KI.2.7	50 men, from the group of 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took off his coat. He rolled it up. He hit the water with it. The water went to the right side and to the left side. They both crossed the river on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	After they had crossed the river, Elijah said to Elisha, ‘Tell me this. What can I do for you before the 
2KI.2.10	‘You have asked a difficult thing’, said Elijah. ‘But watch when God takes me from you. If you can see me, it will be yours. If you cannot see me it will not be yours.’ 
2KI.2.11	So they walked along and they talked together. Then, a 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw this. He shouted, ‘My 
2KI.2.13	He picked up the coat that had dropped from Elijah. He went and he stood on the edge of the river Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	Then he took the coat that Elijah had dropped. He hit the water with it. And he said, ‘I want the 
2KI.2.15	The group of 
2KI.2.16	And they said to him, ‘Look! We are your servants. There are 50 strong men with us. Let them go and look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	But they asked him many times. So he was too ashamed to say ‘no’. So he said, ‘Send them.’ And they sent 50 men. They looked for Elijah for three days, but they did not find him. 
2KI.2.18	Elisha was staying in Jericho. When they returned to Elisha, he said to them, ‘I told you that you should not go to look for Elijah.’
2KI.2.19	The men in the city (Jericho) said to Elisha, ‘Look, our master. You can see that this city is in a good place. But its water is bad and the land does not make good plants.’ 
2KI.2.20	Elisha said, ‘Bring to me a new dish. Put salt into it.’ So they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	Then Elisha went out to the bad water. He threw the salt into it. He said, ‘This is what the 
2KI.2.22	The water has been good to this day. This is what Elisha had said.
2KI.2.23	From there, Elisha went up to Bethel. While he walked along the road, boys came out of the town. They 
2KI.2.24	Elisha turned and he looked at them. He prayed that the 
2KI.2.25	Then Elisha went to the mountain called Carmel. From there, he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Jehoram the son of Ahab became the king of Israel in Samaria. This was when Jehoshaphat had been the king of Judah for 18 years. Jehoram was king for 12 years. 
2KI.3.2	The 
2KI.3.3	But he still did the wrong things that Jeroboam had done. Jeroboam was the son of Nebat. He had caused many people in Israel to do those wrong things. Jehoram continued to do them.
2KI.3.4	Mesha the king of Moab was a sheep farmer. He had to supply the king of Israel with 100,000 young sheep. He also had to supply the soft hair from 100,000 male sheep. 
2KI.3.5	But after Ahab died, the king of Moab decided not to do this for the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So, at that time, King Jehoram went out from Samaria. He caused all the men in Israel to march with him. 
2KI.3.7	He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah. ‘The king of Moab will not obey me. Will you go with me to fight against the king of Moab?’ ‘I will go with you’, Jehoshaphat replied. ‘I am as you are. My people are as your people. My horses are as your horses.’ 
2KI.3.8	‘What road should we go on to attack Moab?’ Jehoram asked. ‘Through the sandy part of Edom’, Jehoshaphat replied.
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah and the king of Edom went together to Moab. After they had marched round Edom for 7 days, there was no more water. There was no water for the army or for their animals. 
2KI.3.10	‘What has happened?’ said the king of Israel. ‘Has the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat asked, ‘Is there not a 
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, ‘He will tell us what the 
2KI.3.13	Elisha said to the king of Israel, ‘We have nothing to say to each other. Go to the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, ‘I am the servant of the 
2KI.3.15	But now, bring a 
2KI.3.16	Then Elisha said, ‘This is what the 
2KI.3.17	Do it, because the 
2KI.3.18	This is a very easy thing for the 
2KI.3.19	You will destroy every city that has strong walls. You will destroy every important town. You will cut down every good tree. You will fill every hole where they get water. You will put stones on to every good field, so that they will be of no value.’ 
2KI.3.20	The water was there on the next morning, at the time when the 
2KI.3.21	All the people in Moab had heard that the kings had come to fight against them. So the leaders of Moab asked every man who could fight, whether young or old, to come. They put them on the border of Moab. 
2KI.3.22	When the men from Moab got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. They were the other side of the border. The people from Moab saw that the water seemed red. They thought that it was like blood. 
2KI.3.23	‘That is blood’, they said. ‘Those kings have fought each other and they have killed each other. Come on, people from Moab. We will take what we can find!’ 
2KI.3.24	So the people from Moab came to where Israel's men were. But then, Israel's men stood up and they fought against the people from Moab. The people from Moab ran away. The men from Israel attacked their country and they killed the people from Moab. 
2KI.3.25	They destroyed the towns. Each man threw a stone on to every good field, until they covered them with stones. They filled every hole where the people from Moab got water. They cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth kept all its stone walls. But men with 
2KI.3.26	Then the king of Moab saw that he was not beating his enemies in the war. So he took with him 700 men with 
2KI.3.27	So the king of Moab took his oldest son. This son would have been king after him. He killed him on the wall of the city called Kir Hareseth to make his god happy. They were very angry with the people from Israel. So the people from Israel left Moab and they returned to their own country.
2KI.4.1	There was a group of 
2KI.4.2	Elisha said to her, ‘How can I help you? Tell me, what have you got in your house?’ She said to Elisha, ‘I, your servant, have nothing in the house, only a pot of 
2KI.4.3	Then Elisha said, ‘Go to the people who live near you. Ask them all to lend you many pots. The pots must be empty. 
2KI.4.4	Then go into your house. Shut the door behind you and behind your sons. Pour the 
2KI.4.5	So she left Elisha and she shut the door behind her and behind her sons. They brought the pots to her and she poured the 
2KI.4.6	When all the pots were full, she said to her son, ‘Bring me another pot.’ But he said, ‘There are no more pots!’ Then there was no more 
2KI.4.7	Then she went and she told all this to the 
2KI.4.8	There was a time when Elisha went to Shunem. A rich woman was there. She asked him to have a meal with her 
2KI.4.9	Then she said to her husband, ‘Listen! I believe that this Elisha is a 
2KI.4.10	We should make a small room on the roof for him. We can put into it a bed, a table, a chair and a light. Then, when he comes to visit us, he can stay there.’
2KI.4.11	There was a certain day when Elisha came there. He went up to his room and he lay there. 
2KI.4.12	Gehazi was Elisha's servant. Elisha said to Gehazi, ‘Ask the woman from Shunem to come here.’ So Gehazi asked her to come and she stood in front of him. 
2KI.4.13	Elisha said to Gehazi, ‘Say to her, “You have done all this work for us. So, what can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king? Or can we speak to the leader of the army on your behalf?” ’ But she replied, ‘I live safely among my own people.’ 
2KI.4.14	But Elisha asked again, ‘What can we do to help her?’ Gehazi said, ‘I know that she has no son. But her husband is old.’ 
2KI.4.15	Elisha said, ‘Ask her to come here.’ When Gehazi had asked her to come, she stood by the door. 
2KI.4.16	Elisha said, ‘About this time next year, you will have a son in your arms.’ ‘No, my master’, she said, ‘do not say what is not true to your servant. You are a 
2KI.4.17	But the woman did become 
2KI.4.18	When the child had grown, he went to his father. His father was in a field with the workers. 
2KI.4.19	‘My head hurts me! My head hurts me!’ he said to his father. His father said to his servant, ‘Carry him to his mother.’ 
2KI.4.20	So the servant lifted him up and carried him to his mother. The boy sat on his mother's knees until midday. Then he died. 
2KI.4.21	Then she went upstairs and she put the boy on the bed of the 
2KI.4.22	She sent a message to her husband. She said, ‘Send to me one of the servants and one of the 
2KI.4.23	Her husband asked, ‘Why are you going to him today? It is not a New Moon or a 
2KI.4.24	So she put a seat on the 
2KI.4.25	So she went out on the road and she came to the 
2KI.4.26	Run now to meet her. Ask her, “Are you well? Is your husband well? Is your child well?” ’ And she said, ‘Well.’ 
2KI.4.27	But when she reached the 
2KI.4.28	‘My master, I did not ask you for a son’, she said. ‘I said to you, “Do not cause me to hope for a son.” ’ 
2KI.4.29	Elisha said to Gehazi, ‘Tie your clothes up round your body. Take my stick in your hand and run to the boy. If you meet anyone, do not speak to him. If anybody speaks to you, do not answer them. Put my stick on the boy's face.’ 
2KI.4.30	But the mother of the child said, ‘The 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went in front of them. He put the stick on the boy's face. But nothing happened and there was no sound from the boy. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha. He said to him, ‘The boy has not woken.’
2KI.4.32	When Elisha arrived at the house, the boy really was dead. He was lying on Elisha's bed. 
2KI.4.33	Elisha went in to the room. He shut the door. He and the boy were together. Elisha prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	Then Elisha went on to the bed. He lay on the boy. He put his mouth to the boy's mouth. He put his eyes to the boy's eyes and he put his hands to the boy's hands. When Elisha lay on the boy's dead body, it became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Elisha went away from the bed. He walked round the room. Then he went on to the bed and he lay down again on the boy. The boy made a noise in his nose 7 times and then he opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	Then Elisha spoke to Gehazi. He said, ‘Ask the woman from Shunem to come here.’ Gehazi did that. When she came, Elisha said, ‘Take your son.’ 
2KI.4.37	She came in to the room. She fell down by his feet. She put her face near the ground. Then she took her son and she went out from the room.
2KI.4.38	Elisha went back to Gilgal. And there was a 
2KI.4.39	One of the 
2KI.4.40	They poured out the 
2KI.4.41	Then Elisha said, ‘Get some flour.’ And he put it into the pot. He said, ‘Give it to the people to eat.’ And there was nothing that was dangerous in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man came from 
2KI.4.43	But his servant said, ‘How can I give this to 100 men?’ Then Elisha answered, ‘Give it to the people to eat. Do it, because the 
2KI.4.44	So the servant gave the bread to them. And they ate it, but they could not eat all of it. The 
2KI.5.1	Naaman was the leader of the king of 
2KI.5.2	But men from 
2KI.5.3	The girl said to her master's wife, ‘I would like my master Naaman to see the 
2KI.5.4	Naaman went to his master the king of 
2KI.5.5	The king of 
2KI.5.6	Also, he took the letter for the king of Israel. It said, ‘I am sending my servant Naaman to you, with this letter. I want you to take away his 
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes. He said, ‘I am not God. I cannot kill people and make them alive again. This man cannot send someone to me, so that I can take away his 
2KI.5.8	Elisha, the 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman went to Elisha with his horses and with his 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a man with a message to Naaman. ‘Go to the river Jordan. Wash yourself 7 times in the river. Then your skin will be clean. You will not have 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was angry. He went away and he said, ‘I thought that he would come out of his house to me. Then he would stand there. He would pray to the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Abana and Pharpar are rivers in Damascus. They are better than any of the rivers in Israel. Surely, I could wash in them and become clean!’ And he turned and he went away. He was very, very angry. 
2KI.5.13	But Naaman's servants went to him. One of them said, ‘My 
2KI.5.14	So Naaman went down to the river Jordan. He washed himself in it 7 times. That was what the 
2KI.5.15	Then Naaman and all his servants went back to the 
2KI.5.16	But Elisha answered him, ‘As surely as the 
2KI.5.17	So Naaman said, ‘So, you will not accept a gift. But give to me, your servant, as much earth as two 
2KI.5.18	But I want the 
2KI.5.19	And Elisha said to Naaman, ‘Go and do not let it be a trouble to you.’ Then Naaman went a little way from Elisha's house.
2KI.5.20	Gehazi was the servant of Elisha, the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. Naaman saw that Gehazi was running after him. So he got down from his 
2KI.5.22	‘Everything is well’, he answered. ‘My master sent me to say this to you. Two young men have come to me. They are from a group of 
2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, ‘Yes, I will. But take two 
2KI.5.24	When Gehazi came to a hill near Elisha's house, he took the things from the servants. He put them in the house. He sent the servants away and they left him. 
2KI.5.25	Gehazi went into the house and he stood in front of his master. And Elisha said to Gehazi, ‘Where have you been?’ Gehazi answered, ‘Your servant has not been anywhere.’ 
2KI.5.26	But Elisha said to him, ‘My 
2KI.5.27	Naaman's 
2KI.6.1	A group of 
2KI.6.2	We must go to the river that is called Jordan. Each one of us can get a piece of wood there. Then we can build a place there in which we can live.’ And Elisha said, ‘Go there.’ 
2KI.6.3	Then one of them said, ‘Please come with your servants.’ Elisha replied, ‘I will come with you.’ 
2KI.6.4	And he went with them. They came to the river Jordan and they began to cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	While one of them was cutting down a tree, his iron axe fell into the water. ‘My master’, he said, ‘It was not my axe!’ 
2KI.6.6	The 
2KI.6.7	‘Lift it out of the water’, Elisha said. Then the man took it out of the water with his hand.
2KI.6.8	Then there was a war between the king of 
2KI.6.9	The 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel checked the place, about which the 
2KI.6.11	This made the king of 
2KI.6.12	One of his officers said, ‘None of us is helping him, my master the king. Elisha is a 
2KI.6.13	‘Go. Find the place where he is’, said the king of 
2KI.6.14	So the king of 
2KI.6.15	The servant of the 
2KI.6.16	‘Do not be afraid’, the 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed and he said, ‘
2KI.6.18	When the enemy came down towards Elisha, he prayed to the 
2KI.6.19	And Elisha said to them, ‘This is not the road. And this is not the city that you are looking for. Follow me! And I will lead you to the man that you are looking for.’ And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	After they had gone into the city Samaria, Elisha prayed again. ‘
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw the enemy army, he asked Elisha, ‘My 
2KI.6.22	Elisha answered, ‘You must not kill them. You would not kill men that you had caught yourself with your 
2KI.6.23	So the king of Israel gave a big meal to them. When they had finished the food and the water, he sent them away. So they returned to their master, the king of 
2KI.6.24	But after that, King Ben-Hadad of 
2KI.6.25	Then there was a bad 
2KI.6.26	While the king of Israel was walking past on the wall of the city, a woman shouted to him. ‘Help me, my master the king’, she said. 
2KI.6.27	The king replied, ‘Do not shout to me for help. The 
2KI.6.28	Then he asked her, ‘What is the matter?’ She answered, ‘This woman who is with me spoke to me. She said, “Give to us your son, so that we can eat him today. Tomorrow we will eat my son.” 
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and we ate him. The next day I said to her, “Give your son, so that we can eat him.” But she had hidden him.’ 
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. He was walking along the wall. And people saw that under his other clothes he was wearing 
2KI.6.31	He said, ‘I want God to do this to me, and more. I want him to do this if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat stays on his shoulders today!’
2KI.6.32	Elisha was sitting in his house. The important men of the city were with him. The king sent a man with a message. But before he arrived, Elisha said to the important men, ‘The king is sending a killer to cut off my head. When the man with the message comes, shut the door. Keep him outside the door. The sound of his master's feet is behind him.’ 
2KI.6.33	While Elisha was still talking to them, the man with the message came down to him. The man said, ‘This bad thing is from the 
2KI.7.1	Elisha said, ‘Listen to the word of the 
2KI.7.2	The king was holding on to the arm of an officer. The officer said to the 
2KI.7.3	At this time, there were 4 men who had 
2KI.7.4	There is a 
2KI.7.5	When the evening came they got up. They went to the place where the army from 
2KI.7.6	The 
2KI.7.7	So, in the evening they got up and they ran away. They left their 
2KI.7.8	The men who had 
2KI.7.9	Then they said among themselves, ‘What we are doing is not the right thing to do. This is a day of good news and we are not saying anything about it. If we wait until the morning, something bad will happen to us. We must go immediately and we must tell this to the king's servants.’ 
2KI.7.10	So they went to the people who kept safely the gate of the city. They spoke to them, and they said, ‘We went into the place where the army from 
2KI.7.11	The people who kept safely the gate of the city shouted the news to everyone else. Somebody reported it to the people in the king's house. 
2KI.7.12	The king got up in the night and he spoke to his officers. ‘I will tell you what the army from 
2KI.7.13	One of the king's officers answered him. ‘Send some men with 5 of the horses that are still in our city. What will happen to them will be the same as what will happen to all Israel's people in the city. They will be like all those among Israel's people who have died already. They may die. So, send them, to find out what has happened.’ 
2KI.7.14	So they chose two 
2KI.7.15	They followed the army from 
2KI.7.16	Then the people left the city. They took everything from the army of 
2KI.7.17	The king had put his special officer by the gate of Samaria. He had held the arm of this officer earlier. The people caused this officer to fall by the gate as they ran past him. He fell under their feet and he died. The 
2KI.7.18	The 
2KI.7.19	The officer had said to the 
2KI.7.19	The 
2KI.7.20	And that had really happened to him! The people had walked all over this officer by the gate and he had died.
2KI.8.1	Elisha had made a woman's son alive again. Elisha had said to the woman, ‘Go away with your 
2KI.8.2	The woman had done what the 
2KI.8.3	She came back from the country called Philistia after the 7 years. She went to the king to ask for her house and for her fields. 
2KI.8.4	The king was talking to Gehazi, who was the servant of the 
2KI.8.5	Gehazi was telling the king that Elisha had made dead people alive again. While Gehazi was doing this, the woman came in to ask for her house and her fields. It was her dead son that Elisha had made alive again. Gehazi said, ‘My master the king, this is the woman! And this is her son that Elisha made alive again!’ 
2KI.8.6	The king asked the woman about it and she told him. Then the king asked for an officer to come to him. The king said to him, ‘Give everything back to her. This must include all the money from her fields, from the day that she left until now.’
2KI.8.7	Elisha went to Damascus. Ben-Hadad, the king of 
2KI.8.8	The king said to Hazael, ‘Take a gift with you. Go and meet the 
2KI.8.9	Hazael went to meet Elisha. He took with him, as a gift, all the best things from Damascus. They needed 40 
2KI.8.10	Elisha answered, ‘Go back to him. Say to him, “Surely, you will get well after your illness.” But the 
2KI.8.11	Elisha looked at him with open eyes until Hazael was ashamed. Then the 
2KI.8.12	And Hazael asked, ‘Why is my master weeping?’ ‘Because I know that you will hurt Israel's people’, answered Elisha. Then he said, ‘You will burn their strong cities. You will kill their young men with the 
2KI.8.13	Hazael said, ‘How could your servant, who has no more power than a dog, do something like that?’ ‘The 
2KI.8.14	Then Hazael left Elisha and Hazael returned to his master the king. Ben-Hadad asked him, ‘What did Elisha say to you?’ Hazael replied, ‘He told me that you will surely get well.’ 
2KI.8.15	But the next day, Hazael took a thick cloth. He filled it with water. Then he put it over the king's face until he died. So Hazael became king after Ben-Hadad.
2KI.8.16	In the 5th year that Joram was king of Israel, Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah. Joram was the son of Ahab. Then Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, also started to rule as king of Judah. 
2KI.8.17	He was 32 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 8 years. 
2KI.8.18	He did all the bad things that the kings of Israel had done. He did what the 
2KI.8.19	But the 
2KI.8.20	While Jehoram was king, Edom's people decided not to obey the king of Judah. Edom's people decided to have their own king. 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram crossed to Zair with all his 
2KI.8.22	Even today, Edom's people do not obey the rulers of Judah. The people in a city called Libnah stopped obeying the king of Judah at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	Other things happened while Jehoram was king and he did other things. People wrote about them in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. 
2KI.8.24	Jehoram died like his 
2KI.8.25	Ahaziah was the son of Jehoram, who had been the king of Judah. Joram was the son of Ahab. Ahaziah began to rule when Joram had been king for nearly 12 years. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah. She was a granddaughter of Omri, who had been the king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Ahaziah did all the bad things that the 
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with Joram to fight against Hazael the king of 
2KI.8.29	so King Joram returned to Jezreel. He went there to get well after the army from 
2KI.9.1	The 
2KI.9.2	When you get there, look for Jehu. He is the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him and take him away from his friends. Take him to an inside room. 
2KI.9.3	Pour the 
2KI.9.4	So the young man that Elisha the 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived at Ramoth Gilead, he found the army officers. They were sitting together. ‘Captain, I have a message for you’, he said. ‘For which of us?’ Jehu asked. ‘Only for you, captain’, the young 
2KI.9.6	Jehu stood up and he went into the house. The young 
2KI.9.7	You must kill the 
2KI.9.8	The whole 
2KI.9.9	I will make the 
2KI.9.10	And dogs will eat Jezebel at a place in Jezreel. Nobody will bury her.” ’ Then the young 
2KI.9.11	Jehu went out to the other officers. ‘Is everything well?’ one of them asked him. ‘Why did this crazy 
2KI.9.12	‘That is not true!’ they said. ‘Tell us what he said.’ So Jehu said, ‘This is what he told me. “This is what the 
2KI.9.13	They hurried to get their coats. They put them under his feet on the stone steps. Then they made a sound with a 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat became an enemy of Joram. Jehoshaphat was the son of Nimshi. Joram had been in Ramoth Gilead. All the army of Israel was with him. They were waiting to see what Hazael would do. Hazael was the king of Syria. 
2KI.9.15	But King Joram then returned to Jezreel. This was to get well after his illness. The army of 
2KI.9.16	Then Jehu got into his 
2KI.9.17	A man was standing on a tall building in Jezreel and he was there to watch. He saw Jehu's soldiers coming towards Jezreel. He shouted, ‘I can see some soldiers that are coming to us.’ Joram said, ‘Fetch a man and a horse. Send them to meet the soldiers. Ask them. “Are you friendly to us?” ’ 
2KI.9.18	The man on the horse rode away to meet Jehu. He said to Jehu, ‘The king asks you, “Are you friendly to us?” ’ ‘It does not matter to you if we are friends’, Jehu replied. ‘Ride behind me.’ The man on the tall building reported to Joram, ‘The man with the message has reached them, but he is not coming back to us.’ 
2KI.9.19	So the king Joram sent a second man who was riding on a horse. He came to Jehu. Then he said, ‘The king says, “Are you coming to us as a friend?” ’ Jehu replied, ‘It does not matter to you if we are friends. Ride behind me.’ 
2KI.9.20	The man on the tall building reported to Joram, ‘He has reached them, but he is not coming back to us either. The man that is driving the 
2KI.9.21	Then Joram said, ‘Fetch my 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu he asked, ‘Have you come as a friend, Jehu?’ ‘We cannot be friends’, Jehu replied. ‘That is because of the things that your mother Jezebel did. People still 
2KI.9.23	Joram turned his 
2KI.9.24	Then Jehu used his bow. He shot Joram between his shoulders. The 
2KI.9.25	Bidkar was Jehu's 
2KI.9.26	“Yesterday, I saw the blood of Naboth. I saw also the blood of his sons, says the 
2KI.9.27	Ahaziah was the king of Judah. He saw what had happened to Joram. So, he ran away past the house in his garden. Jehu followed him. Jehu shouted, ‘Kill him too!’ They hurt Ahaziah in his 
2KI.9.28	His servants took him in a 
2KI.9.29	Ahaziah had become king of Judah when Joram had been king nearly 11 years. Joram was the son of Ahab.
2KI.9.30	Then Jehu went to Jezreel. Jezebel heard about it. So she painted her eyes and she combed her hair. Then she looked out of a window. 
2KI.9.31	While Jehu was coming through the gate of the city, she asked him, ‘Have you come as a friend, Zimri? You are your master's killer.’ 
2KI.9.32	Jehu looked up at the window and he saw her. Then he shouted, ‘Who is with me? Who?’ Two or three 
2KI.9.33	‘Throw her down’, Jehu said. So they threw her down. Some of her blood went all over the wall. Some of it went over the horses when they were kicking her with their feet. 
2KI.9.34	Jehu went into the king's house. He ate and drank food and drink. ‘Do something with the dead body of that bad woman’, he said. ‘Bury her, because she was the daughter of a king.’ 
2KI.9.35	But when they went out to bury her, they did not find much. They found only the bones of her head, her feet and her hands. 
2KI.9.36	They went back and they told this to Jehu. He said, ‘The 
2KI.9.37	Jezebel's dead body will be like dirt on the ground, on that piece of ground at Jezreel. Nobody will be able to say, ‘This is Jezebel’.” ’
2KI.10.1	Ahab had 70 sons. They were in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and he sent them to Samaria. He sent them to the officers in Jezreel. He also sent them to the important older men and to the people who made Ahab's children safe. 
2KI.10.2	This was what the letter said. ‘When this letter reaches you, your master's sons will be with you. You have 
2KI.10.3	Choose the best person to be king from among your master's sons. Make him king instead of his father. Then fight on behalf of your master's 
2KI.10.4	But they were so very afraid. They said, ‘Two kings could not beat Jehu. So we cannot beat him!’
2KI.10.5	So these people sent a message to Jehu:
2KI.10.5	the servant with most authority in the king's house
2KI.10.5	the man that ruled the city called Samaria
2KI.10.5	the important older men
2KI.10.5	the people who made Ahab's children safe.
2KI.10.5	The message said, ‘We are your servants. We will do anything that you say. We will not make anyone king. You do what is best.’
2KI.10.6	So Jehu wrote to them a second letter. It said, ‘If you agree with me, maybe you will obey me. If you do, bring the heads of your master's sons to Jezreel. Be here by this time tomorrow.’ At that time, the 70 sons of Ahab were with the leaders of the city. The leaders were teaching them. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter arrived, these men went to the sons of King Ahab. They killed all 70 of them and they put their heads in baskets. Then they sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	The man with the message arrived in Jezreel. He told Jehu, ‘They have brought the heads of King Ahab's sons.’ Then Jehu said, ‘Put them in two groups. Leave them at the gate of the city until the morning.’ 
2KI.10.9	The next morning, Jehu went out. He stood in front of all the people. He said to them, ‘You have not done anything that is wrong to Ahab. It was I that decided to kill my master. I killed him. But we do not know who killed all these people. 
2KI.10.10	You can know this: Everything that the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed everybody in Jezreel who was in the 
2KI.10.12	Jehu then left Jezreel, and he went towards Samaria. He came to Beth Eked. Some men who kept sheep safe were there. 
2KI.10.13	And Jehu also met some people from Ahaziah's 
2KI.10.14	‘Catch them while they are alive!’ shouted Jehu. So they caught them while they were alive. Then they killed them by the well of Beth Eked. They killed 42 men. Jehu left none of them alive.
2KI.10.15	When Jehu left Beth Eked, he met Jehonadab. Jehonadab was the son of Rechab and he was coming to meet Jehu. ‘Welcome!’ said Jehu. ‘Do you agree with me, as I agree with you?’ Jehonadab answered, ‘I do!’ ‘So give me your hand’, said Jehu. So he did, and Jehu helped him up into his 
2KI.10.16	Jehu said, ‘Come with me. You will see that I really want to be the 
2KI.10.17	So Jehu came to Samaria. There, he killed everyone in Ahab's 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu caused all the people to come together. He said to them, ‘Ahab was not a good servant of 
2KI.10.19	So, ask all the 
2KI.10.20	Then Jehu said, ‘Say that there will be a special meeting to 
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent a notice to everyone in Israel, and all the servants of 
2KI.10.22	Then Jehu said to the keeper of the clothes, ‘Bring out all the special clothes, for the servants of 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab, who was the son of Rechab, went into the house of 
2KI.10.24	So they went in to the house of 
2KI.10.25	When Jehu had finished the 
2KI.10.26	They brought out the special stones from the house of 
2KI.10.27	They destroyed the special stone of 
2KI.10.28	So Jehu destroyed 
2KI.10.29	But Jehu continued to let people do the 
2KI.10.30	The 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu did not try as much as he could to obey the rules of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days, the 
2KI.10.33	east of the river Jordan. That was the place called Gilead, where the 
2KI.10.34	Other things happened while Jehu was king. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. 
2KI.10.35	Jehu died like his 
2KI.10.36	Jehu ruled over Israel in Samaria for 28 years.
2KI.11.1	Athaliah was the mother of Ahaziah. She heard the news that her son was dead. Then, she started to kill all the king's 
2KI.11.2	Jehosheba was the daughter of King Jehoram. She was the sister of Ahaziah. She took Joash away from the sons of the king, because Athaliah was ready to kill them. Joash was the son of Ahaziah. Jehosheba put Joash and the woman who fed him from her breast in a bedroom. Athaliah did not kill Joash because Jehosheba had hidden him. 
2KI.11.3	Athaliah ruled the country (Judah) for 6 years. All this time Jehosheba hid Joash in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	In the 7th year that Athaliah ruled Judah, Jehoiada asked these people to come to him:
2KI.11.4	the leaders of groups of 100 
2KI.11.4	the soldiers that made the

2KI.11.5	Jehoiada said to them, ‘This is what you must do. A third of your soldiers that come to work on the 
2KI.11.6	Another third of your soldiers must stand at the Sur Gate. The other third must be at the gate of the 
2KI.11.7	But two groups of your soldiers do not usually work on the 
2KI.11.8	You must stand all round the king. Each soldier must have his 
2KI.11.9	The leaders of the groups of 100 soldiers did what Jehoiada the 
2KI.11.10	Then Jehoiada gave to the leaders the 
2KI.11.11	Each soldier had his 
2KI.11.12	Jehoiada brought the king's son and Jehoiada put him in front of all the people. He put the 
2KI.11.13	But Athaliah heard the noise that the soldiers and the people made. So she went to the people that were at the house of the 
2KI.11.14	She looked and she saw the king. He was standing in the usual place where they made someone into a king. The leaders of the army and the men with 
2KI.11.15	Jehoiada, the 
2KI.11.16	So they took her to the place where horses went into the king's 
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made a 
2KI.11.18	All the people in the country went to the house of 
2KI.11.19	Jehoiada took with him these people:
2KI.11.19	the leaders of 100 soldiers
2KI.11.19	the 
2KI.11.19	all the people of the country called Judah.
2KI.11.19	They all brought the king down from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	All the people in the country were very happy. And the city Jerusalem was quiet. That was because they had killed Athaliah with the 
2KI.11.21	And Joash was 7 years old when he began to rule Judah.
2KI.12.1	Joash became king of Judah in the 7th year that Jehu was king of Israel. Joash ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother's name was Zibiah. She came from Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	In all the years that Jehoiada the 
2KI.12.3	But he did not remove the 
2KI.12.4	Joash said to all the 
2KI.12.4	what each man pays to the government;

2KI.12.9	Jehoiada the 
2KI.12.10	Every time that there was a large amount of money in the box, they counted the money. The leader of the 
2KI.12.11	Then they gave the money that they had counted to some men. They had made these men the leaders of the workers in the house of the 
2KI.12.12	They also paid the men that used stones. And they paid the men that cut stones. They bought wood. And they bought stones that people had cut. They bought them for the repairs to the house of the 
2KI.12.13	But they did not spend any of this money to buy anything that they used in the 
2KI.12.13	tools that they used to cause their lights to burn well
2KI.12.14	They used all the money to pay the workers. The workers used it to mend the house of the

2KI.12.16	They did not bring other money into the house of the 
2KI.12.17	Hazael was the king of 
2KI.12.18	Joash was the king of Judah. He sent all these special things to Hazael who was the king of

2KI.12.18	the gifts that Joash himself had given to God,
2KI.12.18	all the gold that was in the house of the 
2KI.12.18	So Hazael left Jerusalem and he did not attack it.
2KI.12.19	Other things happened while Joash was king. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. 
2KI.12.20	Joash's officers decided to kill him. They killed him in the house of Millo, which is on the road down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	The officers that killed him were Jozabad, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer. After he died, people buried him with his 
2KI.13.1	Joash, the son of Ahaziah, was the king of Judah. When Joash had been king for nearly 23 years, Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria. Jehoahaz was the son of Jehu. Jehoahaz was king for 17 years. 
2KI.13.2	But the 
2KI.13.3	So the 
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz prayed to the 
2KI.13.5	The 
2KI.13.6	But the people in Israel still did the

2KI.13.7	10,000 soldiers who had to walk.

2KI.13.8	Other things happened while Jehoahaz was king. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. 
2KI.13.9	Jehoahaz died like his 
2KI.13.10	Joash was the king of Judah. When he had been king for nearly 37 years, Jehoash became king of Israel in Samaria. Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz. Jehoash was king for 16 years. 
2KI.13.11	But the 
2KI.13.12	Other things happened while Jehoash was king. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. It includes the report of his war against Amaziah, the king of Judah. 
2KI.13.13	Jehoash died like his 
2KI.13.14	Elisha was very ill. It was the illness from which he died. Jehoash, the king of Israel, went down to see him. Jehoash wept by his side. Jehoash said, ‘My 
2KI.13.15	Elisha said to Jehoash, ‘Fetch a bow and some 
2KI.13.16	Elisha said to the king of Israel, ‘Hold the bow in your hands.’ When he had done this, Elisha put his hands on the hands of the king. 
2KI.13.17	Elisha said, ‘Open the east window.’ And the king opened it. ‘Shoot!’ said Elisha. And the king shot the 
2KI.13.18	Then Elisha said, ‘Take the

2KI.13.20	So Elisha died and people buried him. But, every spring, men from Moab came into the country to rob the people. 
2KI.13.21	Once, while they were burying a man, some people saw a group of those men from Moab. So they threw the man's dead body into Elisha's 
2KI.13.22	Hazael was the king of 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	Then Hazael, who was the king of 
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, got back from Ben-Hadad some towns. They were towns that Hazael had taken from Jehoahaz. Jehoahaz was Jehoash's father. Jehoash beat Ben-Hadad three times and he ruled Israel's towns again.
2KI.14.1	Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, had been the king of Israel for nearly two years. It was then that Amaziah began to rule Judah. Amaziah was the son of Joash. 
2KI.14.2	Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin. She was born in Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	The 
2KI.14.4	But they did not remove the 
2KI.14.5	Amaziah became safe as king of Judah. Then he killed the officers who had killed his father the king. 
2KI.14.6	But he did not kill the sons of these killers. That was because of what the writer of the Book of the 
2KI.14.7	It was Amaziah that beat 10,000 men from Edom in the Valley of Salt. He beat Sela in a war. He called it Joktheel, which is its name today.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent men with messages to Jehoash. Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu. Jehu had been the king of Israel. The message was, ‘Come and meet me.’ 
2KI.14.9	But Jehoash, the king of Israel, replied like this to Amaziah. Amaziah was the king of Judah. ‘The 
2KI.14.10	Yes! You have beaten Edom. And now you think that you are better than other people. Be very happy because you have beaten Edom. But stay at home! Do not ask for trouble. It will hurt you and the people in Judah.’
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah did not 
2KI.14.12	The army from Israel completely destroyed the army from Judah. Every man from Judah ran away to his home. 
2KI.14.13	Jehoash, the king of Israel, caught Amaziah at Beth Shemesh. Amaziah was the king of Judah. He was the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem. He destroyed 180 metres (600 feet) of the wall of Jerusalem, from the Ephraim Gate to the 
2KI.14.14	He took all the gold and 
2KI.14.15	Other things happened while Jehoash was king. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. It includes the war against Amaziah, the king of Judah. 
2KI.14.16	So Jehoash died like his 
2KI.14.17	Amaziah, the son of Joash, was the king of Judah. Amaziah lived for 15 years after Jehoash died. Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, was the king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	Other things happened while Amaziah ruled Judah. These things are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. 
2KI.14.19	Some people in Jerusalem made a 
2KI.14.20	They brought him back to Jerusalem on a horse. They buried him there with his 
2KI.14.21	Then, all the people in Judah made Azariah king instead of his father Amaziah. Azariah was 16 years old. 
2KI.14.22	He was the king who built Elath again. He won it back by war for Judah. That was after Amaziah died like his 
2KI.14.23	Amaziah, the son of Joash, was the king of Judah. When Amaziah had been king for nearly 15 years, Jeroboam became the king of Israel in Samaria. Jeroboam was the son of Jehoash. Jeroboam ruled Israel for 41 years. 
2KI.14.24	The 
2KI.14.25	Jeroboam the Second had won back for Israel by war places from Lebo Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah. This is what the 
2KI.14.26	Everyone in Israel had trouble that hurt them a lot. And the 
2KI.14.27	So the 
2KI.14.28	Other things happened while Jeroboam ruled Israel. They are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. They include these things that his army did. They got Damascus back for Israel. And they got Hamath back from Judah. 
2KI.14.29	Jeroboam died like his 
2KI.15.1	Jeroboam had been king of Israel for nearly 27 years when Azariah began to rule Judah. Azariah was the son of Amaziah, the king of Judah. 
2KI.15.2	Azariah was 16 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 52 years. His mother's name was Jecoliah. She was born in Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	The 
2KI.15.4	But he did not remove the 
2KI.15.5	And the 
2KI.15.6	Azariah did many other things while he was king. They wrote all those things in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. 
2KI.15.7	So Azariah died like his 
2KI.15.8	When Azariah had been king for nearly 38 years, Zechariah became king of Israel in Samaria. Zechariah was the son of Jeroboam and he ruled Israel for 6 months. 
2KI.15.9	The 
2KI.15.10	Shallum was the son of Jabesh. He and his friends decided to kill Zechariah. Shallum attacked Zechariah in front of the people. He killed him and he became king instead of him. 
2KI.15.11	Other things happened while Zechariah ruled Israel. They are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. 
2KI.15.12	So it happened as the 
2KI.15.13	When Uzziah had been the king of Judah for 39 years, Shallum became the king of Israel. Shallum was the son of Jabesh. Shallum ruled in Samaria for one month. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem went from Tirzah up to Samaria. Menahem was the son of Gadi. He attacked Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria. He killed him and he became king of Israel after him. 
2KI.15.15	Other things that happened when Shallum was king are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. It includes the way that he killed Zechariah. 
2KI.15.16	When Menahem came from Tirzah, he attacked Tiphsah. He attacked everybody that was in the city and near it. He did this because they would not open their gates. He destroyed Tiphsah and he cut open all the 
2KI.15.17	When Azariah had been the king of Judah for nearly 39 years, Menahem became the king of Israel. Menahem was the son of Gadi, and he ruled in Samaria for 10 years. 
2KI.15.18	The 
2KI.15.19	Then 
2KI.15.20	Menahem caused the people in Israel to give him this money. He caused every rich man to give 50 
2KI.15.21	The other things that happened to King Menahem are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. Everything that he did is in that book. 
2KI.15.22	So Menahem died like his 
2KI.15.23	When Azariah had been the king of Judah for nearly 50 years, Pekahiah became the king of Israel in Samaria. Pekahiah was the son of Menahem. He ruled Israel for two years. 
2KI.15.24	The 
2KI.15.25	One of his important officers was Pekah, the son of Remaliah. Pekah decided to kill Pekahiah. He took 50 men from Gilead with him, and he killed Pekahiah. He also killed Argob and Arieh in a strong room in the king's 
2KI.15.26	Somebody wrote the other things that King Pekahiah did in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. The book contains everything that Pekahiah did.
2KI.15.27	When Azariah had been king of Judah for nearly 52 years, Pekah became the king of Israel in Samaria. Pekah was the son of Remaliah and he ruled Israel for 20 years. 
2KI.15.28	The 
2KI.15.29	While Pekah was the king of Israel, Tiglath Pileser came from Assyria. He was the king of Assyria. He beat the people in many places in Israel: Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee and all of Naphtali. He took the people that lived in these places to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea decided to kill Pekah the son of Remaliah. Hoshea was the son of Elah. Hoshea attacked Pekah and killed him. So Hoshea became king after Pekah. It was when Jotham had been king of Judah for nearly 20 years. Jotham was the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Somebody wrote the other things that King Pekah did in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Israel’. The book contains everything that Pekah did.
2KI.15.32	When Pekah had been the king of Israel for nearly 2 years, Jotham began to rule Judah. Pekah was the son of Remaliah and Jotham was the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.33	Jotham was 25 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. His mother's name was Jerusha. She was the daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	The 
2KI.15.35	But he did not remove the 
2KI.15.36	Somebody wrote the other things that King Jotham did in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. The book contains everything that Jotham did. 
2KI.15.37	Then the 
2KI.15.38	And Jotham died like his 
2KI.16.1	When Pekah had been king of Israel for nearly 17 years, Ahaz began to rule Judah. Pekah was the son of Remaliah and Ahaz was the son of King Jotham of Judah. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. The 
2KI.16.3	He did the bad things that the kings of Israel did. He even caused his son to walk through fire. He did all the very bad things that people had done earlier in 
2KI.16.4	Ahaz burned animals and other things, and also 
2KI.16.5	Rezin was the king of 
2KI.16.6	At that time, Rezin the king of 
2KI.16.7	Then Ahaz sent people with messages to Tiglath Pileser, the king of Assyria. They said, ‘I am your servant. And I will do anything that you ask me to do. Come up to Jerusalem and save me from the power of the kings of 
2KI.16.8	Also, Ahaz took the 
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria did what Ahaz had asked. He attacked Damascus and he beat its people. He sent the people that had lived there to Kir. And he killed Rezin.
2KI.16.10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria. Ahaz saw an 
2KI.16.11	So Uriah the 
2KI.16.12	Then the king returned from Damascus. And he saw the 
2KI.16.13	He offered these things to his god on the 
2KI.16.13	an animal with its blood
2KI.16.13	something with flour but no blood in it
2KI.16.13	a drink that he poured on to the 
2KI.16.13	the blood of animals to bring him 
2KI.16.14	A 
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz said that Uriah the 
2KI.16.15	an animal with its blood in the morning
2KI.16.15	something with flour in it in the evening
2KI.16.15	an animal on behalf of the king
2KI.16.15	something with flour in it on behalf of the king
2KI.16.15	an animal as a gift on behalf of all the people in the country
2KI.16.15	something with flour in it on behalf of the people in the country
2KI.16.15	all the blood from the animals that you kill.
2KI.16.15	But I will use the 
2KI.16.16	So Uriah the 
2KI.16.17	King Ahaz also took away pieces from the sides of the 
2KI.16.18	He took away the roof that they had made to cover the king's path on the 
2KI.16.19	Somebody wrote the other things that King Ahaz did, in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. The book contains everything that Ahaz did. 
2KI.16.20	So Ahaz died like his 
2KI.17.1	When Ahaz had been the king of Judah for nearly 12 years, Hoshea became the king of Israel in Samaria. Hoshea was the son of Elah and he ruled Israel for 9 years. 
2KI.17.2	The 
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser was the king of Assyria. He came up to Samaria to attack Hoshea. Hoshea had done everything that Shalmaneser had asked him to do. Every year he had paid him all the money that Shalmaneser had asked him for. 
2KI.17.4	But Shalmaneser had discovered that now Hoshea was not a good friend of Shalmaneser. Hoshea had sent people with a message to So, the king of Egypt. Hoshea did not pay any more money to the king of Assyria, as he had done every year. So Shalmaneser caught Hoshea and put him into a prison. 
2KI.17.5	The king of Assyria attacked all the country Israel. His army marched against Samaria and it stayed round it for 3 years.
2KI.17.6	When Hoshea had been king of Israel for nearly 9 years, the king of Assyria beat the people in Samaria. He sent many of the people from Israel to Assyria. He caused them to live in these places:
2KI.17.6	Halah,
2KI.17.6	Gozan by the River Habor and
2KI.17.6	towns in Media.
2KI.17.7	All this happened because the people in Israel had not obeyed the 
2KI.17.8	They had done the things that the people in 
2KI.17.9	The people in Israel did things against the 
2KI.17.10	They put up special stones for their gods and 
2KI.17.11	At every 
2KI.17.12	They 
2KI.17.13	The 
2KI.17.14	But the people in Israel would not 
2KI.17.15	They did not obey his 
2KI.17.16	They threw away all the 
2KI.17.17	They burned their sons and their daughters in fire for 
2KI.17.18	The 
2KI.17.19	Even Judah did not obey the 
2KI.17.20	So the 
2KI.17.21	When God tore Israel away from David's 
2KI.17.22	The people in Israel continued to do all the 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought people to live in the towns in Samaria. They came from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim. They lived in Samaria where Israel's people had lived. They lived in its towns and they ruled Samaria. 
2KI.17.25	When those people first lived in Samaria, they did not 
2KI.17.26	They reported this to the king of Assyria. The report said, ‘You sent some people from your country. You caused them to live in the towns in Samaria. But they do not know what the god of that country wants them to do. He has sent 
2KI.17.27	So the king of Assyria said, ‘You caught some 
2KI.17.28	So they brought one of the 
2KI.17.29	But each group of people, from different countries, made its own gods. They did this in each town where they lived. They did it in the places where the people in Samaria had made 
2KI.17.30	The men from Babylon 
2KI.17.31	The men from Avva 
2KI.17.32	They 
2KI.17.33	They 
2KI.17.34	Even today, they still do those things. They do not really 
2KI.17.35	When the 
2KI.17.36	But you must 
2KI.17.37	You must always obey the words that he wrote for you. And you must obey him about everything. You must obey all his 
2KI.17.38	Do not forget the 
2KI.17.39	Always 
2KI.17.40	But they would not 
2KI.17.41	Even while they were 
2KI.18.1	When Hoshea had been the king of Israel for nearly three years, Hezekiah began to rule Judah. Hoshea was the son of Elah and Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz. 
2KI.18.2	Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother's name was Abijah. She was the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	The 
2KI.18.4	He removed the 
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah believed in the 
2KI.18.6	He really loved the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He beat the people in Philistia as far as Gaza and the country that was near it. He did this from places where people watched to strong cities.
2KI.18.9	Shalmaneser was the king of Assyria. When Hezekiah had been king for nearly 4 years, Shalmaneser marched his army to Samaria. The army stayed round Samaria for nearly three years. That was when Hoshea had been the king of Israel for nearly 7 years. Hoshea was the son of Elah. 
2KI.18.10	After three years, the soldiers from Assyria beat the people in Samaria. So they beat them when Hezekiah had been king of Judah for nearly 6 years. Hoshea had been the king of Judah for nearly 9 years.
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria took all the people out of Israel to Assyria. He caused them to live in these places:
2KI.18.11	Halah,
2KI.18.11	Gozan by the River Habor and
2KI.18.11	towns in Media.
2KI.18.12	This happened because they had not obeyed the 
2KI.18.13	When Hezekiah had ruled Judah for nearly 14 years, Sennacherib attacked all the strong cities in Judah. He made them his cities. Sennacherib was the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.14	So King Hezekiah of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria. Sennacherib was at Lachish. ‘What I did was wrong. March away from me. Then I will pay everything that you ask me to pay.’ The king of Assyria asked King Hezekiah of Judah to send to him 300 
2KI.18.15	So Hezekiah gave to Sennacherib all the 
2KI.18.16	Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He had covered all the doors in the house of the 
2KI.18.17	The king of Assyria sent three people from Lachish to King Hezekiah. Hezekiah was at Jerusalem. They came with a large army. These were the three people:
2KI.18.17	the most important leader of his army
2KI.18.17	the leader of his officers
2KI.18.17	the leader of his army where they fought.
2KI.18.17	They came to Jerusalem and they stopped at the 
2KI.18.18	They asked for the king to come to them. These three people went out to meet them:
2KI.18.18	Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah. He decided what would happen in the 
2KI.18.18	Shebna. He helped the king.
2KI.18.18	Joah, the son of Asaph. He wrote down the things that happened.
2KI.18.19	The leader of Sennacherib's army where they fought said this to them:
2KI.18.19	Say to Hezekiah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says. “You should not be so happy that you have decided well. 
2KI.18.20	You say that you have ideas. And you say that your army is strong. But what you say is very silly! Think about the man that you are believing in. Think about why you are fighting against me. 
2KI.18.21	Think about it! You are hoping that Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, will help you. But Pharaoh is like a sharp bit of wood. It makes a hole in a man's hand. Then it hurts him when he puts his weight on it! Pharaoh is like that to everybody who wants him to help them. 
2KI.18.22	But maybe you will say to me, ‘We are hoping that the 
2KI.18.23	So, come to my master, the king of Assyria, and agree with him. I will give you 2000 horses if you can put riders on them. 
2KI.18.24	You are hoping that Egypt will give you 
2KI.18.25	Also, I would not come to attack and to destroy this place without a word from the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the leader of the army where they fought, ‘Speak to us your servants in the language called Aramaic. We do understand it. Do not speak to us in the 
2KI.18.27	But the leader of the army replied, ‘My master did not send me to say these things only to your king and to you. He sent me also to the men who are sitting on the wall. Like you, they will have to eat their own dirt and to drink their own 
2KI.18.28	Then the leader of the army stood and he shouted in the 
2KI.18.29	This is what the king says. “Do not let Hezekiah make you into fools. He cannot save you from my power. 
2KI.18.30	Do not let Hezekiah cause you to believe that the 
2KI.18.31	Do not 
2KI.18.32	Then I will come to Jerusalem. And I will take you away to a country that is like your own country. It is a country where there is 
2KI.18.33	No god of any country has ever saved his country from the power of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.34	The gods of Hamath and Arpad have gone. The gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah have gone. These gods have not saved Samaria from my power. 
2KI.18.35	None of the gods of those countries has been able to save his country from me. So tell me how the 
2KI.18.36	But the people who were sitting on the wall were quiet. They did not reply, because the king had said, ‘Do not answer him.’
2KI.18.37	Then these people went to Hezekiah:
2KI.18.37	Eliakim the son of Hilkiah. He decided what would happen in the 
2KI.18.37	Shebna. He helped the king.
2KI.18.37	Joah the son of Asaph. He wrote down the things that happened.
2KI.18.37	They had torn their clothes. They told Hezekiah what the leader of Sennacherib's army had said.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard the report of his servants, he tore his clothes. Then he put on 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim and Shebna and the leaders of the 
2KI.19.3	And they told Isaiah, ‘Hezekiah says, “There are many problems at this time. And the words I have heard make me ashamed. The problems are like a child that is ready to be born. But its mother is not strong enough for it to be born. 
2KI.19.4	Perhaps the 
2KI.19.5	So Hezekiah's servants came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them, ‘Tell your master that the 
2KI.19.7	 to me! I will put a spirit into the king of Assyria. Then, he will hear a certain report. When he hears it, he will return to his own country. And there, I will cause someone to kill him with a 
2KI.19.8	Then, the leader of the army heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. So he left Jerusalem and he found the king of Assyria. The king was fighting against Libnah. 
2KI.19.9	But the king of Assyria heard this report about Tirhakah. Tirhakah was the king of Ethiopia. The report said, ‘He has come out from Ethiopia to fight against you.’ So again he sent people to Jerusalem with a message. They had this message for Hezekiah. 
2KI.19.10	‘Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah. Say, “You are hoping that your God will help you. But do not let him tell you what is not true. Your God says that the king of Assyria will not destroy Jerusalem. 
2KI.19.11	But you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. They destroyed them completely. And your God will not save you. 
2KI.19.12	The gods of these other countries did not save them. My fathers destroyed Gozan, Haran and Rezeph. And they have killed the people of Eden that lived in Tel Assar. 
2KI.19.13	The kings of Hamath and Arpad have gone. The king of the city called Sepharvaim has gone. The kings of Hena and Ivvah have gone.” ’
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the people that brought the message. He read it and then he went up to the house of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the 
2KI.19.16	, turn your ears to me and hear me. 
2KI.19.17	It is true, 
2KI.19.18	They threw their gods into the fire. They destroyed them because they are not really God. Human hands made them from wood and stone. 
2KI.19.19	So now, our 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah. ‘The 
2KI.19.21	this is what the 
2KI.19.21	“The people who live in 
2KI.19.21	do not like you.
2KI.19.21	They 
2KI.19.21	The people who live in Jerusalem
2KI.19.21	move the head about behind you.
2KI.19.22	Whom have you said bad things about?
2KI.19.22	They were not true!
2KI.19.22	Who is it that you have shouted at?
2KI.19.22	Who is it that you have looked at 
2KI.19.22	The answer is the
2KI.19.23	You have used your servants to say bad things about the 
2KI.19.23	You have said, ‘With many of my 
2KI.19.23	I have gone up very high mountains,
2KI.19.23	the highest mountains in Lebanon.
2KI.19.23	I have cut its tallest 
2KI.19.23	and the best of its 
2KI.19.23	I went to its highest places and to its best forests.
2KI.19.24	I dug wells in other countries and I drank the water from the wells.
2KI.19.24	I made all the rivers in Egypt dry with my feet.’
2KI.19.25	Surely, you have heard this!
2KI.19.25	I decided what to do a long time ago!
2KI.19.25	I decided what to do in past times!
2KI.19.25	Now it has happened.
2KI.19.25	You have caused strong cities to become mountains of stones.
2KI.19.26	The people in them are not strong.
2KI.19.26	They are not happy. And they are confused.
2KI.19.26	They are like plants in a field.
2KI.19.26	They are like the new parts of young green plants.
2KI.19.26	They are like grass on the roof of a house.
2KI.19.26	The hot winds burn them before they can grow.
2KI.19.27	I know everything about you.
2KI.19.27	I know when you sit down.
2KI.19.27	And I know when you go out.
2KI.19.27	And I know when you come in.
2KI.19.27	And I know when you shout 
2KI.19.28	You have shouted 
2KI.19.28	and you have said bad things about me.
2KI.19.28	So I will put my 
2KI.19.28	and my 
2KI.19.28	And I will cause you to return home by the same way that you came.”
2KI.19.29	And this will show it to you, Hezekiah.
2KI.19.29	“This year, you will eat what grows from its own seeds.
2KI.19.29	And in the second year, you will eat what grows from the first year's seeds.
2KI.19.29	But in the third year you will plant seeds. And you will pick what grows from them.
2KI.19.29	And you will plant again the 
2KI.19.30	And this will happen also to the people that remain in Judah.
2KI.19.30	They will be like plants.
2KI.19.30	They put 
2KI.19.30	The people will be like that.
2KI.19.31	That will happen because a 
2KI.19.31	And the people that remain will come out from 
2KI.19.31	The great love that the 
2KI.19.32	This is what the 
2KI.19.32	“He will not come into this city,
2KI.19.32	and he will not shoot an 
2KI.19.32	He will not stand in front of it with a 
2KI.19.32	He will not build mountains of earth against it.
2KI.19.33	He will return to Assyria by the way that he came,
2KI.19.33	and he will not come into this city.”
2KI.19.33	This is the promise of the 
2KI.19.34	“So I will make this city safe and I will save it.
2KI.19.34	I will do this to keep my good name.
2KI.19.34	I promised my servant David that I would do it. That is why I will do it.” ’
2KI.19.35	That night, the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, took his army away. He returned to Assyria and he stayed there in Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	After that time he was 
2KI.20.1	At that time, Hezekiah was very ill. He nearly died. Isaiah the 
2KI.20.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and he prayed to the 
2KI.20.3	And he said, ‘Remember, 
2KI.20.4	Then the 
2KI.20.5	‘Go back! Say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, “This is what the 
2KI.20.6	I will let you live for 15 more years. I will save you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria. Also, I will keep this city safe, because of my servant David.” ’ 
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, ‘Make some medicine with 
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, ‘How will I know that the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah answered, ‘This is like a sign to you from the 
2KI.20.10	‘It is easy to cause the shadow to go down 10 stairs’, said Hezekiah. ‘So, cause it to go back 10 stairs.’ 
2KI.20.11	Then the 
2KI.20.12	When this happened, Merodach-Baladan was the king of Babylon. He was the son of Baladan. Merodach-Baladan sent Hezekiah letters and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah was ill. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah met the people with the messages that the king of Babylon had sent. Hezekiah showed to them everything that he had stored. He showed them 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the 
2KI.20.15	The 
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‘Listen to what the 
2KI.20.17	“This is what will surely happen. Soldiers from Babylon will take everything that is in your 
2KI.20.18	“And soldiers from Babylon will take away some of your own 
2KI.20.19	And Hezekiah replied, ‘You have spoken good words from the 
2KI.20.20	All the other events while Hezekiah ruled Judah are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. Everything that he did is in the book. It includes the story of the pool and the 
2KI.20.21	So Hezekiah died like his 
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 55 years. His mother's name was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	The

2KI.21.8	I will never cause the feet of the people in Israel go away from this country again. I gave this country to their 
2KI.21.9	But the people did not 
2KI.21.10	So the 
2KI.21.11	‘Manasseh, the king of Judah, has done really bad 
2KI.21.12	So the 
2KI.21.13	I will put a line that measures over Jerusalem. It is the line that I used against Samaria. And it is the 
2KI.21.14	I will leave the 
2KI.21.15	because I have seen that they have done very bad things. They have made me very, very angry. They have done that since their 
2KI.21.16	Also, Manasseh poured out so much blood that he filled Jerusalem from one end to the other with blood. The blood was from people who had not done anything wrong. And there were the 
2KI.21.17	All the other events while Manasseh ruled are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. It contains everything that he did. And it includes all his 
2KI.21.18	So Manasseh died like his 
2KI.21.19	Amon was 22 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for two years. His mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz. Haruz was from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	The 
2KI.21.21	He did all the bad things that his father had done. He 
2KI.21.22	He left the 
2KI.21.23	Amon's officers had some bad ideas against him. Then they killed him in his 
2KI.21.24	Then the people who lived in the country of Judah killed them. They killed all Amon's killers. They made Josiah, Amon's son, king instead. 
2KI.21.25	The other events while Amon was king are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. Everything that he did is in that book. 
2KI.21.26	People buried him in his 
2KI.22.1	Josiah was 8 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 31 years. His mother's name was Jedidah, who was the daughter of Adaiah. Adaiah came from Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	The 
2KI.22.3	When Josiah had been king for nearly 18 years, he sent Shaphan to the house of the 
2KI.22.4	‘Go up to Hilkiah, the leader of the 
2KI.22.5	The 
2KI.22.6	These men will work with wood, and they will build with stones. So they must buy wood. And they must buy stones that people have cut. They must buy them to mend the house of the 
2KI.22.7	But the 
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah, the leader of the 
2KI.22.9	Then Shaphan, who wrote everything, went to the king. He said to him, ‘Your officers have paid all the money that was in the house of the 
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan, who wrote everything for the king, said to the king, ‘Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words from the 
2KI.22.12	He said that Hilkiah, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan and Asaiah must do this. Hilkiah was the 
2KI.22.13	‘Go. And ask the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah, the 
2KI.22.15	She said to them, ‘The 
2KI.22.16	This is what the 
2KI.22.17	This is because they have gone away from me. They have burned

2KI.22.19	I heard you when you prayed to me,” says the 
2KI.22.19	You knew that you needed to do something.
2KI.22.19	You made yourself 
2KI.22.19	You tore your clothes and you wept in front of me.
2KI.22.19	You did all that when you heard my words. I spoke against this place and its people. I said that bad things would happen to them. An enemy will destroy them.
2KI.22.20	So I will bring you to your 
2KI.23.1	So the king Josiah asked all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem to come together.
2KI.23.2	He went up to the house of the 
2KI.23.2	the men from Judah
2KI.23.2	the people in Jerusalem
2KI.23.2	the 
2KI.23.2	He read to them, while they listened, all the words in the Book of the 
2KI.23.3	The king stood in his place in the house of the 
2KI.23.3	He would work for the 
2KI.23.3	He would try as much as he could to obey the 
2KI.23.3	So Josiah agreed with all the words that were in the Book of the 
2KI.23.4	Then the king spoke to Hilkiah and to the other 
2KI.23.5	He sent away the 
2KI.23.6	He took the 
2KI.23.7	He also destroyed the houses where the male 
2KI.23.8	Josiah brought out all the 
2KI.23.9	The 
2KI.23.10	Josiah destroyed Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. After this, nobody could use it to burn his son or his daughter in the fire to the false god Molech. 
2KI.23.11	The kings of Judah had made copies of horses for the sun god. Josiah removed them from near the door of the house of the 
2KI.23.12	The kings of Judah had built 
2KI.23.13	King Josiah also destroyed the 
2KI.23.13	Ashtoreth. She was a very bad female god. The people in Sidon 
2KI.23.13	Chemosh. He was a very bad god. The people in Moab worshipped him.
2KI.23.13	Molech. He was the very, very bad god of the people in Ammon.
2KI.23.14	Josiah broke the special stones into small pieces. He cut down the 
2KI.23.15	Josiah even destroyed the 
2KI.23.16	Then Josiah looked at everything that was round him. When he saw 
2KI.23.17	Then the king asked, ‘I can see a large stone. What is it?’ The men from the city said to him, ‘It is the 
2KI.23.18	‘Do not move his stone’, he said. ‘Do not let anyone move his bones.’ So they did not move his bones, or the bones of the 
2KI.23.19	And Josiah did to all the towns in Samaria what he had done in Bethel. The kings of Israel had built 
2KI.23.20	And he killed all the 
2KI.23.21	Then the king said what all the people must do. ‘Have a special meal called the 
2KI.23.22	There was never a 
2KI.23.23	Josiah had been king for nearly 18 years when they had this 
2KI.23.24	Josiah did all these things to obey the rules in the 
2KI.23.24	Josiah sent away the people that tried to speak to dead people.
2KI.23.24	He sent away the men that did 
2KI.23.24	He destroyed the false gods that were in people's houses.
2KI.23.24	He destroyed all the other really bad things that were in Judah and in Jerusalem.
2KI.23.25	There was never a king like Josiah. He turned to the 
2KI.23.26	But the 
2KI.23.27	So the 
2KI.23.28	Other things happened while Josiah ruled Judah. Everything that he did is in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’.
2KI.23.29	While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco was the king of Egypt. Pharaoh Neco went up to the River Euphrates, to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet Pharaoh Neco. There was a war between them, and Neco killed Josiah at Megiddo. 
2KI.23.30	Josiah's servants brought his dead body from Megiddo to Jerusalem in a 
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah. She came from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	The 
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Neco tied him in a prison at Riblah, so Jehoahaz could not rule in Jerusalem. Riblah is in the country called Hamath. Neco caused Judah to pay him 100 
2KI.23.34	And then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king of Judah. He became king after his father Josiah. Neco changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz away with him to Egypt. Jehoahaz died in Egypt. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco all the 
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah. She was the daughter of Pedaiah. Pedaiah came from Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	And the 
2KI.24.1	While Jehoiakim was king, Nebuchadnezzar attacked the country (Judah). Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. Jehoiakim had to be his servant for three years. But then, Jehoiakim changed his mind. He decided not to be Nebuchadnezzar's servant. 
2KI.24.2	The 
2KI.24.3	It is sure that these things should happen to Judah. The 
2KI.24.4	Manasseh had poured out blood from people who had not done anything wrong. He had filled Jerusalem with the blood of those people. The 
2KI.24.5	The other things that King Jehoiakim did are in a book. It is called ‘the reports about the kings of Judah’. Everything that he did is in that book. 
2KI.24.6	Jehoiakim died like his 
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not march out with his army from his own country again. That was because the king of Babylon had taken a lot of his ground. He had taken all the ground from the Valley of Egypt to the River Euphrates.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta. She was the daughter of Elnathan and she came from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	The 
2KI.24.10+2KI.24.11	The leaders of Nebuchadnezzar's army marched to Jerusalem. They stayed all round it. And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, himself came up to the city Jerusalem. He came while his army leaders were there.
2KI.24.12	All these people went out to the king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar:
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin, the king of Judah
2KI.24.12	his mother
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin's servants, his leaders and his 
2KI.24.12	And the king of Babylon took Jehoiachin away when Nebuchadnezzar had ruled for less than 8 years.
2KI.24.13	Nebuchadnezzar took all the valuable things from the house of the 
2KI.24.14	Nebuchadnezzar took away all the people from Jerusalem into 
2KI.24.15	Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to a place like a prison in Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem the king's mother, his wives, his officers and the important men in the country. 
2KI.24.16	The king of Babylon also took away to Babylon the whole army of 7000 men. They were strong men and ready for war. He also took 1000 people that could make beautiful things. 
2KI.24.17	Jehoiachin's father's brother was called Mattaniah. Nebuchadnezzar made him king instead of Jehoiachin. Nebuchadnezzar changed Mattaniah's name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother's name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah and she came from Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	The 
2KI.24.20	All this happened to Jerusalem and to Judah because the 
2KI.25.1	Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, marched against Jerusalem, with all his army. He did that when Zedekiah had ruled for nearly 9 years, on the 10th day of the 10th month. The army stayed outside the city. They built walls all round the city, which were higher than the walls of Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.2	The army stayed outside the city until Zedekiah had been king for nearly 11 years. 
2KI.25.3	By the 9th day of the month, the 
2KI.25.4	Then the army from Babylon broke the city wall. The army from Babylon was all round the city. So the king of Judah and all his army ran away in the night. They went along a road near the two walls by the king's garden. All the army ran away along a road to Arabah. 
2KI.25.5	But the soldiers from Babylon followed the king. They reached him on some flat land near Jericho. All his soldiers became separate from him and they ran away to different places. 
2KI.25.6	But the soldiers from Babylon caught the king Zedekiah and they took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah. There the king of Babylon said what would happen to Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.7	They killed all Zedekiah's sons, while Zedekiah watched. Then they destroyed Zedekiah's eyes. They tied him with a line of metal pieces that joined together. And they took him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	When Nebuchadnezzar had been the king of Babylon for nearly 19 years, Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem. It was on the 7th day of the 5th month. Nebuzaradan was an officer of the king of Babylon. He was the leader of the soldiers that made the king safe. 
2KI.25.9	Nebuzaradan burned the house of the 
2KI.25.10	All the army from Babylon knocked down the walls round Jerusalem. Their leader was the leader of the soldiers that made king Nebuchadnezzar safe. 
2KI.25.11	Nebuzaradan was the leader of the soldiers that made the king of Babylon safe. He sent into 
2KI.25.12	But Nebuzaradan let some of the poorest people stay behind. They had to work in the 
2KI.25.13	The army from Babylon broke the 
2KI.25.14	They also took away the pots, the spades, the tools for the lights and the spoons. And they took away everything else that people had used in the work of the house of the 
2KI.25.15	The leader of the soldiers that made the king of Babylon safe also took away things. He took away the things in which they had put fire or water. He took away everything that Solomon had made out of gold or 
2KI.25.16	Solomon had made the two 
2KI.25.17	Each 
2KI.25.18	The leader of the soldiers that kept Nebuchadnezzar safe caught some people. These were the people:
2KI.25.18	Seraiah, who was the leader of the 
2KI.25.18	Zephaniah, who was the next most important 
2KI.25.18	three people who stood by the door of the house of the 
2KI.25.19	He also caught some of the people that were still in the city Jerusalem:
2KI.25.19	the leader of the soldiers
2KI.25.19	5 of the men that had told the king of Judah what he should do
2KI.25.19	the leader of the men who had caused the men in the country to join the army
2KI.25.19	60 of his helpers whom they found in the city Jerusalem.
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan was the leader of the soldiers that kept Nebuchadnezzar safe. He took all those people and he brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	There, at Riblah, in the country of Hamath, the soldiers of the king killed them all. So Judah's people went into 
2KI.25.22	Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. He made Gedaliah the leader of the people that were still in Jerusalem. Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
2KI.25.23	The leaders of Zedekiah's army and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah leader of Jerusalem. So these people came to Gedaliah at Mizpah:
2KI.25.23	Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah
2KI.25.23	Johanan, the son of Kareah
2KI.25.23	Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, who came from Netophah
2KI.25.23	Jaazaniah, the son of a 
2KI.25.23	all their men.
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah promised that all these men would be safe. ‘Do not be afraid of the leaders from Babylon’, he said. ‘Live in the country, but be servants of the king of Babylon. Then you will not have any problems.’ 
2KI.25.25	But in the 7th month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, came with 10 men. They killed Gedaliah, the men from Judah and the men from Babylon who were with him in Mizpah. Nethaniah was the son of Elishama, who belonged to the king's (Zedekiah's) 
2KI.25.26	When that happened, everybody ran away to Egypt. That included the leaders of the army, the poor people and the important people. They were all afraid of the people from Babylon.
2KI.25.27	When King Jehoiachin of Judah had been in 
2KI.25.28	Evil Merodach spoke kindly to Jehoiachin. He gave him a seat that was more important than the seats of the other kings with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	So Jehoiachin took off the clothes that he had worn in the prison. Until he died, he always ate his food at the king's table in Babylon.

1CH.16.16	He made that 
1CH.16.16	He will do everything that was in his special promise to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He gave that special promise for a rule for Jacob's people.
1CH.16.17	It is a 
1CH.16.18	He said, ‘I will give the country called Canaan to you.
1CH.16.18	It will be for you and for your 
1CH.16.19	At one time, God's people were only a few people.
1CH.16.19	They were a few people and they were strangers in that country.
1CH.16.20	They left one country and they went to another country.
1CH.16.20	They left one 
1CH.16.21	But he did not let anyone hurt them.
1CH.16.21	He spoke angrily to kings on their behalf.
1CH.16.22	He said, ‘Do not even touch my people that I have

1CH.16.26	All the gods of other countries are false gods.
1CH.16.26	But the 
1CH.16.27	His

1CH.16.31	All the people in the world should say, ‘The 
1CH.16.32	The sea and all the things in it should make a loud noise.
1CH.16.32	The fields will be happy and everything in them will be happy too.
1CH.16.33	Then all the trees in the forest will sing.

1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, ‘
1CH.16.37	King David said, ‘Asaph and his 
1CH.16.38	He told Obed-Edom and 68 men from his 
1CH.16.39	Zadok the 
1CH.16.40	Their job was to burn 
1CH.16.41	Heman and Jeduthun were with them. David had chosen some other men's names and they were there too. They had to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun also kept the 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people left and they all went to their houses. And David went to his house to pray for everyone who lived in his house.
1CH.17.1	David's king's house was now his home. Then he spoke to Nathan the 
1CH.17.2	Nathan replied to David, ‘God is with you. So do anything that you want to do about that.’ 
1CH.17.3	But the 
1CH.17.4	‘Go and speak to my servant David. This is what the 
1CH.17.5	I have not lived in a house since I brought the 
1CH.17.6	I told the 
1CH.17.7	Now tell David my servant that the 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you in all the places that you have gone. And I have killed all your enemies before they reached you. Now I will make your name great. It will be as great as the names of earth's greatest men. 
1CH.17.9	And I will give to my people Israel a place to stay and to grow. Then they can have their own land and other people will not be able to send them away. 
1CH.17.10	They have done that all the time. They have done it since I chose leaders over my people Israel. But I will cause your enemies to be quiet. I am telling you that the 
1CH.17.11	When it is the right time, you will die. And people will bury you where they buried your 
1CH.17.12	He will build a house for me. And I will make his 
1CH.17.13	I will be like a father to him and he will be like my son. I will not take my kind love away from him as I took it away from the king before you. 
1CH.17.14	He will rule my people and my 
1CH.17.15	Nathan told David all the words that the 
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and he sat down in front of the 
1CH.17.17	But you are my God and you have decided to do many more things for me. You have promised things to me about my future 
1CH.17.18	You know your servant. You have promised to make me very great. And I cannot say any more about that.
1CH.17.19	You have decided to promise these great things to me, 
1CH.17.20	There is nobody like you, 
1CH.17.21	Israel is a very special 
1CH.17.22	You chose Israel to be your own people for all time. And you, 
1CH.17.23	Now, 
1CH.17.24	Do that so that your name will always be great. So then people will say, “The 
1CH.17.25	You have told me, your servant, that you will build a house for me. So I was not afraid to pray to you. 
1CH.17.26	You 
1CH.17.27	Now it has given you pleasure to 
1CH.18.1	After some time, David had won all his fights with the 
1CH.18.2	David also fought the 
1CH.18.3	David also beat Hadadezer, king of Zobah. He won land as far as Hamath and he ruled the land up to the River Euphrates. 
1CH.18.4	David took from Hadadezer 1000 
1CH.18.5	Men from Damascus in Syria came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. And David killed 22,000 men from Syria. 
1CH.18.6	David put some of his soldiers in Damascus in Syria to keep it for him. Then he ruled over the people in Syria and they had to bring gifts to him. The 
1CH.18.7	David took the gold 
1CH.18.8	David also took a lot of 
1CH.18.9	People told Tou, king of Hamath, that David had beaten the whole army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah. 
1CH.18.10	Hadadezer had often fought against Tou. So Tou sent his son Hadoram to ask King David if he was well. And he wanted Hadoram to tell David that he had done well against Hadadezer. He also sent many kinds of things of gold, 
1CH.18.11	King David saved all those things for the 
1CH.18.12	And Zeruiah's son Abishai killed 18,000 men from Edom in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	He put groups of soldiers in Edom. Then David ruled over all Edom. The 
1CH.18.14	David ruled over all Israel. He did only things that were good and fair for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Zeruiah's son Joab was over the army. And Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat recorded the things that happened. 
1CH.18.16	Ahitub's son Zadok and Abiathar's son Ahimelech were 
1CH.18.17	Jehoiada's son Benaiah was over the 
1CH.19.1	After that, Nahash, the king of Ammon, died and his son ruled instead. 
1CH.19.2	David said, ‘Nahash was kind to me. So I will be kind to his son Hanun.’ So David sent some officers to Hanun. He wanted to say that he was sorry about the death of Hanun's father. David's servants came to Ammon to tell Hanun that David was sorry about it. 
1CH.19.3	But the leaders of the people in Ammon said to Hanun, ‘David has sent these men to you. So perhaps you think that he really wants to 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David's servants and he cut off all their hair. His men cut off the lower half of their long clothes to the top of their legs. Then they sent them away.
1CH.19.5	Some people came and they told David about the men. So he sent men to meet them because they were very ashamed. The king said, ‘Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown again. Then return.’
1CH.19.6	Then the people in Ammon knew that they had caused David to be very angry. So Hanun and the people in Ammon sent about 1000 
1CH.19.7	So they bought 32,000 
1CH.19.8	People told David about it so he sent out Joab with all the 
1CH.19.9	So the people from Ammon came out. And they stood ready to fight in front of their city's gate. The other kings who had come were outside in the fields.
1CH.19.10	Joab saw that there were armies in front of him and behind him too. So he took some of Israel's best soldiers. And he was their leader against the men from Syria. 
1CH.19.11	He told his brother Abishai that he must be leader of all the other soldiers against the men from Ammon. 
1CH.19.12	Joab said, ‘If the army from Syria is too strong for me, you must come to me. And you must help me. But if the army from Ammon is too strong for you, I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	We must be strong and brave. We are fighting for our people and for our God's cities. The 
1CH.19.14	Then Joab and his soldiers went out to fight the men from Syria. And they ran from him. 
1CH.19.15	The men from Ammon saw that the men from Syria had run away. And so they ran from his brother Abishai's men and they went into the city. So Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	The men from Syria saw that Israel's men had beaten them. So they sent men with a message to fetch more soldiers. More of their men came across the river, from Syria. Shophach, Hadadezer's most important officer, was at the front of those men.
1CH.19.17	Someone told David about it. Then he took all Israel's soldiers and he crossed the River Jordan. They stood in front of the men from Syria, ready to fight. And the men from Syria fought against David. 
1CH.19.18	The men from Syria ran away from Israel's men. And David killed 7000 men who drove 
1CH.19.19	The other kings saw that Israel had won the fight against Hadadezer. So they made 
1CH.20.1	Joab and the army went out in the spring. It was the time of the year when kings go out to fight. Joab destroyed the land of the 
1CH.20.2	David took the 
1CH.20.3	He took out the people who were there. And they had to work for him with tools to cut wood and with iron tools and with axes. That is what David did to all the cities in Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	Some time after that, they fought the 
1CH.20.5	In another fight with the 
1CH.20.6	And there was again war at Gath. A very tall man in Gath had 24 fingers and toes. He had 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot. He too was a 
1CH.20.7	He said that Israel's soldiers were silly. So Jonathan, son of David's brother, Shimea killed him.
1CH.20.8	David and his men killed all those 
1CH.21.1	Then 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and to all his officers, ‘Go and count the people in Israel from Beersheba to Dan. And then come and tell me. Then I will know how many there are.’
1CH.21.3	But Joab replied, ‘They are all your servants, my 
1CH.21.4	But Joab had to do what the king had said. So Joab left. And he went through all Israel and then he returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	He told David the number of men who could fight. It was 1100,000 men in all Israel. All those men knew how to use a 
1CH.21.6	But what the king had said seemed 
1CH.21.7	And God was angry because David had done this thing. So he 
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, ‘I have 
1CH.21.9	Gad was David's 
1CH.21.10	‘Go and say this to David: “You may choose one out of these three things for me to 
1CH.21.11	So Gad went to David and he said to him, ‘This is what the 
1CH.21.12	I might cause three years with very little food for your country. Or I might cause you to run from your enemies' 
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, ‘I am in great trouble. The 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	God sent an 
1CH.21.16	David looked up and he saw the 
1CH.21.17	David said to God, ‘It was I who caused Joab to count the people. I am the man who has done the bad thing. It was I who 
1CH.21.18	Then the 
1CH.21.19	So David obeyed what Gad had spoken on behalf of the 
1CH.21.20	Ornan and his 4 sons were hitting their food plants until the seeds fell out. They turned and they saw the 
1CH.21.21	Then David came near to Ornan. He looked and he saw David. He left the 
1CH.21.22	David said to Ornan, ‘Let me buy this ground so that I can build an 
1CH.21.23	Ornan replied, ‘Take it. My 
1CH.21.24	But King David said to Ornan, ‘No, I must pay the whole price. I must pay for your things. I cannot 
1CH.21.25	So David paid Ornan 7 kilos of gold (about 15 pounds weight) for the place. 
1CH.21.26	David built an 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	At that time the 
1CH.21.30	But David was afraid of the 
1CH.22.1	And then David said, ‘We will build the house of the 
1CH.22.2	So he told his officers that they must bring together all the foreign men in Israel. From them he chose men to cut the stones so that the people could build the God's house. 
1CH.22.3	He supplied a lot of iron. That was for things that would hold together its doors and gates and other things. He also gave them more 
1CH.22.4	The people from Tyre and Sidon had brought a lot of 
1CH.22.5	David said, ‘The house for the 
1CH.22.6	Then David sent someone to fetch Solomon. He told him that he must build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	He said to Solomon, ‘My son, I really wanted to build a house for the name of the 
1CH.22.8	But the 
1CH.22.9	But you will have a son who will be a quiet man, a man of 
1CH.22.10	He will build a house for my name. He will be my son and I will be his father. I will make it sure that he and his 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, I pray that the 
1CH.22.12	But I pray that the 
1CH.22.13	Then everything that you do will go well. But you must be careful to obey the 
1CH.22.14	‘I have been very careful to make many things ready for you to build the 
1CH.22.15	You have many men with you who can cut stone. And you have many men who can work with stone. You have many men who can work with wood. And you have many men who can do any kind of difficult work. 
1CH.22.16	And nobody knows how much gold, 
1CH.22.17	Then David sent messages to all the leaders in Israel. He said that they must help his son Solomon. 
1CH.22.18	He said to them, ‘The 
1CH.22.19	So you should do only things that will give the 
1CH.23.1	David was old and his life had nearly finished. Then he caused his son Solomon to rule over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	He brought together all Israel's leaders with the 
1CH.23.3	His men counted all the 
1CH.23.4	David said, ‘Now 24,000 men from among these 
1CH.23.5	And 4000 men will keep the gates safe. And 4000 men will 
1CH.23.6	David made the 
1CH.23.7	From the Gershon 
1CH.23.8	Ladan's three sons were Jehiel the most important, then Zetham and Joel.
1CH.23.9	The three sons of another Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran. Those were the leaders of Ladan's 
1CH.23.10	And 4 sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zizah, Jeush and Beriah.
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the oldest and Zizah the second. But because Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons the officers counted them as one 
1CH.23.12	The 4 sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
1CH.23.13	Amram's sons were Aaron and Moses. The 
1CH.23.14	The 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
1CH.23.16	Gershom's oldest son was Shebuel.
1CH.23.17	From Eliezer's family, Rehabiah was the leader. Eliezer had no other sons but Rehabiah had very many sons.
1CH.23.18	From Izhar's sons, Shelomith was the leader.
1CH.23.19	From Hebron's sons, Jeriah was the leader and Amariah was second. Jahaziel was third and Jekameam was fourth.
1CH.23.20	From Uzziel's sons, Micah was the leader and Isshiah was second.
1CH.23.21	Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish.
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died without sons but he had daughters. Their cousins, Kish's sons, married them.
1CH.23.23	Mushi's three sons were Mahli, Eder and Jeremoth.
1CH.23.24	Those were the leaders of the 
1CH.23.25	David had said, ‘Now the 
1CH.23.26	So the 
1CH.23.27	David had told them that they should count the

1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father died. And they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar were the 
1CH.24.3	Zadok and Ahimelech helped David to put them into groups. Zadok was a

2CH.3.16	He made 
2CH.3.17	Then he put the 
2CH.4.1	He made a 
2CH.4.2	He made a round metal thing like a sea. It was about 4.5 metres (15 feet) across and 2.3 metres (7.5 feet) high. And it was about 13.5 metres (45 feet) round its edge. 
2CH.4.3	He made shapes of things like male cows below the edge. He put 5 of these to each 0.5 metres (1.5 feet) and 5 more cows below them. And they were part of the same piece of metal as the metal sea.
2CH.4.4	He put the sea on 
2CH.4.5	The edge of the sea was as wide as a hand. And it was like a cup, the shape of a flower called a lily. It contained about 66,000 litres (17 500 gallons) of water.
2CH.4.6	Then he made 10 
2CH.4.7	He made 10 
2CH.4.8	He also made 10 tables and he put them in the 
2CH.4.9	He made the yard for the 
2CH.4.10	He put the sea on the right side in the south-east corner.
2CH.4.11	Huram also made more pots and spades and 
2CH.4.12	He made the two 
2CH.4.13	And he made 400 
2CH.4.14	He made the 
2CH.4.15	He made the very large 
2CH.4.16	He made the pots, spades and forks for meat. Huram, the good worker, made all the things for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	The king caused him to make them in the 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made very many things. So nobody knew the weight of the 
2CH.4.19	And Solomon made all the things that were inside God's house. And he made the 
2CH.4.20	He made the 
2CH.4.21	He made the flowers, the 
2CH.4.22	He made the tools to help the 
2CH.5.1	So Solomon finished all his work for the house of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon brought all the leaders of the 
2CH.5.3	All the men in Israel came together to the king. It was the time of the 
2CH.5.4	When all the leaders in Israel had arrived, the 
2CH.5.5	They took the 
2CH.5.6	King Solomon and all the 
2CH.5.7	Then the 
2CH.5.8	The 
2CH.5.9	Those pieces of wood were so long that the 
2CH.5.10	In the 
2CH.5.11	Then all the 
2CH.5.12	The 
2CH.5.13	Those 
2CH.5.13	‘He is good,
2CH.5.13	because his love will continue for all time.’
2CH.5.13	Then a cloud filled the house, the 
2CH.5.14	So the 
2CH.6.1	Then King Solomon prayed. He said, ‘The 
2CH.6.2	But I have built a beautiful house for you. It is a place for you to live for all time.’
2CH.6.3	All the 
2CH.6.4	He said, ‘
2CH.6.5	“I brought my people out of the country called Egypt. Since then I have not chosen any city in Israel for you to build a house for my name. And I have not chosen a man to be the leader of my people called Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem to become the place where they give 
2CH.6.7	My father David wanted to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	But you will not build the house. But your son who will be born in your own family will build the house for my name.”
2CH.6.10	And the 
2CH.6.11	I have put the 
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood in front of the 
2CH.6.13	He had made a 
2CH.6.14	He said, ‘
2CH.6.15	You have done what you promised to your servant David my father. You spoke with your mouth. And now, today you have done what you said.
2CH.6.16	Now 
2CH.6.17	 the God of Israel, you promised that to your servant David. So now please cause it to happen as you said.
2CH.6.18	But I do not know how it can be possible for God to live on earth with men. Neither the sky, nor the highest 
2CH.6.19	So please listen to my 
2CH.6.20	I am asking you to watch this 
2CH.6.21	Your servant and your people Israel will ask for things as they turn towards this place. Please hear them from your home in 
2CH.6.22	A man may do something wrong to another 
2CH.6.23	Then, please hear from 
2CH.6.24	The 
2CH.6.25	Then please hear them from 
2CH.6.26	Perhaps you will 
2CH.6.27	When they return, please listen from 
2CH.6.28	Many bad things might happen to your people or to their land. They might have no food, or many people might be very ill. They may have troubles with their plants. Insects may eat their food plants or enemies may attack their towns. Or there might be very bad illnesses in the country. 
2CH.6.29	Then any 
2CH.6.30	Then please hear them from your home in 
2CH.6.31	Then they will be afraid to make you angry. And they will do the things that give pleasure to you. They will obey your rules all the time that they live in their country. It is the country that you gave to our 
2CH.6.32	A man from a foreign country, not somebody from Israel, may come here. He might have come a long way because of your great name. Someone has told him that you are very strong. He may come and he may pray towards this house. 
2CH.6.33	Then please hear him from your home in 
2CH.6.34	Your people may go to fight their enemies in a place where you send them. Then they will pray to you. They will pray towards this city that you have chosen. And they will pray towards this house that I have built for your name. 
2CH.6.35	Then, from 
2CH.6.36	There is nobody who does not 
2CH.6.37	Then they may change their ideas in that country. And they may be sorry about their 
2CH.6.38	Then they will return to you in their minds. They will want to do only the things that give pleasure to you. They will pray from the country where their enemies took them. They will pray towards their country that you have given to their 
2CH.6.39	Then hear their 
2CH.6.40	Now, my God, will you please look at us. And please listen to the words that we are praying in this place.
2CH.6.41	Now, 
2CH.7.1	When Solomon had finished his 
2CH.7.2	And the 
2CH.7.3	All the 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a 
2CH.7.6	The 
2CH.7.7	The 
2CH.7.8	So Solomon obeyed the rules of the 
2CH.7.9	On the 8th day, they met together for an important meeting. For 7 days, they had made the 
2CH.7.10	Solomon sent the people to their homes on the 23rd day of the 7th month. The 
2CH.7.11	Solomon finished the house of the 
2CH.7.12	Then the 
2CH.7.13	I might cause there to be no rain or I might send insects to eat your food plants. Or I might send bad illnesses to my people. 
2CH.7.14	Then my people who are called by my name should be sorry. They should be 
2CH.7.15	Now I will be watching this place and I will be listening to the 
2CH.7.16	I have now chosen this 
2CH.7.17	‘But you must live carefully. You must remember that I am watching you. That is what your father David did. You must obey everything that I have said to you. And you must obey my rules and my 
2CH.7.18	If you do that, I will make your 
2CH.7.19	But that will not happen if you turn away from me. You may stop obeying the rules and the 
2CH.7.20	I have given my country to the 
2CH.7.21	This 
2CH.7.22	Men will answer, “It is because they have left the 
2CH.8.1	After 20 years, Solomon had built the house of the 
2CH.8.2	After that, he built in the towns that Huram had given to him. And he sent 
2CH.8.3	Then Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah. And he won the fight with the people who lived there. 
2CH.8.4	He made Tadmor in the 
2CH.8.5	He built again Higher Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon. He made those cities strong and he put walls with strong gates round them. 
2CH.8.6	And he built Baalath and more towns to store things. And he built other towns for his 
2CH.8.7	Some people who were not 
2CH.8.8	They were 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not cause any 
2CH.8.10	King Solomon's most important officers were 250 
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought 
2CH.8.12	Solomon had built an 
2CH.8.13	He told the 
2CH.8.14	Solomon gave jobs to groups of 
2CH.8.15	All the 
2CH.8.16	Solomon's servants did all Solomon's work. They started on the day when they put down the floor of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber and to Eloth by the edge of the sea. Those towns were in the country called Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent ships to him with his own men. They had their own officers who knew the sea. Those officers sailed with Solomon's servants to Ophir. And they returned with 17,000 kilos (38,000 pounds) of gold and they gave it to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	People told the Queen of Sheba about Solomon and about everything that he had done. So she came to Jerusalem to ask him many difficult things. She arrived with many people and animals. Her 
2CH.9.2	Solomon answered all her questions. Nothing was too difficult for Solomon to explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	The Queen of Sheba saw that Solomon knew many things. And she saw the house that he had built. 
2CH.9.4	She saw all the food on his table. And she saw how his 
2CH.9.5	Then she said to the king, ‘People told me about you in my country. And they told me about your 
2CH.9.6	But I did not believe it. Now I believe it because I have come here. And I have seen all those things. But people had told me only half of the things that they might have told me. You are much 
2CH.9.7	Your men are very happy. And your servants who always stand in front of you are very happy. They can always hear your 
2CH.9.8	I 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave to the king 4000 kilos (9000 pounds) of gold, a lot of 
2CH.9.10	Huram's servants and Solomon's servants brought gold from Ophir. They also brought 
2CH.9.11	The king used this 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba everything that she wanted. And he gave to her everything that she asked for. He gave more things to her than she had brought to him. Then she left with all her servants and she returned to her own country.
2CH.9.13	Every year 23,000 kilos (50,000 pounds weight) of gold came to Solomon. 
2CH.9.14	Men who were buyers and sellers brought more things. And the rulers of the country and all the kings of Arabia brought gold and 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon's men made 200 large 
2CH.9.16	Then they made 300 small 
2CH.9.17	Then the king made a large king's seat out of 
2CH.9.18	This seat had 6 steps and on top of them the 
2CH.9.19	Two 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon's cups were gold. Everything that anyone used in the house of the forest of Lebanon was the best gold. People did not think that 
2CH.9.21	The king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. And ships from Tarshish came every three years with gold, 
2CH.9.22	King Solomon was more 
2CH.9.23	All the kings on the earth wanted to meet Solomon. They wanted to hear the 
2CH.9.24	Each king brought a gift to him. They brought things of 
2CH.9.25	Solomon had 4000 places for horses and 
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the River Euphrates, past the 
2CH.9.27	The king made Jerusalem rich. 
2CH.9.28	And people brought to Solomon horses from Egypt and from all the other countries.
2CH.9.29	Nathan the 
2CH.9.30	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years over all Israel. 
2CH.9.31	Then Solomon died and the people buried him in his father David's city. And Rehoboam his son ruled instead.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the 
2CH.10.2	Jeroboam, son of Nebat was in Egypt when people told him about this. He had run there from King Solomon. But he returned from Egypt when people told him this news. 
2CH.10.3	So the 
2CH.10.4	‘Your father made our work very difficult, but will you make it easier? If you do that, we will be your servants.’ 
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam answered, ‘Come to me again after three days.’ So the people went away.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam asked the older men what they thought. Those men had been servants of his father Solomon when he was alive. ‘What should I say to these people?’ he asked.
2CH.10.7	They replied, ‘Be kind to these people. Give to them what they want. And speak good words to them. If you do that, they will always be your servants.’
2CH.10.8	But Rehoboam did not do what the older men had said. He asked the young men who had been children with him. They were standing in front of him. 
2CH.10.9	‘What answer should I give to these people who have spoken to me?’ he said. ‘They have said to me, “Your father made our work very difficult, but will you make it easier?” ’
2CH.10.10	The young men who had been children with him replied, ‘Say this to the people who said, “Your father made our work very difficult, but will you make it easier?” Say, “I am much greater than my father was. 
2CH.10.11	My father made your work difficult but I will make your work more difficult. He hurt you a little, but I will hurt you badly.” ’
2CH.10.12	Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam after three days as King Rehoboam had said. He had said, ‘Come to me again on the third day after this.’ 
2CH.10.13	The king did not speak to them in a kind way. King Rehoboam did not do what the older men had said. 
2CH.10.14	He did what the young men had said. He said, ‘My father caused your work to be difficult but I will make your work more difficult. He hurt you a little, but I will hurt you badly.’ 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people. But this was what God had decided. This was what the 
2CH.10.16	All the 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the 
2CH.10.18	Hadoram was the officer who caused the people to do very difficult work. King Rehoboam sent him to the 
2CH.10.19	So Israel has refused to obey David's 
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he sent servants to bring all the soldiers in Judah and Benjamin to him. He had 180,000 best soldiers to fight for him against Israel. Rehoboam wanted them to help him to become the king of all the people again. 
2CH.11.2	But the 
2CH.11.3	‘Speak to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the 
2CH.11.4	Tell them that the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem. He built cities in Judah to keep it safe. 
2CH.11.6	He put more buildings in Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah and Ziph. 
2CH.11.9	And he built in Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. He made all those cities in Judah and Benjamin very strong. 
2CH.11.11	He made their strong buildings even stronger and he put important officers in them to rule over them. He stored food and 
2CH.11.12	He supplied every city with 
2CH.11.13	The 
2CH.11.14	The 
2CH.11.15	Jeroboam chose his own 
2CH.11.16	But some people from every 
2CH.11.17	They helped to make the 
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab. 
2CH.11.19	She gave to him three sons, who were Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	Then he married Absalom's daughter Maacah and she gave to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Absalom's daughter Maacah better than he loved any of his other wives or lady friends. He had 18 wives and 60 lady friends. And he was the father of 28 sons and 60 daughters.
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam said that Abijah, son of Maacah was the most important among all his sons. He wanted him to become king. 
2CH.11.23	He did a 
2CH.12.1	When Rehoboam had become a safe, strong king, he stopped obeying the 
2CH.12.2	They had not been 
2CH.12.3	Shishak attacked with 1200 
2CH.12.4	He won the fight for the strong cities in Judah and he came near to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	The 
2CH.12.6	The leaders of Israel and the king made themselves 
2CH.12.7	The 
2CH.12.8	But they will become his servants. Then they will learn what it is like to be my servants. And they will learn that it is very different to be servants of kings from other countries.’
2CH.12.9	Shishak, king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. And he took away the valuable things from the 
2CH.12.10	So King Rehoboam made 
2CH.12.11	They carried the 
2CH.12.12	Rehoboam made himself 
2CH.12.13	King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and he ruled there. He was 41 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city where the 
2CH.12.14	But he did not really want to be the 
2CH.12.15	Shemaiah the 
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam died and people buried him in David's city with his 
2CH.13.1	Abijah began to rule over Judah when King Jeroboam had been king of Israel for 18 years. 
2CH.13.2	Abijah was king in Jerusalem for three years. His mother's name was Micaiah, daughter of Uriel from the town called Gibeah. Abijah and Jeroboam fought a war. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah chose his best 400,000 soldiers. And Jeroboam prepared to fight against him with 800,000 strong brave men that he had chosen.
2CH.13.4	Abijah stood on the hill called Zemaraim in the hills of Ephraim. He said, ‘Listen to me, Jeroboam and all you men from Israel. 
2CH.13.5	The 
2CH.13.6	Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was a servant of David's son Solomon. But this Jeroboam has refused to obey his master. 
2CH.13.7	Some 
2CH.13.8	And now you want to be strong against the 
2CH.13.9	But you pushed out the 
2CH.13.10	But we are different. The 
2CH.13.11	They burn 
2CH.13.12	God is with us and he is our leader. His 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam had sent some soldiers round behind Judah's men. He was in front of them with his army but the other soldiers were now behind Judah's army. 
2CH.13.14	Judah's men turned. And they saw Jeroboam's soldiers who were attacking them from the front and from behind them. Then they shouted out to the 
2CH.13.15	The men from Judah shouted very loudly. When the men from Judah shouted, the 
2CH.13.16	Israel's men ran away from Judah's men and God caused the men from Judah to win the fight. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his men completely beat the men from Israel. And 500,000 men from Israel's best soldiers died. 
2CH.13.18	On that day, the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah went after Jeroboam. And he won the fight for the towns called Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron with their villages. 
2CH.13.20	After that, Jeroboam was always weak while Abijah was Judah's king. The 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah became very strong. He married 14 wives and he had 22 sons and 16 daughters.
2CH.13.22	Many other things happened while Abijah was king. The 
2CH.14.1	Then Abijah died and people buried him in David's city with his 
2CH.14.2	Asa did good things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.14.3	He took away the 
2CH.14.4	Asa said that all the people in Judah must try to obey the 
2CH.14.5	He took away the high places for 
2CH.14.6	He built strong cities in Judah while there was 
2CH.14.7	Asa said to Judah's people, ‘We should make these towns stronger. We will put walls round them with tall buildings and gates and strong pieces of wood across the gates. The country is ours because we have obeyed the 
2CH.14.8	Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah. They carried big 
2CH.14.9	Zerah from Ethiopia marched out to fight them with a big army and 300 
2CH.14.10	Asa went out to fight Zerah. And they prepared for the fight in the valley called Zephathah near Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	Then Asa asked the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	Then Asa and his soldiers ran after them until they reached Gerar. So many soldiers from Ethiopia died there that their army could not fight again. The 
2CH.14.14	The people in the towns round Gerar had become very afraid of the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the 
2CH.15.1	God's Spirit came on Azariah, Oded's son. 
2CH.15.2	He went out to meet Asa and he said to him, ‘Listen to me Asa and all you men from Judah and Benjamin. The 
2CH.15.3	Israel's people have been without the only God that there really is for a long time. They have not had any 
2CH.15.4	But when they were in trouble they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	At that time it was not safe to go on journeys. The people in all the 
2CH.15.6	One 
2CH.15.7	But you be strong and do not be afraid. God will be good to you because your work gives pleasure to him.’
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard those words of Azariah, son of the 
2CH.15.9	Then he brought all his people together. They were from Judah and Benjamin. And there were some people from the 
2CH.15.10	These people met together in Jerusalem in the 15th year after Asa had become king. They met in the 3rd month. 
2CH.15.11	At that time they 
2CH.15.12	They promised the 
2CH.15.13	They decided to kill anyone who would not obey the 
2CH.15.14	They gave a very serious promise to the 
2CH.15.15	All Judah's people were happy because they had given this promise to God. They really wanted to obey the 
2CH.15.16	Asa took away his grandmother Maacah's special 
2CH.15.17	Asa did not remove out of Israel the high places for 
2CH.15.18	He took the 
2CH.15.19	Judah did not have to fight again until Asa had been king for more than 35 years.
2CH.16.1	After Asa had been king of Judah for nearly 36 years Baasha, king of Israel, attacked Judah. And he made Ramah a strong town. He did not want to let anyone go in or out of King Asa's country, Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa took 
2CH.16.3	‘We should promise to help each other. My father and your father promised to help each other. I am sending 
2CH.16.4	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and he sent the captains of his armies to attack Israel's towns. They won the fights at Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim and all the cities where Naphtali kept their things. 
2CH.16.5	When Baasha knew about this, he stopped building Ramah. He stopped his work on it. 
2CH.16.6	So King Asa brought all the men from Judah. They carried away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build with in Ramah. And Asa used them to build in Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani, the 
2CH.16.8	The armies of Ethiopia and Libya were very large. And they had many 
2CH.16.9	The 
2CH.16.10	Asa was angry with the 
2CH.16.11	Somebody wrote about all the things that King Asa did. They are in the Book about the Kings of Judah and Israel. All the events from the first event to the last event are in that book. 
2CH.16.12	When Asa had been king for nearly 39 years, he became ill. His feet became very bad. But Asa did not ask the 
2CH.16.13	Asa died as his 
2CH.16.14	The people buried him in the place that he had prepared in the city of David. They put him on a table that he had covered with 
2CH.17.1	Asa's son Jehoshaphat ruled instead. And he made himself strong against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He put armies in all the cities of Judah that had walls. And he put groups of soldiers in places in Judah. And he put them in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had won. 
2CH.17.3	Jehoshaphat was like his 
2CH.17.4	He went for help to the God of his father. He obeyed the 
2CH.17.5	The 
2CH.17.6	He really wanted be the 
2CH.17.7	When he had been king for nearly three years, Jehoshaphat sent his officers to teach in Judah's towns. The names of those officers were Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah. 
2CH.17.8	He sent some 
2CH.17.9	They taught the people in all parts of Judah. They took with them the Book of the 
2CH.17.10	The people in all the 
2CH.17.11	Some 
2CH.17.12	Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built strong buildings. And he built towns in Judah to store his good things. 
2CH.17.13	He stored many valuable things in the towns of Judah. And he kept strong, brave soldiers in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	These are their names for each 
2CH.17.14	From Judah there were officers over groups of 1000 men. Adnah was the officer over 300,000 brave soldiers.
2CH.17.15	Next, there was Jehohanan. He was the officer over 280,000 soldiers.
2CH.17.16	Next, there was Amasiah, Zichri's son. He wanted to be the 
2CH.17.17	From Benjamin, there was Eliada, a brave soldier, with 200,000 men with bows and 
2CH.17.18	Next, there was Jehozabad with 180,000 men with 
2CH.17.19	All these soldiers worked for the king. He also had other soldiers that he put in all Judah's strong cities.
2CH.18.1	Jehoshaphat was very rich and people gave a lot of 
2CH.18.2	After some years, he went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab killed many sheep and cows for him and for the people who were with him. Ahab wanted to attack Ramoth-Gilead. He asked Jehoshaphat to help him. And Jehoshaphat decided to do it. 
2CH.18.3	This is what happened. Ahab, Israel's king said to Jehoshaphat Judah's king, ‘Will you go with me to attack Ramoth-Gilead?’ Jehoshaphat replied, ‘I am like you. My people are like your people. We will come with you to the fight.’ 
2CH.18.4	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, ‘Please ask the 
2CH.18.5	So the king of Israel brought the 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, ‘Is there another 
2CH.18.7	Ahab replied, ‘There is one other man here who will ask the 
2CH.18.7	‘Do not say that!’ replied Jehoshaphat.
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel said to an officer, ‘Bring Micaiah son of Imlah to me quickly.’
2CH.18.9	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah were sitting on their special king's seats. And they were wearing their special king's clothes. They were at a 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made two iron 
2CH.18.11	All the other 
2CH.18.12	The officer who had gone to fetch Micaiah spoke to him. ‘All the other 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, ‘The 
2CH.18.14	When he arrived, the king asked him, ‘Micaiah, should we go to fight at Ramoth-Gilead or should I not go?’
2CH.18.14	‘Attack and win’, he said. ‘The 
2CH.18.15	The king said to him, ‘I have to say this to you too many times. You must promise me, in the 
2CH.18.16	Then Micaiah said, ‘I saw all Israel's men and they were running everywhere over the mountains. They were like sheep that had no 
2CH.18.17	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ‘I told you that he never 
2CH.18.18	Then Micaiah said, ‘So listen to the word of the 
2CH.18.19	The 
2CH.18.20	Then another 
2CH.18.20	“How will you do it?” the 
2CH.18.21	“I will go. And I will cause all his 
2CH.18.21	“That will cause him to go and fight”, said the 
2CH.18.22	So now the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah went up and he hit Micaiah on the face. ‘Which way did the 
2CH.18.24	Micaiah replied, ‘You will know that on the day when you go to hide in an inside room.’
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said to his soldiers, ‘Take Micaiah to Amon, who rules the city and to Joash my son. 
2CH.18.26	Tell them that the king says, “Put this man in a prison. Give to him only bread and water as food until I return alive and well.” ’
2CH.18.27	Micaiah said, ‘If you really return alive and well, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah went to fight against the people in Ramoth-Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ‘I will not wear special clothes when I am fighting. But you wear your king's clothes.’ So the king of Israel wore soldier's clothes. And they started to fight the enemy.
2CH.18.30	But the king of Syria had said to his 
2CH.18.31	The 
2CH.18.32	The 
2CH.18.33	But a man shot an 
2CH.18.34	They fought all day and the king of Israel stood against the side of his 
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in Jerusalem. He was safe. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu the 
2CH.19.3	But you have some good things in you. You have destroyed the Asherah 
2CH.19.4	So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. But he went out among all the people from Beersheba to the hills of Ephraim. He turned the people to the 
2CH.19.5	He chose men to become 
2CH.19.6	He said to the 
2CH.19.7	Now be afraid to make the 
2CH.19.8	Jehoshaphat also chose men in Jerusalem to be 
2CH.19.9	He said to them, ‘You must be afraid to make the 
2CH.19.10	 who live in the cities may be arguing. And they will come to you. These problems may be about deaths. They may be about what the 
2CH.19.11	Amariah, the most important 
2CH.20.1	After that, men from Moab, men from Ammon and some other people called Meunites came to fight Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.20.2	Some men came and they said to Jehoshaphat, ‘A large army is coming from this side of Syria. It has come across the Dead Sea to attack you. They are already in Hazazon-Tamar.’ (That is another name for En-Gedi.)
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid. So, he decided to ask the 
2CH.20.4	All Judah's people came together to ask the 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood up in front of the people from Judah and from Jerusalem. He was standing in front of the new yard of the 
2CH.20.6	He said, ‘
2CH.20.7	Our God, you pushed out the people who were living in this country. You caused your people, the 
2CH.20.8	Your people have lived here and they have built a house here to give 
2CH.20.9	“Perhaps we will have troubles. The trouble might be war, 
2CH.20.10	But now men from Ammon, Moab and the mountain called Seir are here. You would not let the 
2CH.20.11	Now see how these people are paying us for that. They are coming to push us out of your country that you gave to us to keep. 
2CH.20.12	So, our God, please 
2CH.20.13	All the men from Judah were standing there in front of the 
2CH.20.14	Then the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	He said, ‘Listen to me all you people who live in Judah and in Jerusalem. And listen to me King Jehoshaphat. The 
2CH.20.16	March down against them tomorrow. They will be climbing up the narrow valley called Ziz. People go to the 
2CH.20.17	You will not have to fight this time. Go to your places. Stand there. And see how the 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat put his nose to the ground. And all the people from Judah and from Jerusalem fell down in front of the 
2CH.20.19	Then some 
2CH.20.20	Jehoshaphat and his men got up early the next morning. And they started to go to the 
2CH.20.21	And Jehoshaphat talked with the people. Then he chose men to sing and to 
2CH.20.22	The soldiers from Ammon, Moab and from the mountain called Seir were coming to attack Judah. God's people started to sing and to 
2CH.20.23	The men from Ammon and Moab started to attack the men from Seir. They destroyed their army. When they had done that, they started to fight each other. And they were killing each other. 
2CH.20.24	The men from Judah came to the place where they could see the 
2CH.20.25	So Jehoshaphat and his people went to take away everything that was valuable. They found a lot of clothes and other valuable things on the dead bodies. They took the things from the dead bodies. But there were more things than they could carry away. There was so much that it took them three days to carry all the things away. 
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they came together in the Valley of Beracah. There they 
2CH.20.27	Then Jehoshaphat and all the men from Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat was walking in front of them. They were very happy because the 
2CH.20.28	They went into Jerusalem with 
2CH.20.29	The people in all the 
2CH.20.30	Then Jehoshaphat's 
2CH.20.31	So Jehoshaphat was still the king of Judah. He was 35 years old when he started to rule over Judah. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother's name was Azubah. She was Shilhi's daughter. 
2CH.20.32	He lived as his father Asa had done. And he always followed his father's ways. He always did what the 
2CH.20.33	But he did not remove the high places where some people 
2CH.20.34	Other things happened while Jehoshaphat was king. Hanani's son Jehu recorded all those things from the first thing to the last thing. He recorded them in the Book about the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	After that, Jehoshaphat became a friend of Ahaziah the king of Israel who did very wrong things. 
2CH.20.36	They agreed to build ships that would sail to Tarshish. And they built the ships in the town called Ezion-Geber. 
2CH.20.37	Dodavahu's son Eliezer from the town called Mareshah 
2CH.21.1	Then Jehoshaphat died as his 
2CH.21.2	Jehoram had brothers who were also sons of Jehoshaphat. They were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these men were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	Their father had given many gifts of 
2CH.21.4	Jehoram made himself a strong king over his father's 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was 32 years old when he started to rule. He ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem.
2CH.21.6	He had married Ahab's daughter. So he did what the kings of Israel had done. He did what Ahab and his 
2CH.21.7	But the 
2CH.21.8	Edom's people decided not to obey Judah's king while Jehoram was king. So they chose their own king to rule over them. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his 
2CH.21.10	But since then, Edom's people have refused to obey Judah's king. At the same time, the people in Libnah decided not to obey Jehoram. That was because Jehoram had stopped 
2CH.21.11	He also built high places on the hills in Judah. And there he caused the people from Jerusalem to 
2CH.21.12	Elijah the 
2CH.21.12	‘The 
2CH.21.13	Instead, you have done as the kings of Israel do. You have been like Ahab and his 
2CH.21.14	So now the 
2CH.21.15	You, yourself, will have many illnesses. You will have an illness in your stomach. The illness will get worse each day until in the end your inside parts will come out of your body.” ’
2CH.21.16	And the 
2CH.21.17	They attacked Judah and they won a lot of land. They took away all the things in the king's house and his sons and his wives. The only son that they did not take was Jehoahaz, the youngest son.
2CH.21.18	After all those things, the 
2CH.21.19	He was very ill for two whole years, and then his inside parts came out because of the illness. He had very bad pain because of this illness and then he died. His people did not make a big fire to give 
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was 32 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 8 years. When he died nobody was sad. They buried him in David's city, but not where they had buried the other kings.
2CH.22.1	The people who lived in Jerusalem chose Jehoram's youngest son, Ahaziah to be king of Judah instead. Enemies that came in with the Arabs had killed all Jehoram's older sons. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah began to rule over Judah.
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was 22 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, who was a granddaughter of Omri.
2CH.22.3	Ahaziah's mother taught him to do what was wrong. So he did the things that Ahab and his 
2CH.22.4	He did very wrong things that the 
2CH.22.5	Ahab's officers told him that he should go with Jehoram to fight Hazael, king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead. Jehoram was the son of Ahab and he was the king of Israel. He did as they said and the soldiers from Syria hurt Jehoram. 
2CH.22.6	So he went to Jezreel to get better after what had happened at Ramah. While he was fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria there, Hazael's soldiers had hurt him. Then Jehoram's son Ahaziah, the king of Judah went to Jezreel to see Ahab's son Jehoram because he was ill.
2CH.22.7	God used this visit to Jehoram to cause Ahaziah's death. When Ahaziah arrived, he went with Jehoram to meet Nimshi's son Jehu. But the 
2CH.22.8	While Jehu was 
2CH.22.9	Then he went to find Ahaziah. Jehu's men found him where he was hiding in Samaria. And they caught him. They took him to Jehu. Then they killed him. They buried him because they said, ‘He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat obeyed the 
2CH.22.10	Then Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, knew that her son was dead. So she started to kill everyone in the king's 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, King Jehoram's daughter, took Ahaziah's son Joash away from the other sons that Athaliah was killing. And she hid him. She was the wife of Jehoiada the 
2CH.22.12	He stayed secretly with them in the house of God for 6 years. During that time, Athaliah ruled the country.
2CH.23.1	After nearly 7 years, Jehoiada decided that he must be brave. He told some officers in the army what he wanted to do. And they agreed with him. They were each over 100 soldiers. These men were Jeroham's son Azariah, Jehohanan's son Ishmael, Obed's son Azariah, Adaiah's son Maaseiah and Zichri's son Elishaphat. 
2CH.23.2	They went to all the towns in Judah. They brought the 
2CH.23.3	There in God's house all those people promised the king that they would help him. 
2CH.23.3	Jehoiada said to them, ‘Here is the king's son. He must rule as the 
2CH.23.4	You must do this: You 
2CH.23.5	Another group will watch at the king's house. And the last group will be at the gate called Foundation Gate. All the other people will be in the yards round the house of the 
2CH.23.6	Only the 
2CH.23.7	The 
2CH.23.8	The 
2CH.23.9	Jehoiada the 
2CH.23.10	He told all the men that they must stand with their 
2CH.23.11	Jehoiada and his sons brought out the old king's son and they put the 
2CH.23.12	Athaliah heard the noise when the people started to run about. She heard them when they 
2CH.23.13	She looked and she saw the new king. He was standing in the king's place by the door of the 
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the 
2CH.23.15	So they took her and they brought her to the Horse Gate, next to the king's house. And they killed her there.
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada, the people and the king promised each other that they would be the 
2CH.23.17	All the people went to the 
2CH.23.18	Then Jehoiada gave authority over the house of the 
2CH.23.19	Jehoiada also put men at the gates of the 
2CH.23.20	Jehoiada took the captains who were each over 100 men, the important men and the rulers of the people. And all the country's people went with them. They brought the king down from the 
2CH.23.21	And all the people in the whole country were very happy. The city was quiet because the people had killed Athaliah with the 
2CH.24.1	Joash was 7 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did the things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada chose two wives for him and he had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Some time after those things, Joash decided to do repairs to the 
2CH.24.5	He asked the 
2CH.24.6	So the king asked Jehoiada, the most important 
2CH.24.7	The sons of that 
2CH.24.8	The king said that the 
2CH.24.9	Then he sent men to tell everyone in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring the money there. God's servant Moses had told the 
2CH.24.10	All the officers and all the people were happy to give this money. They brought their part and they threw it into the box. They did that until all the people had given their money. 
2CH.24.11	The 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave the money to builders for the repairs to the 
2CH.24.13	These workers worked well and they soon finished the repairs. They made the house as it should be. And they made it stronger, too. 
2CH.24.14	They did not use all the money. So when they had finished the work, they brought some money to the king and to Jehoiada. They decided to make tools to use in the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada became very old. He had lived for many years. And he died when he was 130 years old. 
2CH.24.16	They buried him among the kings in David's city. That was because he had done many good things in Israel for God and for God's house.
2CH.24.17	After Jehoiada died, the most important leaders in Judah came to the king. They fell down in front of him and then the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	They stopped 
2CH.24.19	The 
2CH.24.20	Then God's Spirit came upon Zechariah, son of Jehoiada the 
2CH.24.21	But the people decided to hurt him. The king told them that they should kill him. So they threw stones at him until he was dead. They did it in the yard of the 
2CH.24.22	King Joash did not remember that Zechariah's father Jehoiada had been very kind to him. He killed his son. And when Zechariah was dying he said, ‘I pray that the 
2CH.24.23	At the end of that year, an army from Syria attacked Joash. They attacked Judah and Jerusalem. They killed all the people's leaders and they sent many valuable things to their king in Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	The army from Syria was only a few soldiers. But the 
2CH.24.25	When the army from Syria left, Joash was very ill. His own servants were angry that he had killed the son of Jehoiada the 
2CH.24.26	The 
2CH.24.27	People recorded the things about Joash's sons and the 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was 25 years old when he began to rule. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother's name was Jehoaddan and she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did the things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.25.3	He made himself safe and strong as the ruler of the country. Then he killed all his servants who had killed the king, his father. 
2CH.25.4	But he did not kill their children. He did as Moses had written in the 
2CH.25.5	Then Amaziah brought all the people in Judah together. He chose leaders for their 
2CH.25.6	And he paid 3500 kilos (7800 pounds) of 
2CH.25.7	But a 
2CH.25.8	With them, you may be strong and you may fight well in the war. But God will use the enemy to beat you. God can help you. And he can cause your enemies to beat you.’
2CH.25.9	Amaziah said to God's servant, ‘But I have paid 3500 kilos (7800 pounds weight) of 
2CH.25.10	So Ahaziah spoke to the soldiers who were 
2CH.25.11	But Amaziah became brave and he led all his soldiers to the Valley of Salt. There they fought and they killed 10,000 men from Seir. 
2CH.25.12	His army also caught 10,000 more men alive. They took them to the top of a tall rock and they threw them from the top of the rock. So, all the men died when they hit the rocks below. 
2CH.25.13	But the soldiers that Amaziah had sent away were attacking towns in Judah from Samaria to Beth-Horon. He had not let them go to war with his army. They killed 3000 men and they took away many valuable things from those towns.
2CH.25.14	Amaziah returned to Judah after he had killed all those soldiers from Seir. But he brought the gods that the people in Seir 
2CH.25.15	So the 
2CH.25.16	While he was speaking, the king said to him, ‘We have not asked you to tell the king what he should do! Stop! If you do not stop, my men will kill you.’ So the 
2CH.25.17	Then Judah's King Amaziah and his most important officers spoke together. Then they sent a message to the king of Israel. He was Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu. ‘Come and we can fight each other’, the message said.
2CH.25.18	But Israel's King Joash replied to Amaziah the king of Judah, ‘A small weed in Lebanon sent a message to a great 
2CH.25.19	You say to yourself that you have won the fight with Edom. And now you think that you are great. But stay in your house! You do not want to cause trouble for yourself. If you fight us, we will beat you and Judah.’
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah refused to listen. God had decided that he would cause Joash's army to win the fight. That was because Amaziah had 
2CH.25.21	So Joash, Israel's king attacked Amaziah, the king of Judah. They stood at Beth-Shemesh in Judah. And they were looking at each other. 
2CH.25.22	Israel's army beat Judah's army completely. So every soldier from Judah ran away to his 
2CH.25.23	Joash, the king of Israel caught Amaziah the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Judah. He caught him at Beth-Shemesh and he took him to Jerusalem. Then Joash broke the wall of Jerusalem, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. That part of the wall was about 180 metres (600 feet) long. 
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold and the 
2CH.25.25	Joash's son, King Amaziah of Judah lived for 15 years after Jehoahaz's son Joash, king of Israel died. 
2CH.25.26	Men have written down all the other things that Amaziah did from the first thing to the last thing. All those things are in the Book about the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.25.27	After Amaziah had stopped obeying the 
2CH.25.28	They brought his dead body to Jerusalem on horses. And they buried him with his 
2CH.26.1	Then all the people in Judah took Uzziah and they chose him to be king instead. He was Amaziah's son and he was 16 years old. 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth again after King Amaziah had died. And he made it a part of Judah again. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 52 years. His mother's name was Jecoliah and she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did the things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.26.5	He tried to obey God all the time that Zechariah was alive. Zechariah was 
2CH.26.6	Uzziah went and he attacked the 
2CH.26.7	God helped him to win fights against the 
2CH.26.8	The people from Ammon paid 
2CH.26.9	Uzziah built tall buildings to keep Jerusalem safe. He built them at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the corner of the wall. He made them strong and he put men with 
2CH.26.10	He also built buildings like that in the 
2CH.26.11	Uzziah had an army of soldiers who were ready for war. Jeiel was the king's 
2CH.26.12	The number of leaders of the soldiers' 
2CH.26.13	They ruled an army of 307 500 men who were ready to fight. They were a powerful army to help the king against his enemies. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah gave to all the soldiers enough 
2CH.26.15	Clever men in Jerusalem had new ideas about machines to throw 
2CH.26.16	So Uzziah was powerful. But then he began to think that he was more important than anyone. So he began to do wrong things. And he 
2CH.26.17	Azariah and 80 other brave 
2CH.26.18	They told King Uzziah that he was wrong. They said to him, ‘It is not right for you, Uzziah to burn special oils with sweet smells in front of the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was angry. In his hand, he was holding the thing that 
2CH.26.20	And Azariah the most important 
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah had the illness on his skin until the day that he died. Because of the illness he had to live in a house by himself. And he could not go into the 
2CH.26.22	Amoz's son, the 
2CH.26.23	Uzziah died. And his servants buried him in a field that the kings had to bury people in. They did that because they said, ‘He had the illness called leprosy.’ Then his son Jotham ruled Judah instead.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was 25 years old when he began to rule his country. He ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did the things that his father Uzziah had done. He did things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.27.3	Jotham built the highest gate of the 
2CH.27.4	He built towns in the hills of Judah. And he built strong buildings and tall buildings for soldiers in the forests.
2CH.27.5	Jotham attacked the king of Ammon's 
2CH.27.6	Jotham became powerful because he was careful to obey the 
2CH.27.7	Someone has written about all the wars and about all the other things that Jotham did. All those things are in the Book about the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was 25 years old when he began to rule his country. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. 
2CH.27.9	Then Jotham died and his servants buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz ruled the country instead.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to rule his country. He ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. But he was not like his 
2CH.28.2	He did all the things that the kings of Israel did. And he made metal 
2CH.28.3	He burnt oils with sweet smells in the Ben-Hinnom Valley for them. And he 
2CH.28.4	He offered 
2CH.28.5	So, the 
2CH.28.6	Remaliah's son Pekah from Israel killed 120,000 of Judah's best soldiers in one day. God let that happen because the people in Judah had stopped 
2CH.28.7	Zichri, a good fighter from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son. He also killed Azrikam, the officer over the king's house and Elkanah who was the king's most important officer. 
2CH.28.8	The 
2CH.28.9	But a 
2CH.28.10	And now you want to use people from Judah and Jerusalem as your male and female slaves. But remember that you too have 
2CH.28.11	Now listen to me. The 
2CH.28.12	Then some leaders in Ephraim met the soldiers while the soldiers were returning from the war. Those leaders were Johanan's son Azariah, Meshillemoth's son Berechiah, Shallum's son Jehizkiah and Hadlai's son Amasa. 
2CH.28.13	‘You must not bring these people that you have caught here’, they said. ‘If you do, it will be a 
2CH.28.14	So the soldiers gave the people and the things that they had taken from Judah to the leaders. All the people were watching them while they did that. 
2CH.28.15	Then those 4 leaders gave clothes and shoes to those who had none. They took those things from the things that the soldiers had taken away from Judah. And they gave food, drink and medicines to them. They put on 
2CH.28.16	At that time, King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help. 
2CH.28.17	The people from Edom had come again. They had attacked Judah and they had taken people away. 
2CH.28.18	At the same time, the 
2CH.28.19	The 
2CH.28.20	Tilgath-Pilneser, the king of Assyria came to Ahaz. But he caused trouble and he did not help Ahaz. 
2CH.28.21	Ahaz had taken many valuable things from the 
2CH.28.22	In this time of trouble, this same King Ahaz did more and more bad things against the 
2CH.28.23	He gave 
2CH.28.24	Ahaz took away all the things that were in God's house. And he cut them into pieces. He shut the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	He built high places in every town in Judah to burn oils with sweet smells to other gods. So he made the 
2CH.28.26	Everything about him is in the Book about the Kings of Judah and Israel. And all the things that he did from the first thing to the last thing are in that book. 
2CH.28.27	Ahaz died and the people buried him in the city, in Jerusalem. But they did not bury him near the kings of Israel. Then his son Hezekiah ruled the country instead.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was 25 years old when he began to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother's name was Abijah. She was the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did as his 
2CH.29.3	He opened the doors of the 
2CH.29.4	He brought the 
2CH.29.5	He said to them, ‘Listen to me you 
2CH.29.6	‘Our 
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors of the 
2CH.29.8	So the 
2CH.29.9	So our fathers died while they were fighting our enemies. And our sons, our daughters and our wives are in foreign countries because of it. 
2CH.29.10	Now I want to give a promise to the 
2CH.29.11	‘My sons, the 
2CH.29.12	Then these 
2CH.29.12	From Kohath's 
2CH.29.12	From Merari's 
2CH.29.12	From Gershon's 
2CH.29.13	From Elizaphan's 
2CH.29.13	From Asaph's 
2CH.29.14	From Heman's 
2CH.29.14	And from Jeduthun's 
2CH.29.15	They brought all the 
2CH.29.16	The 
2CH.29.17	They began to make the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went to King Hezekiah and they said, ‘We have made the whole house of the 
2CH.29.19	King Ahaz removed many things from the 
2CH.29.20	King Hezekiah got up early the next morning and he brought the leaders of the city together. Then he and all the leaders went to the 
2CH.29.21	They brought with them 7 male cows, 7 male sheep, 7 young sheep and 7 young male goats. These animals were for a 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the male cows and the 
2CH.29.23	Then the king and the people who were there put their hands on the male goats. They were a 
2CH.29.24	Then the 
2CH.29.25	The king caused the 
2CH.29.26	The 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah told the 
2CH.29.28	All the people were 
2CH.29.29	At the end of the 
2CH.29.30	King Hezekiah and his officers told the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, ‘Now you have given yourselves to the 
2CH.29.32	For 
2CH.29.33	They also put to one side 600 male cows and 3000 sheep and goats for 
2CH.29.34	But there were not enough 
2CH.29.35	There were many 
2CH.29.35	That is how they again began to 
2CH.29.36	Hezekiah and all the people were happy because God had helped them to do it so quickly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah sent servants with letters to all the people in Israel and in Judah. He also wrote letters to the 
2CH.30.2	The king, his officers and all the people in Jerusalem decided to have the 
2CH.30.3	The proper time was the first month, but not enough 
2CH.30.4	This idea seemed right to the king and to all the people. 
2CH.30.5	So they sent men to read a letter to all the people. They sent them through all Israel from Beersheba to Dan. The letter asked them to come to Jerusalem for the 
2CH.30.6	So the king and his officers sent men with letters to every place in Israel and Judah. The letters said, ‘
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your 
2CH.30.8	Do not refuse to obey him as your 
2CH.30.9	If you start to obey the 
2CH.30.10	The men took this letter to every town among the 
2CH.30.11	But some people from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun became 
2CH.30.12	God was also working in the people in Judah. And so all those people agreed to obey the king and his officers. The 
2CH.30.13	A very large crowd of people came together in Jerusalem in the second month. They came to have the 
2CH.30.14	They started to work. And they took away the 
2CH.30.15	They killed the young sheep for the 
2CH.30.16	They stood in their proper places. God's servant Moses had described these in the 
2CH.30.17	Many people in the crowd had not made themselves 
2CH.30.18	Many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not made themselves 
2CH.30.19	who really wants to 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	The 
2CH.30.22	All the 
2CH.30.23	Then all the people there agreed to eat the 
2CH.30.24	Hezekiah, the king of Judah gave to the people 1000 young male cows and 7000 sheep and goats. And the leaders gave to them 1000 young male cows and 10,000 sheep and goats. And many 
2CH.30.25	All Judah's people were happy. And the 
2CH.30.26	Everyone in Jerusalem was very happy. There had not been anything like this in Jerusalem since the time when David's son Solomon was king of Israel. 
2CH.30.27	The 
2CH.31.1	All the 
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah put the 
2CH.31.3	The king gave his own animals for 
2CH.31.4	He spoke to all the people who lived in Jerusalem. He told them that they must give the proper gifts to the 
2CH.31.5	When the people got Hezekiah's message they brought many good things. They brought the first 
2CH.31.6	The people from 
2CH.31.7	They started to put the things together in the 3rd month and they finished in the 7th month. 
2CH.31.8	Hezekiah and the leaders saw all the things. And they said good things about the 
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the 
2CH.31.10	Azariah, the most important 
2CH.31.11	Hezekiah told them that they must make rooms to store the things in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	They brought in all the gifts and the 
2CH.31.13	Conaniah and his brother, Shimei were over Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah. And those men told other 
2CH.31.14	Imnah the 
2CH.31.15	He was over Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah, who lived in the 
2CH.31.16	They gave gifts to all the males with names that were in the lists of 
2CH.31.17	The lists of the 
2CH.31.18	Also, the very young children, wives, sons and daughters received some things from the gifts. That was because they always kept themselves 
2CH.31.19	Some of the 
2CH.31.20	That is what Hezekiah did in all Judah. He did what was good and right. And he obeyed the 
2CH.31.21	He tried to obey God in everything that he did for God's house. He tried to obey God's 
2CH.32.1	After Hezekiah had done all these good things, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria came into Judah. His soldiers lived in 
2CH.32.2	Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come. And he saw that he wanted to fight against Jerusalem's people. 
2CH.32.3	So he talked with his officers and with his best soldiers. They decided to stop all the water that came from streams round the city. And the officers and the soldiers helped him to do it. 
2CH.32.4	Many people came. And they stopped the big stream that went through the land there. They said, ‘We do not want the kings of Assyria to find plenty of water here.’ 
2CH.32.5	Then Hezekiah's men worked to do repairs to the city's walls where they needed it. All the men worked as well as they could. Hezekiah built tall buildings on the walls. And he built another wall outside the first wall. He made the wall called the Millo round the City of David stronger, too. And he made a lot of 
2CH.32.6	Hezekiah chose some men to be captains over the people in the fight. He asked all the captains to come together in front of him. They met in the big place by the city's gate. Then he spoke to make them braver. This is what he said: 
2CH.32.7	‘Be strong and brave. Do not be afraid of Assyria's king or of his large army. And do not think that they will certainly beat you. There are more soldiers with us than there are with him. 
2CH.32.8	He has only human soldiers to help him. But we have the 
2CH.32.9	Sennacherib, the king of Assyria and all his army were waiting round Lachish to attack it. Then he sent a message to Judah's King Hezekiah and to all Judah's people with him in Jerusalem. This is what it said: 
2CH.32.10	‘Sennacherib, king of Assyria says this to you: “You are sitting in Jerusalem and there are soldiers everywhere round you. But I do not know what you are 
2CH.32.11	Hezekiah is saying that the 
2CH.32.12	Remember that Hezekiah himself removed this god's high places for 
2CH.32.13	You know what my 
2CH.32.14	None of the gods of the 
2CH.32.15	So now do not let Hezekiah cause you to believe things that are not true. Do not let him change your thoughts. Do not believe him. No god of any 
2CH.32.16	Sennacherib's servants also spoke more things against the 
2CH.32.17	He also wrote letters that said bad things about the 
2CH.32.18	Then Sennacherib's servants shouted loudly in the 
2CH.32.19	They spoke about Jerusalem's God. They spoke as they had spoken about all the gods of the people in other countries. But those gods were only 
2CH.32.20	King Hezekiah and Amoz's son, Isaiah the 
2CH.32.21	Then the 
2CH.32.22	So the 
2CH.32.23	Many people brought gifts to Jerusalem for the 
2CH.32.24	Hezekiah became very ill at that time. He nearly died. He prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not thank the 
2CH.32.26	But then Hezekiah and the people who lived in Jerusalem made themselves 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah was very rich and people gave great 
2CH.32.28	He built places to store 
2CH.32.29	He built cities for himself. And he had many sheep and cows because God had given very many things to him.
2CH.32.30	Hezekiah had stopped the water coming from the higher stream that came out of the ground at Gihon. He caused the water to run down inside the west of David's City. And when he tried to do anything, good things happened. 
2CH.32.31	But the rulers of Babylon sent some 
2CH.32.32	The 
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah died and people buried him with David's 
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was 12 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 55 years. 
2CH.33.2	He did very wrong things that the 
2CH.33.3	Manasseh built again the high places for 
2CH.33.4	The 
2CH.33.5	He built 
2CH.33.6	He 
2CH.33.7	He made an 
2CH.33.8	I do not want to take Israel's people away again from this country that I gave to your 
2CH.33.9	But Manasseh caused Judah's people and the people in Jerusalem to 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	So the 
2CH.33.12	When Manasseh had a lot of trouble, he asked the 
2CH.33.13	When he prayed to God, and God listened to him. And he listened to what Manasseh was asking for. So he brought Manasseh to Jerusalem again. And he caused him to become king again. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	After that, he built a new wall outside the wall of David's City. He built it to the west of Gihon, in the valley and at the way in to the Fish Gate. The wall went round the hill called Ophel. And he made the wall very high. And Manasseh put officers and soldiers in all the strong cities in Judah.
2CH.33.15	He took away the gods of other 
2CH.33.16	Then he did repairs to the 
2CH.33.17	But the people still 
2CH.33.18	The other things that Manasseh did are in ‘The Book about the Kings of Israel’. The 
2CH.33.19	The words that he prayed are in another book. That book is called ‘What the 
2CH.33.20	Manasseh died and his servants buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon ruled instead.
2CH.33.21	Amon was 22 years old when he began to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 2 years. 
2CH.33.22	He did all the very wrong things that his father Manasseh had done. The 
2CH.33.23	But he did not make himself 
2CH.33.24	Amon's servants decided to kill him and they killed him in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	Then all the people in that country killed the men who had decided to kill King Amon. And they chose his son Josiah to be king instead. 
2CH.34.1	Josiah was 8 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 31 years. 
2CH.34.2	He did the things that gave pleasure to the 
2CH.34.3	When Josiah had been king for nearly 8 years he was still a boy. He began to 
2CH.34.4	He caused the people to pull down the 
2CH.34.5	Josiah burned the bones of their 
2CH.34.6	He went to the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon and even into Naphtali. And he did the same in all the old places round them that nobody had used for some time. 
2CH.34.7	He pulled down the 
2CH.34.8	When Josiah had been king for nearly 18 years, the country and the 
2CH.34.9	The people had given money to the 
2CH.34.10	Then they gave this money to the men who were leaders over the work on the 
2CH.34.11	They also gave money to those who worked with wood and with stones. They gave money to the builders to buy stones that were ready to use and wood. The wood was to hold the walls up and for beams. They needed those things because the kings of Judah before Josiah had destroyed the buildings of the 
2CH.34.12	Josiah was able to 
2CH.34.13	They were also over the men who carried heavy things and over all the other workers. Some 
2CH.34.14	The 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah spoke to Shaphan the writer. He said, ‘I have found the Book of the 
2CH.34.16	Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and he told the king about it. He said, ‘Your servants are doing everything that you asked them to do. 
2CH.34.17	They have taken the money that was in the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the writer told the king about it. ‘Hilkiah the 
2CH.34.19	When the king had listened to the words of the 
2CH.34.20	Then Josiah spoke to Hilkiah, Shaphan's son Ahikam, Micah's son Abdon, Shaphan the writer and Asaiah the king's servant. He told them what they must do. This is what he said to them: 
2CH.34.21	‘Go to ask the 
2CH.34.22	Hilkiah and those other men that the king had sent went to Huldah. Huldah was a lady and she was a 
2CH.34.23	She told them what the 
2CH.34.24	“The 
2CH.34.25	I will do that because they have gone away from me. They have made other gods with their hands and they have burned oils with sweet smells to them. They made me angry by all the things that they made with their hands. So I will 
2CH.34.26	Speak to the king of Judah who sent you to ask the 
2CH.34.27	‘You were sorry when you heard your God's words about this place and about its people. You made yourself 
2CH.34.28	‘So I will let you die in 
2CH.34.29	Then the king asked all the leaders in Judah and in Jerusalem to come to him. And they came. 
2CH.34.30	Then the king went to the 
2CH.34.31	The king stood there in his special place. And he promised the 
2CH.34.32	Then he caused all the people from Benjamin and all the other people in Jerusalem to promise that too. And so the people who lived in Jerusalem agreed to obey the 
2CH.34.33	Josiah took away all the 
2CH.35.1	And Josiah had a 
2CH.35.2	He caused the 
2CH.35.3	He spoke to the 
2CH.35.4	Make yourselves ready to do the work that King David and King Solomon chose for each group in each 
2CH.35.5	‘Stand in the 
2CH.35.6	Kill the young sheep for the 
2CH.35.7	Josiah gave to the 
2CH.35.8	Also, his leaders gave animals freely to the people, to the 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethanel, Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad gave animals to the 
2CH.35.10	Everything was ready for the 
2CH.35.11	The 
2CH.35.12	They put the animals for 
2CH.35.13	They cooked the animals for 
2CH.35.14	After that, the 
2CH.35.15	The singers stood where they should stand. They were 
2CH.35.16	So, they prepared everything that day to 
2CH.35.17	Some people from the country called Israel were also there. They had the 
2CH.35.18	There had not been a 
2CH.35.19	They had this 
2CH.35.20	After Josiah had done all that for the 
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent men to Josiah. They said to him, ‘King of Judah, you and I should not fight. I did not come to fight you. I came to fight my enemies. God told me that I must hurry. God is with me, so do not fight against him. If you do not fight against me, God will not kill you.’
2CH.35.22	But Josiah would not stop his attack. He did not want Neco's soldiers to know that he was Josiah. So he wore different clothes to fight against Neco. God had used Neco to speak to Josiah. But Josiah would not listen to his words. He went to fight Neco on the flat land at Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	Neco's men shot King Josiah with 
2CH.35.24	So, they took him out of that 
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah wrote sad songs about Josiah's death. Even today, all the male and female singers remember Josiah with these songs. These songs became like a 
2CH.35.26+2CH.35.27	Everything else that Josiah did is in the Book about the Kings of Israel and Judah. Everything is there from the first thing to the last thing. That includes all the good things that he did. He tried to obey everything that is in the 
2CH.36.1	Then the people in Judah chose Josiah's son, Jehoahaz to become king in Jerusalem instead.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. 
2CH.36.3	Then the king of Egypt said that Jehoahaz must not be king in Jerusalem. And he caused Judah's people to pay a lot of money to him. It was about 3400 kilos (7500 pounds) of 
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt chose Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim to be king over Judah and Jerusalem. And he changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. He did very wrong things that the 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon came and he attacked him. He tied his hands and his feet together with metal 
2CH.36.7	Also, Nebuchadnezzar took some things from the 
2CH.36.8	The other things that Jehoiakim did are in the Book about the Kings of Israel and Judah. That includes all the very wrong things that he did. It includes all the things that God did not like about him. And his son Jehoiachin ruled instead.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was 8 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for three months and 10 days. He did very wrong things that the 
2CH.36.10	In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent his soldiers to fetch Jehoiachin and they brought him to Babylon. Also, he brought the valuable things from the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he started to rule. And he ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. 
2CH.36.12	He did very wrong things that the 
2CH.36.13	King Nebuchadnezzar had caused Zedekiah to promise in God's name that he would obey Nebuchadnezzar. But he decided not to obey Nebuchadnezzar. And he became 
2CH.36.14	Also, all the leaders of the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	But they said that the men with God's messages were silly. And they thought that God's words were not important. They said that his 
2CH.36.17	So, the 
2CH.36.18	And he took all the things that were still in God's house. He took all the big things and he took all the small things too. He took the valuable things from the house of the 
2CH.36.19	Nebuchadnezzar's men burned the house of God and they broke down the wall round Jerusalem. They burned all the king's houses in Jerusalem and they destroyed all the valuable things in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.20	Nebuchadnezzar took all the people that he had not killed to Babylon. They became slaves for him and for his sons. They were slaves until the king of Persia began to rule everywhere. 
2CH.36.21	So, what the 
2CH.36.22	But Cyrus, king of Persia, began to rule Babylon. And during his first year as king, the 
2CH.36.23	‘Cyrus, king of Persia says, “The 
EZR.1.1	Cyrus, king of Persia had just begun to rule Babylon. He decided to make a new 
EZR.1.2	This is what Cyrus, the king of Persia said:
EZR.1.2	‘The 
EZR.1.3	Any of Israel's people who live in my land can return to Jerusalem. They must build a 
EZR.1.4	Many 
EZR.1.5	Then the leaders of Judah and Benjamin's families and the 
EZR.1.6	All the people who lived near them gave them animals, gold, 
EZR.1.7	Then King Cyrus remembered the things that Nebuchadnezzar had taken away from the 
EZR.1.8	Mithredath kept Cyrus's valuable things safe. So Cyrus asked him to fetch the things that belonged to Jerusalem's 
EZR.1.9	They counted the things and they made a list:
EZR.1.9	30 gold plates.
EZR.1.9	1000 
EZR.1.9	29 
EZR.1.10	30 gold deep dishes.
EZR.1.10	410 
EZR.1.10	1000 other things.
EZR.1.11	All the things made from gold and

EZR.2.61	And they included families of the 
EZR.2.61	This Barzillai had married one of Barzillai's daughters and he took Barzillai's name. These daughters had lived in Gilead.
EZR.2.62	All these looked to see if their names were written as

EZR.2.68	The most important men in some families came to the 
EZR.2.69	They gave money to build the 
EZR.2.70	The 
EZR.3.1	When all the people were living in their towns, they met together in Jerusalem. It was the 7th month. 
EZR.3.2	The 
EZR.3.3	They were afraid of the other people who lived round them. But they built the 
EZR.3.4	Then they had the 
EZR.3.5	They burnt 
EZR.3.6	They began to 
EZR.3.7	The leaders gave money to men who could work with stone and wood. They sent food and drink and oil to the people in Tyre and Sidon. This was to pay for beams of wood from a tree called cedar. They would bring the wood on the sea. It would come from Lebanon's country to Joppa. Cyrus, king of Persia, had asked Lebanon's people to do this.
EZR.3.8	The 
EZR.3.9	These are their names:
EZR.3.9	Jeshua and his sons and brothers.
EZR.3.9	Kadmiel and his sons. (They were 
EZR.3.9	Henadad's sons and their sons and brothers.
EZR.3.9	All of them were 
EZR.3.10	The men who were building the 
EZR.3.11	They thanked and 
EZR.3.11	And all the people shouted. ‘
EZR.3.12	But many of the older 
EZR.3.13	The shouts and the noise of people who were weeping were very loud. So nobody knew if they were laughing or crying. People far away could hear the noise.
EZR.4.1	The enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the 
EZR.4.2	Then the enemies went to speak to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders. ‘Let us help you to build’, they said. ‘We want to 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and Israel's family heads said, ‘No. You cannot help us to build the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people round them tried to make the 
EZR.4.5	They paid men to work against them and to say bad things about the building. They did this all the time that Cyrus was king of Persia. They went on until Darius became king.
EZR.4.6	They wrote to Xerxes when he became king. They said that the people of Judah and Jerusalem were doing a wrong thing.
EZR.4.7	Later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and their friends wrote a letter to Artaxerxes, king of Persia. They wrote in the Aramaic language. 
EZR.4.8	Rehum, the most important officer and Shimshai wrote this letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes. This is what it said.
EZR.4.9	Rehum, your officer and Shimshai, his helper and many other men are writing to you. They are 
EZR.4.10	We include other people who live in or near the cities in Samaria. The great King Ashurbanipal had sent those people there. Some came from the other side of the River Euphrates. 
EZR.4.11	This is the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes:
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes,
EZR.4.11	from your servants in the land across the Euphrates.
EZR.4.12	The king should know what the 
EZR.4.13	And you should know this. If they build this city and its walls, they will not pay any more money to you. They will take away some of your people's money. 
EZR.4.14	We are your servants. We do not want you to lose 
EZR.4.15	If you look in letters to kings before you, you will find much about this city. Jerusalem's people always did what they chose. And the letters will show you that. For many years Jerusalem's people did not obey those with authority. They did not listen to the kings or their officers. That is why the soldiers from Babylon destroyed the city. 
EZR.4.16	We are telling the king that nobody should let these people build up this city and its walls. If they do, you will have no authority on this side of the Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	This is the king's reply:
EZR.4.17	‘To Rehum my officer, Shimshai his helper and all their friends in Samaria and across the River Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	I thank you for your news.
EZR.4.18	They have translated the letter that you sent into my language. Then they read it to me. 
EZR.4.19	I caused them to look in the old letters and they told us about Jerusalem's people. They have always caused trouble to their rulers. They never obeyed their rulers. 
EZR.4.20	In past days the kings of Jerusalem were powerful. They ruled all the land on their side of the Euphrates. The people there gave money and other things to them because their kings had authority. 
EZR.4.21	Now you must cause them to stop their work. They must not build the city again until I let them. 
EZR.4.22	You must be careful to do this. We cannot let them make my authority smaller.’
EZR.4.23	Rehum, Shimshai and their friends took the king's letter to the 
EZR.4.24	So the people did no work on God's house in Jerusalem. The work stopped until Darius, Persia's king, had ruled over them for more than one year.
EZR.5.1	Haggai and Zechariah, Iddo's 
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's son, and Jeshua, Jozadak's son, started again to build the 
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai was the king's ruler of all the land across the River Euphrates. He and Shethar-Bozenai and their friends went to ask them what they were doing. They said, ‘Who gave you the authority to start building this 
EZR.5.4	And they asked, ‘What are the names of the men who are building this place?’ 
EZR.5.5	But God was watching over the 
EZR.5.6	The ruler Tattenai, Shethar-Bozenai and their friends wrote to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	This is what they said:
EZR.5.7	We hope that you, King Darius, are well and happy.
EZR.5.8	We went to Judah to visit the 
EZR.5.9	We spoke to them and we asked, ‘Who gave authority to you to do this and to build up this 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names. Then we could give the names of their leaders to you.
EZR.5.11	This is the answer that they gave to us:
EZR.5.11	‘We are servants of the God of 
EZR.5.12	But our 
EZR.5.13	But Cyrus, king of Babylon said that we must build the house of our God again. He said this in the first year that he was king. 
EZR.5.14	And he even gave us the gold and 
EZR.5.14	Then King Cyrus gave the valuable things to Sheshbazzar. He had given authority to this man over Jerusalem and the places round it. 
EZR.5.15	He said to Sheshbazzar, “Take these things and put them in the 
EZR.5.16	So this Sheshbazzar came and he built the 
EZR.5.17	If the king should choose, he may look in the letters in his store. It is there in Babylon. King Cyrus did say that we must build up God's 
EZR.6.1	King Darius asked his servants to look in his Babylon store. That was where he kept all his valuable things. 
EZR.6.2	They found a 
EZR.6.2	‘Remember:
EZR.6.3	King Cyrus told the 
EZR.6.3	“They must build their 
EZR.6.4	On this they must build a wall from big stones, 3 stones high. On this they must build a wall made out of wood. Money from my store will pay for it. 
EZR.6.5	And we will give their 
EZR.6.6	So you, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and your officers must stay away from them. 
EZR.6.7	You must not stop them from building God's 
EZR.6.8	Now I will tell you what you must do for these leaders. You must pay for everything that they need with the king's money. This money is from the people who live across the Euphrates. Then the work will not stop. 
EZR.6.9	Be sure to give each day to the 
EZR.6.10	Then their 
EZR.6.11	Nobody can change any of these rules that I have given to you. If anyone does not obey, men must pull a beam out of his house. They must lift him and push the beam through his body. They must destroy his house because he has not obeyed me. 
EZR.6.12	God, has caused his name to live in his 
EZR.6.13	Tattenai, ruler of the land across the Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and their friends heard this 
EZR.6.14	So the leaders of the 
EZR.6.15	They finished building it on the 3rd day of the month Adar. King Darius had then been king for 6 years.
EZR.6.16	Then the 
EZR.6.17	At this time they 
EZR.6.18	They caused the groups of 
EZR.6.19	On the 14th day of the first month, the people had another party. This was the 
EZR.6.20	The 
EZR.6.21	So all the people who had returned from Babylon ate the 
EZR.6.22	And they all remembered the 
EZR.7.1	After these things, Ezra came up from Babylon while Artaxerxes was king of Persia. This is the list of Ezra's 
EZR.7.2	Hilkiah was the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub. 
EZR.7.3	Ahitub was the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth. 
EZR.7.4	Meraioth was the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki. 
EZR.7.5	Bukki was the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar. And Eleazar was a son of Aaron, the most important 
EZR.7.6	This Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher who knew the 
EZR.7.7	Some other 
EZR.7.8	Ezra came to Jerusalem in the 5th month of Artaxerxes' 7th year. 
EZR.7.9	He left Babylon on the first day of the first month. And he came to Jerusalem on the first day of the 5th month. God had made his journey easy. 
EZR.7.10	He did this because Ezra had studied God's 
EZR.7.11	This is a copy of the letter that Artaxerxes had given to Ezra, the 
EZR.7.12	From Artaxerxes, king of kings,
EZR.7.12	to Ezra the 
EZR.7.13	Many 
EZR.7.14	The king and his 7 important officers are sending you there. You must ask whether the people in Judah and Jerusalem are obeying their God's 
EZR.7.15	And I and my officers have given gold and 
EZR.7.16	And take the gold and 
EZR.7.17	You must buy male cows and old and young male sheep with this money. Also buy drink and 
EZR.7.18	You and all the other 
EZR.7.19	You must take all the things that you use for 
EZR.7.20	Perhaps you may need other things for 
EZR.7.21	This is what I, King Artaxerxes, will do. I will speak to the rulers of the countries across the River Euphrates. They must help you. Their men keep my money. They must give Ezra anything that he asks for. He is a 
EZR.7.22	You should not give more than this to him:
EZR.7.22	3400 kilos (3.3 tons) of 
EZR.7.22	22,000 litres (5800 US gallons) of 
EZR.7.22	2200 litres (580 US gallons) of 
EZR.7.22	2200 litres of oil
EZR.7.22	all the salt that he wants.
EZR.7.23	Be careful to give to Ezra everything that the God of 
EZR.7.24	You must not take money for any purpose from men who work in this house of God. You have no authority to do this. These men include 
EZR.7.25	Your God has helped you to understand things, Ezra. He will show to you which men to choose. They will 
EZR.7.26	You must 
EZR.7.27	This is how the king wants to give 
EZR.7.28	And God has been kind to me in front of the king and his powerful friends and officers. The 
EZR.8.1	These are the leaders and other men in their families who came with me from Babylon. We came during the time that Artaxerxes was king.
EZR.8.2	Gershom, Phinehas's

EZR.8.14	Uthai and Zaccur with 70 men, Bigvai's 
EZR.8.15	I caused all the people to come together at the river that goes to Ahava. We stayed there during 3 days. I looked at the people and 
EZR.8.16	So I asked them to send Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah and Elnathan. And I asked for Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam. They were all leaders. I also asked for Joiarib and Elnathan. They were men who had learnt much. 
EZR.8.17	And I sent them all to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. Iddo and his family were servants in the 
EZR.8.18	This was what God wanted. So they brought Sherebiah to us. He was a man who could do the work well. He was from Mahli's family. Levi was a son of Israel, and Mahli was Levi's son. Sherebiah came with his sons and brothers. Together they were 18 men. 
EZR.8.19	Hashabiah came and Jeshaiah, a 
EZR.8.20	They also brought 220 
EZR.8.21	We were all by the River Ahava. I said that the people should not eat any food. This was to show God that we needed his help. Then we asked him to keep us safe on the journey with our children and all our things. 
EZR.8.22	I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers who walked. And I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers who rode on horses. They could have kept us safe from our enemies. But we had spoken to the king. We had said, ‘Our God is good. He keeps safe those who obey him. But he is very angry with those who turn away from him. And he works against them.’ 
EZR.8.23	So we ate no food and we prayed to our God about this. And he listened to us.
EZR.8.24	I chose 12 of the most important 
EZR.8.25	I weighed in front of them many valuable things. These things included the 
EZR.8.26	I weighed about 20,000 kilos (20 tons) of 
EZR.8.27	20 deep dishes of gold that weighed about 8.5 kilos (19 pounds). I also gave to them 2 beautiful things that someone had made from metal. But those things were as valuable as gold.
EZR.8.28	Then I spoke to them. I said, ‘You people and these things all belong to the 
EZR.8.29	You must be careful to keep them safe until you reach Jerusalem. There in the rooms in the 
EZR.8.30	Then they gave the 
EZR.8.31	We left the River Ahava on the 12th day of the first month. We left to go to Jerusalem. Our God kept us safe on the journey. No enemies robbed us or hurt us. 
EZR.8.32	So we arrived in Jerusalem. And we rested there during 3 days.
EZR.8.33	We went into God's house on the 4th day. Then we weighed out the 
EZR.8.34	They weighed and counted everything. They wrote it all in a list.
EZR.8.35	All the people who had returned from Babylon 
EZR.8.36	They also gave the king's letters to his officers. And they gave them to those who ruled the land across the Euphrates. Then those in authority helped the people and they gave things to the house of God.
EZR.9.1	When we had done all these things, the leaders came to see me. They said, ‘The 
EZR.9.2	They and their sons have married some of the foreign men's daughters. They have mixed their blood with that of other peoples. The leaders of our 
EZR.9.3	I tore my shirt and coat when I heard this. I pulled out hair from my head and my beard. I sat down and I was angry and ashamed. 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who was afraid because of the words of the God of Israel came round me. They were afraid because the 
EZR.9.5	Then I stood up with my torn shirt and coat. I went on my knees at the evening 
EZR.9.6	I said,
EZR.9.6	‘My God, I am too ashamed to look up at you. Our 
EZR.9.7	We have done wrong things from the first days of our 
EZR.9.8	But now the 
EZR.9.9	We are still slaves, but our God has not left us alone. He has caused the kings of Persia to be kind to us. They have let us live and they have let us build up the house of our God. We have mended it. And now he keeps us safe in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	We can say nothing to you, our God because we have not obeyed your rules. 
EZR.9.11	You gave them to us by your servants, the 
EZR.9.12	You must not let your daughters marry their sons. And you must not let your sons marry their daughters. Do not ever make a strong promise to be their friends. Then you will be strong and you will have good food to eat. Your children will live in the same country after you. It will always belong to your families.”
EZR.9.13	You have 
EZR.9.14	We do not want to marry people who do those very bad things. We must obey you, or you will be angry with us. You might kill all of us, and none of us would still be here. 
EZR.9.15	You do only what is good, 
EZR.9.15	We come to you. We are sorry and ashamed of the wrong things that we have done. Not one person among us is 
EZR.10.1	A big crowd of 
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah spoke to him. He was Jehiel's son, a 
EZR.10.3	We will make a promise to him. We will send away these women and their children. This is what you, Ezra, are telling us to do. And the people who want to obey God's 
EZR.10.4	Get up! Now you must help us to do what is right. We will help you, so you must not be afraid.’
EZR.10.5	So Ezra got up. He caused the leaders of the 
EZR.10.6	And Ezra went from the front of God's house to Jehohanan's room. Jehohanan was Eliashib's son. Ezra was still very sad because the people had not been 
EZR.10.7	They wrote a message and they sent it to all the people in Judah and Jerusalem. It said that they must all come to Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	If they did not arrive in 3 days, they would lose everything. The leaders and officers had decided to say this. And they would push out anyone who did not obey the message. They would send them out of Israel.
EZR.10.9	All the men from Judah and Benjamin reached Jerusalem in 3 days. All the people sat in front of God's house on the 20th day of the 9th month. They were very sad because they had made God angry. And the rain was bad. 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the 
EZR.10.11	Now you must tell the 
EZR.10.12	All the people spoke with a loud voice. ‘You are right’, they said. ‘We must do as you say. 
EZR.10.13	But we are many people and we cannot stand in the rain. And we shall need more than two days to do this thing. Many of us have 
EZR.10.14	Our officers should do this for us. In every town they must make a special time for men to visit the leaders and the 
EZR.10.15	Only 4 men did not agree with this. They were Jonathan, Asahel's son, Jahzeiah, Tikvah's son, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the 
EZR.10.16	So the 
EZR.10.17	And they finished on the first day of the first month.

NEH.1.1	These are the words of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah. It was the month Kislev. This was when King Artaxerxes had ruled for 20 years. I was in the king's house in the city called Susa. 
NEH.1.2	Hanani, my brother and some men arrived. They came from Judah. I asked them for news of the 
NEH.1.3	They told me, ‘The 
NEH.1.4	After they told me this, I sat down. And I cried. During many days, I was very sad. I did not eat or drink. I prayed to God.
NEH.1.5	I prayed, ‘Oh 
NEH.1.6	Listen to my words. I am your servant. I am praying to you. I pray in the day and in the night. I am praying on behalf of the people of Israel. They are your servants. We have all done wrong things. I and my

NEH.2.1	It was the month of Nisan. King Artaxerxes had ruled Babylon for 20 years. I brought the king's

NEH.2.3	I replied, ‘Let the king live always! I am sad because they have destroyed my 
NEH.2.4	The king asked me, ‘What do you want?’ So I prayed to God. 
NEH.2.5	Then I replied to the king, ‘If it gives the king pleasure, might he send me there? Then if he is happy with his servant Nehemiah, I can build the city again. They buried my 
NEH.2.6	The king sat with the queen next to him. The king asked me, ‘How long will you be away? When will you return?’ The king was happy to let me go to Judah. I told him when I would leave. 
NEH.2.7	I said to the king, ‘If the king likes the idea, give me some letters. The letters are for your government officers of Trans-Euphrates. The officers will keep me safe on the journey to Judah. 
NEH.2.8	Let me have a letter to give to Asaph. He has authority for the king's forest. He will give me wood from the trees to make beams. The beams are for the gates of the city, near the 
NEH.2.9	I went to Trans-Euphrates. I gave the government officers the letter. The king sent soldiers with me. Some rode horses and some walked. 
NEH.2.10	Sanballat and Tobiah were not happy because I came to help the 
NEH.2.11	I went to Jerusalem. I was in Jerusalem for three days. After three days 
NEH.2.12	I went out at night. A few men came with me. I did not tell anyone the idea that God had put in my mind. I rode on a horse. We did not take any other horses. 
NEH.2.13	I went through the Valley Gate to the Jackal Well and the 
NEH.2.14	I went to the 
NEH.2.15	So I went to the valley to look at the wall. It was dark. I returned past the Valley Gate. 
NEH.2.16	The officers did not know what I had done. I had not said anything to the officers or 
NEH.2.17	I spoke to the 
NEH.2.18	I told the people how God had helped me. God had put the idea in the king's mind to let me come to Jerusalem. I told them what the king had said to me. The people said, ‘We will start to build!’ And they began the good work. 
NEH.2.19	But Sanballat, Tobiah and Geshem tried to make us seem like fools. They said, ‘What are you doing? Are you going against the king?’ 
NEH.2.20	I replied, ‘God will make us strong to finish this work. We are God's servants. We will start to build. But you have no place in Jerusalem.’
NEH.3.1	Eliashib, the

NEH.4.1	Sanballat knew that the 
NEH.4.2	Sanballat's officers and Samaria's army were with him. He said, ‘Those 
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the 
NEH.4.4	I prayed, ‘Hear us, our God. Our enemies are against us. Make them seem like fools. Let their enemies take them as slaves. And let their enemies take their land. 
NEH.4.5	Do not forget their 
NEH.4.6	The 
NEH.4.7	But Sanballat and Tobiah were very angry. They had heard that the 
NEH.4.8	They met together. They decided how to fight against the 
NEH.4.9	But we, the 
NEH.4.10	While this was happening, the people in Judah said, ‘The workers are becoming weak. There are too many small pieces of stone. We cannot build the city. The stones are in the places where we want to build.’ 
NEH.4.11	Our enemies said, ‘Before the 
NEH.4.12	The 
NEH.4.13	So I (Nehemiah) put some men behind the lowest part of the wall. They had 
NEH.4.14	I looked at everything. I said to the officers and the people, ‘Do not be afraid of our enemies. Remember that God is great and powerful. Fight on behalf of your brothers. Fight on behalf of your sons and daughters. Fight on behalf of your wives. Fight on behalf of your homes.’ 
NEH.4.15	We knew what our enemies had decided to do. They discovered this. Then they knew that God had stopped them. So each of us went back to our work on the wall.
NEH.4.16	After that day, half of my men carried 
NEH.4.17	Those who carried building materials kept one hand on their 
NEH.4.18	Every man who built the wall carried his 
NEH.4.19	I said to all the people, ‘Because the wall is long, we are not near each other. 
NEH.4.20	When you hear the sound of the 
NEH.4.21	We continued to work on the wall. Half of the men carried 
NEH.4.22	I spoke to the 
NEH.4.23	Neither I nor my brothers took our clothes off. Nor did my men or the 
NEH.5.1	Some men and their wives were not happy with some other 
NEH.5.2	They said, ‘We have many sons and daughters. But we have no food.’ 
NEH.5.3	Other people said, ‘We have no money for food. We have to sell our fields, vineyards and homes for food to stay alive.’ 
NEH.5.4	Other people said, ‘We have no money to pay our debts to the king. 
NEH.5.5	We have had to sell our sons and daughters as slaves. Other people buy them because we have no money. Our sons and daughters are 
NEH.5.6	When I knew about this, I was very angry. 
NEH.5.7	I thought about what these 
NEH.5.8	I said, ‘We have bought back those 
NEH.5.9	I said, ‘You are doing a very wrong thing. You should be afraid that our enemies will have no

NEH.5.11	Please give the fields, 
NEH.5.12	The rich 
NEH.5.13	I moved my clothes while I was still wearing them. While I did this, I said, ‘Like this, God should move every man out of his house if he does not obey this promise. God should move him away from everything that is his. People should take him away and destroy all his things.’ Everyone said, ‘
NEH.5.14	During all the time that I had authority in Judah, I did not eat the food of those in authority. I did this from the 20th to the 32nd year of King Artaxerxes. For 12 years I did not eat this food. Nor did my brothers. 
NEH.5.15	Those in authority before I came took 40 pieces of 
NEH.5.16	I worked together with my men when we built the wall. I did not take any land. 
NEH.5.17	150 
NEH.5.18	Every day, my servants cooked one ox, 6 sheep and some birds for us to eat. Every 10 days I bought much 
NEH.5.19	‘Please God, remember me. And do good things to me because of what I have done on behalf of the 
NEH.6.1	We had finished building the wall. There were no holes in it, but the doors were not in the gates. Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem and all our enemies knew that we had finished building the wall. (Geshem came from Arabia.) 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent this message to me, ‘Let us meet together in a village on the Ono flat land.’ I knew that they wanted to hurt me. 
NEH.6.3	I sent a man with my reply, ‘I am too busy to meet you. I will not stop this important work to meet you.’ 
NEH.6.4	They sent me the same message 4 times. My reply to each was the same. 
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his officer to me. He carried a letter that was open. Any person could read this letter. 
NEH.6.6	This is what the letter said, ‘They are telling the people that you (Nehemiah) and the 
NEH.6.7	You have told 
NEH.6.8	I sent this reply, ‘What you say is not true. You are saying things that are your own ideas.’
NEH.6.9	Our enemies wanted to frighten us. They thought, ‘The 
NEH.6.10	One day I went to Shemaiah's house. He is the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel. He would not go out of his house. He said to me, ‘Meet me in the 
NEH.6.11	But I said, ‘I will not run away. I will not go into the 
NEH.6.12	Then I knew that my enemies had sent Shemaiah. Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to say this to me. 
NEH.6.13	They wanted to frighten me so that I would hide in the 
NEH.6.14	‘Please God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat. Remember what they have done. Remember Noadiah the 
NEH.6.15	We finished the wall on the 25th of Elul. It had taken 52 days to build the city wall again. 
NEH.6.16	When our enemies knew this, they were afraid. All the people who lived near Jerusalem were afraid. They knew that God had helped the 
NEH.6.17	The rich men of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah. Tobiah also sent many replies. 
NEH.6.18	Many people in Judah had promised to obey Tobiah. That was because his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam. He had helped to repair the city wall. And his wife was Shecaniah's daughter. Shecaniah was Arah's son. 
NEH.6.19	The men of Judah told me often about the good things that Tobiah had done. Then they told Tobiah everything that I said. And Tobiah sent letters to people to cause trouble for me.
NEH.7.1	When we had built the wall I put the doors in their place. We chose men to watch at the gates (these men are called gatekeepers), singers and 
NEH.7.2	I gave my brother Hanani authority over Jerusalem. I also gave authority over the strongest building to Hananiah. He was a good man. He gave God more 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, ‘Do not open the city gates until the sun is high in the sky. Lock the gates while the 
NEH.7.4	Jerusalem city was large, but not many people lived in it. We had not yet built the houses completely.
NEH.7.5	God put an idea in my mind. All the people who returned to Jerusalem must write down their

NEH.13.2	This was because they had not given the 
NEH.13.3	When the 
NEH.13.4	Before this happened, I had given to Eliashib the 
NEH.13.5	He let Tobiah use a large room in the house of God. The purpose of the room was to store the 
NEH.13.6	But when this happened, I (Nehemiah) was not in Jerusalem. In the 32nd year of Artaxerxes, King of Babylon, I had returned to the king. After some time had passed, I asked the king 
NEH.13.7	to let me return to Jerusalem. There I heard about the bad thing that Eliashib had done. He had given Tobiah, who was not a

NEH.13.16	Men from Tyre, who lived in Jerusalem, sold fish and other things on the 
NEH.13.17	I was angry with the leaders of Judah. I said, ‘You are doing a thing that is wrong. It is the 
NEH.13.18	Your 
NEH.13.19	I said to the 
NEH.13.20	Once or twice some people who wanted to sell things stayed outside Jerusalem all night. 
NEH.13.21	I said to them, ‘You should not stay outside the wall all night. If you do this again, I will hurt you.’ After this, they did not come to Jerusalem on the

NEH.13.23	Also at that time, men from Judah had married foreign women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of another country. They did not know how to speak the language of Judah. 
NEH.13.25	I was angry and I said angry words to them. I hit some of them. I pulled out the hair of some of these men. I made them make a promise in God's name. I said, ‘You must not let your daughters marry the sons of foreign people. You must not let your sons marry the daughters of foreign people.

EST.1.15	The king asked them, ‘What must I do with Queen Vashti? The 
EST.1.16	In front of the king and all the important men, Memucan (one of the men) replied, ‘The queen has not only done something wrong to you. She has done something wrong to all the important men in your 
EST.1.17	When other wives hear about this, they will not obey their own husbands. All the women in the 
EST.1.18	So now, the wives of the king's officers will not obey their husbands. This will make their husbands angry.
EST.1.19	If it makes the king happy, we suggest this: The king should make a 
EST.1.20	When people know the 
EST.1.21	The king and his officers liked this idea. And so they did as Memucan said. 
EST.1.22	Men on horses took the 
EST.2.1	Some time after that happened, King Xerxes was not feeling so angry. He thought about Vashti. And he thought about the 
EST.2.2	Some of the king's servants said, ‘We think that the king should ask his servants to look for beautiful young women for him. 
EST.2.3	The king could choose officers from every part of his 
EST.2.4	The young woman who makes the king happy will be queen. She will be queen as Vashti was.’ King Xerxes agreed with the servants. And he did everything that the servants said.
EST.2.5	In the city called Susa there was a 
EST.2.6	Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had sent Kish (with other 
EST.2.7	Mordecai had a young cousin called Hadassah. (She was also called Esther.) She lived in his house. Esther's mother and father were dead. Esther was beautiful. Mordecai called Esther his daughter. 
EST.2.8	Esther was with the young women that the officers brought to the city called Susa. The servants brought them to the 
EST.2.9	Hegai liked Esther. He gave her 
EST.2.10	Mordecai said to Esther, ‘Do not tell anyone that you are a

EST.2.12	Before a young woman went to be with the king she had to have 
EST.2.13	Then she went to be with the king. And she could take whatever she wanted with her then. 
EST.2.14	She would go to be with the king in the evening. She would stay with him during that night. In the morning, she went to the 
EST.2.15	One evening, it was Esther's time to go to the king. And she asked for the things that Hegai had suggested. Everyone who saw Esther liked her. 
EST.2.16	Esther went to King Xerxes in the 10th month. That is the month Tebeth. King Xerxes had ruled for nearly 7 years. 
EST.2.17	The king loved Esther more than he loved any of the other women. He was nice to her because he liked her. He put the 
EST.2.18	The king gave a great 
EST.2.19	The officers brought the young women together again. At this time, Mordecai sat at the King's Gate.
EST.2.20	Esther had not told the king that she was a 
EST.2.21	Mordecai was sitting at the King's Gate. At that time, Bigthana and Teresh, who were two of the king's officers, became angry. And they wanted to kill the king. 
EST.2.22	Mordecai heard about this. So he told Queen Esther that the officers wanted to kill the king. Queen Esther told the king. She said that Mordecai had discovered this. 
EST.2.23	The king discovered that this was true. He told men that they must kill these officers. They must hang them from 
EST.3.1	Some time after that happened, King Xerxes gave a certain officer a lot of authority. The officer was called Haman. Only King Xerxes had more authority in the 
EST.3.2	The king said that everyone must bend his body down to Haman to show 
EST.3.3	The officers at the King's Gate said to Mordecai, ‘You are not obeying the king's

EST.3.5	Haman saw that Mordecai would not bend his body down. So, he was very angry. 
EST.3.6	Haman discovered that Mordecai was a

EST.3.12	Haman asked the king's writers to come to him. This was on the 13th day of the 1st month. The writers wrote the 
EST.3.13	Men delivered the 
EST.3.14	Haman caused people to make copies of the 
EST.3.15	King Xerxes told his officers that they must send the

EST.4.2	He stopped at the King's Gate. Nobody who had dressed in 
EST.4.3	All through the 
EST.4.4	Esther's female servants and 
EST.4.5	Hathach was one of the king's 
EST.4.6	Hathach went to Mordecai. Mordecai was near the King's Gate. He was waiting outside. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told Hathach what happened with Haman. King Xerxes had said that people must kill all the 
EST.4.8	Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the king's 
EST.4.9	Hathach returned to the 
EST.4.10	Esther sent Hathach to tell Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	‘A person can only see the king if the king asks for him or her by name. Everyone knows that. There is only one 
EST.4.12	Then Hathach told Mordecai what Esther had said. 
EST.4.13	Mordecai sent back this answer. ‘Do not think that you, in the king's 
EST.4.14	If you do not speak on behalf of the 
EST.4.15	Esther sent this answer to Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	‘Tell all the 
EST.4.17	Mordecai did as Esther had asked him.
EST.5.1	After three days, Esther put on her special clothes and she went to King Xerxes. The king was sitting on his special king's seat. Esther stood in the room that was in front of his special seat. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Esther, he was happy. He held out his gold 
EST.5.3	The king asked, ‘What do you want, Queen Esther? I will give to you whatever you want. Even if it is half my

EST.5.5	The king said to his servants, ‘Bring Haman quickly. Then we can do what Esther wants.’ The king and Haman went to the meal that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	When they were drinking 
EST.5.7	She replied, ‘This is what I want. 
EST.5.8	I hope that the king is happy with me. And perhaps the king wants to give me what I want. And this is what I want: I would like the king and Haman to come again tomorrow. Come to a 
EST.5.9	When Haman went from Queen Esther's 
EST.5.10	Haman did not say anything to Mordecai. He went home. Then he asked his friends and Zeresh his wife to come to him.
EST.5.11	Haman told them how rich he was. He told his friends how many sons he had. And he told them how powerful he was. He told his friends and his wife that he was more powerful than any other man in the 
EST.5.12	Haman told his friends and his wife about the 
EST.5.13	But all these things do not make me happy when I see the 
EST.5.14	Haman's wife and his friends said to him, ‘Ask some men to build a 
EST.5.14	What they had suggested made Haman happy. So he told his servants that they must build the 
EST.6.1	That night the king could not sleep. He asked a servant to bring the Book of Years. And he asked the servant to read the book to him. 
EST.6.2	The Book of Years included the report of how two officers wanted to kill the king. And how Mordecai had discovered this and he had told Queen Esther. The servant read this report to the king. 
EST.6.3	The king asked his servant, ‘When Mordecai saved me, what did I do for him?’ The servant told the king that Mordecai did not receive anything.
EST.6.4	The king said, ‘Who is in the 
EST.6.5	The servants told the king that Haman was in the 
EST.6.6	Haman came to the king. The king asked him, ‘What should I do for a man that I want to make very important?’ Haman thought to himself, ‘I am sure that I am that man. I am sure that the king wants to make me very important.’ 
EST.6.7	So Haman replied to the king. ‘You should do this for the man that you want to make very important: 
EST.6.8	Your servants should bring the clothes that the king wears. They should bring the king's horse. It should have a 
EST.6.9	Tell your servants that they must give the clothes and the horse to one of your officers. It should be the officer that you 
EST.6.10	The king said, ‘Go quickly! Get the clothes and the horse. Do as you have suggested for Mordecai the 
EST.6.11	So Haman dressed Mordecai in the king's clothes. And he led Mordecai on the king's horse from the beginning to the end of the city. Haman shouted, ‘This is the man that the king wants to make very important. See what the king does for a man like that!’
EST.6.12	After this, Mordecai returned to the King's Gate. But Haman hurried home. He covered his face because he was ashamed and angry. He was ashamed and angry about what had happened. 
EST.6.13	He told his wife and friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wife, Zeresh, and his friends who knew the 
EST.6.14	While they were speaking, the king's 
EST.7.1	King Xerxes and Haman went to the 
EST.7.2	While they were drinking 
EST.7.3	Queen Esther replied, ‘I hope that you are happy with me. And perhaps you want to give me what I ask. If you do, please let me live. And let my people live. That is what I want. 
EST.7.4	Someone has sold me and my people so that we will die. If he had sold us as male and female slaves, I would not have caused trouble for the king.’ 
EST.7.5	Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, ‘Who is he? Where is the man who would do this?’ 
EST.7.6	Esther replied, ‘The man who wants to kill us is this very bad man Haman!’ Then Haman was very afraid. 
EST.7.7	The king was very angry. He left his 
EST.7.8	Just when the king returned, Haman threw himself down. He threw himself down on the bed that Queen Esther was lying on. He asked her to save him. The king shouted, ‘You even attack the queen when she is with me in the 
EST.7.9	Harbona, one of the king's 
EST.7.10	So a servant hung Haman on the 
EST.8.1	That day, King Xerxes gave Queen Esther all of Haman's things. Mordecai came in front of the king. Esther had told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. 
EST.8.2	The king had taken back his

EST.8.5	Esther said to the king, ‘I hope that I make the king happy. And perhaps the king thinks that this is the right thing to do: If he does, the king should do this. Tell your people that they must not kill all the 
EST.8.6	If they do kill them, I will have to see the death of all my people.’

EST.8.12	The 
EST.8.13	A copy of the 
EST.8.14	The king told his officers that they must travel quickly on their horses. The king's officers also told everybody about the

EST.8.17	In all the 
EST.9.1	It was the 13th day of the 12th month, the month called

EST.9.4	Everyone knew that Mordecai had great authority in the 
EST.9.5	So the 
EST.9.6	In the city (Susa), the 
EST.9.7	They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha. 
EST.9.10	Those men were the 10 sons of Haman, who wanted to kill the 
EST.9.11	Officers told the king how many people the 
EST.9.12	Then the king said to Queen Esther, ‘In the city (Susa) the 
EST.9.13	Esther replied, ‘If it makes the king happy, please let the

EST.9.17	They did that on the 13th day of

EST.9.19	So 
EST.9.20	Mordecai recorded what had happened. He sent letters to all the 
EST.9.21+EST.9.22	He told them that they should have a 
EST.9.23	So the 
EST.9.24	They remembered how Haman from Agag's 
EST.9.25	They remembered how Esther went to the king. And they remembered that the king wrote another 
EST.9.26	So the 
EST.9.27	The 
EST.9.28	Every 
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai wrote a second letter. In this letter they gave their authority to the 
EST.9.30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the 
EST.9.31	But it also told the

EST.10.1	King Xerxes caused everyone to pay

JOB.1.1	Many years ago, a man lived in a place called Uz. His name was Job and he was a very good man. He was fair to everybody and he did the right things. He was afraid to make God angry. And he refused to do wrong things. 
JOB.1.2	Job had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	He had 7000 sheep and 3000 
JOB.1.4	Each year, Job's sons had birthday parties in their homes. They had lots to eat and lots to drink. And they always asked their three sisters to come. 
JOB.1.5	After each party, Job would ask his children to visit him. He thought that they might have done wrong things. Or perhaps they had had wrong thoughts about God. So he would get up early the next morning and 
JOB.1.6	One day, the 
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.9	‘He may be afraid to make you angry and he may obey you’,
JOB.1.10	You do not let any bad things happen to him. So he knows that he will be safe. You do this for all his family. You make sure that all his things are safe. You have helped his business so that he has become very rich. He has many sheep and lots of cows. 
JOB.1.11	But take away the things that he has. Then he will certainly let you know that he is 
JOB.1.12	So the 
JOB.1.13	Job's sons and daughters were at a party in the home of his oldest son. 
JOB.1.14	A servant rushed up to Job. He told him about things that had just happened. This is what the servant told Job. ‘We were using your 
JOB.1.15	Some bad men from the south came and they attacked us. They took the 
JOB.1.16	That servant was still speaking, when a second servant ran up to Job. He said, ‘God has sent a fire that has killed your sheep and all your servants except me. And I have come to tell you what has happened.’
JOB.1.17	Before that servant had finished speaking, a third servant ran up to Job. He said, ‘Bad men from the north have attacked your 
JOB.1.18	That servant was still speaking, when a fourth servant ran up to Job. He said, ‘Your children were at a party. They were drinking 
JOB.1.19	There was a bad storm and the wind destroyed the house. The house fell on all your children and it killed them. But I am still alive. And I have come to tell you what has happened.’
JOB.1.20	When Job heard all this he was very sad. He tore his clothes and he cut off all his hair. He did this because he was so sad. Then he bent his body to the ground and he 
JOB.1.21	And he said, ‘When we are born we have nothing. When we die, we take nothing with us. God has given to us all the things that we have. Sometimes he takes away the things that we have. Only the 
JOB.1.22	Even after all the things that had happened, Job still did not do wrong things. Nor did he say that God had done anything wrong.
JOB.2.1	The next time that the 
JOB.2.2	The 
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.5	But if you cause Job to have great pain in his own body, it will be different. And then he will certainly let you know that he is 
JOB.2.6	So the 
JOB.2.7	So 
JOB.2.8	Then Job sat down among the ashes. He did this to show how sad he was. He sat there and removed bad bits of skin with a piece of a broken pot.
JOB.2.9	His wife said, ‘You cannot still believe that God is good. You should 
JOB.2.10	Job replied, ‘Do not talk like a fool! We take the good things that God gives us. So we should not be surprised if he sends us trouble as well.’ Many bad things had happened to Job but he never said any wrong things about God.
JOB.2.11	Three of Job's friends heard about his troubles and so they decided to visit him. The first friend was called Eliphaz. He lived in a place called Teman. The second friend was called Bildad. He lived in a place called Shuah. The third friend was called Zophar. He lived in a place called Naamah. They came because they wanted to help Job. 
JOB.2.12	When they came near enough to see Job, they did not recognise him. He looked so ill. They were so sad that they tore their clothes. Then they put ash on their heads and cried a lot. 
JOB.2.13	For a whole week, they sat on the ground near Job. All that time, they knew how bad his pain was. So they did not say anything to him.
JOB.3.1	In the end, Job 
JOB.3.2	He said,
JOB.3.3	‘Forget the day of my birth.
JOB.3.3	Forget the night when a son was born to my parents.
JOB.3.4	Forget about that day because it was a bad day.
JOB.3.5	I want people to think about that day as a dark day.
JOB.3.5	I want it to be as dark as night.
JOB.3.6	Make it a date that no one remembers.
JOB.3.6	Hide it from the thoughts of everyone.
JOB.3.7	Do not let children be born on that date.
JOB.3.7	Do not let people be happy on that date.
JOB.3.8	Some people know how to cause 
JOB.3.8	Let those people 
JOB.3.9	On that date, make dark the stars that shine in the morning.
JOB.3.9	Do not let the sun shine at dawn.
JOB.3.10	I ask all this because on that day I was born into a world full of trouble.
JOB.3.11	It would have been better if I had died at birth.
JOB.3.11	My mother should have let me die.
JOB.3.12	Instead, she put me on her knee and I drank from her breast.
JOB.3.13	If I had died at birth, I would now be with all the other dead people.
JOB.3.14	Kings and rulers are there, too.
JOB.3.14	Those kings had lived in buildings that had been beautiful. And I would be with them.
JOB.3.15	I would be with rulers who once were rich with gold and 
JOB.3.16	If I had been born dead, my friends would have buried me.
JOB.3.16	Then I would not have lived to wake each day.
JOB.3.16	Then I would not have had a life full of trouble.
JOB.3.17	After death, no one causes any more troubles.
JOB.3.17	This is true for people who have done wrong things during their lives.
JOB.3.17	And people who have been very tired during their lives can rest.
JOB.3.18	It is a place where no one is in prison.
JOB.3.18	It is a place where slaves do not hear the voice of a master.
JOB.3.19	Important people and people who are not important are there.
JOB.3.19	Slaves are free there. They do not have a master there.
JOB.3.20	My life is so difficult that I always feel sad.
JOB.3.20	So I want to know why God lets people like me live.
JOB.3.21	They want to die. But they are still alive.
JOB.3.21	They would rather die than discover gold.
JOB.3.22	When, in the end, they are dying, they are very happy.
JOB.3.23	They want to know why they should go on living.
JOB.3.23	They do not know what will happen to them.
JOB.3.23	They feel like people that God has put in a prison.
JOB.3.24	I cannot eat because I am crying so much.
JOB.3.24	I cannot drink because I weep all the time.
JOB.3.25	The things that frighten me most have happened to me.
JOB.3.26	I cannot rest because of all the troubles that I have.’
JOB.4.1	Job's friend Eliphaz lived in a place called Teman. He spoke with Job. And this is what he said.
JOB.4.2	‘You might not like the things that I want to say.
JOB.4.2	But I have to say something because this is important.
JOB.4.3	Think about this:
JOB.4.3	You have taught many people.
JOB.4.3	And you have helped weak people.
JOB.4.4	By your words, you have saved people from great dangers.
JOB.4.4	And you have helped weak people to hope.
JOB.4.5	But now you have many troubles.
JOB.4.5	And you feel sad and weak because of your troubles.
JOB.4.6	But you can still hope that your troubles will stop.
JOB.4.6	Go on being afraid to make God angry.
JOB.4.6	And try to live the right way.
JOB.4.7	Think about this:
JOB.4.7	Many people live the right way. They do not die while they are young.
JOB.4.7	God does not kill people who only do good things.
JOB.4.8	I will tell you what I have seen.
JOB.4.8	Bad people have trouble in their lives.
JOB.4.8	In fact they have troubles that they cause for themselves.
JOB.4.8	They are like a farmer.
JOB.4.8	The things that he has planted grow in his field.
JOB.4.9	God is angry with people who are like that.
JOB.4.9	And he will kill them.
JOB.4.9	When God is angry it is like a strong wind.
JOB.4.9	When he is angry bad people die. They die like they would in a bad storm.
JOB.4.10	Think about 
JOB.4.10	But if God breaks a 
JOB.4.11	So it is hungry and, in the end, it dies.
JOB.4.11	And the young 
JOB.4.11	Bad people may be strong too.
JOB.4.11	But, if God is angry, they cannot fight him.
JOB.4.12	One night I heard a quiet voice.
JOB.4.12	Someone spoke to me and told me a secret.
JOB.4.13	I was asleep, but my dreams woke me.
JOB.4.14	I was very afraid.
JOB.4.14	Even my bones were 
JOB.4.15	Then a 
JOB.4.15	My hairs stood up.
JOB.4.16	The 
JOB.4.16	Everything was quiet and then I heard the voice. I heard these words.
JOB.4.17	“God made us all. And he sees the things that we do.
JOB.4.17	He knows that no one is completely good.
JOB.4.18	He says that even his servants and his 
JOB.4.19	God made us all from 
JOB.4.19	And we are as weak as insects that fly.
JOB.4.19	So we cannot hope to have lives with no troubles.
JOB.4.20	All our lives are very short.
JOB.4.20	Insects are born after dawn and they die before the end of the day.
JOB.4.20	No one will ever see them again.
JOB.4.20	Our lives are so short that they seem like that.
JOB.4.21	Our lives are like 
JOB.4.21	There are 
JOB.4.21	When you remove the 
JOB.4.21	So a small thing can cause us to die.
JOB.4.21	And often people learn nothing during their lives.” ’
JOB.5.1	Eliphaz continued to speak.
JOB.5.1	‘You may shout, Job, and ask someone to help you. But no one will answer you.
JOB.5.1	Even if you ask the 
JOB.5.2	A fool may be so angry with other people that he dies.
JOB.5.2	He may want to have the things that they have. He may die because he wants them too much.
JOB.5.3	I myself have seen the way that a fool lives. He seems to be happy.
JOB.5.3	And his life seems to be comfortable. But soon God sends trouble to him.
JOB.5.4	His children are not safe any more. People will say that they have done wrong things.
JOB.5.4	Then no one will say that his children are honest.
JOB.5.5	Hungry people take plants from his fields. They even take them from among the weeds.
JOB.5.5	And other people use his money to buy their drinks.
JOB.5.6	But difficulties do not grow like plants.
JOB.5.6	And troubles do not come from the ground.
JOB.5.7	You know that from every fire smoke rises into the air.
JOB.5.7	So every man that is born has troubles in his life.
JOB.5.8	I suggest that you ask God to help you.
JOB.5.8	I suggest that you tell him about your problems.
JOB.5.9	He does great things that nobody can understand.
JOB.5.9	Nobody can count the surprising things that he has done.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain for the earth.
JOB.5.10	He sends water for the fields.
JOB.5.11	He makes 
JOB.5.11	Some people are sad because someone has died. But God makes those people safe.
JOB.5.12	Clever people may try to do wrong things.
JOB.5.12	But God will not let them do such things.
JOB.5.13	He sees the things that clever people are doing.
JOB.5.13	And he causes them to stop doing those things.
JOB.5.14	They find that it is dark at midday.
JOB.5.14	They can see no better in the day than at night.
JOB.5.15	He saves poor people from death.
JOB.5.15	And he stops bad people from hitting them.
JOB.5.16	God helps poor people. So they can hope that their future lives will be good.
JOB.5.16	But those who do wrong things must be quiet.
JOB.5.17	If God teaches you the right way to live, you should be happy.
JOB.5.17	He may decide that you should have difficulties in your life.
JOB.5.17	Do not be sad if the 
JOB.5.18	He may cause you to have pain. But he will make you well again.
JOB.5.18	He may hurt you, but he will give you health again.
JOB.5.19	Often he will save you from trouble.
JOB.5.19	Many times, he will keep you safe from danger.
JOB.5.20	He will keep you alive if there is a 
JOB.5.20	And he will also keep you alive if there is a war.
JOB.5.21	He will not let people say bad things about you.
JOB.5.21	And you will not be afraid when people attack you.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh if there is a 
JOB.5.22	You will not be afraid of wild animals.
JOB.5.23	They will not be wild any more when you are near them.
JOB.5.23	And there will be no danger in your fields.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your home is safe. You will check all the things you have.
JOB.5.24	And you will find that they are all there.
JOB.5.25	You will know that you will have a large family. You will have many children and grandchildren.
JOB.5.25	It will not be any easier to count them than to count the grass in a field.
JOB.5.26	You will live for many years. Plants grow until the right time to pick them.
JOB.5.26	So you will live until it is the right time for you to die. And you will have good health until you die.
JOB.5.27	We have checked all this. And we have found that it is true.
JOB.5.27	So listen to what we say. And do what we suggest.’
JOB.6.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.6.2	‘It is not possible to measure my troubles
JOB.6.2	or to weigh my pains!
JOB.6.3	If it were possible to weigh them, they would be heavier than all the sand on the shore.
JOB.6.3	That is why I have spoken so quickly. And I did not think before I spoke.
JOB.6.4	The 
JOB.6.4	Their poison is in my body. I am very afraid of what God is going to do to me.
JOB.6.5	A wild 
JOB.6.5	An 
JOB.6.6	You cannot enjoy food that has no salt in it.
JOB.6.6	If you only eat the white part of an egg, it will not be very nice.
JOB.6.7	I refuse to eat food like that.
JOB.6.7	Whatever I eat makes me ill.
JOB.6.8	God will not give me what I ask for. I want to know why this is.
JOB.6.8	When I pray he does not answer.
JOB.6.9	I want to die. And I have prayed that God would kill me.
JOB.6.10	I have had much pain. But I know that God is 
JOB.6.10	And I have always done what he has told me to do.
JOB.6.10	So, because I know that, I am ready to die.
JOB.6.11	I am not strong enough to hope for a better life.
JOB.6.11	There is no reason why I should be patient.
JOB.6.12	I am not as strong as stone.
JOB.6.12	God did not make my body from 
JOB.6.13	I am not strong enough to help myself.
JOB.6.13	And there is nowhere that I can go to get help.
JOB.6.14	When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him.
JOB.6.14	Friends who are not like that have stopped being afraid to make God angry.
JOB.6.15	But, my friends, you are not here to help me when I need you.
JOB.6.15	You are like some rivers. Sometimes there is water and sometimes there is no water.
JOB.6.16	In the spring, the sun warms the ice and the snow and there is a lot of water.
JOB.6.17	But in the summer, there may be no rain. And the sun is so hot that there is no water.
JOB.6.18	Travellers get lost when they go to look for water.
JOB.6.18	They leave the proper paths and they die in the 
JOB.6.19	Travellers from Tema look for water. People on business from Sheba look for water.
JOB.6.19	But they are all disappointed.
JOB.6.20	They are sad, because they had hoped to find water.
JOB.6.20	But when they arrive, they are disappointed.
JOB.6.21	You are like those streams.
JOB.6.21	You see what has happened to me. And you are afraid.
JOB.6.22	I have never asked you to send me a gift.
JOB.6.22	Nor have I asked you to pay money so that I could be free.
JOB.6.23	I have not asked you to save me from my enemy.
JOB.6.23	Nor have I asked you to help me get free from cruel people.
JOB.6.24	Tell me things that are true. Then I will be quiet.
JOB.6.24	Tell me if I have done something wrong.
JOB.6.25	The true words that an honest man speaks will make the listener sad.
JOB.6.25	You may argue with me. But the things that you say mean nothing.
JOB.6.26	You do not believe me when I speak to you. So you should not try to argue with me.
JOB.6.26	There is nothing more that I can hope for in this life. You know that.
JOB.6.27	But you would sell to be slaves, children who had no parents.
JOB.6.27	You would even sell your best friend.
JOB.6.28	But now, please look at me.
JOB.6.28	I only tell you things that are true.
JOB.6.29	Please think again about what you say.
JOB.6.29	Think again. I want people to know that I am an honest man.
JOB.6.30	The things that I say are true.
JOB.6.30	I know what is right. And I know what is wrong.’
JOB.7.1	‘Men always have a lot of work to do on this earth.
JOB.7.1	They have to work every day like servants.
JOB.7.2	A slave waits for the end of the day so that he can stop his work.
JOB.7.2	A servant waits until his master pays him.
JOB.7.3	But I have nothing to wait for.
JOB.7.3	Every night, when I lie down to sleep, I am sad.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I want the night to end.
JOB.7.4	But it does not end, and I cannot sleep. At last, dawn comes.
JOB.7.5	There are insects all over my body.
JOB.7.5	All of my skin is painful.
JOB.7.6	My life is passing very fast. It is passing as fast as the 
JOB.7.6	But I cannot hope that it will get any better.’
JOB.7.7	‘Remember, God, that my life is as short as a 
JOB.7.7	I know that I will never be happy again.
JOB.7.8	You see me now but soon you will not see me.
JOB.7.8	You will look for me, but I will have gone.
JOB.7.9	A cloud passes across the sky and then it is gone. You never see it again.
JOB.7.9	That is like a person who dies. He never returns to the earth.
JOB.7.10	He will never come back to his house again.
JOB.7.10	People who knew him soon forget him.
JOB.7.11	So I will not be quiet. I will speak to tell you how angry I am.
JOB.7.11	I will speak to say how very sad I feel.
JOB.7.12	Perhaps you have to watch the animals that live in the sea.
JOB.7.12	But I do not understand why you have to watch me every day.
JOB.7.13	I lie down and try to rest.
JOB.7.13	Perhaps my pain will be less when I am asleep.
JOB.7.14	But even then you cause me to dream and that frightens me.
JOB.7.14	I am afraid when I see things in the night.
JOB.7.15	I would rather die than continue a life like this.
JOB.7.16	I hate my life and I do not want to live any more.
JOB.7.16	My life has no meaning.
JOB.7.16	So let me die alone.
JOB.7.17	You seem to think that men are very important.
JOB.7.17	You seem to have a lot of interest in men.
JOB.7.18	You seem to watch them every morning.
JOB.7.18	And you seem to check what they are doing at each moment of the day.
JOB.7.18	I would like to know why you are like that.
JOB.7.19	It seems that you never stop watching me.
JOB.7.19	It seems that I cannot be alone, even for a moment.
JOB.7.20	You seem to think that I have done wrong things.
JOB.7.20	You watch what men do. I know that. But I do not know what I have done to you.
JOB.7.20	I do not know why you have chosen to watch me.
JOB.7.20	You seem to think that I have caused trouble for you.
JOB.7.21	I do not know why you do not excuse me.
JOB.7.21	I do not know why you do not 
JOB.7.21	Soon I will die and my friends will bury me.
JOB.7.21	Then you will look for me, but you will not find me.’
JOB.8.1	Job's friend Bildad lived in a place called Shuah.
JOB.8.1	He spoke to Job. And this is what he said.
JOB.8.2	‘You should not continue to say such things.
JOB.8.2	Your words are like the wind.
JOB.8.3	Surely you know that God is fair.
JOB.8.3	The 
JOB.8.4	Your children did things that were wrong.
JOB.8.4	Because of the things that they did, God 
JOB.8.5	But you should pray to God
JOB.8.5	and you should ask the 
JOB.8.6	If you are honest, God will listen to you.
JOB.8.6	You may have lived the right way.
JOB.8.6	Then he will hear you when you speak to him.
JOB.8.6	And he will give back to you the things that you have lost.
JOB.8.7	You will be very rich.
JOB.8.7	God will give you much more than you had before.
JOB.8.8	People who lived before us knew many things.
JOB.8.8	Try to discover what they learned.
JOB.8.9	Our lives are like shadows that pass in a moment.
JOB.8.9	They are so short that we learn nothing.
JOB.8.10	But the people who lived before us can teach us.
JOB.8.10	Listen to what they said. Then you will learn from them.
JOB.8.11	You know that some trees only grow tall in wet ground.
JOB.8.11	And plants can only live if they have water.
JOB.8.12	They may still be growing and they may not be ready for somebody to cut them.
JOB.8.12	But if they have no water, they will soon die.
JOB.8.13	People who forget about God are like those plants.
JOB.8.13	They cannot hope to live. They, too, will die before they are old.
JOB.8.14	They believe in something that is weak.
JOB.8.14	It is as weak as a 
JOB.8.15	A man like that 
JOB.8.15	He holds all his things as well as he can. But in the end, they will leave him.’
JOB.8.16	‘Bad people are like weeds when there is plenty of water.
JOB.8.16	The weeds grow all over the garden.
JOB.8.17	Their 
JOB.8.17	and they find space between rocks.
JOB.8.18	But in the end, someone will dig the ground and destroy the weeds.
JOB.8.18	Then no one will remember that they had been there.
JOB.8.19	So the weeds die.
JOB.8.19	But other plants will grow in the ground where they had been.
JOB.8.20	God will not refuse to help an honest man.
JOB.8.20	Nor will he hurry to help a bad man.
JOB.8.21	He will make you happy.
JOB.8.21	And you will have reasons to laugh again. And you will smile again, too.
JOB.8.22	Your enemies will be ashamed of what they have done.
JOB.8.22	And they will even lose their homes.’
JOB.9.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.9.2	‘The things that you have said are true. I know that they are true.
JOB.9.2	But God will not agree that anyone is completely honest.
JOB.9.3	We might decide to quarrel with him about that.
JOB.9.3	But God can ask 1000 questions which we cannot answer.
JOB.9.4	God is very 
JOB.9.4	It is impossible to argue with him.
JOB.9.5	He is so powerful that he can move mountains.
JOB.9.5	When he is angry he can knock them down.
JOB.9.6	He can make the earth itself move.
JOB.9.6	He can even move it from the place where it belongs.
JOB.9.7	He can tell the sun not to shine during the day.
JOB.9.7	He can stop the stars shining at night.
JOB.9.8	God made the sky and everything that is above the earth.
JOB.9.8	He did not need anyone to help him. And he tells the seas what they should do.
JOB.9.9	He made all the stars and he put them in their places in the sky.
JOB.9.9	He made the 
JOB.9.9	They are all there in the shapes that he decided. 
JOB.9.10	Nobody can understand all the things that he does.
JOB.9.10	And nobody can count the surprising things that he has done.
JOB.9.11	When God passes in front of me, I cannot see him.
JOB.9.11	He may go somewhere else. And I cannot see where he has gone.
JOB.9.12	He takes what he wants. And no one can stop him.
JOB.9.12	No one can ask him what he is doing.
JOB.9.13	God will always be angry with his enemies.
JOB.9.13	They may fight against him but they will not beat him.
JOB.9.14	I cannot cause God to change his thoughts about me.
JOB.9.14	There are no words that I can use.
JOB.9.15	I may not have done anything that was wrong. But I cannot explain that to God.
JOB.9.15	I can only ask him to be 
JOB.9.16	If I call to him he might answer me.
JOB.9.16	But even then he would not listen to the things that I say.
JOB.9.17	He would send a storm to cause me pain.
JOB.9.17	He would hurt me for no reason.
JOB.9.18	I would not be able to 
JOB.9.18	Instead, he would make me very sad.
JOB.9.19	God is much stronger than I am.
JOB.9.19	And no one can ask him to explain what he has done.
JOB.9.20	I may not have done anything that was wrong.
JOB.9.20	But my words do not show that this is true.
JOB.9.20	I may be completely honest.
JOB.9.20	But when I speak, no one believes me.
JOB.9.21	I have not done anything that was wrong.
JOB.9.21	But my life is not important and I hate myself.
JOB.9.22	The same thing happens to everybody in the end.
JOB.9.22	So I say, “God kills both good people and very bad people.”
JOB.9.23	Sometimes a good man will become ill while he is young.
JOB.9.23	But even if he is very sad, God does not do anything to help him.
JOB.9.24	Bad men may rule the countries in the world.
JOB.9.24	And the 
JOB.9.24	It must be God who lets those things happen.
JOB.9.24	I do not know anyone else that would do that.
JOB.9.25	I am becoming old very quickly.
JOB.9.25	But even if I live for many years, I will not be happy.
JOB.9.26	A fast boat passes very quickly. My life is like that. It will soon end.
JOB.9.26	A bird can catch a small animal in a moment. My life seems to be as short as that.
JOB.9.27	I may try to smile.
JOB.9.27	And I may try to forget about all my troubles.
JOB.9.28	Even then, I will be afraid of the pain that God causes.
JOB.9.28	God does not agree that I am an honest man. I know that.
JOB.9.29	He has decided that I have done wrong things.
JOB.9.29	So I do not see why I should continue to argue with him.
JOB.9.30	I might wash myself with soap
JOB.9.30	and I might clean my hands with powder.
JOB.9.31	Even then, God would throw me into a dirty hole.
JOB.9.31	I would be so dirty that I could not wear my own clothes.
JOB.9.32	God is not a man; so I cannot argue with him.
JOB.9.32	We cannot argue with each other in 
JOB.9.33	No one can decide which of us is right.
JOB.9.33	What I say may be true. But no one can check if it is true.
JOB.9.34	No one can stop God when he hurts me.
JOB.9.34	If that were possible, then I would not be afraid any more.
JOB.9.35	If that were possible, I would not be afraid to speak.
JOB.9.35	But it is not possible, so I cannot speak.
JOB.10.1	I do not enjoy my life now. I do not want to live. I am very, very sad.
JOB.10.1	So I will speak about the thoughts that are in my mind.
JOB.10.2	This is what I will say to God. “Do not say that I am a bad person.
JOB.10.2	You may believe that I have done wrong things. Tell me what they are.
JOB.10.3	You seem to enjoy it when you hurt me. You made me. So I do not know why you refuse to help me.
JOB.10.3	And you seem to help very bad people even when they are doing very bad things.
JOB.10.4	Sometimes you seem not to have eyes like men have eyes.
JOB.10.4	And you seem not to see things as people see them.
JOB.10.5	Your life is not like the life of a human being.
JOB.10.5	You life does not have an end like ours does.
JOB.10.6	But you seem to be in a hurry to discover the wrong things that I have done.
JOB.10.6	I do not know why you have to do that.
JOB.10.7	You know that I have not done wrong things.
JOB.10.7	But you also know that no one can save me from you.
JOB.10.8	You made me with your hands.
JOB.10.8	But now it seems that you want to kill me.
JOB.10.9	Remember that you made me from 
JOB.10.9	Now it seems that you want to make me into 
JOB.10.10	People make cheese with only a little milk.
JOB.10.10	So you made my body with only a little material.
JOB.10.11	You joined my bones together
JOB.10.11	and you covered them with skin.
JOB.10.12	You gave my life to me and you have always loved me.
JOB.10.12	You have always watched me to save me from danger.
JOB.10.13	But I know what you decided to do.
JOB.10.13	I know the thoughts that were in your mind.
JOB.10.14	You were watching me to see if I did wrong things.
JOB.10.14	And then you would not 
JOB.10.15	If I do wrong things, then you 
JOB.10.15	But you never see the good things that I do.
JOB.10.15	Whatever I do, I am ashamed.
JOB.10.15	Whatever I do, my life is full of trouble.
JOB.10.16	If I do something well, I am happy.
JOB.10.16	But then you catch me as a 
JOB.10.16	And you use your power against me.
JOB.10.17	You continue to say that I do wrong things.
JOB.10.17	You become more and more angry with me.
JOB.10.17	You attack me again and again.
JOB.10.18	I do not know why you let me be born.
JOB.10.18	I should have died before anyone saw me.
JOB.10.19	It would have been better if I had never been born.
JOB.10.19	Or perhaps I should have died straight after my birth.
JOB.10.20	It seems that I will die soon.
JOB.10.20	Turn yourself from me so I can be happy for a moment.
JOB.10.21	I want to be happy before I die. I will soon die.
JOB.10.21	Then I will go to a place from which I cannot return.
JOB.10.22	I will go to a dark place where there are only shadows.
JOB.10.22	In that place, it is as dark as midnight in the middle of the day.” ’
JOB.11.1	Job's friend Zophar lived in a place called Naamah. He spoke to Job. And this is what he said.
JOB.11.2	‘Someone must answer all the questions that you ask.
JOB.11.2	Even if you talk a lot, God will still not excuse you.
JOB.11.3	We will not be quiet while you continue to speak.
JOB.11.3	You are saying wrong things about God. Someone should stop you doing that.
JOB.11.4	You say to God, “The things that I believe are true.
JOB.11.4	I am an honest man and I live the right way.”
JOB.11.5	I wish that God would speak to you.
JOB.11.5	And I wish that he would explain to you his thoughts.
JOB.11.6	Then he might tell you the secret of 
JOB.11.6	True 
JOB.11.6	You have done things that were wrong.
JOB.11.6	But God has forgotten some of those wrong things.
JOB.11.7	You cannot understand the things that God does.
JOB.11.7	You do not know how powerful he is.
JOB.11.8	His power can reach beyond the sky.
JOB.11.8	You cannot do that.
JOB.11.8	He knows what happens after death.
JOB.11.8	You do not know that.
JOB.11.9	The earth itself could not contain everything that God knows.
JOB.11.9	Neither is the sea big enough to contain it.
JOB.11.10	If he puts you in prison you will not be able to stop him.
JOB.11.10	If he 
JOB.11.10	you will not be able to answer him.
JOB.11.11	I am sure about this. God knows the people who do wrong things.
JOB.11.11	He sees the wrong things that they do.
JOB.11.12	Wild 
JOB.11.12	And fools do not change their nature and become 
JOB.11.13	You should live the right way, Job.
JOB.11.13	You should raise your hands and pray to God.
JOB.11.14	Stop doing things that are wrong.
JOB.11.14	Do not let people do wrong things in your home.
JOB.11.15	If you do this, you will not be ashamed any more.
JOB.11.15	Instead, you will be strong. And you will not be afraid.
JOB.11.16	I am sure that you will forget your trouble.
JOB.11.16	It will be like water that has gone under a bridge long ago. No one remembers it.
JOB.11.17	Your life will be good. And you will be happy again.
JOB.11.17	All day, it will seem brighter than noon. Even the dark night will seem like the morning.
JOB.11.18	You will be able to hope, so you will 
JOB.11.18	Then you will know that it is safe to rest.
JOB.11.19	When you sleep, you will not be afraid.
JOB.11.19	Many people will ask you to help them.
JOB.11.20	But bad people will not be able to hope for a better life.
JOB.11.20	God will 
JOB.11.20	It would be better if they died.’
JOB.12.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.12.2	‘You seem to think that you know everything.
JOB.12.2	And you think that, after your death, no one else will be 
JOB.12.3	But I have a mind too. And you are no better than I am.
JOB.12.3	Everyone knows the things that you have told me.
JOB.12.4	All my friends think that I am a fool.
JOB.12.4	But I pray to God and he answers me.
JOB.12.4	I have always lived the right way.
JOB.12.4	But still my friends think that I am a fool.
JOB.12.5	Some people have no troubles.
JOB.12.5	It is easy for them to think that they are better than people with troubles.
JOB.12.5	It is easy to push a man who is nearly falling already.
JOB.12.5	And those people with no troubles are doing something like that.
JOB.12.6	Men who rob other people are safe in their homes.
JOB.12.6	They make God angry. But they think that they are safe.
JOB.12.7	But ask the animals, and they will teach you.
JOB.12.7	Or ask the birds in the air. They will tell you things that are true.
JOB.12.8	Speak to the earth, and it will teach you.
JOB.12.8	Or let the fish that are in the sea speak to you.
JOB.12.9	Any of them can tell you what the 
JOB.12.10	He gives life to all the animals.
JOB.12.10	And he decides what the lives of men will be like.
JOB.12.11	We can taste food when we put it into our mouths.
JOB.12.11	And we learn the things that we hear with our ears.
JOB.12.12	Old people are often 
JOB.12.12	And they understand more things if they live for a long time.
JOB.12.13	But God is 
JOB.12.13	He is strong and he makes us strong too.
JOB.12.14	No one can repair something that he has destroyed.
JOB.12.14	And if God puts someone in prison he must stay there. No one can help that person.
JOB.12.15	If God stops the rain, the land becomes a 
JOB.12.15	If he sends too much rain, there are 
JOB.12.16	God is strong. He will always beat anyone who fights against him.
JOB.12.16	He has power over good people and over bad people.
JOB.12.17	He takes away the 
JOB.12.17	And he causes leaders to seem like fools.
JOB.12.18	He takes from kings the special clothes that they wear.
JOB.12.18	He gives them instead cloths to tie round them.
JOB.12.19	God causes 
JOB.12.19	Because of what he decides, important men lose their jobs too.
JOB.12.20	He confuses 
JOB.12.20	And he removes 
JOB.12.21	He causes rulers to be ashamed.
JOB.12.21	And he destroys the power of strong men.
JOB.12.22	He shows to us things that nobody knew.
JOB.12.22	And he makes the shadows of the night shine like the day.
JOB.12.23	He makes 
JOB.12.23	He makes 
JOB.12.24	He destroys the understanding of kings.
JOB.12.24	And then he sends them to walk about in the 
JOB.12.25	They have no light while they walk in the dark.
JOB.12.25	And he causes them to walk like men who have drunk a lot of alcohol.’
JOB.13.1	‘I have seen with my own eyes all the things that you have told me.
JOB.13.1	I have heard everything that you have said. And I have understood all of it.
JOB.13.2	I know as much as you do.
JOB.13.2	You are no better than I am.
JOB.13.3	But I want to speak to the 
JOB.13.3	And I want him to explain the things that he has done to me.
JOB.13.4	But you tell me things that are not true.
JOB.13.4	You are like doctors who cannot make sick people better.
JOB.13.5	It would be better if you said nothing.
JOB.13.5	That would be a 
JOB.13.6	Listen now to me when I speak to you.
JOB.13.6	Listen to the things that I say.
JOB.13.7	You should not speak on behalf of God!
JOB.13.7	You are saying things on his behalf; but they are not true.
JOB.13.8	You should be fair when you speak on his behalf.
JOB.13.8	But I cannot believe that you are really trying to explain his thoughts to me.
JOB.13.9	God may check what you have been doing.
JOB.13.9	Other people may not understand.
JOB.13.9	But he will see the wrong things that you have done.
JOB.13.10	It may be a secret that you have not been fair.
JOB.13.10	Even so, God will still 
JOB.13.11	I am sure that his power will frighten you.
JOB.13.11	I am sure that you will be afraid of him.
JOB.13.12	The things that you say are worth no more than ashes.
JOB.13.12	You are not strong enough to save yourself.
JOB.13.13	So be quiet and let me speak.
JOB.13.13	Then I will not cry about the things that happen to me.
JOB.13.14	If anything happens to me, it will be my mistake.
JOB.13.14	But I do want to say what I really think.
JOB.13.15	Even if God kills me, I will still believe him.
JOB.13.15	But I will explain to him the reason why he should not kill me.
JOB.13.16	No bad man would be brave enough to speak with God.
JOB.13.16	So if I speak to him, it will save me.
JOB.13.17	Listen well when I speak.
JOB.13.17	Do not forget the things that I say to you.
JOB.13.18	Now I have prepared the things that I want to say.
JOB.13.18	I have not done anything that was wrong. So I know that he will excuse me.
JOB.13.19	Nobody can tell me any wrong thing that I have done.
JOB.13.19	If you can do that, I will be quiet. And then I will die.
JOB.13.20	God, I do not want to hide myself from you any more.
JOB.13.20	So I want to ask you to do two things.
JOB.13.21	Stop causing bad things to happen to me.
JOB.13.21	And stop making me afraid of you.
JOB.13.22	Call to me and I will answer you.
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, and then reply to me.
JOB.13.23	Tell me how many wrong things I have done.
JOB.13.23	Show me one wrong thing that I have done.
JOB.13.24	I would like to know why you hide yourself from me.
JOB.13.24	You seem to think that I am your enemy. I would like to know why you think that.
JOB.13.25	I am as weak as a leaf that the wind blows along the road.
JOB.13.25	I am only as strong as dry grass.
JOB.13.25	So I do not understand why you want to frighten me.
JOB.13.26	You write down bad things about me.
JOB.13.26	I may have done wrong things when I was young. And you remember them.
JOB.13.27	You fasten my feet with metal ties.
JOB.13.27	You watch me to see where I am going.
JOB.13.27	You even put marks on my feet so that you can follow me.
JOB.13.28	So my life is worth nothing.
JOB.13.28	I am like an old coat that the insects have eaten.’
JOB.14.1	‘Every man that is born will only live for a few years.
JOB.14.1	And his life will be full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	Flowers grow and soon die. Our lives are not long, either.
JOB.14.2	We are like shadows that soon pass by.
JOB.14.3	So I would like to know why you always watch a weak person like me.
JOB.14.3	You always want me to explain the wrong things that I have done.
JOB.14.3	I would like to know why you want me to do that.
JOB.14.4	People who are bad do not know the right way to live.
JOB.14.4	No one can change them so that they live like that.
JOB.14.5	You have decided whether we will live for a long time or for a short time.
JOB.14.5	You know the number of months that we will live. And we cannot change that.
JOB.14.6	So do not watch me any more.
JOB.14.6	I may live like a servant. But please let me enjoy my life.
JOB.14.7	If someone cuts branches off a tree, the tree will not die.
JOB.14.7	Instead, new branches will grow.
JOB.14.8	Its 
JOB.14.8	Its branches may have fallen off and the tree may be nearly dead.
JOB.14.9	But if there is even a little water, the tree will not die.
JOB.14.9	And its branches will start to grow again.
JOB.14.10	But when people are dying, they become very weak.
JOB.14.10	Then they die and they can never live again.
JOB.14.11	When there is no water in the river or the lake,
JOB.14.11	they both become dry.
JOB.14.12	People are like that. They die and they never live again.
JOB.14.12	They will not wake while the sky is above the earth.
JOB.14.13	I want you to hide me among all the dead people.
JOB.14.13	Hide me until you are no longer angry with me.
JOB.14.13	Then decide when you will remember me.
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, he will not live again.
JOB.14.14	So I will wait until my troubles have stopped.
JOB.14.14	Then I might hope to have a better life.
JOB.14.15	You will call me and I will answer you.
JOB.14.15	Then you will have pleasure, because you made me.
JOB.14.16	Then you will watch what I do. And you will watch where I go.
JOB.14.16	But you will not still remember the wrong things that I have done.
JOB.14.17	You will 
JOB.14.17	And you will hide them so that you never see them again.
JOB.14.18	In the end, mountains fall
JOB.14.18	and rocks move from their places.
JOB.14.19	In the end, water will break stones.
JOB.14.19	When the rain falls, nothing remains on the earth.
JOB.14.19	And in the end, because of the things that you do,
JOB.14.19	no man can hope to have a better life.
JOB.14.20	In the end, you kill him. Then he is gone for always.
JOB.14.20	You change his face and you send him away.
JOB.14.21	He does not know if his sons become famous.
JOB.14.21	Nor does he know if they have wasted their lives.
JOB.14.22	He thinks only about the pain that he feels.
JOB.14.22	He does not think about the pain that other people feel.
JOB.14.22	And when he is sad, he thinks only about himself.’
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz replied to Job. This is what he said.
JOB.15.2	‘A 
JOB.15.2	Nor would he use words that mean so little.
JOB.15.3	No 
JOB.15.3	The things that you say do not mean anything.
JOB.15.4	You do not seem to be afraid of God.
JOB.15.4	Nor do you want people to pray to him.
JOB.15.5	The wrong things that you say come from bad thoughts in your mind.
JOB.15.5	You try to be clever. And you try to make people believe you.
JOB.15.6	I will not say that you are wrong.
JOB.15.6	Your words themselves show that you are wrong.
JOB.15.7	You were not the first human to be born.
JOB.15.7	You were not alive when God made the hills.
JOB.15.8	You are not with God so you cannot know his thoughts.
JOB.15.8	You are not the only 
JOB.15.9	You do not know any more than we know.
JOB.15.9	We have as much 
JOB.15.10	There are men who agree with us.
JOB.15.10	They have grey hair and they are older than your father.
JOB.15.11	God is so good to you. And he is kind when he speaks to you.
JOB.15.11	That ought to be enough for you.
JOB.15.12	I would like to know why there are wrong thoughts in your mind.
JOB.15.12	When we look at you, you seem very angry.
JOB.15.13	I would like to know why you are angry with God like this.
JOB.15.13	You should not say such bad things when you speak to him.
JOB.15.14	No person can say that he is always honest.
JOB.15.14	Nor can anyone say that he has never done wrong things.
JOB.15.15	God does not even believe that his 
JOB.15.15	When he looks at them, they seem to him to be bad.
JOB.15.16	So people must seem to God to be very bad.
JOB.15.16	Something inside them causes them to want to do wrong things.
JOB.15.17	Listen to me and I will explain something to you.
JOB.15.17	Let me tell you what I have seen.
JOB.15.18	They learned such things from people who lived before them.
JOB.15.19	There were no strangers in the country where those people lived.
JOB.15.19	So they did not learn any foreign ideas.
JOB.15.20	A man who is cruel will not have a happy life.
JOB.15.20	Instead, he will have pain during all the years that he lives.
JOB.15.21	He will hear things that frighten him.
JOB.15.21	He may think that he is safe. But bad people will attack him and they will rob him.
JOB.15.22	He will not go out in the dark, because someone may kill him.
JOB.15.23	So that bad man walks about everywhere to look for food.
JOB.15.23	He is saying, “Where is it?”
JOB.15.23	He knows that he will soon die.
JOB.15.24	He is afraid and confused.
JOB.15.24	He is like a king who is frightened before a war.
JOB.15.25	That happens if a man does not obey God.
JOB.15.25	A man like that thinks that he is more important than the 
JOB.15.26	He is the kind of man who tries to argue with God.
JOB.15.26	He even tries to attack God.
JOB.15.27	He may have had plenty of food to eat.
JOB.15.27	And he may be very fat.
JOB.15.28	But he will live in a town where no one else lives.
JOB.15.28	And he will not have a home because people will have destroyed his house.
JOB.15.29	He will have lost all his money.
JOB.15.29	He may have had many valuable things. He will have lost those too.
JOB.15.30	It will be dark and he will not be able to hide. God will find him.
JOB.15.30	God's 
JOB.15.31	He may think that his money will save him. If he thinks that, he is a fool.
JOB.15.31	He will not get back anything. His money will have no value.
JOB.15.32	Before he is old, his life will end.
JOB.15.32	He will not be able to do all the things that he wanted to do.
JOB.15.33	A 
JOB.15.34	If people do not obey God, they will have no children.
JOB.15.34	Such people may have done wrong things to get homes for themselves.
JOB.15.34	If they have done that, fire will destroy those homes.
JOB.15.35	Such people have only wrong thoughts in their minds.
JOB.15.35	Other people have trouble because of the things that they do.
JOB.15.35	And through all their lives they do things that are bad.’
JOB.16.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.16.2	‘I have heard all these things before. When you speak to me, you do not help me.
JOB.16.2	Nor do you make me any happier.
JOB.16.3	I want you to stop speaking words that do not help me.
JOB.16.3	You have no reason to answer me.
JOB.16.4	If your troubles were like my troubles, I could say the same things to you.
JOB.16.4	I could speak about the wrong things that you have done.
JOB.16.5	But, instead, I would try to help you.
JOB.16.5	I would say things that made you happier.
JOB.16.6	But even if I speak, my pain does not go away.
JOB.16.6	And if I stop speaking, my pain is still there.
JOB.16.7	God, you have been very cruel to me.
JOB.16.7	You have killed my whole family.
JOB.16.8	You and I are enemies.
JOB.16.8	And you do not let me move.
JOB.16.8	I am so thin that people can see my bones.
JOB.16.8	People think that you made me like this because of the wrong things in my life.
JOB.16.9	God attacks me because he is angry. I look at his face. I look at his eyes.
JOB.16.9	And I can see how angry he is.
JOB.16.10	Crowds of people say things about me that are not kind.
JOB.16.10	They are not afraid of me and they even slap my face.
JOB.16.11	It was God who let these bad people take me away.
JOB.16.11	He let them do these things to me.
JOB.16.12	I was enjoying my life.
JOB.16.12	Then he held me and everything changed.
JOB.16.12	He held my neck and he hurt me.
JOB.16.12	He has made me his 
JOB.16.13	Soldiers with bows seem to be all round me.
JOB.16.13	He tears my body and my blood falls on the ground. Still he does not feel sorry for me.
JOB.16.14	He attacks me again and again.
JOB.16.14	He rushes at me like a soldier.
JOB.16.15	My clothes show how sad I am.
JOB.16.15	I sit among ashes to show that he has beaten me.
JOB.16.16	I have cried so much that my eyes are red.
JOB.16.16	I am so tired that there are shadows under my eyes.
JOB.16.17	But I have never done anything that was cruel or wrong.
JOB.16.17	And when I pray, I speak honestly to God.
JOB.16.18	I ask the earth not to hide my blood. I do not want people to forget me.
JOB.16.18	I want them always to hear my cry for help.
JOB.16.19	Even now there is someone in 
JOB.16.19	I have a friend in that high place who knows about God's rules.
JOB.16.20	My friends do not help me; so I cry to God.
JOB.16.20	My tears fall to the ground.
JOB.16.21	Sometimes another person can help friends when they have a quarrel.
JOB.16.21	I want someone to speak to God on my behalf.
JOB.16.22	Soon my life will end.
JOB.16.22	And I will never again return to this earth.’
JOB.17.1	‘I am very weak and I will soon die.
JOB.17.1	Then my friends will bury me in the ground.
JOB.17.2	All round me people say that I am a fool.
JOB.17.2	I have to stand and watch them.
JOB.17.3	God, you must help me.
JOB.17.3	There is nobody else who can help me.
JOB.17.4	Because of what you have done, my friends will not listen to me.
JOB.17.4	But I do not want them to think that they were right.
JOB.17.5	They have said very bad things about me.
JOB.17.5	They wanted people to think that they were clever.
JOB.17.5	Now I want you to make their children 
JOB.17.5	Do this, God, because of what they have said about me.
JOB.17.6	When people see me, they are not polite to me.
JOB.17.6	You, God, have caused them to be like this.
JOB.17.7	I have cried so much that I can hardly see.
JOB.17.7	I am so thin that I am like a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Honest people know that this is not fair.
JOB.17.8	They are angry because I seem to be so bad.
JOB.17.9	Honest people always know the right thing to do.
JOB.17.9	And people who only do good things get stronger.
JOB.17.10	But, my friends, come and try again to help me.
JOB.17.10	I will not find a 
JOB.17.11	I will not live for many more days.
JOB.17.11	I will not be able to do the things that I wanted to do.
JOB.17.12	My friends say, “It is day”, when it is still night.
JOB.17.12	They say that it is nearly morning. But I know that it is still dark.
JOB.17.13	If I die I will go to a dark place.
JOB.17.13	There I will lie in the dark.
JOB.17.14	There I might speak to the 
JOB.17.14	And I might say to the 
JOB.17.14	Or I might speak to the 
JOB.17.14	I might say to them, “Hello, my mother. Hello, my sister.”
JOB.17.15	I can hope for nothing that is better than that.
JOB.17.15	No one can find anything that is better for me.
JOB.17.16	When I die, I will go to my 
JOB.17.16	I will have lost everything that I had hoped for.’
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.18.2	‘You should not talk so much!
JOB.18.2	Be 
JOB.18.3	You seem to think that we are as silly as cows.
JOB.18.3	You should not think that we are as silly as that.
JOB.18.4	You are so angry that you will hurt yourself.
JOB.18.4	You may be very angry, but you will not be able to change anything.
JOB.18.4	You may be angry. But that will not make the earth move.
JOB.18.4	Nor will you be able to make the rocks move from their place.
JOB.18.5	The light of a bad person will go out.
JOB.18.5	His fire will stop burning.
JOB.18.6	He will not be able to see anything in his 
JOB.18.6	And the light that is near him will go out.
JOB.18.7	Once he was strong but now his legs are weak.
JOB.18.7	The things that he decided to do have confused him.
JOB.18.8	Where he is walking there is danger.
JOB.18.9	He cannot move because his foot is in a 
JOB.18.10	Someone has hidden the 
JOB.18.10	It is on the path in front of him.
JOB.18.11	A bad person is afraid of everything that is round him.
JOB.18.11	He thinks that there is trouble everywhere.
JOB.18.12	Years ago, he was rich but now he is hungry.
JOB.18.12	If he makes a mistake, he will have many troubles.
JOB.18.13	An illness will make his skin painful.
JOB.18.13	When he is nearly dead, he will not be able to use his arms or his legs.
JOB.18.14	He will die. Then, it will like a man who leaves his 
JOB.18.14	It will be like a man who goes to meet a bad king. Then the bad person will be really afraid.
JOB.18.15	People will live in his house. They will not be his family.
JOB.18.15	They will live there after they have lit a fire to clean the house.
JOB.18.16	He is like a tree whose 
JOB.18.16	He is like a tree whose branches have fallen off.
JOB.18.17	Then he will not be famous, either in his own country or in any other country.
JOB.18.17	No one will remember him now.
JOB.18.18	He will have to leave the world where he has lived.
JOB.18.18	He will go to a place where it is always dark.
JOB.18.19	He will have no children or grandchildren.
JOB.18.19	He will have no family to live in his house where he lived.
JOB.18.20	People from the east heard about the things that happened to him.
JOB.18.20	People who lived in the west heard about them too.
JOB.18.20	And they were all afraid because of what they heard.
JOB.18.21	I am sure that there is a reason for all these things.
JOB.18.21	They happened because he is a bad man.
JOB.18.21	And they happened because he did not know God.’
JOB.19.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.19.2	‘You are still trying to hurt me with the things that you say about me.
JOB.19.2	You should not still be doing that after such a long time.
JOB.19.3	Many times, you have been angry because of the things that I have done.
JOB.19.3	And you have been quick to say bad things about me.
JOB.19.4	It may be true that I have done wrong things.
JOB.19.4	But the things that I have done have not hurt you.
JOB.19.5	You seem to think that you are a better person than me.
JOB.19.5	My troubles do not mean that I am a bad person.
JOB.19.5	But you seem to think that they do mean that.
JOB.19.6	But you should be able to see that God has caused all my troubles.
JOB.19.6	He is trying to catch me in a 
JOB.19.7	God is not fair. He did not have a good reason to cause my troubles.
JOB.19.7	I shouted and I asked for help. But no one came to help me.
JOB.19.8	He stopped me so that I could not go past.
JOB.19.8	He made my path dark so that I could not see the way to go.
JOB.19.9	He has removed all the things that I had.
JOB.19.9	He has caused people to think that I am a bad person.
JOB.19.10	Everywhere I go, God is there to attack me. My life is nearly finished.
JOB.19.10	I am like a tree that he has dug out of the ground.
JOB.19.10	There is nothing more that I can hope for in my life.
JOB.19.11	He is very angry with me.
JOB.19.11	I am one of the people that he sees as his enemies.
JOB.19.12	He sends his army to attack me. They build roads so that they can reach me.
JOB.19.12	They are all round me.
JOB.19.13	Now my brothers do not want to meet me.
JOB.19.13	And my friends think that I am a stranger.
JOB.19.14	My 
JOB.19.14	And my best friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Visitors to my house think that I am a stranger.
JOB.19.15	And my servants think that I come from a foreign country.
JOB.19.16	I ask my servant to come to me. But he does not answer me.
JOB.19.16	Even when I ask him again, he still does not come to me.
JOB.19.17	My wife does not like the smell of my 
JOB.19.17	My brothers will not come near me.
JOB.19.18	Even little boys think that I am a fool.
JOB.19.18	When I appear, they turn away from me.
JOB.19.19	My best friends 
JOB.19.19	People that I have loved do not want to be my friends.
JOB.19.20	My body is nothing more than skin and bones.
JOB.19.20	I could easily have died.
JOB.19.21	Be kind to me, my friends.
JOB.19.21	Be kind because God has been cruel to me.
JOB.19.22	God looks for me as a hunter looks for an animal.
JOB.19.22	I want to know why you do the same thing.
JOB.19.23	I want someone to write down the words that I speak.
JOB.19.23	I want him to write my words on a 
JOB.19.24	I want him to write them on a stone with an iron tool.
JOB.19.24	I want people to be able to read them always.
JOB.19.25	I know that my 
JOB.19.25	I know that, in the end, he will stand upon the earth. 
JOB.19.26	One day I will die and people will bury me in the ground.
JOB.19.26	But in this, my body, I will see God.
JOB.19.27	I will see him with my own eyes.
JOB.19.27	I really want that to happen soon.
JOB.19.28	You say that I have caused my own troubles.
JOB.19.28	And because of that, you cause me to have even more trouble.
JOB.19.29	But you should be afraid of what may happen to you.
JOB.19.29	God will decide if you have done good things or bad things.
JOB.19.29	He may decide that you have done bad things.
JOB.19.29	And then he may 
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.20.2	‘The things that you said have caused me to be very confused.
JOB.20.2	I have troubles in my mind but I must answer you.
JOB.20.3	You have said bad things about me.
JOB.20.3	But now I know how to reply to you.
JOB.20.4	I am sure that you know this fact.
JOB.20.4	It has been true ever since men lived on the earth.
JOB.20.5	A bad man will only be happy for a short time.
JOB.20.5	He will only enjoy his life for a few moments.
JOB.20.6	He may think that he is very important.
JOB.20.6	He may be very powerful and his head may seem to touch the sky. 
JOB.20.7	But he will die and he will never return.
JOB.20.7	His friends will ask where he is.
JOB.20.7	He will be like things that you put into the toilet.
JOB.20.7	They, too, go away and never come back.
JOB.20.8	You will not find him again. He will be like a dream that you do not see in the morning.
JOB.20.8	He will have gone, like something that you saw in your dream.
JOB.20.9	People who knew him will not see him again.
JOB.20.9	No one will see him in the house where he lived before.
JOB.20.10	He was not a fair man and he took money from poor people.
JOB.20.10	So his children must pay that money back to them.
JOB.20.11	When he was a young man, he was very strong.
JOB.20.11	But he will die and his bones will lie in the ground.
JOB.20.12	He enjoys the wrong things that he does.
JOB.20.12	They are like something sweet in his mouth.
JOB.20.13	He continues to do wrong things.
JOB.20.13	That is like a man who keeps something in his mouth to taste it again and again.
JOB.20.14	But this will be like food that has become bad in his stomach.
JOB.20.14	It will be like the poison of a snake inside him.
JOB.20.15	He cannot keep all the money that he has taken from other people.
JOB.20.15	God will say that he should give it all back to them.
JOB.20.16	He will drink the poison of snakes.
JOB.20.16	An 
JOB.20.17	He might get as much oil from 
JOB.20.17	But he will not enjoy that oil.
JOB.20.17	He may have as much cream as there is water in the river.
JOB.20.17	But he will not enjoy that cream either.
JOB.20.17	Nor will he enjoy rivers of cream and other sweet things.
JOB.20.18	He will have to give back everything that he owned.
JOB.20.18	He will not enjoy the things that he has worked for.
JOB.20.19	This will happen because he took money from poor people.
JOB.20.19	And he took houses that someone else had built.
JOB.20.20	He will always want to have more money.
JOB.20.20	But his riches will not save him.
JOB.20.21	Now there is nothing that he can eat.
JOB.20.21	So his good health will not continue.
JOB.20.22	He may be very rich,
JOB.20.22	but he will soon have many troubles.
JOB.20.23	When he has filled his stomach with food, God will be very angry with him.
JOB.20.23	God will show him how angry he is. And God will 
JOB.20.24	He may run from a soldier who has a 
JOB.20.24	But another soldier, with a bow, will catch him and he will shoot an 
JOB.20.25	He pulls the 
JOB.20.25	Its point hurts him and he is very afraid.
JOB.20.26	He will not be able to save the things that he had.
JOB.20.26	God will send a fire to kill him and to destroy everything that he had.
JOB.20.27	God in 
JOB.20.27	People on earth have also seen him do those wrong things.
JOB.20.28	God will very angry. And he will destroy the bad man's home and all his things.
JOB.20.28	It will be like a 
JOB.20.29	This is what will happen to bad people.
JOB.20.29	God has decided that this will happen to them.’
JOB.21.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.21.2	‘Please listen to the things that I say.
JOB.21.2	You can only help me if you hear my words.
JOB.21.3	Be patient while I speak to you.
JOB.21.3	You may not agree with me. Then you may want to say bad things about me.
JOB.21.4	It is God that I want to argue with.
JOB.21.4	I do not understand why I should be patient.
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be surprised.
JOB.21.5	Put your hand over your mouth.
JOB.21.6	I think about the things that I am saying.
JOB.21.6	Then I am afraid and my body becomes weak.
JOB.21.7	I do not understand why bad people live for a long time.
JOB.21.7	As they get older, they become more powerful. I do not know why this happens.
JOB.21.8	They see their children grow up.
JOB.21.8	Their grandchildren make them happy.
JOB.21.9	Such people feel safe in their homes.
JOB.21.9	God does not 
JOB.21.10	It is easy for their cows to have 
JOB.21.10	And many 
JOB.21.11	Their children jump like 
JOB.21.11	And the children love to dance, too.
JOB.21.12	Such people enjoy the music of a 
JOB.21.12	And they are happy when they hear the sound of a 
JOB.21.13	All through their lives they have plenty of money.
JOB.21.13	They do not have any troubles until the day that they die.
JOB.21.14	But they say to God, “Do not come near us!
JOB.21.14	We do not want to know about your ways.”
JOB.21.15	They do not want to obey God. Nor do they want to do what he tells them to do.
JOB.21.15	And they do not see why they should pray to him.
JOB.21.16	They think that they have made themselves rich. But it is not true.
JOB.21.16	So I do not listen to the things that they say.
JOB.21.17	Bad people may do wrong things. But bad things do not often happen to them.
JOB.21.17	Even when God is angry, they do not have troubles.
JOB.21.18	They are not often like dry grass that the wind blows away.
JOB.21.18	Nor are they like something that a storm can sweep away.
JOB.21.19	You say that God will 
JOB.21.19	He will 
JOB.21.19	But I say that God should 
JOB.21.19	Then they will know that they have done wrong things.
JOB.21.20	They must understand what will happen to them.
JOB.21.20	They should know that God is angry. And they should know what God will do to them.
JOB.21.21	Bad things may happen to their children after they die. But they will not feel sad about those things.
JOB.21.21	So God should 
JOB.21.22	No one can tell God what he should do.
JOB.21.22	He sees the things that important people do. And he decides if those things are right or wrong.
JOB.21.23	One person has good health all his life.
JOB.21.23	He has been happy and he has had plenty of money.
JOB.21.24	He has always had enough to eat.
JOB.21.24	And he has never been ill until the day when he dies.
JOB.21.25	Another person has been sad all his life, until the day when he dies.
JOB.21.25	He has never had good health and he has never enjoyed lots of money.
JOB.21.26	But they lie together in the ground.
JOB.21.26	And the 
JOB.21.27	I know your thoughts.
JOB.21.27	You want me to do things that are wrong.
JOB.21.28	You seem to know what happens to bad men.
JOB.21.28	You say that people destroy their houses.
JOB.21.29	But you should ask people who travel, “What have you seen?”
JOB.21.29	You should listen to the things that they say.
JOB.21.30	They would tell you this. God does not always 
JOB.21.30	The bad man may have done wrong things but often nothing will happen to him.
JOB.21.31	No one asks him why he has done wrong things.
JOB.21.31	And no one 
JOB.21.32	When he dies people bury him.
JOB.21.32	And then they stand near the place where his body lies.
JOB.21.33	The ground is soft where his body lies.
JOB.21.33	And many people come to say “goodbye” to the man who has died.
JOB.21.34	You have tried to help me and you have told me many things.
JOB.21.34	But nothing that you have told me is true!’
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.22.2	‘Nothing that a man can do is worth anything to God.
JOB.22.2	Even a 
JOB.22.3	It would not make God happy if you lived a good life.
JOB.22.3	It would not give him pleasure if you always lived the right way.
JOB.22.4	Think about why God 
JOB.22.4	It is not because you are a good person.
JOB.22.5	No! It is because you are a bad person.
JOB.22.5	And you have done so many wrong things that nobody could count them.
JOB.22.5	That is why he is 
JOB.22.6	You lent some money to your brother.
JOB.22.6	But you wanted to be sure that you would get your money back. So you took his clothes.’ 
JOB.22.7	‘When you met tired people, you did not give them any water to drink.
JOB.22.7	And when you met hungry people you did not feed them.
JOB.22.8	You, Job, were a powerful man and you owned land.
JOB.22.8	But you kept for yourself everything that grew on that land.
JOB.22.9	You were not kind to women whose husbands had died.
JOB.22.9	And you were cruel to children who had no parents.
JOB.22.10	That is why you have so many troubles.
JOB.22.10	And that is why you are so afraid.
JOB.22.11	That is why you seem to be walking in the dark.
JOB.22.11	And that is why you seem to be drowning in deep water.
JOB.22.12	God lives in 
JOB.22.12	From there, he can see everything that happens on earth.
JOB.22.13	But you say, “God does not know.
JOB.22.13	He cannot see us from so far away.”
JOB.22.14	You think that thick clouds hide him.
JOB.22.14	So he does not see us as he walks on the circle of the sky.’ 
JOB.22.15	‘You must stop living the wrong way.
JOB.22.15	That is what bad people have done for a long time.
JOB.22.16	They died while they were still young.
JOB.22.16	They thought that they were safe.
JOB.22.16	But they were not safe.
JOB.22.16	They were like people who had drowned in a 
JOB.22.17	They did not believe God.
JOB.22.17	And they thought that God would not do anything to them.
JOB.22.18	But God gave them all the good things that they enjoyed.
JOB.22.18	So I do not understand the thoughts of bad people.
JOB.22.19	But, in the end, God 
JOB.22.19	Good people see that when it happens. And they are happy because they have seen it.
JOB.22.20	“God has killed our enemies”, the good people say.
JOB.22.20	“Fire has destroyed all the things that they owned.”
JOB.22.21	So, Job, do not argue with God but obey him instead.
JOB.22.21	Then your troubles will end and you will be rich again.
JOB.22.22	Listen to what he tells you to do.
JOB.22.22	And remember all that he says.
JOB.22.23	You should live the way that God wants you to live.
JOB.22.23	And you should stop doing wrong things. Then your life will be comfortable again.
JOB.22.24	You may have lots of gold but it will not make you happy.
JOB.22.24	So you should throw it into the dry valley where, years ago, there was a river.
JOB.22.25	Then you will see that God is more valuable than gold.
JOB.22.25	And he is more valuable than 
JOB.22.26	‘Then you will find that it is a pleasure to know God.
JOB.22.26	You will enjoy your life more if you 
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you.
JOB.22.27	And you will do the things that you have promised to him.
JOB.22.28	You will be able to do all the things that you want to do.
JOB.22.28	And God will say that you are living the right way.
JOB.22.29	You will pray for people who have difficulties.
JOB.22.29	And when you pray, God will make their lives better.
JOB.22.30	God will even 
JOB.22.30	He will do that because you have lived a good life.’
JOB.23.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.23.2	‘I am still angry because of the things that God has done.
JOB.23.2	He was cruel to me even when I asked him to help me.
JOB.23.3	I wish that I knew where to find him.
JOB.23.3	I would like to go to the place where he lives.
JOB.23.4	I would explain to him that I have not done any wrong things.
JOB.23.4	I would say many things to him.
JOB.23.5	I would want to know how he would reply to me.
JOB.23.5	I would try to understand all the things that he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	God is much stronger than I am.
JOB.23.6	But he would be fair and he would listen to me.
JOB.23.7	People may obey him and may live the right way.
JOB.23.7	He will listen to such people.
JOB.23.7	If I have lived like that, he will listen to me.
JOB.23.7	And he will agree that I have not done wrong things.
JOB.23.8	But if I go to the east, God is not there.
JOB.23.8	And if I go to the west, I cannot find him there either.
JOB.23.9	When he is at work in the north, I do not see him.
JOB.23.9	And when he goes to the south, I still cannot find him.
JOB.23.10	But he watches where I go. And he knows the things that I do.
JOB.23.10	Many bad things have happened in my life.
JOB.23.10	But he will check the way that I have lived.
JOB.23.10	Then he will see that I am a good man.
JOB.23.10	I will be like gold that has been in a fire.
JOB.23.10	People see that it really is gold.
JOB.23.11	I have always lived in the way that he would have wanted.
JOB.23.11	I have never done things for my own pleasure.
JOB.23.12	I always do the things that God tells me to do. The things that he says are very important.
JOB.23.12	They are more important than the food that I eat each day.
JOB.23.13	I may want God to change the things that he has decided to do.
JOB.23.13	But he will not change them. Whatever he wants to do, he does.
JOB.23.14	He will do to me the things that he has decided to do.
JOB.23.14	And there are many things that he wants to do to me.
JOB.23.15	When he is near me, I am afraid.
JOB.23.15	And when I think about all this, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	God has frightened me.
JOB.23.16	The 
JOB.23.17	So many bad things have happened to me that it seems to be dark all round me.
JOB.23.17	Everything may be dark. But I will still want to speak about all these things.’
JOB.24.1	‘The 
JOB.24.1	I do not know why he will not decide.
JOB.24.1	In the end, he will 
JOB.24.1	But good people will have to wait a long time to see this happen.
JOB.24.2	Bad men move the stones that mark the edge of their fields.
JOB.24.2	They do this to take fields that belong to other people.
JOB.24.2	Then they take the sheep that belong to those people.
JOB.24.2	And they bring them to eat the grass in their own fields.
JOB.24.3	Bad men will take a 
JOB.24.3	They will take a cow from a woman who has no husband.
JOB.24.3	She may have to pay them some money.
JOB.24.3	So they keep the cow until she pays that money to them.
JOB.24.4	They push away people who need help.
JOB.24.4	And poor people have to hide because they are afraid of such bad men.
JOB.24.5	Poor people are like wild 
JOB.24.5	There is nowhere else that they can go to find food for their children.
JOB.24.6	These poor people have to work in the fields of bad men.
JOB.24.6	They pick the plants and the fruit that grow there.
JOB.24.7	They have no clothes to wear during the cold night.
JOB.24.7	They do not have anything with which to cover themselves.
JOB.24.8	The rain that falls in the mountains makes them very wet.
JOB.24.8	So they hide among the rocks where they try to keep dry.
JOB.24.9	Bad men take children without parents and they make them slaves.
JOB.24.9	These men also take the children of poor people who cannot pay their debts.
JOB.24.10	Poor people have to go out with no clothes to cover them.
JOB.24.10	They may be hungry. But they cannot eat the plants that they pick from the fields.
JOB.24.11	They make oil from the 
JOB.24.11	But they still do not have anything to drink.
JOB.24.12	In the city, men who are dying shout for help.
JOB.24.12	But God does not do anything to the people who have hurt them.
JOB.24.13	A bad person does not like the light.
JOB.24.13	He does not understand it. Nor does he follow where it leads him.
JOB.24.14	At sunset, he gets up and he goes out to murder poor people.
JOB.24.14	In the night, he goes out to take things that belong to other people.
JOB.24.15	A man may want to have sex with another man's wife.
JOB.24.15	He waits until it is dark.
JOB.24.15	Then he thinks that no one will see him.
JOB.24.15	And he covers his face so that no one will recognise him.
JOB.24.16	In the dark, bad men go out to rob other people.
JOB.24.16	But in the day, they stay in their homes and sleep.
JOB.24.17	They all like the night rather than the morning.
JOB.24.17	And they are not afraid of things that happen at night.
JOB.24.18	If people throw things into a river, they quickly go away.
JOB.24.18	Bad people go from the earth as quickly as that.
JOB.24.18	Nothing grows in their fields.
JOB.24.18	And there are no 
JOB.24.19	Snow on the ground soon goes away when the sun shines.
JOB.24.19	And people who do wrong things soon die.
JOB.24.20	Their mothers soon forget them.
JOB.24.20	No one remembers people who have done wrong things.
JOB.24.20	Like a dead tree, they will never live again.
JOB.24.21	They are cruel to women who have no children.
JOB.24.21	And they are not kind to women whose husbands have died.
JOB.24.22	But God is strong. And he can kill people who are rich and powerful.
JOB.24.22	They may be important. But they do not know when they will die.
JOB.24.23	They think that they are safe. God may let them think that.
JOB.24.23	But he always watches them. And he sees the things that they do.
JOB.24.24	For a short time, bad people may be important, but then they die.
JOB.24.24	They are not different from anyone else and they soon die, like weeds in the ground.
JOB.24.25	I believe that my words are true. But perhaps someone can say that they are not true.
JOB.24.25	Then the words that I speak will be as good as nothing.’
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.25.2	‘God is great and he is powerful, too. So we should love him and we should be afraid of him.
JOB.25.2	In 
JOB.25.3	No one can count his armies.
JOB.25.3	And his light shines over all the earth.
JOB.25.4	God looks at all the people who live on the earth.
JOB.25.4	But he does not see anyone who is really good and completely honest.
JOB.25.5	When God looks at the moon and the stars,
JOB.25.5	they do not seem to be very bright.
JOB.25.6	So God must think that people are not very important.
JOB.25.6	In his mind they are no more important than insects.’
JOB.26.1	Then Job replied. And this is what he said.
JOB.26.2	‘I am a weak man. But nothing that you have done has saved me.
JOB.26.2	And nothing that you have said has helped me.
JOB.26.3	I am a fool. But you have not been able to make me 
JOB.26.3	And still you think that you are very clever.
JOB.26.4	I think that someone has helped you to speak these words.
JOB.26.4	I think that someone has told you the things that you should say.
JOB.26.5	Dead people go to a place that is under the sea.
JOB.26.5	But even there, they are afraid of God.
JOB.26.6	God watches the place where dead people go.
JOB.26.6	There is nothing that can hide it from him.
JOB.26.7	He puts the sky in the right place so that it covers everything.
JOB.26.7	And he hangs the earth in the skies and he holds it there.
JOB.26.8	He puts water in the clouds.
JOB.26.8	The clouds are full of water but they do not break.
JOB.26.9	When the moon is big and round, he hides it.
JOB.26.9	He causes clouds to cover it.
JOB.26.10	Look across the sea.
JOB.26.10	You can see the end of the sea.
JOB.26.10	There the sky begins.
JOB.26.10	God decided where that place should be.
JOB.26.11	If God is angry, even the walls of 
JOB.26.11	And because he is angry, they are afraid.
JOB.26.12	He is strong enough to fight against the sea.
JOB.26.12	And he is 
JOB.26.13	When he blows, the sky becomes bright.
JOB.26.13	And he is able to kill the sea 
JOB.26.14	These are only a few of the things that God can do.
JOB.26.14	No one really knows how powerful God is.’
JOB.27.1	Job continued to speak. And this is what he said.
JOB.27.2	‘God has not been fair to me.
JOB.27.2	And God, who can do anything, has made my life to be very sad.
JOB.27.3	That is what my life has been like.
JOB.27.3	But while I am alive, I will promise this to God.
JOB.27.4	I will always say things that are true.
JOB.27.4	And I will always be honest.
JOB.27.5	I will never agree that you are right.
JOB.27.5	Until my death, I will never say things that are wrong.
JOB.27.6	I will continue to be honest.
JOB.27.6	During all of my life, my 
JOB.27.7	My enemies are bad people.
JOB.27.7	I pray that God will 
JOB.27.8	A bad person cannot hope to have a happy life.
JOB.27.8	In the end, God will cause him to die.
JOB.27.9	God does not hear him when he asks for God's help.
JOB.27.10	He should always ask God to show him the right way to live.
JOB.27.10	But because he does not do that, he does not enjoy his life.
JOB.27.11	I will teach you about the power of God.
JOB.27.11	And I will explain to you the things that God will do to bad people.
JOB.27.12	You have all seen this yourselves.
JOB.27.12	So you should not still say things that mean nothing.
JOB.27.13	I will tell you what God will do to a bad person.
JOB.27.13	I will tell you how God will 
JOB.27.14	A bad person may have many children, but they will all die.
JOB.27.14	Some will die in the war. Other people will die because they do not have enough food to eat.
JOB.27.15	Some will live for a longer time but, in the end, an illness will kill them.
JOB.27.15	And their wives will not weep when they are dead.
JOB.27.16	A bad man may have more money than he can count.
JOB.27.16	And he may have more clothes than he could ever wear.
JOB.27.17	But, in the end, a good man will wear those clothes.
JOB.27.17	And an honest man will spend all that money.
JOB.27.18	The house of a bad man will not be any stronger than the home of an insect.
JOB.27.18	Nor will it be any better than a worker's hut.
JOB.27.19	A bad man may be very rich.
JOB.27.19	But soon he will find that all his money has gone.
JOB.27.20	He will become afraid as quickly as a 
JOB.27.20	A storm will come in the night and it will kill him.
JOB.27.21	The east wind takes him away, and he is gone.
JOB.27.21	It removes him from his home.
JOB.27.22	It is so strong that he cannot fight against it.
JOB.27.22	He can only do one thing. He can try to run away from it.
JOB.27.23	People will see a bad man leave his home.
JOB.27.23	And God will make them happy when they see that.’
JOB.28.1	Job continued to speak.
JOB.28.1	‘People know how to dig under the ground to find 
JOB.28.1	And they know how to heat gold to remove all the dirt from it.
JOB.28.2	They understand how to get iron from under the ground.
JOB.28.2	And they know how to choose the stones that they can get 
JOB.28.3	They look for these metals in places that are deep under the ground.
JOB.28.3	They take lights with them that help them to see in the dark.
JOB.28.4	They dig a very deep hole that is far from towns or cities.
JOB.28.4	They work alone. And they hang on strong lines to help them climb down into the hole.
JOB.28.5	We grow our food in the fields.
JOB.28.5	But deep under the ground there is fire.
JOB.28.6	And among the stones there, people can find pieces of gold.
JOB.28.7	People go to places where birds have never been.
JOB.28.7	And they find things that birds have never seen.
JOB.28.8	Wild animals do not walk there.
JOB.28.8	And 
JOB.28.9	Men break into the hard rock.
JOB.28.9	And they look beneath the mountains.
JOB.28.10	They dig through the rock.
JOB.28.10	And they discover stones that are very valuable.
JOB.28.11	They look in the places where rivers start.
JOB.28.11	And they bring into the light the things that they find there.
JOB.28.12	But people do not know where they can find 
JOB.28.12	Nor do they know where they can learn to be 
JOB.28.13	People do not understand that it is good to be 
JOB.28.13	And in none of the places where people live can anyone find 
JOB.28.14	No one will find 
JOB.28.14	Even in the deepest sea, no one will find it.
JOB.28.15	You cannot buy 
JOB.28.15	You may have lots of gold and 
JOB.28.16	It is worth more than 
JOB.28.17	Neither a gold cup nor a beautiful glass is as valuable as 
JOB.28.17	If you sold all your gold, you still could not buy 
JOB.28.18	The price of it is more than the price of 
JOB.28.19	Nor can anyone buy it, not even with the best gold.’ 
JOB.28.20	‘So people know how to do many things.
JOB.28.20	But they do not know where to find 
JOB.28.21	Many people live on the earth, but none of them has found 
JOB.28.21	Even the birds that fly above the earth cannot see it.
JOB.28.22	People who have died may have heard about 
JOB.28.22	But they cannot tell us where we can find it.
JOB.28.23	Only God understands how we can be 
JOB.28.23	And only he knows where we can find 
JOB.28.24	He knows this because he knows everything.
JOB.28.24	And he sees everything that happens on the earth.
JOB.28.25	He decided the power of the wind.
JOB.28.25	And he decided the size of the seas.
JOB.28.26	He tells the rain where it should fall.
JOB.28.26	And he decides where storms should go.
JOB.28.27	When he had done these things, he thought about 
JOB.28.27	He knew that it was valuable. And he said that it was good.
JOB.28.28	God spoke to all the people. And he said this:
JOB.28.28	“If you want to live the right way, you must not do wrong things.
JOB.28.28	If you want to be 
JOB.28.28	You should do these things because I am God.”’
JOB.29.1	Job continued to speak. And this is what he said.
JOB.29.2	‘There was a time, many months ago, when I was happy.
JOB.29.2	At that time, God watched the things that I did.
JOB.29.2	And because he was with me, bad things did not happen to me.
JOB.29.3	He was my guide and he showed me how to live the right way.
JOB.29.3	His light seemed to shine on my head.
JOB.29.4	At that time, I was strong and I had good health.
JOB.29.4	God was my best friend and he kept my home safe.
JOB.29.5	He was always with me.
JOB.29.5	And my children were still alive.
JOB.29.6	At that time, I got plenty of milk from my cows.
JOB.29.6	And I got lots of oil from my 
JOB.29.7	Sometimes I went to the gate of the city.
JOB.29.7	There I sat down with the people who ruled the city.
JOB.29.8	Young men moved to let me go by.
JOB.29.8	Even the old men stood up when I arrived.
JOB.29.9	And they covered their mouths with their hands.
JOB.29.10	The 
JOB.29.10	They closed their mouths and they did not say anything.
JOB.29.11	People heard the things that I said. They saw the things that I did.
JOB.29.11	And they were happy because of them.
JOB.29.12	When poor people needed help, I saved them.
JOB.29.12	And if children had no parents, I helped them.
JOB.29.13	I helped men who were near to death. And they thanked me for my help.
JOB.29.13	I made 
JOB.29.14	Everyone knew that I always did right things.
JOB.29.14	I was always fair and I was always honest.
JOB.29.15	If people could not see, I guided them.
JOB.29.15	If people could not walk, I fetched things for them.
JOB.29.16	If poor people came to me for help, I was like their father.
JOB.29.16	I helped strangers when they had no one else to speak for them.
JOB.29.17	I destroyed the power of cruel men.
JOB.29.17	I saved the people that they had attacked.
JOB.29.18	I thought that I would live to be an old man.
JOB.29.18	And then I would die in my own house with my family round me.
JOB.29.19	I always had good health.
JOB.29.19	I was like a tree that had plenty of water.
JOB.29.20	I thought that I would always be strong.
JOB.29.20	I thought that I would always be a great man.
JOB.29.21	Men waited patiently to hear what I would say.
JOB.29.21	They knew that I was 
JOB.29.22	After I spoke, they did not speak again.
JOB.29.22	They were happy to hear the things that I said to them.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me to speak to them.
JOB.29.23	The things that I said were valuable to them, like rain in the spring.
JOB.29.24	They were surprised when I smiled at them.
JOB.29.24	And my smile made them happy.
JOB.29.25	I told them what they should do. I lived among them like a king who lives with his army.
JOB.29.25	And when they were sad, I helped them to be happy again.’
JOB.30.1	‘Now young men are cruel to me and they say bad things about me.
JOB.30.1	I would not even let their fathers help me with my sheep.
JOB.30.2	These fathers were strong when they were young. But now they are old.
JOB.30.2	And they are so weak that they cannot do any work for me.
JOB.30.3	They are thin because they do not have anything to eat.
JOB.30.3	At night, they run and hide in the 
JOB.30.4	In the 
JOB.30.4	And to keep warm at night, they burn the 
JOB.30.5	People tell them to go away from the towns and cities.
JOB.30.5	The same people shout at them as they would shout at robbers.
JOB.30.6	They live among the rocks in dry valleys where there had been rivers.
JOB.30.6	Or they live in holes that they make in the sides of hills.
JOB.30.7	The sounds that they make are like the sounds of wild animals.
JOB.30.7	And they hide together among the bushes to try to get warm.
JOB.30.8	They are like fools and no one recognises them.
JOB.30.8	And people do not want them to live near them.
JOB.30.9	Now their sons sing songs about me that are not nice.
JOB.30.9	They enjoy it when they are cruel to me.
JOB.30.10	They do not like me and they stay away from me.
JOB.30.10	But if they see me, they 
JOB.30.11	God has made me weak and he has nearly killed me.
JOB.30.11	So they can do to me anything that they want.
JOB.30.12	From one side, the crowd attacks me. They push me so that I have to run away.
JOB.30.12	They are like an army that waits to beat the enemy. And I am their enemy.
JOB.30.13	They do not let me get away from them. When they attack, they really want to kill me.
JOB.30.13	And they know that no one will come to help me.
JOB.30.14	I cannot stop them when they come near me.
JOB.30.14	When I fall down, they rush to attack me.
JOB.30.15	Every day that I live, I am afraid. No one thinks that I am an important man now.
JOB.30.15	And my money has gone as quickly as a cloud passes across the sky.
JOB.30.16	My life will soon end.
JOB.30.16	Every day I have pains in my body.
JOB.30.17	At night, my bones are painful.
JOB.30.17	The pains that I feel never go away.
JOB.30.18	Because of the things that God has done to me, my clothes do not fit me.
JOB.30.18	And my skin does not seem to be the right shape any more.
JOB.30.19	He knocks me down and I fall in the dirt.
JOB.30.19	I am no better than ashes on the ground.
JOB.30.20	I shout to you, God, but you do not answer me.
JOB.30.20	When I stand to pray, you do not listen to me.
JOB.30.21	You have become cruel to me.
JOB.30.21	You are strong. And you can attack me when you choose.
JOB.30.22	You send a strong wind to attack me.
JOB.30.22	And you destroy me in the storm.
JOB.30.23	I know that you will cause me to die soon.
JOB.30.23	That happens to everyone who lives on this earth.
JOB.30.24	People do not usually attack someone who has fallen.
JOB.30.24	They do not refuse to help someone who asks for help.
JOB.30.25	I wept when I saw people with troubles in their lives.
JOB.30.25	I was sorry to see poor people who needed help.
JOB.30.26	I hoped that I would be happy. But bad things happened to me.
JOB.30.26	And when I looked for light, everything round me was dark.
JOB.30.27	There is never a day when I feel well.
JOB.30.27	Every day I have pain and I feel sick.
JOB.30.28	I feel sad. And even when the sun shines it seems to me to be dark.
JOB.30.28	I stand up in a public place and there I shout to ask for help.
JOB.30.29	My voice is like a 
JOB.30.29	After dark, I make noises like birds in the night.
JOB.30.30	There are holes in my skin, which has become black.
JOB.30.30	And I have a 
JOB.30.31	Before all these things happened to me, I was happy. And I enjoyed music.
JOB.30.31	Now I am not happy. So I only sing songs that are sad.’
JOB.31.1	‘I have promised that I will not look at young women in a wrong way.
JOB.31.2	God is angry with men who have thoughts like that.
JOB.31.2	He will cause bad things to happen to me if I do that.
JOB.31.3	He is angry with people who do any kind of wrong thing.
JOB.31.3	And bad things will happen to people who do not live the right way.
JOB.31.4	God sees all the things that I do.
JOB.31.4	And he watches where I go.
JOB.31.5	I have always said things that are true.
JOB.31.5	And I have always been an honest man.
JOB.31.6	I ask God to be fair when he thinks about me.
JOB.31.6	He should know that I have never done any wrong things.
JOB.31.7	God may think that I have not lived the right way.
JOB.31.7	Or he may think that I have not always obeyed him.
JOB.31.7	Perhaps, in some other way, I have done something that was wrong.
JOB.31.8	If any of these things is true, someone else can dig my fields.
JOB.31.8	And they can eat the plants that have grown there.
JOB.31.9	I have not decided to have sex with another man's wife.
JOB.31.9	I have not waited outside her door until she was alone.
JOB.31.10	If I had done those things, my wife should cook food for someone else.
JOB.31.10	And she should have sex with other men.
JOB.31.10	But I have not done those things.
JOB.31.11	If I loved the wife of another man, it would be a very bad thing.
JOB.31.11	I want God to kill me if I ever do something as bad as that.
JOB.31.12	It would be very dangerous if I loved another woman.
JOB.31.12	It could destroy my whole life as a fire can destroy everything round it.
JOB.31.13	My servants, both men and women, sometimes had problems.
JOB.31.13	But if they spoke to me about their problems, I always answered them fairly.
JOB.31.14	God might ask me questions about that.
JOB.31.14	But if I had not listened to them, I could not have answered him honestly.
JOB.31.15	God made me and he made my servants too.
JOB.31.15	He made us both and we both grew inside our mothers.
JOB.31.16	I have never refused to help people who are poor.
JOB.31.16	And I have always helped 
JOB.31.17	I have never kept my food for myself.
JOB.31.17	I have always given some of my food to 
JOB.31.18	Since I was a young man, I have been kind to 
JOB.31.18	And I have always been kind to 
JOB.31.19	I have seen people who were too poor to buy clothes.
JOB.31.19	I have met people who had no coat to wear.
JOB.31.20	So I took material from my sheep's backs and I made warm clothes for them.
JOB.31.20	And they thanked me because I was very kind to them.
JOB.31.21	I did not have to be kind to 
JOB.31.21	But I was never cruel to them.
JOB.31.22	The things that I say are true.
JOB.31.22	But if they are not true, then someone can break my arm.
JOB.31.23	I could never do wrong things because I was afraid of God.
JOB.31.23	He hates people who do wrong things. And I was afraid that he would kill me.
JOB.31.24	I know that money will not make me happy.
JOB.31.24	And if I own lots of gold I will still not be a powerful man.
JOB.31.25	I have worked all my life and got a lot of money.
JOB.31.25	But that has never been the most important thing to me.
JOB.31.26	Sometimes I look at the sun when it shines in the sky.
JOB.31.26	And sometimes I watch the moon when it shines at night.
JOB.31.27	But I have never believed the sun or the moon to be gods.
JOB.31.27	Nor have I ever wanted to 
JOB.31.28	That would have been false.
JOB.31.28	And God would have been angry if I had done something like that.
JOB.31.29	I do not smile if someone beats my enemy in a war.
JOB.31.29	It does not make me happy when I see my enemy's troubles.
JOB.31.30	I have never wanted to see the death of my enemy.
JOB.31.30	That would have been a wrong thing for me to do.
JOB.31.31	There are many men who work in my house as my servants.
JOB.31.31	They know that I always welcome strangers.
JOB.31.32	Travellers are always welcome in my home.
JOB.31.32	And no stranger has ever slept in the street outside my house.
JOB.31.33	Some people try to hide the wrong things that they have done.
JOB.31.33	I have never done that.
JOB.31.34	I do not stay inside my house. I do not refuse to speak.
JOB.31.34	I am not afraid to hear the things that people say about me.
JOB.31.34	I am an honest man.
JOB.31.34	And I will speak about the wrong things that I have done.
JOB.31.35	I really need someone to listen to the things that I say.
JOB.31.35	All the things that I say are true.
JOB.31.35	God may believe that I have done wrong things.
JOB.31.35	If he does, then he should write them down.
JOB.31.36	Then I would wear his list on my shoulder.
JOB.31.36	Or I would put it on my head like a 
JOB.31.37	I would tell God everything that I have done.
JOB.31.37	I would come to speak to him, as a king would come to visit another king.
JOB.31.38	I have not taken land from anyone else.
JOB.31.38	I have not taken it from other people who owned it.
JOB.31.39	I have paid for the food that I have eaten.
JOB.31.39	And I have never been so cruel to farmers that they died.
JOB.31.40	But if I have done any of those things, then I want weeds to grow in my fields.
JOB.31.40	I do not want 
JOB.31.40	I want very bad weeds to grow there instead.’
JOB.31.40	That is the end of all the words that Job spoke.
JOB.32.1	Job had said again and again that he was a completely honest man. So his three friends did not argue with him any more. 
JOB.32.2	But another man called Elihu was also there. He was the son of Barachel. (Barachel lived in a place called Buz.) And Elihu became very angry with Job because of the things that Job had said. Job had said that he had never done any wrong things. And he had said that God had caused all his troubles. 
JOB.32.3	Elihu was also angry with Job's three friends. They had not been able to answer Job's questions. And they had said that Job had caused all his own problems. 
JOB.32.4	The three friends were older than Elihu. So he had not spoken to Job. Instead, he had let them speak first. 
JOB.32.5	But, in the end, he saw that the three men did not have anything more to say. And he became very angry. 
JOB.32.6	So Elihu spoke. And this is what he said.
JOB.32.6	‘I am young and you are old.
JOB.32.6	So I was afraid to tell you the things that I know.
JOB.32.7	I thought, “Older men should speak.
JOB.32.7	They should be able to teach other people how to be 
JOB.32.8	But it is the Spirit of 
JOB.32.8	And the Spirit helps men to be 
JOB.32.9	It is not only older people who are 
JOB.32.9	It is not only older people who know the right way to live.
JOB.32.10	So I say, listen to me.
JOB.32.10	I too will tell you the things that I know.
JOB.32.11	I waited while you spoke. I listened while you explained your reasons to Job.
JOB.32.11	And I listened while you tried to find the right words to say to him.
JOB.32.12	I listened carefully to you. But Job did not believe the things that you said.
JOB.32.12	And none of you was able to answer his questions.
JOB.32.13	Do not say, “We are 
JOB.32.13	Do not say, “God, not man, will explain to Job why Job is wrong.”
JOB.32.14	Job was speaking to you and not to me.
JOB.32.14	But I will not answer his questions in the way that you did.
JOB.32.15	Your friends, Job, are sad and confused. They are quiet now because they cannot help you.
JOB.32.15	There is nothing more that they can say.
JOB.32.16	They stand there and are not able to answer you.
JOB.32.16	But surely I need not be quiet because they do not say anything.
JOB.32.17	There are things that I, too, want to say to you.
JOB.32.17	I, too, will tell you what I know.
JOB.32.18	There are many things that I want to say.
JOB.32.18	It is now time for me to tell you my thoughts.
JOB.32.19	I can hardly wait to speak to you.
JOB.32.19	I am like a bottle of 
JOB.32.20	Please help me. Let me speak to you.
JOB.32.20	I must open my mouth and reply to you.
JOB.32.21	I will not say good things about someone because he is important.
JOB.32.21	Nor will I say good things about anyone if they are not true.
JOB.32.22	I am too honest to do that.
JOB.32.22	If I am not honest, then God will remove me.’
JOB.33.1	‘But now, Job, listen to the things that I will tell you.
JOB.33.1	Listen carefully to everything that I say.
JOB.33.2	I will speak to you now.
JOB.33.2	I am ready to tell you the thoughts that are in my mind.
JOB.33.3	I am an honest man. So you can believe the words that I speak.
JOB.33.3	All the things that I will say are true.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me.
JOB.33.4	I am alive because of him.
JOB.33.5	Answer me now, Job, if you can.
JOB.33.5	Prepare yourself and get ready to speak with me.
JOB.33.6	When God looks at us, we are all like each other.
JOB.33.6	God made both of us from dirt.
JOB.33.7	There is no reason why you should be afraid of me.
JOB.33.7	I will not do anything that might hurt you.
JOB.33.8	But I have heard you speak, Job.
JOB.33.8	And these are the words that you spoke.
JOB.33.9	You said, “I am an honest man.
JOB.33.9	I have not done anything that was wrong.
JOB.33.10	But God says that I have done wrong things.
JOB.33.10	And he thinks that I am his enemy.
JOB.33.11	I cannot go far because he has tied my feet.
JOB.33.11	And he always watches me. So he knows where I go.”
JOB.33.12	But I tell you this, Job, you are not right.
JOB.33.12	You know that God is greater than any man.
JOB.33.13	So you should not argue with him.
JOB.33.13	You should not say that he does not answer any of your questions.
JOB.33.14	God does speak to a man.
JOB.33.14	He speaks to him again and again.
JOB.33.14	But often the man does not listen to him.
JOB.33.14	And he does not hear the things that God has said.
JOB.33.15	Sometimes God speaks to a man at night, while he is asleep in bed.
JOB.33.15	He speaks by the things that he dreams about.
JOB.33.16	When God speaks in that way, a man listens to him.
JOB.33.16	And sometimes he is afraid because of the things that God says to him.
JOB.33.17	God speaks to him to tell him that he must not to do wrong things.
JOB.33.17	A man may think that he is important.
JOB.33.17	But God tells him that he is not very important.
JOB.33.18	God will not let anyone kill him.
JOB.33.18	He saves him from death.
JOB.33.19	He may have illnesses that are very painful.
JOB.33.19	God can send an illness like that to teach a man the right way to live.
JOB.33.20	Then a man feels sick if he looks at food.
JOB.33.20	He cannot eat even the food that he likes most.
JOB.33.21	He was well but now he has become very thin.
JOB.33.21	He is so thin that people can see his bones.
JOB.33.22	He is so ill that he will soon die.
JOB.33.22	Then he will go to the place where all dead people go.
JOB.33.23	God has thousands of 
JOB.33.23	Perhaps an 
JOB.33.24	Then God will be kind to that sick person.
JOB.33.24	And God will say, “I have found someone to pay on behalf of this person. So keep him alive.”
JOB.33.25	He will become well again.
JOB.33.25	And he will be strong, like a young man.
JOB.33.26	He will pray to God and God will answer him.
JOB.33.26	He will again be God's friend.
JOB.33.26	And he will enjoy that.
JOB.33.26	God will know him to be a good man again.
JOB.33.27	Then he will say to people, “I did wrong things.
JOB.33.27	I did not live the right way but God 
JOB.33.28	God paid to save me from death.
JOB.33.28	And now I will live to enjoy the light.”
JOB.33.29	God does all these things to people.
JOB.33.29	He does them twice and sometimes three times.
JOB.33.30	He saves them from death.
JOB.33.30	Then he lets them again enjoy their lives.
JOB.33.31	Now, Job, listen to the things that I will say.
JOB.33.31	Be quiet, and I will speak to you.
JOB.33.32	There may be something that you want to say. If there is, then say it.
JOB.33.32	Then I will be able to say to everyone that you are a good man.
JOB.33.33	But you may not want to say anything. If not, then listen to me.
JOB.33.33	Be quiet and I will teach you about 
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu continued to speak. And this is what he said.
JOB.34.2	‘Hear the words that I speak, you 
JOB.34.2	Listen to me, you men who have learned many things.
JOB.34.3	You recognise nice food when you eat it.
JOB.34.3	And you ought to understand the words that you hear.
JOB.34.4	We should decide what is right.
JOB.34.4	And we should agree together what is true.
JOB.34.5	Job has said, “I am an honest man.
JOB.34.5	But God does not agree with me.
JOB.34.6	I am right.
JOB.34.6	But nobody believes me.
JOB.34.6	I have not done anything wrong.
JOB.34.6	But I am like a man who has his last illness.”
JOB.34.7	There has never been a man like Job.
JOB.34.7	He laughs at God as easily as a man drinks water.
JOB.34.8	He meets with men who do wrong things.
JOB.34.8	And his friends are bad people.
JOB.34.9	Job says that people should not try to obey God.
JOB.34.9	If they do, they will not get anything back.
JOB.34.10	So listen to me, you men who understand everything.
JOB.34.11	If a man has been kind to other people, God is kind to him.
JOB.34.11	But God will do to a bad man the things that he has done to other people.
JOB.34.12	No one thinks that God could ever do anything wrong.
JOB.34.12	All the things that he does, he does fairly.
JOB.34.13	God is the ruler of the whole world.
JOB.34.13	And nobody gave that job to him!
JOB.34.14	God gave us our lives.
JOB.34.14	So he can decide if he wants to take them from us.
JOB.34.15	If he did that, everyone would die together.
JOB.34.15	And people would become dirt again.
JOB.34.16	If you can understand my words, then hear me.
JOB.34.16	And listen to me when I speak to you.
JOB.34.17	God could not rule fairly if he were not a good God.
JOB.34.17	He is powerful and he is always fair. So you cannot say that he has been cruel to you.
JOB.34.18	It is God who removes kings and rulers.
JOB.34.18	He may do this if they have been bad kings or bad rulers.
JOB.34.19	God made us all. So it does matter to him that someone is a king's son.
JOB.34.19	And he is no kinder to a rich person than he is to a poor person.
JOB.34.20	Anyone can die in a moment, in the middle of the night.
JOB.34.20	People die, even if no person has tried to kill them.
JOB.34.21	He watches the way that people live.
JOB.34.21	They can go anywhere that they want. But he will always be able to see them.
JOB.34.22	There is no place dark enough for people to hide from God.
JOB.34.22	It does not matter where they are. He can always see them.
JOB.34.23	In the end, people will have to explain to God how they have lived their lives.
JOB.34.23	But God does not need to tell them when they will have to do that.
JOB.34.24	God does not need to ask what rulers have done. He may decide to remove them.
JOB.34.24	And he will make other men rulers instead of them.
JOB.34.25	He knows that the bad rulers have done wrong things.
JOB.34.25	So, in the night, he kills them.
JOB.34.26	He 
JOB.34.26	He does this because they have done wrong things.
JOB.34.27	They have not lived in the way that he wanted them to live.
JOB.34.27	And they have not done the things that he told them to do.
JOB.34.28	Because of the things that they did, poor people had to ask God for help.
JOB.34.28	And God heard those poor people and he helped them.
JOB.34.29	But God might have decided not to help those poor people.
JOB.34.29	And no one could say that he was wrong to decide that.
JOB.34.29	If he hides himself, no one can see him.
JOB.34.29	But he rules over men and countries.
JOB.34.30	He does not let bad people rule.
JOB.34.30	In this way, he saves the people from bad rulers.
JOB.34.31	Someone may say to God, “I have done wrong things.
JOB.34.31	But I am sorry and I will not do them again.
JOB.34.32	I may not have understood that some things were wrong.
JOB.34.32	Tell me about such things and I will not do them again either.”
JOB.34.33	But Job, you refuse to say that you are sorry.
JOB.34.33	So there is no reason why God should 
JOB.34.33	You must decide what you will do. I cannot decide for you.
JOB.34.33	So give me a true answer – what have you decided?
JOB.34.34	This is what they will say to me.
JOB.34.35	“Job speaks like a fool.
JOB.34.35	He does not understand the things that he says.”
JOB.34.36	Job, it is right that bad things should happen to you.
JOB.34.36	You have spoken like a bad man would speak.
JOB.34.37	You have done wrong things. And now you are refusing to obey God.
JOB.34.37	You are playing games with us. And you have now said many bad things against God.’
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu spoke to Job again. And this is what he said.
JOB.35.2	‘The things that you say cannot be right.
JOB.35.2	“God knows that I have not done anything wrong.” That is what you say.
JOB.35.3	But you ask him why you should live the right way.
JOB.35.3	You ask this also. “What do I get if I only do good things?”
JOB.35.4	I would like to reply to you.
JOB.35.4	And I will speak, too, to the friends who are with you.
JOB.35.5	Look up at the sky to see what is there.
JOB.35.5	Look at the clouds that are so high above you.
JOB.35.6	If you do wrong things, that will not hurt God.
JOB.35.6	If you do many wrong things, it will not change him.
JOB.35.7	You do not give anything to God if you are always good.
JOB.35.7	He does not receive from you because you do good things.
JOB.35.8	Only you feel the result of the wrong things that you do.
JOB.35.8	And only other people get something as a result of the good things that you do.
JOB.35.9	People shout when they have a lot of trouble.
JOB.35.9	They ask for help when powerful people attack them.
JOB.35.10	God made men. And when they are sad, he causes them to be happy.
JOB.35.10	But none of them asks where he is.
JOB.35.11	He teaches more things to us than he teaches to animals.
JOB.35.11	And he makes us 
JOB.35.12	People may ask him to help them.
JOB.35.12	But he does not help them because they do so many wrong things.
JOB.35.13	They may pray to God. But they do not believe that he will answer them.
JOB.35.13	So God does not even listen to them.
JOB.35.14	You say that you do not see him. And you say that you wait for him to answer you.
JOB.35.14	So there is no reason why he should listen to you either.
JOB.35.15	You say that God does not 
JOB.35.15	But you think that he does not see them.
JOB.35.16	So, Job, you do not understand what you say.
JOB.35.16	And the words that you speak do not mean anything.’
JOB.36.1	Elihu continued to speak. And this is what he said.
JOB.36.2	‘Please be patient and listen to me.
JOB.36.2	I want to say something else on behalf of God.
JOB.36.3	I have learned many things during my life.
JOB.36.3	And I know that God is always fair.
JOB.36.4	Everything that I say to you is true.
JOB.36.4	You can be sure about that because I am a really 
JOB.36.5	God is powerful and he does not 
JOB.36.5	But when he decides to do something, he does it.
JOB.36.6	He does not let bad people live for a long time.
JOB.36.6	But he is always fair to people who have problems.
JOB.36.7	He sees people who live the right way.
JOB.36.7	And he makes them famous so that they rule like kings.
JOB.36.8	Sometimes people have trouble in their lives.
JOB.36.8	And they cannot discover what has caused their trouble.
JOB.36.9	Then he tells them what they have done.
JOB.36.9	They have done wrong things and they have not listened to him.
JOB.36.10	He causes them to listen to him.
JOB.36.10	And he tells them that they must not continue to 
JOB.36.11	God wants them to be his servants and to obey him.
JOB.36.11	If they do that, they will be rich. And they will be happy until they die.
JOB.36.12	But some people do not listen to God and they do not obey him.
JOB.36.12	Such people do not know the right way to live.
JOB.36.12	And someone will fight against them and kill them.
JOB.36.13	When people do not obey God, they become angry.
JOB.36.13	Even when God 
JOB.36.14	They die while they are still young.
JOB.36.14	They have wasted their lives. They have lived among men who have sex with other men.
JOB.36.15	But God helps people who have troubles.
JOB.36.15	And he causes them to hear his words.
JOB.36.16	God does not want you to have trouble in your life, Job.
JOB.36.16	He wants to make you safe and to take your problems away.
JOB.36.16	He wants you to have a comfortable life.
JOB.36.16	And he wants you to have plenty of nice food.
JOB.36.17	But now God is 
JOB.36.17	But, in the end, he will be fair to you.
JOB.36.18	You are a rich man, but be careful.
JOB.36.18	Rich people often do wrong things to get even more money.
JOB.36.19	You may be a rich man, but this will not help you.
JOB.36.19	Even if you try, you will not be able to get out of trouble.
JOB.36.20	Do not wait until it is night.
JOB.36.20	Do not take people away from their homes in the dark.
JOB.36.21	God let you have troubles in your life. He did this to make you think about your life.
JOB.36.21	So be careful that you live the right way.
JOB.36.22	You know that God is powerful.
JOB.36.22	And he is also the best teacher.
JOB.36.23	Nobody can tell God what he should do.
JOB.36.23	And no one can say to him, “You have done things that are wrong.”
JOB.36.24	People sing songs to say that God is great.
JOB.36.24	You should do that, too.
JOB.36.25	Men everywhere have seen the things that God has done.
JOB.36.25	But we can only see them from far away.
JOB.36.26	God is so great that we cannot know him completely.
JOB.36.26	We do not know how long he has lived.
JOB.36.27	It is God who takes water from the earth.
JOB.36.27	Then he makes it into rain.
JOB.36.28	The rain falls from the clouds.
JOB.36.28	And so there is enough water for everyone.
JOB.36.29	Nobody understands how the clouds move through the sky.
JOB.36.29	And nobody understands the noise that storms make.
JOB.36.30	In a storm, the clouds are dark. But he causes the light to shine brightly.
JOB.36.30	It shines even on things that are deep under the sea.
JOB.36.31	This is the way that God rules the world.
JOB.36.31	He sends storms. But he gives to people all the food that they need.
JOB.36.32	He sends the storms where he wants them to go.
JOB.36.32	And he tells them what they should hit.
JOB.36.33	Loud noises in the sky show that a storm is coming soon.
JOB.36.33	Then even the cows in the fields know that there will soon be a storm.’
JOB.37.1	‘A storm like that makes me very afraid.
JOB.37.2	Listen well to God's words.
JOB.37.2	Listen to the loud noise when he speaks.
JOB.37.3	He sends 
JOB.37.3	It goes in all directions.
JOB.37.4	After the 
JOB.37.4	When he speaks, it is like the sound of 
JOB.37.5	When God speaks, great things happen.
JOB.37.5	He does things that we can never understand.
JOB.37.6	He tells the snow to drop on the earth.
JOB.37.6	And when it rains, he causes lots of rain to drop on the ground.
JOB.37.7	People need to see what God can do. He made them and he rules the weather.
JOB.37.7	And when the weather is bad like that, people are not able to work.
JOB.37.8	The wild animals hide among the rocks.
JOB.37.8	Or they stay in the places where they sleep at night.
JOB.37.9	The storm comes from the south.
JOB.37.9	And the cold winds come from the north.
JOB.37.10	Ice covers the rivers and lakes.
JOB.37.10	The cold wind that makes the ice is like God's 
JOB.37.11	He fills the clouds with water.
JOB.37.11	And he sends the 
JOB.37.12	The clouds move across all the earth.
JOB.37.12	They go where he sends them.
JOB.37.13	He sends the clouds so that there is water on the earth.
JOB.37.13	Sometimes he does this when he has to 
JOB.37.13	Sometimes he does it to show them that he loves them.
JOB.37.14	Listen to the things that I tell you.
JOB.37.14	Stop, Job. Think about all the great things that God does.
JOB.37.15	God makes the clouds move.
JOB.37.15	But you do not know how he does that.
JOB.37.15	He makes the 
JOB.37.15	But you do not know how he does that either.
JOB.37.16	You cannot explain how the clouds stay up in the sky.
JOB.37.16	Only God can do all these things, because he knows how to do everything.
JOB.37.17	When the warm wind blows from the south in summer, everything is hot.
JOB.37.17	And you are too warm in the clothes that you wear.
JOB.37.18	Then the sky becomes like a metal mirror that makes everything even warmer.
JOB.37.18	God has made it like that. And you cannot help him do it.
JOB.37.19	You think that you are 
JOB.37.19	Help us, Job, because we do not know what to say to him.
JOB.37.20	I will not ask if I can speak to God.
JOB.37.20	If I ask, he might kill me.
JOB.37.21	The winds have blown all the clouds away.
JOB.37.21	Now no one can look at the sun, which shines brightly in the sky.
JOB.37.22	People can see lovely colours in the sky, towards the north. But they cannot see God.
JOB.37.22	He is too bright and too beautiful for us to look at.
JOB.37.23	God is so powerful that we cannot come near to him.
JOB.37.23	But he is always kind and fair to everyone.
JOB.37.24	People may think that they are 
JOB.37.24	But they are afraid of him, because only he is really 
JOB.38.1	While a storm continued, the 
JOB.38.2	‘You have asked many questions about the things that I do, Job.
JOB.38.2	But you do not really understand the things that you say.
JOB.38.3	Now be brave, and listen to me.
JOB.38.3	There are many things that I want to tell you.
JOB.38.4	You were not there when I made the world.
JOB.38.4	If you know so many things, tell me about that.
JOB.38.5	I decided how large the world should be.
JOB.38.5	I am sure that you know that!
JOB.38.6	You do not know how I made the world.
JOB.38.6	But it was I who put it in the right place.
JOB.38.7	When I did this, the 
JOB.38.7	And even the stars seemed to sing, too.
JOB.38.8	At the beginning of time, I made the sea.
JOB.38.8	I decided where it should begin. And I decided how far it should go.
JOB.38.9	Above the sea, I made the clouds.
JOB.38.9	And everything was dark.
JOB.38.10	I decided where the land would be.
JOB.38.10	And the sea could not come there.
JOB.38.11	I said to the sea, “This is as far as you can come.
JOB.38.11	This is where you must stop.”
JOB.38.12	You, Job, have never said when night should end.
JOB.38.12	And you could not tell the morning when it should start.
JOB.38.13	Bad things happen at night. And when day comes, they stop.
JOB.38.13	But you could not tell the light when to cover the earth.
JOB.38.14	When the day comes, people can see things clearly.
JOB.38.14	And the shape of the earth becomes clear, like someone who is wearing a coat.
JOB.38.15	The light of day is too bright for people who do bad things.
JOB.38.15	In the day, they stop doing things that are wrong.
JOB.38.16	You have not explored where the water in the sea comes from.
JOB.38.16	Nor have you gone to the deepest part of the sea.
JOB.38.17	You have not seen the place where dead people go.
JOB.38.17	Nor do you know the way to that place.
JOB.38.18	You do not understand how big the world is.
JOB.38.18	Tell me, Job, if you know all these things.
JOB.38.19	You do not know where light comes from.
JOB.38.19	And you do not know how the dark begins.
JOB.38.20	You do not know where to find them.
JOB.38.20	You do not know how to get there.
JOB.38.21	But you have lived for many years.
JOB.38.21	So perhaps you do know all these things.
JOB.38.22	You have not visited the place where I keep all the snow.
JOB.38.22	And you have not seen the place where I keep the 
JOB.38.23	I keep the snow and the 
JOB.38.23	I keep them to use when there are wars.
JOB.38.24	You do not understand where 
JOB.38.24	Nor do you know how the wind from the east blows over the earth.
JOB.38.25	I decide where the rivers should go.
JOB.38.25	And I tell the storm which way to go.
JOB.38.26	I send the rain to places where no one lives.
JOB.38.26	And it falls in the 
JOB.38.27	It falls on ground where there has been no rain for a long time.
JOB.38.27	And it makes the grass grow again.
JOB.38.28	The rain does not have a father.
JOB.38.28	No one knows where 
JOB.38.29	Ice does not have a mother.
JOB.38.29	No one knows why the ground is cold and hard in the morning.
JOB.38.30	In very cold weather, water becomes hard like stone.
JOB.38.30	And there is even ice on top of the sea.
JOB.38.31	You cannot tie together the beautiful 
JOB.38.31	And you cannot change the shape of 
JOB.38.32	You cannot put the stars in the right place at different times of the year.
JOB.38.32	And you cannot tell the Great 
JOB.38.33	You do not know how everything in the sky stays in the right place.
JOB.38.33	And you do not understand, either, how I rule the earth.
JOB.38.34	You cannot speak to the clouds.
JOB.38.34	You cannot tell them to cover the earth with water.
JOB.38.35	You cannot send the 
JOB.38.35	Even if you tried to do that, nothing would happen.
JOB.38.36	And you do not understand everything about the weather, either.
JOB.38.37	You are not clever enough to count the clouds.
JOB.38.37	Nor can you send water from the sky, like a person who pours it from a pot.
JOB.38.38	Rain can make the 
JOB.38.38	But you cannot cause the rain to fall.
JOB.38.39	You do not look for food to feed hungry 
JOB.38.39	The mother of the young 
JOB.38.40	She looks for food while the young 
JOB.38.40	She brings them food while they wait in the bushes.
JOB.38.41	You do not feed the 
JOB.38.41	When the young 
JOB.39.1	‘You do not know when young goats are born on the mountains.
JOB.39.1	You are not there to see the young 
JOB.39.2	You do not know how many months it will be until the birth of the young 
JOB.39.2	Nor do you know when they will be born.
JOB.39.3	The 
JOB.39.3	Then they have no more pain.
JOB.39.4	The young animals become fit and strong.
JOB.39.4	When they have grown, they leave their parents. And they will not return to them.
JOB.39.5	The wild 
JOB.39.5	I let them do that.
JOB.39.6	I decided that the 
JOB.39.6	And I decided that they would live there.
JOB.39.7	They do not go near cities where there is a lot of noise.
JOB.39.7	They do not listen to people who might want them to work.
JOB.39.8	They live on the hills where they look for food.
JOB.39.8	They look for nice green grass to eat.
JOB.39.9	A wild 
JOB.39.9	Nor will it stay in your farm at night.
JOB.39.10	It will not let you fasten it to a plough.
JOB.39.10	Nor will it plough the fields for you.
JOB.39.11	The wild 
JOB.39.11	But you cannot be sure that it will help you to do your work.
JOB.39.12	It will not help you to pick the plants in your fields.
JOB.39.12	Nor will it help you to bring them into your farm.
JOB.39.13	The 
JOB.39.13	But the 
JOB.39.14	The 
JOB.39.14	And it lets them get warm in the sand.
JOB.39.15	It does not know that a person's foot may break them.
JOB.39.15	And it does not know that a wild animal may walk on them.
JOB.39.16	It is careless with its eggs. It does not know that they are its eggs.
JOB.39.16	They were the result of its work. But it will not be sad if someone breaks them.
JOB.39.17	This is because I did not make the 
JOB.39.17	And I did not make it able to think properly.
JOB.39.18	But when the 
JOB.39.18	It can run past the fastest horse.
JOB.39.19	You, Job, did not make horses strong.
JOB.39.19	Nor did you give them all the long hair that they have on their necks.
JOB.39.20	You did not make them able to jump like 
JOB.39.20	And horses also frighten people because of the loud noises that they make.
JOB.39.21	A horse knows that it is very strong.
JOB.39.21	It hits its foot on the ground when it is ready to fight.
JOB.39.22	A horse is not afraid of anything.
JOB.39.22	It is not even afraid when it carries a soldier with his 
JOB.39.23	The soldier's 
JOB.39.23	And the horse feels the 
JOB.39.24	It wants to run as fast as it can.
JOB.39.24	When it hears the 
JOB.39.25	When it hears the sound of the 
JOB.39.25	People may be far away. But it can hear them when they fight.
JOB.39.25	It can hear the officers in the army when they shout to the soldiers.
JOB.39.26	The 
JOB.39.26	You do not teach it to fly toward the south in winter.
JOB.39.27	You do not tell the 
JOB.39.27	You do not show it where to build its home up in the mountains.
JOB.39.28	Its home is among the highest rocks where it stays at night.
JOB.39.28	It knows that it is safe there.
JOB.39.29	From there it can look for its food, even if it is far away.
JOB.39.29	It can see small animals that it wants to catch.
JOB.39.30	Its food is the small animals that it kills.
JOB.39.30	And then the young 
JOB.40.1	The 
JOB.40.2	‘I am God. Do you still want to argue with me?
JOB.40.2	You say that I have done wrong things. Now you must explain what you mean.’
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	‘I am a silly man and I cannot reply to you properly.
JOB.40.4	I put my hand over my mouth and I will not say anything.
JOB.40.5	I have said too much already.
JOB.40.5	There is nothing more that I want to say.’
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	‘Stand up and be brave.
JOB.40.7	I will speak to you, and you must answer me.
JOB.40.8	You think that I am not fair to you.
JOB.40.8	And you think that you are always right.
JOB.40.9	But you are not as strong as I am.
JOB.40.9	And your voice is not as loud as mine is.
JOB.40.10	If you were like me, you could put on lovely clothes.
JOB.40.10	And you could show everyone how beautiful you are.
JOB.40.11	You could show everyone how angry you can be.
JOB.40.11	People think that they are very clever. You could show them that they are not so clever.
JOB.40.12	You could do that, Job, if you were like me.
JOB.40.12	And, when you find them, you could kill bad people, too.
JOB.40.13	You could bury them all in the ground.
JOB.40.13	You could send them to the place where dead people go.
JOB.40.14	If you can do these things, then even I would 
JOB.40.14	Then I would agree that you could save yourself.
JOB.40.15	Look at the Great Animal.
JOB.40.15	I made it and I made you. It eats only grass, like a cow.
JOB.40.16	But how strong its legs are!
JOB.40.16	And how powerful its stomach is!
JOB.40.17	Its tail is as straight as a tall tree.
JOB.40.17	Its legs are thick and they are strong.
JOB.40.18	Its bones are as strong as 
JOB.40.18	Its back legs and its front legs are as strong as iron.
JOB.40.19	I have not made anything bigger or better than the Great Animal.
JOB.40.19	And only I am stronger than the Great Animal.
JOB.40.20	The wild animals may play in the grass on the side of the hill.
JOB.40.20	But the Great Animal comes and eats the grass next to them.
JOB.40.21	It lies under the bushes.
JOB.40.21	It hides among the plants that grow at the edge of the lake.
JOB.40.22	It rests under the trees that grow near the river.
JOB.40.22	Then it can stay cool because the sun does not shine on it.
JOB.40.23	Even when the river is deep and strong, it is not afraid.
JOB.40.23	The River Jordan may be all round it, but it still feels safe.
JOB.40.24	No one can catch the Great Animal.
JOB.40.24	No one can put a ring in its nose and lead it away.’
JOB.41.1	‘You cannot catch a 
JOB.41.1	Nor can you tie its mouth to stop it biting you.
JOB.41.2	You cannot fasten a line to its nose.
JOB.41.2	Nor can you put a 
JOB.41.3	It will not ask you to stop being cruel to it.
JOB.41.3	And it will not speak to you politely.
JOB.41.4	It will not agree to work for you.
JOB.41.4	And you cannot make it your slave for always.
JOB.41.5	It is not a friendly animal, like a bird that you can keep in your home.
JOB.41.5	And it is not the kind of animal that your children can play with.
JOB.41.6	No one will buy it to sell it.
JOB.41.6	And no one will cut it up and try to sell it in shops.
JOB.41.7	You cannot put long knives into its skin to catch it.
JOB.41.7	Nor can you put a sharp stick into its head to kill it.
JOB.41.8	If you touch it, you will never forget it.
JOB.41.8	It will fight with you and you will never touch it again!
JOB.41.9	You cannot hope to catch it, because it will always be too strong.
JOB.41.9	As soon as you see it, you will be afraid of it.
JOB.41.10	No one is silly enough to wake it. Everyone knows that it is too strong.
JOB.41.10	And I made it! So no one will be able to fight against me.
JOB.41.11	There is nothing that I must pay to anyone.
JOB.41.11	Everything in the world is mine.
JOB.41.12	Let me tell you all about this animal.
JOB.41.12	It is strong and it has a large body and powerful legs.
JOB.41.13	Its skin is so thick that no one could remove it.
JOB.41.13	And people are afraid to go near it.
JOB.41.14	Nobody would try to open its mouth.
JOB.41.14	Anyone who sees its teeth would be very afraid.
JOB.41.15	Its back has very thick skin to keep it safe.
JOB.41.15	There are no spaces into which you could put a knife.
JOB.41.16	Each piece of skin is very near the next one.
JOB.41.16	Not even air can pass between them.
JOB.41.17	There is no space between the pieces of skin.
JOB.41.17	And no one can separate them.
JOB.41.18	It makes a loud noise and its eyes are very bright.
JOB.41.18	Its eyes are as red as the sky at dawn.
JOB.41.19	Fire comes from its mouth.
JOB.41.19	And 
JOB.41.20	Smoke comes from its nose.
JOB.41.20	It is like smoke that comes from a fire of weeds under a pot.
JOB.41.21	The air that comes from its mouth can light a fire.
JOB.41.21	And 
JOB.41.22	Its neck is very strong.
JOB.41.22	It frightens people when they see it.
JOB.41.23	There is no weak place anywhere on its skin.
JOB.41.23	Its whole body is as strong as iron.
JOB.41.24	Its front is hard like rock.
JOB.41.24	It is as hard as a stone.
JOB.41.25	Even strong and brave people are afraid when it moves towards them.
JOB.41.25	They run away because it might hit them with its tail.
JOB.41.26	No one can hurt it, even with a 
JOB.41.26	None of your sharp 
JOB.41.27	It can break iron as easily as a thin stick.
JOB.41.27	It can break 
JOB.41.28	Stones cannot hurt it.
JOB.41.29	A heavy stick seems to it like a piece of dry grass.
JOB.41.29	It laughs when it hears the sound of a 
JOB.41.30	Its stomach is sharp, like bits of a pot that someone has broken.
JOB.41.30	When it moves along, it leaves marks on the ground, like a plough.
JOB.41.31	The water seems to boil when it swims in it.
JOB.41.31	When it swims down deep, the water is like a pot of oil.
JOB.41.32	When it moves through the water, the water behind it shines.
JOB.41.32	The water seems to have become white.
JOB.41.33	Nowhere in the world is there anything that is as strong as this animal.
JOB.41.33	And it is not afraid of anything.
JOB.41.34	It is stronger than even the strongest of animals.
JOB.41.34	It is like the king of all the wild animals.’
JOB.42.1	Then Job replied to the 
JOB.42.2	‘I know that you can do all things. Nobody can beat you.
JOB.42.2	You are powerful. And you can do anything that you want to do.
JOB.42.3	I do not know much. And you asked me why I talk so much.
JOB.42.3	I have talked about the surprising things that you do.
JOB.42.3	But I did not understand them.
JOB.42.4	You told me to listen and to answer your questions.
JOB.42.5	I had heard about you from other people.
JOB.42.5	Now I have seen you with my own eyes.
JOB.42.6	So I do not like the things that I said.
JOB.42.6	I sit here in the ashes.
JOB.42.6	I am doing that to show you that I am sorry.’
JOB.42.7	The 
JOB.42.7	‘The things that my servant Job has said about me are true. But the things that you said were not true. So I am angry with you and your two friends. 
JOB.42.8	I want you to go to Job and to 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar obeyed the 
JOB.42.10	So Job prayed for his three friends. After that, the 
JOB.42.11	Then Job had a party for his brothers and sisters and for his friends. They each told Job how sad they had been. They had been very sad because the 
JOB.42.12	The 
JOB.42.13	As well as seven sons, Job had three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	Their names were Jemimah, Keziah, and Keren-Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	They were the most beautiful women in the whole country. Job said what should happen after his death. His sons and his daughters should have all the things that had belonged to him. 
JOB.42.16	Job lived for another 140 years. He lived until he had seen his grandchildren and their grandchildren. 
JOB.42.17	When, in the end, he died, he was a very old man.
PSA.1.1	The man is very happy that does not:
PSA.1.1	· walk as 
PSA.1.1	· stand in the way near 
PSA.1.1	· sit with them that 
PSA.1.2	He likes what the 
PSA.1.2	He repeats it day and night. 
PSA.1.3	‘He will become like a tree planted by rivers of water.’
PSA.1.3	‘It will give its fruit in its season. Its leaves will not fall’
PSA.1.3	‘Everything that he does will be very good.’ 
PSA.1.4	But the godless are like 
PSA.1.4	The wind blows them away. 
PSA.1.5	So godless people will not stand in the 
PSA.1.5	Sinners will not stay with 
PSA.1.6	The 
PSA.1.6	The way of the godless leads to death. 
PSA.2.1	Why are nations planning together?
PSA.2.1	Why are people having such stupid ideas?
PSA.2.2+PSA.2.3	Why are their kings saying,
PSA.2.2+PSA.2.3	‘We will not obey the 
PSA.2.2+PSA.2.3	Why are their leaders saying,
PSA.2.2+PSA.2.3	‘We will not do what his 
PSA.2.4	He that is sitting above the skies will laugh.
PSA.2.4	The 
PSA.2.5	Then he will say angry words to them.
PSA.2.5	He will make them very frightened because he is so angry.
PSA.2.6	He will say, ‘I myself put my king in 
PSA.2.6	I put him on my 
PSA.2.7	I will tell you what God has decided to do.
PSA.2.7	The 
PSA.2.7	Today I have given you the 
PSA.2.8	Ask me for anything! I will give you 
PSA.2.8	The whole world can be yours.
PSA.2.9	You will rule them with an iron 
PSA.2.9	You will break them like a 
PSA.2.10	So now, you kings, be careful.
PSA.2.10	You world leaders, listen to this:
PSA.2.11	Become the servants of the 
PSA.2.11	Remember that he is very powerful.
PSA.2.12	Kiss his son or God will be angry.
PSA.2.12	He may be so angry that you will die.
PSA.2.12	Only the people that come to the 
PSA.2.12	He will make them safe. 
PSA.3.1	Many people fight me.
PSA.3.2	Many people say about me,
PSA.3.2	‘God will not 
PSA.3.3	But 
PSA.3.3	You are my 
PSA.3.3	You have lifted up my head. 
PSA.3.4	I shouted aloud to the 
PSA.3.4	He answered me from his 
PSA.3.4	SELAH
PSA.3.5	I lay down and slept.
PSA.3.5	I awoke because the 
PSA.3.5	He kept me safe.
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of 10000 enemies that are all round me.
PSA.3.7	, stand up! My God, save me!
PSA.3.7	In the past, you hit all my enemies in the face.
PSA.3.7	You broke their teeth.
PSA.3.8	It was the 
PSA.3.8	, do good things for all your people.
PSA.3.8	SELAH 
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I shout for help, O God.
PSA.4.1	You are the God that makes me 
PSA.4.1	Give me help in my troubles.
PSA.4.1	Show me that you are kind.
PSA.4.1	Listen to me when I pray.
PSA.4.2	· how long will you say that I am bad?
PSA.4.2	· how long will you love stupid ideas?
PSA.4.2	· how long will you want to hear lies?
PSA.4.3	Sons of man:
PSA.4.3	· the 
PSA.4.3	· the 
PSA.4.3	· the 
PSA.4.4	Get angry – but do nothing wrong. Go to bed.
PSA.4.4	Argue with yourself – but say nothing aloud.
PSA.4.4	SELAH 
PSA.4.5	Offer the right gifts and believe in the 
PSA.4.6	Many people say, ‘Who will do anything good for us?’
PSA.4.6	, shine the light of your face on us.
PSA.4.7	You have made me feel happy deep down inside me.
PSA.4.7	I feel better than I do at a 
PSA.4.8	I will lie down in 
PSA.4.8	This is because only you, 
PSA.5.1	Listen to what I am saying to you.
PSA.5.2	My king and my God, listen to my voice.
PSA.5.2	I am praying to you for help.
PSA.5.2	I am shouting to you!
PSA.5.3	, at sunrise you will hear my voice.
PSA.5.3	I will watch and pray early in the morning. 
PSA.5.4	My God, you do not like what is wrong.
PSA.5.4	Bad people cannot live with you.
PSA.5.5	Some people think that they are important.
PSA.5.5	They cannot stay near to God.
PSA.5.5	God, you hate everyone that does wrong.
PSA.5.6	You destroy all that do not speak the truth.
PSA.5.6	The 
PSA.5.6	He hates people that do not keep their promises. 
PSA.5.7	But I will come into your house
PSA.5.7	because you are so loving and kind.
PSA.5.7	I will bend low in your 
PSA.5.8	Lead me in your 
PSA.5.8	because of my enemies.
PSA.5.8	Make your path straight for me. 
PSA.5.9	Nothing that my enemies say is true.
PSA.5.9	They want to destroy me.
PSA.5.9	Their mouth is like an open grave.
PSA.5.9	They only speak what is not true.
PSA.5.10	God, tell them that they are not right.
PSA.5.10	Show them that their ideas are wrong.
PSA.5.10	Send them away because they are bad.
PSA.5.10	They argued with you. 
PSA.5.11	Make all the people happy that hide with you.
PSA.5.11	Make them always sing for 
PSA.5.11	Cover them that love your name. Keep them safe.
PSA.5.11	Then they will 
PSA.5.12	, you do such good things to the righteous.
PSA.5.12	Your love is all round them. 
PSA.6.1	Please do not become angry.
PSA.6.2	, be kind to me because I am not strong.
PSA.6.2	, give me health because my bones are afraid.
PSA.6.3	I myself am very frightened. 
PSA.6.4	, come back. Give me back my life.
PSA.6.4	Make me safe because of your kind love.
PSA.6.5	Nobody that dies can remember you.
PSA.6.5	Who can 
PSA.6.6	I am weak with crying.
PSA.6.6	My bed swims on my 
PSA.6.6	The place where I sleep is 
PSA.6.7	My eyes are so sad that they are growing weak.
PSA.6.7	They are becoming old because of all my enemies. 
PSA.6.8	Go away from me all you bad people.
PSA.6.8	The 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.10	All those that hate me will be very much ashamed.
PSA.6.10	They will also be disappointed.
PSA.6.10	They will be disappointed and soon they will turn away. 
PSA.7.1	, my God, I am hiding in you.
PSA.7.1	Keep me safe from all those people that are trying to catch me.
PSA.7.1	Make me safe,
PSA.7.2	or he will tear me to pieces as a wild animal would.
PSA.7.2	He will tear me to pieces and nobody will find me.
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	, my God, if I did this:
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	· if my hand did something wrong
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	· if I did something bad to a friend
PSA.7.3+PSA.7.4	· if I robbed my enemy without a reason
PSA.7.5	then I want him to catch me.
PSA.7.5	I want him to knock me to the ground.
PSA.7.5	I want him to kill and bury me.
PSA.7.6	, get up and show that you are angry.
PSA.7.6	Fight my angry enemies.
PSA.7.6	Wake up, my God, and tell us who is right.
PSA.7.7	I want everybody to stand round you.
PSA.7.7	Rule over them from above.
PSA.7.8	, tell us who is right when people argue.
PSA.7.8	LORD 
PSA.7.9	Stop the 
PSA.7.9	God of the righteous, look at how we think and feel.
PSA.7.10	God Most High is a

PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge.
PSA.7.11	God shows his

PSA.7.12	He will bend his bow and make it ready. 
PSA.7.13	He will prepare 
PSA.7.13	He will make ready 
PSA.7.14	Look! The bad man is 
PSA.7.14	He

PSA.14.3	But everybody has turned away from God.
PSA.14.3	They have all become evil.
PSA.14.3	Nobody does anything that is good.
PSA.14.4	Will they never learn? They do evil.
PSA.14.4	They eat my people as easily as they eat bread.
PSA.14.4	They never talk to the 
PSA.14.5	There they were afraid. They were very much afraid.
PSA.14.5	This was because God was with the 
PSA.14.6	They tried to stop the plans of the poor people.

PSA.34.8	The man that trusts in him will be very happy. 
PSA.34.9	Oh,

PSA.34.10	Young lions may need food and become hungry.
PSA.34.10	People that pray to the 
PSA.34.11	Children, come and listen to me.
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	Which one of you finds pleasure in life?
PSA.34.12	Who wants time to see good things?
PSA.34.13	Do not say anything 
PSA.34.13	or let your lips tell anything that is false.
PSA.34.14	Turn away from evil and do good things.
PSA.34.14	Look for 
PSA.34.15	The 
PSA.34.15	Nobody in all the earth will remember them.
PSA.34.16	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.16	and his ears listen when they pray.
PSA.34.17	The 
PSA.34.17	He saves them from all their troubles. 
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	He saves those whose 
PSA.34.19	Many evil things happen to the 
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	The 
PSA.34.20	Not one of them becomes broken. 
PSA.34.21	Evil things will kill very bad people.
PSA.34.21	The 
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	and not punish anyone that 
PSA.35.1	Fight 
PSA.35.2	Pick up a small 
PSA.35.2	Get up and give me help.
PSA.35.3	Pull out a small 
PSA.35.3	Use them against the people that are running after me.
PSA.35.3	Say to me. ‘I will make you safe.’
PSA.35.4	Some people want to kill me.
PSA.35.4	I hope that they will become ashamed.
PSA.35.4	I hope that everyone else will think that they are very bad.
PSA.35.4	Some people are planning to destroy me.
PSA.35.4	Turn them back and confuse them.
PSA.35.5	Make them become like 
PSA.35.5	Let the 
PSA.35.6	Make their way dark and dangerous.
PSA.35.6	Let the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	Do this because they hid a trap for me.
PSA.35.7	There was no reason for it.
PSA.35.7	For no reason they dug a 
PSA.35.8	Surprise him and destroy him!
PSA.35.8	Catch him in the trap that he hid! Let him die in his own pit!
PSA.35.9	Then I will be 
PSA.35.9	I will be happy when the 
PSA.35.10	All my bones will shout, ‘
PSA.35.10	You take the poor man away from the man that is too strong for him.
PSA.35.10	You take the people that need help away from those that hurt them.’ 
PSA.35.11	People say that they saw me do bad things.
PSA.35.11	They asked me about it, but I knew nothing.
PSA.35.12	They paid me 
PSA.35.12	I felt as if my children had died.
PSA.35.13	When they were ill I wore clothes made from 
PSA.35.13	I hurt myself by not eating food.
PSA.35.13	My 
PSA.35.14	I cried when I walked about. I became bent because I was so sad.
PSA.35.14	I lived as though my friend or my brother or even my mother was ill.
PSA.35.15	But when I fell down they laughed.
PSA.35.15	They all met together. They came together against me.
PSA.35.15	I did not know the people that were attacking me.
PSA.35.15	They would not stop hurting me.
PSA.35.16	They were like 
PSA.35.16	They showed their teeth like a wild animal.
PSA.35.17	 how long will you watch this?

PSA.35.20	They do not talk about 
PSA.35.20	They say false things to the people in the land that do not want trouble.
PSA.35.21	They open wide their mouth 
PSA.35.21	They say, ‘

PSA.35.26	Do this to them that laughed at me when I became hurt:
PSA.35.26	· make them ashamed and confused at the same time
PSA.35.26	· make them sorry that they said that they were greater than me
PSA.35.26	· make them feel that they are wearing

PSA.37.34	He will give you help. The land will be yours.
PSA.37.34	You will see when godless people become cut off. 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the godless man with great power.
PSA.37.35	He was a tree growing in the best place for it. 
PSA.37.36	But he died. He did not remain alive.
PSA.37.36	I looked for him but I did not find him.
PSA.37.37	Think about the 
PSA.37.37	Look at the man that is good.
PSA.37.37	He will have peace in the end.
PSA.37.38	But God will destroy people that do not obey him.
PSA.37.38	In the end God will cut off godless people.
PSA.37.39	The 
PSA.37.39	He will give them help in time of trouble.

PSA.38.1	Do not punish me because you are so angry with me.
PSA.38.2	For your 
PSA.38.2	and your hand has come down on me. 
PSA.38.3	My body is very ill because you are so angry
PSA.38.3	and there is no health in my bones because of my sin. 
PSA.38.4	Also, my sin has gone over my head!
PSA.38.4	Like a heavy weight, it is too heavy for me to carry. 
PSA.38.5	This is because I was so stupid.
PSA.38.6	My sins have bent me down, I am very near to the ground.
PSA.38.6	Every day I walk about in black clothes. 
PSA.38.7	Also, there is a 
PSA.38.7	There is nothing good in my body. 
PSA.38.8	I am very weak. Everything is pushing down on me.
PSA.38.8	I am making a noise like a wild animal because my heart is so sad.
PSA.38.9	, you know everything that I want.
PSA.38.9	Nothing can hide me from you when I cry.
PSA.38.10	My heart is 
PSA.38.10	There is no light in my eyes. 
PSA.38.11	My family and my friends stay away from 
PSA.38.11	The people that live near me stay far from me. 
PSA.38.12	Also, the people that are trying to kill me 
PSA.38.12	Those people that want bad things to happen to me
PSA.38.12	are planning to destroy me.
PSA.38.12	They only think about their lies all day long. 
PSA.38.13	But I am like a deaf man. I hear nothing.
PSA.38.13	Also, I am like a dumb man. I do not open my mouth.
PSA.38.14	So, I have become like someone that hears but does not answer. 
PSA.38.15	O 
PSA.38.15	I believe that you will answer me, O 
PSA.38.16	I say this so that my enemies will not laugh at me.
PSA.38.16	When my foot 
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to fall and my pain is always with me. 
PSA.38.18	But I will say that I have done bad things.
PSA.38.18	My sin is always a trouble to me. 
PSA.38.19	Many people hate me for no reason.
PSA.38.19	A lot of people are saying lies about me.
PSA.38.20	Some people 
PSA.38.20	They fight me when I try to do what is good. 
PSA.38.21	Do not leave me, O 
PSA.38.21	O God, do not go far away from me.
PSA.38.22	Hurry to give me help, O 
PSA.39.1	I said, I will be careful what I do so that I do not sin.
PSA.39.1	I will be careful what
PSA.39.2	I say.
PSA.39.2	I will shut my mouth when the 
PSA.39.3	I will be like a dumb man and not speak.
PSA.39.3	I will not even talk about good things.
PSA.39.3	But it hurt me to do this and the pain in my heart grew worse.
PSA.39.3	It was like a fire inside me when I thought about it.
PSA.39.3	I just had to say something! 
PSA.39.4	O 
PSA.39.4	how long it will be and when it will finish.
PSA.39.4	Then I will know how weak I am.
PSA.39.5	Look, you have made my life just as wide as my hand!
PSA.39.5	The length of my life is as nothing to you.
PSA.39.5	It is true that the life of everybody is like the wind.
PSA.39.6	People walk about just like shadows.
PSA.39.6	They are like the wind.
PSA.39.6	They get a lot of money,
PSA.39.6	but they do not know who will have it when they die. 
PSA.39.7+PSA.39.8	Now, what do I hope for, O 
PSA.39.7+PSA.39.8	I am hoping for you to 
PSA.39.7+PSA.39.8	Do not put me where fools will laugh at me.
PSA.39.9	I will not say anything.
PSA.39.9	I will not open my mouth, because you have done something! 
PSA.39.10	Do not hit me again.
PSA.39.10	Your hand is hurting and destroying me.
PSA.39.11	You speak 
PSA.39.11	You make all that is pleasant in them fly away like a 
PSA.39.11	It is true that everyone is like the wind.
PSA.39.11	SELAH
PSA.39.12	O 
PSA.39.12	Listen to me when I cry. Do not be dumb to my 
PSA.39.12	I am an 
PSA.39.13	Look away from me.
PSA.39.13	Then I will be happy until I live no more and die. 
PSA.40.1	I was patient while I waited for the 
PSA.40.1	He turned to me and he heard me when I prayed for help.
PSA.40.2	He lifted me out of the 
PSA.40.2	and from very wet ground.
PSA.40.2	He put my feet on a rock and made me walk without falling. 
PSA.40.3	He gave me a new song to sing.
PSA.40.3	It was a 
PSA.40.3	Many people will see what happened and be afraid.
PSA.40.3	Then they will 
PSA.40.4	The man that trusts in the 
PSA.40.4	He does not listen to proud people that turn to false gods.
PSA.40.5	, my God, you have done many wonderful things.
PSA.40.5	Nobody can tell you about your plans for us.
PSA.40.5	If I say that I will talk about them,
PSA.40.5	there would be too many to speak about! 
PSA.40.6	You did not want a 
PSA.40.6	You have made a hole in my ears.
PSA.40.6	You did not ask for a 
PSA.40.7	Then I said, ‘Here I am.
PSA.40.7	In this book someone wrote about me.’ 
PSA.40.8	I am 
PSA.40.8	and your rules are in my heart.
PSA.40.9	I talk about the good news of (how to become) 
PSA.40.9	Look, 
PSA.40.10	I do not keep the righteous things that you do to myself.
PSA.40.10	I do not hide (from people) that they can trust in you.
PSA.40.10	I tell everyone that your kind love will 
PSA.40.10	Also, I (show them) the truth.
PSA.40.11	You, 
PSA.40.11	Your kind love and your truth will always 
PSA.40.12	But trouble is all round me.
PSA.40.12	I cannot see how much there is.
PSA.40.12	My sins have followed me and caught me.
PSA.40.12	I cannot see anything.
PSA.40.13	, please save me!
PSA.40.13	, hurry to give me help!
PSA.40.14	There are people that want to kill me.
PSA.40.14	I hope that they will become ashamed and confused.
PSA.40.14	There are people that want to destroy me.
PSA.40.14	I hope that everyone will say that they are bad people.
PSA.40.15	I want all those people that say to me ‘
PSA.40.15	to become very sorry for what they have done.
PSA.40.16	I want everyone that is looking for you to be happy, very happy.
PSA.40.16	I want everyone that loves it when you 
PSA.40.16	‘
PSA.40.17	But I am poor and I need help.

PSA.41.1	The 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	He will be happy where he lives.
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	to do what they want to do with him. 
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	Every time that he is ill, you will make him well again. 
PSA.41.4	I said, ‘
PSA.41.5	My enemies say bad things about me.
PSA.41.5	They say ‘When will he die?
PSA.41.5	When will people forget his name?’ 
PSA.41.6	And if one (of them) comes to see me, he tells lies.
PSA.41.6	He fills his mind with bad things to say about me.
PSA.41.6	Then he goes out and tells everyone.
PSA.41.7	All the people that hate me 
PSA.41.7	They hope that worse things will happen to me. 
PSA.41.8	They say that ‘someone put a 
PSA.41.8	so he will never get up from his bed.’ 
PSA.41.9	Even my best friend has lifted up his 
PSA.41.9	He was someone that I 
PSA.41.9	someone that I often ate food with in my home. 
PSA.41.10	But you, 
PSA.41.10	Raise me up so that I can 
PSA.41.11	I know that you are 
PSA.41.11	because my enemy does not shout over me that he has won.
PSA.41.12	You will help me because I am honest.
PSA.41.12	You will always keep me near to you.
PSA.41.13	Say good things about the 
PSA.41.13	He always was the God of Israel and he always will be!
PSA.42.1	My 
PSA.42.2	My soul is 
PSA.42.2	When can I come and see the face of God? 
PSA.42.3	All day and all night I cry and do not eat.
PSA.42.3	All day my enemies say to me, ‘Where is your God?’
PSA.42.4	My soul cries inside me when I remember that:
PSA.42.4	· I went with a crowd to 
PSA.42.4	· I went to the house of God
PSA.42.4	· there was the sound of singing
PSA.42.4	· there was a loud noise of people thanking you and dancing. 
PSA.42.5	My soul, why are you so sad?
PSA.42.5	Why are you so 
PSA.42.5	Hope in God because I will 
PSA.42.5	When God is with me, he will do great things for me. 
PSA.42.6	My 
PSA.42.6	So I will remember you my God from:
PSA.42.6	· the land of the Jordan river
PSA.42.6	· the mountains of Hermon
PSA.42.6	· the hill of Mizar.
PSA.42.7	The deep waters make a noise when your 
PSA.42.7	All your big 
PSA.42.8	In the day time the 
PSA.42.8	At night his song is with me.
PSA.42.8	My 
PSA.42.9	I will say to the God that is my Rock,
PSA.42.9	‘Why did you forget me? Why must I be so sad?
PSA.42.9	You let my enemy do what he likes to me!’
PSA.42.10	My enemies hurt all my bones.
PSA.42.10	The people that fight me are always saying, ‘Where is your God?’ 
PSA.42.11	My soul, why are you so sad?
PSA.42.11	Why are you so 
PSA.42.11	Hope in God, because I will 
PSA.42.11	When God is with me, he will do great things for me. 
PSA.43.1	My God, say that I am right.
PSA.43.1	Tell it to the people that do not love me.
PSA.43.2	This is because you are my 
PSA.43.2	Why are you always so 
PSA.43.2	Why must I continue to be so sad?
PSA.43.2	You let my enemy do what he likes to me! 
PSA.43.3	Send out your light and your 
PSA.43.3	Let them be my guide.
PSA.43.3	They will bring me to your 
PSA.43.3	and to the house where you live. 
PSA.43.4	Then I will come to the 
PSA.43.4	the God that makes me happy.

PSA.44.1	God, we have heard it for ourselves.
PSA.44.1	Our fathers told it to us.
PSA.44.1	They told us what you did for them a long time ago.
PSA.44.2	Your hand pushed out the people that lived in the land
PSA.44.2	and put our fathers in.
PSA.44.2	You broke our enemies but gave help to our fathers.
PSA.44.3	Our fathers did not get the land by their own 
PSA.44.3	Their own power did not win the fight. It was you and
PSA.44.3	· your right hand
PSA.44.3	· your arm
PSA.44.3	· the light on your face
PSA.44.3	that did it because you were their friend.
PSA.44.4	You are my king. You are my God.
PSA.44.4	You are the one that said that Jacob must win.
PSA.44.5	Because of you, we pushed back our enemies.
PSA.44.5	Because of your name, we beat those that fought us.
PSA.44.6	I do not believe that my bow gave me help.
PSA.44.6	I do not think that my sword won the fight.
PSA.44.7	This is because you give us help to beat our enemies.
PSA.44.7	You make the people that 
PSA.44.8	We 
PSA.44.8	We will always praise your name.
PSA.44.9	But now you have turned away from us.
PSA.44.9	You have made us ashamed.
PSA.44.9	You do not go out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You make us run away from an enemy.
PSA.44.10	Those people that hate us take what they like from us!
PSA.44.11	You make us 
PSA.44.11	You have thrown us into other countries.
PSA.44.12	You are selling your people and the price is cheap.
PSA.44.12	You have sold them and not got anything for it!
PSA.44.13	You have made us into something that our 
PSA.44.13	Everyone round us laughs at us and 
PSA.44.14	We are as nothing among the 
PSA.44.14	Everybody is sorry for us.
PSA.44.15	I am ashamed all day long.
PSA.44.15	I do not know where to look.
PSA.44.16	This is because of:
PSA.44.16	· the bad things that people say about me
PSA.44.16	· the people that do bad things to me
PSA.44.16	· the people that are my enemies
PSA.44.16	· the people that are happy because they hurt me.
PSA.44.17	All this happened to us, but we did not forget you.
PSA.44.17	We did not forget our 
PSA.44.18	Our 
PSA.44.18	nor did our feet turn from your path.
PSA.44.19	But you broke us where the wild animals are.
PSA.44.19	You covered us with great 
PSA.44.20	If we had
PSA.44.20	· forgotten the name of our God, or
PSA.44.20	· lifted up our hands to a foreign god
PSA.44.21	would God not have discovered it?
PSA.44.21	He knows the secrets of people's hearts.
PSA.44.22	Yet because of you, people kill us all day long.
PSA.44.22	They think that we are 
PSA.44.23	Get up! Do not throw us away 
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide your face from us?
PSA.44.24	Why do you forget our trouble
PSA.44.24	and the way that people hurt us?
PSA.44.25	We have fallen down to the earth.
PSA.44.25	Our bodies are on the ground.
PSA.44.26	Wake up and give us help!
PSA.44.26	Save us, because of your kind love. 
PSA.45.1	These good words make my 
PSA.45.1	I will say these verses to the king.
PSA.45.1	My 
PSA.45.2	You are the most beautiful man that there is.
PSA.45.2	You speak words of 
PSA.45.2	God has made you special 
PSA.45.3	Wear your 
PSA.45.3	You are the 
PSA.45.3	You are great and you are the king!
PSA.45.4	Because you are the king,
PSA.45.4	ride out and beat all your enemies.
PSA.45.4	Then people that are honest
PSA.45.4	and 
PSA.45.4	Your right hand will show you
PSA.45.4	that you can do things that make people afraid.
PSA.45.5	Your sharp 
PSA.45.6	Your 
PSA.45.6	The 
PSA.45.7	You have loved things that are 
PSA.45.7	and you have 
PSA.45.7	So God, your God, has put you above the people that are with you.
PSA.45.7	He did this by putting some 
PSA.45.8	All your clothes smell of 
PSA.45.8	The beautiful 
PSA.45.8	and the music that you hear from them makes you happy.
PSA.45.9	Among your great women are the daughters of kings.
PSA.45.9	Your 
PSA.45.9	She is wearing gold from 
PSA.45.10	Daughter, listen to me.
PSA.45.10	Hear what I am saying and think about it.
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your father's house. 
PSA.45.11	You are beautiful and so the king loves you.
PSA.45.11	He is your 
PSA.45.12	Rich people will make you happy with gifts.
PSA.45.13	The daughter of the king is beautiful inside.
PSA.45.13	They made what she wore out of cotton made from gold.
PSA.45.14	They led her to the king in her beautiful clothes.
PSA.45.14	The girls that were her friends followed her.
PSA.45.15	They came in with 
PSA.45.15	as they entered the king's 
PSA.45.16	You will have sons instead of fathers.
PSA.45.16	You will make them 
PSA.45.17	I will make sure that people always remember your name.
PSA.45.17	So, people will 
PSA.46.1	God is 
PSA.46.1	He will always give us help when troubles come.
PSA.46.2	So we will not be afraid when the earth moves under our feet,
PSA.46.2	or when the mountains fall into the middle of the seas.
PSA.46.3	We will not be afraid
PSA.46.3	even when the seas make a loud noise and move a lot.
PSA.46.3	We will not be afraid
PSA.46.3	when the mountains move a lot as well.
PSA.46.4	There is a river and the waters from it make the city of God very happy.
PSA.46.4	The city is the 
PSA.46.5	God is in the middle of it. It will not fall down.
PSA.46.5	God will give it help early in the morning.
PSA.46.6	The 
PSA.46.6	When God spoke even the earth 
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	The God of 
PSA.46.8	Go and look at the things that the 
PSA.46.8	He has done surprising things in the earth!
PSA.46.9	He is the one that makes 
PSA.46.9	He breaks bows; he destroys 
PSA.46.10	Be quiet! Know that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I will make them lift me high among the 
PSA.46.10	I will make them lift me high in all the world.
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob makes us safe.
PSA.47.1	Peoples from every country, 
PSA.47.1	Shout aloud to God with the sound of happy singing.
PSA.47.2	Because the 
PSA.47.2	He is the Great King of all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He won the fight against peoples that were our enemies.
PSA.47.3	He put their soldiers under our feet. 
PSA.47.4	He chose for us the place where we live.
PSA.47.4	Jacob, that he loved, is very happy with it.
PSA.47.5	God has gone up with a great noise.
PSA.47.5	The 
PSA.47.6	Sing 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our king, sing praises!
PSA.47.7	Because God is the King of the whole earth.
PSA.47.7	Sing to him a 
PSA.47.8	God is ruling over the 
PSA.47.8	God is sitting on his 
PSA.47.9	People that want to be his servants
PSA.47.9	have joined the people that belong to Abraham's God.
PSA.47.9	The people that rule the earth belong to God.
PSA.47.9	They lifted God up very high. 
PSA.48.1	The 
PSA.48.1	His 
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion is in a beautiful place,
PSA.48.2	and it makes the whole world very happy.
PSA.48.2	It is the city of the Great King.
PSA.48.2	It is also called the High Place of Zaphon. 
PSA.48.3	God was in its 
PSA.48.4	This was when we saw the kings meeting each other.
PSA.48.4	They crossed into our country together.
PSA.48.5	Then they saw something that really surprised them.
PSA.48.5	It made them very frightened so that they hurried away!
PSA.48.6	They were so afraid that they felt pain 
PSA.48.7	It was like the east wind that destroys great ships,
PSA.48.7	like those from Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	We have seen in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	that it was just as people told us.
PSA.48.8	They told us that God would keep the city of our God safe 
PSA.48.9	When we are inside your 
PSA.48.10	Your name reaches to the ends of the world
PSA.48.10	so that people give you 
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of the good things that you do.
PSA.48.11	Because of the things that you decide to do:
PSA.48.11	· Mount 
PSA.48.11	· the daughters of 
PSA.48.12	Walk all round Zion, go to every side of it. Count the 
PSA.48.13	think about its strong buildings and make a note of its 
PSA.48.13	Then you may describe it to your children. 
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God 
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide until we die. 
PSA.49.1	Hear this, people from every country.
PSA.49.1	Everybody that is passing through this world, listen! 
PSA.49.2	Listen together,
PSA.49.2	whether you are important or not,
PSA.49.2	or whether you are rich or poor.
PSA.49.3	I will speak to you words of wisdom.
PSA.49.3	I will tell you how my 
PSA.49.4	There is a question that I have heard.
PSA.49.4	I will make music on the 
PSA.49.5	Must I be I afraid when bad things happen
PSA.49.5	and bad people are all round me?
PSA.49.6	These bad people think that their money will help them.
PSA.49.6	They are always saying how rich they are. 
PSA.49.7	A man cannot pay the price for any man.
PSA.49.7	He cannot give to God what his life costs. 
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	The life of someone costs very much.
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	He can never pay enough:
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	· so that he can stay alive 
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	· so that he will not see the 
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	Does he not see that 
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	Fools and people that are not wise will also die.
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	Their graves will be their homes for ever.
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	That is where they will always be.
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	They called their land by their own name,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	but other people will get their money.
PSA.49.12	So, even if a man has riches, he will not live for ever.
PSA.49.12	He will die, just 
PSA.49.13	This is the way that people that 
PSA.49.13	This is also the way of the people that copy them,
PSA.49.13	that say that they are right.
PSA.49.14	They will go to 
PSA.49.14	Their bodies will waste away in Sheol.
PSA.49.14	But good people will rule over them in the morning.
PSA.49.14	They will not stay in their big houses! 
PSA.49.15	For God will buy me back from the hand of Sheol.
PSA.49.15	He will hold me in his own hand.
PSA.49.15	SELAH 
PSA.49.16	Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich
PSA.49.16	and his house gets even better. 
PSA.49.17	He cannot take it with him when he dies.
PSA.49.17	Nothing will go down to Sheol with him, not even his fame!
PSA.49.18	Though good things happened to him in his life
PSA.49.18	and people will say good things to you when you have a lot of money
PSA.49.19	he will go to his fathers and people like that.
PSA.49.19	He will never see the light again. 
PSA.49.20	So, even if a man has riches, he will not always understand.
PSA.49.20	He will die, just like the animals. 
PSA.50.1	God, the powerful God, the 
PSA.50.1	He is calling everything on the earth,
PSA.50.1	from where the sun rises in the east
PSA.50.1	to where it goes down in the west.
PSA.50.2	God is shining out from 
PSA.50.3	Our God is coming and he will not be quiet.
PSA.50.3	A fire burns up everything that is in front of him.
PSA.50.3	And there is a great storm round him.
PSA.50.4	He is calling the skies above and the earth below
PSA.50.4	to say whether his people are good or bad.
PSA.50.5	He says ‘Bring my people to me.
PSA.50.5	Bring to me the people that have made a 
PSA.50.5	and have made a 
PSA.50.6	Then the skies above showed everyone about God's 
PSA.50.6	and that God himself is the 
PSA.50.7	Listen to me, my people, and I will speak to you.
PSA.50.7	I have something to say against you, Israel.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your own God.
PSA.50.8	I will not be angry with your sacrifices,
PSA.50.8	nor with you for always burning offerings to me.
PSA.50.9	I do not need a 
PSA.50.10	This is because all the animals of the forest are mine,
PSA.50.10	and all the cows and bulls on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird in the mountains.
PSA.50.11	All the farm animals are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I am hungry, I will not tell you.
PSA.50.12	This is because the world is mine
PSA.50.12	and everything that is in it.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the meat of bulls? No!
PSA.50.13	Do I drink the blood of goats? No!
PSA.50.14	Offer to God thanks.
PSA.50.14	Do what you have promised for the 
PSA.50.15	Then pray to me when you are in trouble.
PSA.50.15	I will make you safe and you will say good things to me. 
PSA.50.16	But to the bad people God says:
PSA.50.16	· why do you repeat my rules?
PSA.50.16	· why do you talk about my covenant?
PSA.50.17	For you 
PSA.50.17	You put my words behind you.
PSA.50.18	If you see someone robbing someone else then you do it with him!
PSA.50.18	If people have sex with other people's wives or husbands, you do it too!
PSA.50.19	Your mouth speaks 
PSA.50.20	You sit and say things against your own brother.
PSA.50.20	You repeat bad things about your own mother's son!
PSA.50.21	You did all this and I said nothing.
PSA.50.21	So you thought that I was just 
PSA.50.21	But I will be angry with you
PSA.50.21	and tell you to your face what you have done wrong. 
PSA.50.22	Now, everyone that forgets God, think about this,
PSA.50.22	or I will tear you into pieces.
PSA.50.22	No one will save you.
PSA.50.23	Anyone that offers me thanks is giving me 
PSA.50.23	They that live the right way will see that God will make them safe. 
PSA.51.1	Give 
PSA.51.1	Because you have so much love, forget that I did not obey you. 
PSA.51.2	Wash me from the bad feeling that I have
PSA.51.2	because of the bad thing that I did.
PSA.51.2	Make me clean from all my 
PSA.51.3	Because I know that I did not obey you
PSA.51.3	and my sin is always in front of me. 
PSA.51.4	I have sinned against you and only you.
PSA.51.4	You saw the 
PSA.51.4	And so you are right when you talk to me.
PSA.51.4	You are not wrong when you say that I am bad. 
PSA.51.5	I am sure that I have done bad things since my birth.
PSA.51.5	I have always wanted to sin since the day that I was born. 
PSA.51.6	But you want me to be good
PSA.51.6	and you want to teach me how to live in the proper way.
PSA.51.7	Make me clean with 
PSA.51.7	Wash me and I will be whiter than snow. 
PSA.51.8	I want to hear happy words that give me 
PSA.51.8	I want the bones that you broke to 
PSA.51.9	Hide your face from my sins
PSA.51.9	and forget all the bad things that I have done. 
PSA.51.10	And put a strong spirit in me. 
PSA.51.11	Do not send me away from where you are.
PSA.51.11	Do not take your 
PSA.51.12	Give me back the joy that I get when I am safe with you.
PSA.51.12	And give me a spirit that makes me strong to give help to people. 
PSA.51.13	I will teach your ways to those people that fight against you.
PSA.51.13	Then sinners will return to you. 
PSA.51.14	Take away from me the bad feeling that I have because I killed someone,
PSA.51.14	God, the God that makes me safe.
PSA.51.14	Then my 
PSA.51.15	then my mouth will say how great you are. 
PSA.51.16	For animal 
PSA.51.16	You would not want a whole burnt offering. 
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices that God wants are a broken spirit
PSA.51.17	and a broken 
PSA.51.18	In your pleasure, do good things to 
PSA.51.18	Build up the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then:
PSA.51.19	· there will be the right kind of animal sacrifice
PSA.51.19	· whole burnt offerings will bring you pleasure
PSA.51.19	· they will offer 
PSA.52.1	Why do you say how great you are, you strong but 
PSA.52.1	The kind love of God is always with us. 
PSA.52.2	Your 
PSA.52.2	It is 
PSA.52.2	You are always doing something to hurt people. 
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	You love:
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· to do evil things
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· not to do good things
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· to say 
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· not to say what is true
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· every 
PSA.52.3+PSA.52.4	· a false 
PSA.52.5	So, God will destroy you completely. He will catch you.
PSA.52.5	He will tear you away from your home.
PSA.52.5	He will pull you out from the earth where people live.
PSA.52.5	SELAH 
PSA.52.6	And good people will see it and be afraid.
PSA.52.6	But then they will laugh at him. 
PSA.52.7	‘Look at the man that did not make God his 
PSA.52.7	Instead, he 
PSA.52.7	He became strong by destroying people.’ 
PSA.52.8	But I am like tree that is growing well in the house of God.
PSA.52.8	I will always 
PSA.52.9	I will always 
PSA.52.9	I will tell your people what a good name that you have. 
PSA.53.1	A fool thinks that there is no God.
PSA.53.1	People 
PSA.53.1	None of them does anything that is good. 
PSA.53.2	God is looking down from 
PSA.53.2	He wants to see if there is:
PSA.53.2	· anyone that understands
PSA.53.2	· anyone that is looking for God 
PSA.53.3	But they have all turned away and have become evil.
PSA.53.3	Nobody does anything good, not one person.
PSA.53.4	Will the evil doers not learn?
PSA.53.4	They eat my people as easily as they eat bread.
PSA.53.4	They do not speak to God. 
PSA.53.5	They were very much afraid when there was nothing to fear!
PSA.53.5	God threw away the bones of the people that attacked you, his people.
PSA.53.5	He made the evil doers ashamed because God did not like them. 
PSA.53.6	Oh, who will come from Zion and make Israel safe?
PSA.53.6	When God makes his people rich and happy again,
PSA.53.6	Jacob will sing and Israel will dance. 
PSA.54.1	God, give me help because of your name.
PSA.54.1	Use your power to make me safe. 
PSA.54.2	God, hear my 
PSA.54.3	Because my enemies are fighting against me
PSA.54.3	and 
PSA.54.3	They do not think about God.
PSA.54.4	But God, listen and give me help!
PSA.54.5	Send back this 
PSA.54.5	Because you love what is true, destroy them.
PSA.54.6	I want to 
PSA.54.6	I want to 
PSA.54.7	Your name saved me from all my trouble.
PSA.54.7	When I looked at my enemies I saw that I had won the battle. 
PSA.55.1	God, listen to my 
PSA.55.1	Do not turn away when I cry for 
PSA.55.2	Hear me and answer me.
PSA.55.2	I cannot sleep because of my trouble. I am very 
PSA.55.3	because of what my enemies say. They give me a lot of pain.
PSA.55.3	And they are so angry that they 
PSA.55.4	My 
PSA.55.4	And all the 
PSA.55.5	Great fear and 
PSA.55.5	They are all over me. 
PSA.55.6	So I said, ‘I would like to fly away as a bird.
PSA.55.6	Then I would find 
PSA.55.7	Yes! I would go far away and live in a wild place.
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to a safe place,
PSA.55.8	safe from angry wind and storm.’ 
PSA.55.9	Because I see fighting and angry people in the city. 
PSA.55.10	They walk on its walls in the day and at night.
PSA.55.10	There are evil things and trouble inside it.
PSA.55.11	People that tell 
PSA.55.12	For it was not an enemy that laughed at me.
PSA.55.12	That would not have hurt me.
PSA.55.12	It was not someone that fought against me and said bad things to me.
PSA.55.12	I could have hidden from him!
PSA.55.13	But it was you, a man just 
PSA.55.13	We did things together, you were my best friend! 
PSA.55.14	We had good times together!
PSA.55.14	We used to go with a crowd of people to the house of God!
PSA.55.15	I want death to take my enemies by surprise!
PSA.55.15	I want them to go down to 
PSA.55.15	Because evil has made its home in them. 
PSA.55.16	But I will cry to God for help and the 
PSA.55.17	I will tell God that something is wrong,
PSA.55.17	and cry to him in the evening, in the morning and at noon.
PSA.55.17	He will listen to my voice. 
PSA.55.18	He will make me safe and well
PSA.55.18	after the many times that I have fought against people
PSA.55.18	that are my enemies.
PSA.55.19	God will listen to me and he will 
PSA.55.19	God will always be King!
PSA.55.19	SELAH
PSA.55.19	He will never change towards the people that are not afraid of God. 
PSA.55.20	But my best friend attacks his friends.
PSA.55.20	He does not do what he promised to do. 
PSA.55.21	What he says is as soft as butter, but there is war in his 
PSA.55.21	His words are as 
PSA.55.22	Take your problems to the 
PSA.55.22	The 
PSA.55.23	And you, God, you will make bad people go to the 
PSA.55.23	The pit will destroy them.
PSA.55.23	It will destroy the people that tell 
PSA.55.23	They will only live half their lives!
PSA.55.23	But I will 
PSA.56.1	God, be 
PSA.56.2	All day long my enemies are fighting me.
PSA.56.2	Many people are attacking me!
PSA.56.4	By God's help I will 
PSA.56.4	By God's help I will trust in him. I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can men on earth do to me? 
PSA.56.5	All day long they make my words mean something else
PSA.56.5	that I did not mean.
PSA.56.5	All their thoughts about me are bad thoughts against me.
PSA.56.6	They meet together and hide themselves.
PSA.56.6	They 
PSA.56.7	Do not let them 
PSA.56.7	God, destroy these people, because you are angry with them. 
PSA.56.8	You count the times when I cry because I am not happy.
PSA.56.8	Put all my 
PSA.56.8	Make sure that they are all in your book. 
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will turn back, on the day when I cry to you.
PSA.56.9	Then I will know that God is 
PSA.56.10	By God's help I will praise his word.
PSA.56.10	By the help of the 
PSA.56.11	By God's help I will 
PSA.56.11	I will not be afraid of what 
PSA.56.12	I have made special promises to you, God.
PSA.56.12	I am ready to give you thanks and praise.
PSA.56.13	This is because you have saved my life from death.
PSA.56.13	Keep my feet from falling so that I may walk before God and stay alive. 
PSA.57.1	Be 
PSA.57.1	I have looked for a place to hide in that is near to you.
PSA.57.1	I will hide under the shadow of your 
PSA.57.2	I will pray to God, the 
PSA.57.2	to the God who will finish his plan for me.

PSA.69.24	Pour out your anger on them!
PSA.69.25	I want the places where they stay to be empty
PSA.69.25	and nobody to be in their 
PSA.69.26	For they 
PSA.69.26	and talk about more pain for the people that you 
PSA.69.27	Make a note of all their 
PSA.69.27	and do not let them have your 
PSA.69.28	Take their names out of the book of life.
PSA.69.28	Take them off the list of 
PSA.69.29	But I have pain in my body and trouble in my mind.
PSA.69.29	God, 
PSA.69.30	I will 
PSA.69.30	and I will say how great he is by giving thanks.
PSA.69.31	This will bring more pleasure to the 
PSA.69.31	than an 
PSA.69.32	Poor people will see it and be happy.
PSA.69.32	People that are looking for God will have brave 
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	and he does not think bad things about his people in 
PSA.69.34	Let the skies and the earth 
PSA.69.34	And let the seas and everything that moves through them praise him! 
PSA.69.35	For God will make Zion safe.
PSA.69.35	He will build again the cities of Judah.
PSA.69.35	Then his servants will live there and it will be theirs.
PSA.69.36	As for the children of his servants,
PSA.69.36	it will stay their 
PSA.69.36	The people that love God's name will always remain there.
PSA.70.1	God, save me!
PSA.70.2	There are people that want to kill me.
PSA.70.2	I hope that they will become ashamed and confused.
PSA.70.2	There are people that want to destroy me.
PSA.70.2	I hope that everyone will say that they are bad people.
PSA.70.3	I want all those people that say to me ‘
PSA.70.3	to become very sorry for what they have done. 
PSA.70.4	I want everyone looking for you to be happy, very happy.
PSA.70.4	I want everyone that loves it when you save them to say, ‘
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and I need help.
PSA.70.5	God, hurry to give me help.
PSA.70.5	You are my help, and you save me.
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	Do not let me ever become ashamed.
PSA.71.2	Take me away from danger and make me free,
PSA.71.2	because you do what is right.
PSA.71.2	Listen to me and make me safe.
PSA.71.3	You really are a rock,
PSA.71.3	where I can always go to hide from danger.
PSA.71.3	Tell people to make me safe,
PSA.71.3	for you are my rock and my 
PSA.71.4	My God, take me from the hands of 
PSA.71.4	Take me from the 
PSA.71.5	You are my hope, Lord.
PSA.71.5	, I have trusted in you since I was young. 
PSA.71.6	Since I was born, I have trusted in you.
PSA.71.6	You have given me help since I came out of my mother's 
PSA.71.6	I will always tell you how great you are!
PSA.71.7	I make many people think of danger and become afraid.
PSA.71.7	But you are a strong and safe place for me. 
PSA.71.8	My mouth is full of saying how great you are.
PSA.71.8	All day I am saying that you are beautiful!
PSA.71.9	Do not throw me away when I am old.
PSA.71.9	Do not forget me when I am not strong. 
PSA.71.10	For my enemies say things against me
PSA.71.10	and the people that want to kill me are making plans together.
PSA.71.11	They say, ‘God has forgotten him.
PSA.71.11	Run after him and catch him! For nobody will save him.’
PSA.71.12	God, do not stay far from me.
PSA.71.12	God, give me help very soon. 
PSA.71.13	Make my enemies become completely ashamed.
PSA.71.13	Cover in 
PSA.71.14	But I, I will always have hope.
PSA.71.14	I will go on saying again and again that you are great.
PSA.71.15	My mouth will say that you are 
PSA.71.15	that you make people safe 
PSA.71.15	I will do this even if I do not know how much (you have done). 
PSA.71.16	I will come and speak about the great things that you have done,
PSA.71.16	Master and 
PSA.71.16	I will talk about how 
PSA.71.16	You, only you, are righteous.
PSA.71.17	God, you have taught me since I was young.
PSA.71.17	And until now I have told about the wonderful things that you have done.
PSA.71.18	And even when I am old and grey, do not forget me, God.
PSA.71.18	Do not forget me until I tell the people still to be born:
PSA.71.18	· about your great power and
PSA.71.18	· how strong you are. 
PSA.71.19	You are righteous, God, with 
PSA.71.19	You have done such great things, God, who is 
PSA.71.20	Even when you made me see troubles, many bad troubles,
PSA.71.20	you made me live again.
PSA.71.20	From deep under the earth you brought me up again. 
PSA.71.21	You will make me great again and make me strong.
PSA.71.22	I will sing about how great you are, with 
PSA.71.22	You do what you promise, God.
PSA.71.22	I will sing about how great you are, with 
PSA.71.22	You are the 
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout because I am so happy!
PSA.71.23	I really want to sing about how great you are.
PSA.71.23	You have bought me back. 
PSA.71.24	My 
PSA.71.24	The people that want to hurt me will become ashamed
PSA.71.24	and covered with 
PSA.72.1	God, give your 
PSA.72.1	and your 
PSA.72.2	He will rule your people with righteousness
PSA.72.2	and the poor people with justice.
PSA.72.3	With righteousness will the mountains
PSA.72.3	and the hills bring 
PSA.72.4	He will 
PSA.72.4	and save the children of those that are in need.
PSA.72.4	He will destroy 
PSA.72.5	and they will be afraid of him
PSA.72.5	as long as there is a sun and a moon.
PSA.72.6	He will be 
PSA.72.6	He will be like showers that bring water to the earth.
PSA.72.7	When he is king, a 
PSA.72.7	There will be peace until there is no moon!
PSA.72.8	He will rule from sea to sea
PSA.72.8	and from the river to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.72.9	People that live in wild places will 
PSA.72.9	and his enemies will eat the dirt. 
PSA.72.10	Kings from Spain and other far places will give him money
PSA.72.10	and kings from Arabia and Africa will bring him gifts. 
PSA.72.11	All the kings will fall down in front of him
PSA.72.11	and people in every land will become his servants.
PSA.72.12	For he will save the person in need that is crying for help.
PSA.72.12	And he will save the poor that nobody is giving help to.
PSA.72.13	He will be kind to people that are weak and in need.
PSA.72.13	He will save the lives of the people in need.
PSA.72.14	He will buy back their lives from 
PSA.72.14	Their blood is of great value in his eyes.
PSA.72.15	I pray that he will always be alive and that:
PSA.72.15	· people will give him gold from Arabia Sheba
PSA.72.15	· people will always pray for him
PSA.72.15	· people will 
PSA.72.16	There will be plenty of 
PSA.72.16	It will blow in the wind even on the top of the mountains.
PSA.72.16	Its fruit will grow as well as in Lebanon.
PSA.72.16	Even people in the towns will be as grass in a field. 
PSA.72.17	His name will remain 
PSA.72.17	It will continue as long as the sun shines.
PSA.72.17	All people will bless themselves by him
PSA.72.17	and people in every country will say that he is happy. 
PSA.72.18	Bless the 
PSA.72.18	Only he does wonderful things.
PSA.72.19	Bless his 
PSA.72.19	Fill all the earth with his 
PSA.72.20	This is the end of the 
PSA.73.1	I am sure that God is good to the people of Israel,
PSA.73.1	to the people whose hearts are clean. 
PSA.73.2	But this is what happened to me.
PSA.73.2	My feet nearly 
PSA.73.3	Some people had made themselves important.
PSA.73.3	Because I was angry, I wanted the things they had.
PSA.73.3	I saw that 
PSA.73.4	And so their bodies are fat and 
PSA.73.4	Even when they die, they feel no pain. 
PSA.73.5	They do not have trouble 
PSA.73.5	or the difficulties that hit everyone else.
PSA.73.6	So they, the godless, wear their 
PSA.73.6	The bad things that they do, they wear them like clothes.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes look out from fat faces.
PSA.73.7	Their hearts are full of 
PSA.73.8	They laugh at people and say bad things about them.
PSA.73.8	In their pride they talk about 
PSA.73.9	The mouths of the godless say that the skies belong to them.
PSA.73.9	And their 
PSA.73.10	So his God's people turn to them.
PSA.73.10	They drink everything from them the godless. 
PSA.73.11	And they God's people ask, ‘How can God know?’
PSA.73.11	And they ask ‘Does the 
PSA.73.12	This, then, is what godless people say and do.
PSA.73.12	They have no trouble and plenty of money! 
PSA.73.13	I was sure that I had made my heart clean
PSA.73.13	for no good purpose!
PSA.73.13	Also, I had washed my hands
PSA.73.13	to show that I had done nothing wrong for no reason! 
PSA.73.14	I had trouble all day
PSA.73.14	and it started to hurt me every morning!
PSA.73.15	If I had said, ‘I will agree with what the godless say’;
PSA.73.15	then I would have let down all your children.
PSA.73.16	When I thought about this,
PSA.73.16	it was so hard for me to understand.
PSA.73.17	Then I went into the house of God.
PSA.73.17	That was when I understood what would happen to them the godless. 
PSA.73.18	Then I was sure that you would put them
PSA.73.18	in a place where they would 
PSA.73.18	You would throw them down and destroy them. 
PSA.73.19	It will take just a moment to destroy them!
PSA.73.19	Great 
PSA.73.20	It will be 
PSA.73.21	When my heart hurt me and my stomach was painful. 
PSA.73.22	I was 
PSA.73.22	I was as an angry animal with you!
PSA.73.23	But really I was always with you.
PSA.73.23	Now you hold me by my right hand.
PSA.73.24	What you say to me will be my guide.
PSA.73.24	And then you will take me to 
PSA.73.25	I know nobody in 
PSA.73.25	And, with you, there is nothing else on earth that I want.
PSA.73.26	My heart and my body may fail,
PSA.73.26	but God will always make me strong.
PSA.73.26	He is all that I will ever need.
PSA.73.27	I am sure that people far from you will die.
PSA.73.27	You will destroy everybody that does not obey you.
PSA.73.28	But it is good for me to be near to God.
PSA.73.28	I have made the 
PSA.73.28	I will tell people about the good things that you do. 
PSA.74.1	God, will you never think about us again?
PSA.74.1	Why are you burning with 
PSA.74.2	Think again about:
PSA.74.2	· your people that you bought a long time ago
PSA.74.2	· the people that you chose and saved
PSA.74.2	· the Mountain called 
PSA.74.3	Go and look at everything that the enemy broke.
PSA.74.3	He destroyed your 
PSA.74.4	Your enemies have made an angry noise inside your meeting place.
PSA.74.4	They have put their own 
PSA.74.5	They seemed 
PSA.74.5	They used axes to cut the temple into pieces!
PSA.74.6	They used hammers and axes to break the doors
PSA.74.6	and other things made from wood.
PSA.74.7	They burned your temple to the ground!
PSA.74.7	They said that the place where your name lived was 
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, ‘We will completely destroy them.’
PSA.74.8	So they burned every meeting place of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	Nobody gives us signs that are 
PSA.74.9	There are no 
PSA.74.9	Nobody knows how long this will continue. 
PSA.74.10	God, how long will the enemy laugh at you?
PSA.74.10	Will the enemy always laugh at your name?
PSA.74.11	Why do you hide your hand from us, even your right hand?
PSA.74.11	Take it out from your pocket! Destroy them!
PSA.74.12	For you, God, have been my king from the beginning.
PSA.74.12	You have done great things in the earth. 
PSA.74.13	It was you that 
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the 
PSA.74.14	It was you that broke the heads of 
PSA.74.14	You gave him as food for the animals in the 
PSA.74.15	It was you that made 
PSA.74.15	It was you that made quick-moving rivers dry! 
PSA.74.16	You made both day and night.
PSA.74.16	It was you that put the moon and the sun in their places. 
PSA.74.17	It was you that said where the dry land must be.
PSA.74.17	It was you that made both summer and winter. 
PSA.74.18	· an enemy has laughed at you
PSA.74.18	· and 
PSA.74.19	Do not give the life of your 
PSA.74.19	Do not always forget the lives of your poor people.
PSA.74.20	Keep your promise!
PSA.74.20	Because the earth is full of dark places where bad men hide.
PSA.74.21	Do not let 
PSA.74.21	Let the poor people that need help say how great you are!
PSA.74.22	Stand up, God! Tell everyone that you are right.
PSA.74.22	Remember that fools are laughing at you all the time.
PSA.74.23	Listen to the noise that your enemies make.
PSA.74.23	The sound of people fighting against you goes on all the time! 
PSA.75.1	God, we thank you.
PSA.75.1	We really thank you because you are still near to us.
PSA.75.1	This is what the 
PSA.75.2	God said: At the time that I will choose, I will be a fair 
PSA.75.3	When the earth 
PSA.75.3	I will stop its 
PSA.75.4	I say to the people that are 
PSA.75.4	I say to the 
PSA.75.5	Do not lift your horn up high.
PSA.75.5	Do not push your neck up high when you speak.
PSA.75.6	For nobody
PSA.75.6	· from the east
PSA.75.6	· or from the west
PSA.75.6	· or from the 
PSA.75.6	· or from the mountains in the north
PSA.75.7	will be judge. Only God will be judge.
PSA.75.7	He puts one person down and he lifts up another person.
PSA.75.8	Because there is a cup in the 
PSA.75.8	It is full of 
PSA.75.8	The 
PSA.75.8	All the godless people in the world will drink it.
PSA.75.8	They will drink the last bit of it. 
PSA.75.9	But I will always talk about what God did.
PSA.75.9	I will sing 
PSA.75.10	Because he says ‘I will cut off all the horns of the godless.
PSA.75.10	But I will lift up the horns of the 
PSA.76.1	God is famous in Judah.
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel. 
PSA.76.2	His house is in Salem and his home is in 
PSA.76.3	There he broke the enemy's:
PSA.76.3	· bow shooting fire
PSA.76.3	· 
PSA.76.3	· and 
PSA.76.3	· and war 
PSA.76.4	You God are the Shining One!
PSA.76.4	You are the King from the mountains,
PSA.76.4	where you robbed your enemy!
PSA.76.5	You took from the brave enemy soldiers all the weapons that they had.
PSA.76.5	Now they are sleeping and will never wake up.
PSA.76.5	None of the soldiers can use their hands. 
PSA.76.6	When you were angry, God of 
PSA.76.6	both the horses and the men that rode on them fell down dead.
PSA.76.7	You – everyone is afraid of you!
PSA.76.7	Who can remain standing in front of you when you are angry?
PSA.76.8	From the 
PSA.76.8	All the earth was afraid of you and became quiet.
PSA.76.9	This happened, God, when you came to judge
PSA.76.9	and to save the 
PSA.76.9	SELAH 
PSA.76.10	So the 
PSA.76.10	What remains of their anger you will wear as praise. 
PSA.76.11	Make a promise to the 
PSA.76.11	Let everyone that lives near bring a gift to the God that people are afraid of.
PSA.76.12	He breaks the 
PSA.76.12	All the kings of the world are afraid of him. 
PSA.77.1	I cried aloud to God.
PSA.77.1	I cried to God so that he could hear me.
PSA.77.2	When trouble came, I looked for the 
PSA.77.2	All through the night, I lifted my hands to him while I prayed.
PSA.77.2	But I did not get help. 
PSA.77.3	I remembered God and I cried.
PSA.77.3	I thought about my trouble and my 
PSA.77.4	God, you do not let me close my eyes.
PSA.77.4	I have so much trouble that I do not know what to say. 
PSA.77.5	I think about days that have gone
PSA.77.5	and the years that have passed.
PSA.77.6	At night I remember the songs that I sang.
PSA.77.6	I ask myself questions and my spirit looks for answers.
PSA.77.7	· ‘Will the 
PSA.77.7	· ‘Will he never again be good to us?’
PSA.77.8	· ‘Will he for ever stop giving us his kind love?’
PSA.77.8	· ‘Will he not do what he promised for us and our children?’
PSA.77.9	· ‘Has God forgotten to be 
PSA.77.9	· ‘Is he so angry with us that he will not love us?’
PSA.77.9	SELAH 
PSA.77.10	Then I said, ‘I will think about the times
PSA.77.10	when the 
PSA.77.11	I will remember the things that the 
PSA.77.11	Yes, I will remember the 
PSA.77.12	I will think about all that you have done.
PSA.77.12	I will think about all the great things that you have done.’
PSA.77.13	Your way, God, is 
PSA.77.13	What god is as great as our God?
PSA.77.14	You are the God that does miracles.
PSA.77.14	You show people that you are very powerful.
PSA.77.15	You saved your people with your strong arm.
PSA.77.15	You saved the people of 
PSA.77.15	SELAH 
PSA.77.16	The waters saw you, God,
PSA.77.16	the waters saw you and rolled over and over.
PSA.77.16	The deepest seas moved round a lot.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down water.
PSA.77.17	The noise of 
PSA.77.17	Your 
PSA.77.18	The voice of your thunder was in the storm.
PSA.77.18	Your 
PSA.77.18	The earth moved about and 
PSA.77.19	Your road went through the sea.
PSA.77.19	Your path was through the great waters,
PSA.77.19	but nobody saw where your feet went.
PSA.77.20	You led your people in a group
PSA.77.20	with Moses and Aaron at the front. 
PSA.78.1	My people, hear what I am teaching you.
PSA.78.1	Listen to the words that I am saying to you.
PSA.78.2	I will tell you a story.
PSA.78.2	I will talk about things hard to understand from past times.
PSA.78.3	We have heard them and know them
PSA.78.3	because our fathers told them to us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children.
PSA.78.4	We will tell future children that they should 
PSA.78.4	He is very strong and he has done great things.
PSA.78.5	He decided what things 
PSA.78.5	He told our grandfathers that they must teach them to their children.
PSA.78.6	Then those children would know them, even the children still to be born.
PSA.78.6	When the time came, they too would tell their children.
PSA.78.7	Then they the children would:
PSA.78.7	· believe that God would give them help
PSA.78.7	· not forget what God had done
PSA.78.7	· obey his laws
PSA.78.8	So they would not be like their grandfathers who:
PSA.78.8	· would not listen to God
PSA.78.8	· would not obey him
PSA.78.8	· did not make God their leader
PSA.78.8	· did not continue to follow him
PSA.78.9	The people of Ephraim had bows and 
PSA.78.9	But they ran away when the war started! 
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the 
PSA.78.10	They refused to obey his 
PSA.78.11	And they forgot what he had done
PSA.78.11	and the 
PSA.78.12	He did 
PSA.78.12	He did them in the country of Egypt, in the part they called Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He made a road in the sea and led them through it.
PSA.78.13	He built the waters into a wall on both sides. 
PSA.78.14	He showed them the way with a cloud in the day
PSA.78.14	and with light from a fire all night. 
PSA.78.15	He broke rocks in the 
PSA.78.15	and gave his people water from deep in the earth.
PSA.78.16	He made streams to come from the rocks
PSA.78.16	so that the waters ran like rivers. 
PSA.78.17	But they continued to 
PSA.78.17	They fought against the 
PSA.78.18	They made a plan to 
PSA.78.18	They demanded the food that they liked best!
PSA.78.19	And they spoke against God.
PSA.78.19	They said, ‘Can God do it?
PSA.78.19	Can he prepare a table in the 
PSA.78.20	It is true that when he hit a rock, water came out,
PSA.78.20	streams of water were everywhere.
PSA.78.20	But can he also give bread?
PSA.78.20	Can he supply meat for his people?
PSA.78.21	When the 
PSA.78.21	So he sent fire against 
PSA.78.21	and also his 
PSA.78.22	He did this because they did not believe that God could do it,
PSA.78.22	or that he had the power to save them. 
PSA.78.23	So he gave an 
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors in the skies.
PSA.78.24	He rained 
PSA.78.24	He gave them bread from 
PSA.78.25	People ate the same bread that 
PSA.78.25	God sent them plenty of food.
PSA.78.26	Then God sent an east wind blowing through the skies.
PSA.78.26	And he was so strong that he also sent a south wind.
PSA.78.27	And he rained meat down on them like powder.
PSA.78.27	He rained flying birds on them 
PSA.78.28	He made them fall where his people were living,
PSA.78.28	all round their 
PSA.78.29	And they ate as much as they needed.
PSA.78.29	God gave them what they wanted.
PSA.78.30	But before they ate all that they wanted
PSA.78.30	while the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	God became very angry with them.
PSA.78.31	He killed the strongest of them
PSA.78.31	and sent the young men of Israel to their deaths.
PSA.78.32	Even when this happened, they still 
PSA.78.32	They did not believe that God had done these 
PSA.78.33	So he made their days seem to blow away like the wind.
PSA.78.33	He made their years go away fast so that they were afraid!
PSA.78.34	When he killed some of them, the other people looked to God.
PSA.78.34	They were sorry and really prayed to him. 
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their Rock.
PSA.78.35	Also, they remembered that God 
PSA.78.36	But what they said was not true
PSA.78.36	and they did not mean what they said with their mouths to 
PSA.78.37	They were not honest with him.
PSA.78.37	They did not obey his 
PSA.78.38	But he was 
PSA.78.38	He 
PSA.78.38	Many times he was not angry with them
PSA.78.38	and did not become 
PSA.78.39	But he remembered that they were only human,
PSA.78.39	like a wind that blows away and does not return.
PSA.78.40	The people of Israel often fought against God in the 
PSA.78.40	They made him very sad in the 
PSA.78.41	Many times they 
PSA.78.41	and this made the 
PSA.78.42+PSA.78.43	They chose not to remember what he did when:
PSA.78.42+PSA.78.43	· he saved them from the enemy
PSA.78.42+PSA.78.43	· he showed his 
PSA.78.42+PSA.78.43	· he did 
PSA.78.44	Here is some of what God did to the Egyptians:
PSA.78.44	He turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	so they could not drink from their streams.
PSA.78.45	He sent very large numbers of flies that made a lot of trouble for them.
PSA.78.45	And he sent 
PSA.78.46	He gave the plants that they grew to 
PSA.78.46	and their food to 
PSA.78.47	He killed their 
PSA.78.47	and their 
PSA.78.48	He killed their cows with hail
PSA.78.48	and their sheep with fire from the sky.
PSA.78.49	He was so angry that he burned 
PSA.78.49	He sent a group of 
PSA.78.49	called 
PSA.78.50	He made a path for his anger.
PSA.78.50	He did not save them from death.
PSA.78.50	He gave their lives to the 
PSA.78.51	He killed all the first born sons in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the oldest boys of the men of Ham. 
PSA.78.52	This is what God did for his people:
PSA.78.52	But he took his people from Egypt like a 
PSA.78.52	And he led them like sheep through the 
PSA.78.53	They were safe with him as a guide and they were not afraid.
PSA.78.53	But the sea drowned their enemies.
PSA.78.54	So he brought them to the edge of his 
PSA.78.54	to this hill-country, which his right hand took.
PSA.78.55	He sent away the people that were living there.
PSA.78.55	He said which parts of the land each group of his people could have.
PSA.78.55	He put the families of Israel in their homes.
PSA.78.56	But the 
PSA.78.56	Also, they did not obey his 
PSA.78.57	They turned away and did not keep the 
PSA.78.57	They were like a bow that would not shoot straight!
PSA.78.58	They made him angry with their high places
PSA.78.58	and their 
PSA.78.59	When God heard this, he was angry
PSA.78.59	and he stopped giving them help completely.
PSA.78.60	He left his house the 
PSA.78.60	the place where he had lived on earth.
PSA.78.61	He gave his power and his 
PSA.78.61	to the enemy for them to keep.
PSA.78.62	He let the 
PSA.78.62	he was so angry with them.
PSA.78.63	The fire of war ate their young men
PSA.78.63	and the young girls did not hear music when they married.
PSA.78.64	The sword killed their 
PSA.78.64	and their wives could not cry for them. 
PSA.78.65	Then the 
PSA.78.65	He was like a strong man shouting after drinking 
PSA.78.66	He beat his enemies so that they went away.
PSA.78.66	He did this so that they would always be ashamed.
PSA.78.67	Also, he decided not to let the people of Joseph continue as leaders.
PSA.78.67	And he no longer chose the 
PSA.78.68	But he chose the tribe of Judah.
PSA.78.69	There he built a 
PSA.78.69	He made it so that it would always be there, like the earth.
PSA.78.70	Also, he chose David his servant
PSA.78.70	and he took him away from the sheep farm.
PSA.78.71	He took him from feeding sheep
PSA.78.71	and brought him to be 
PSA.78.71	those in Israel that were his.
PSA.78.72	And so David, with his honest heart, was their shepherd.
PSA.78.72	He knew how to lead them. 
PSA.79.1	God, countries that do not love you have attacked us.
PSA.79.1	They have taken away your land.
PSA.79.1	They have done bad things to your 
PSA.79.1	so that we cannot 
PSA.79.1	They have destroyed Jerusalem. 
PSA.79.2	They have given the dead bodies of your people
PSA.79.2	to the birds that fly in the air for food.
PSA.79.2	They have given the bodies of your servants
PSA.79.2	for wild animals to eat.
PSA.79.3	They have poured out the blood of your servants
PSA.79.3	There was nobody to bury your people. 
PSA.79.4	Our 
PSA.79.4	The people that live near us 
PSA.79.5	How long will this continue?
PSA.79.5	Will your 
PSA.79.6	Be very angry with the countries that do not love you
PSA.79.6	and the 
PSA.79.7	Because they have beaten 
PSA.79.7	and destroyed the land where he lived. 
PSA.79.8	Do not be angry with us
PSA.79.8	because of the wrong things that our fathers did.
PSA.79.8	Have 
PSA.79.8	We have lost all our hope. 
PSA.79.9	God, give us help! You are the God that can save us.
PSA.79.9	For the 
PSA.79.9	So that your name will always be famous, 
PSA.79.10	Why should the countries that do not love God say,
PSA.79.10	‘Where is their God?’
PSA.79.10	We want to see you become angry with these countries,
PSA.79.10	because they poured out the blood of your servants. 
PSA.79.11	Listen to the 
PSA.79.11	By the power of your arm, save those that are going to die. 
PSA.79.12	have seven times as much trouble as we have had!
PSA.79.12	Because they said bad things to you. 
PSA.79.13	Then we, your people who are as sheep in your field,
PSA.79.13	will always thank you.
PSA.79.13	So will our children and grandchildren. 
PSA.80.1	You are the one that leads 
PSA.80.1	You sit like a king between the 
PSA.80.2	Shine on Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Get up and show how strong you are.
PSA.80.2	Come and make us safe.
PSA.80.3	God, make us return to you.
PSA.80.3	Make your face shine on us and make us safe.
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry when your people pray? 
PSA.80.5	You have fed them tears for food
PSA.80.5	and buckets of tears for drink.
PSA.80.6	You have made the people that live near us fight us
PSA.80.6	and our enemies laugh among themselves at us.
PSA.80.7	God of Many Armies, make us return to you.
PSA.80.7	Make your face shine on us and make us safe.
PSA.80.8	You brought a 
PSA.80.8	You moved away the people that lived in the land and planted it. 
PSA.80.9	You made the ground ready for it,
PSA.80.9	so that it grew and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	Its shade covered the mountains in the south
PSA.80.10	and its branches covered the big cedar trees in the north.
PSA.80.11	Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea in the west
PSA.80.11	and the River Euphrates in the east.
PSA.80.12	Why have you knocked down its walls
PSA.80.12	so that anyone that passes can rob its fruit?
PSA.80.13	Pigs from the woods attack it
PSA.80.13	and wild animals destroy it.
PSA.80.14+PSA.80.15	Come back to us, God of Many Armies!
PSA.80.14+PSA.80.15	Look down from 
PSA.80.14+PSA.80.15	Be careful with this vine
PSA.80.14+PSA.80.15	that your right hand planted.
PSA.80.14+PSA.80.15	The vine is the son that you made strong for yourself.
PSA.80.16	You let the enemy cut down your vine and burn it with fire.
PSA.80.16	Destroy them the enemy because you are angry!
PSA.80.17	Let your hand be on the man at your right hand.
PSA.80.17	He is the son of man that you made strong for yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we will never turn away from you.
PSA.80.18	Give us life and we will always 
PSA.80.19	Make your face shine on us and make us safe.
PSA.81.1	Sing to God because you are so happy!
PSA.81.1	Do this because God makes us strong!
PSA.81.1	Shout aloud to the God of 
PSA.81.2	Start the music! Hit the 
PSA.81.2	and make beautiful sounds on the 
PSA.81.3	Start the New Moon 
PSA.81.3	Do it at the Full Moon Festival also.
PSA.81.4	For this is a rule for Israel,
PSA.81.4	something that the God of Jacob said that we must do.
PSA.81.5	He told it to 
PSA.81.5	I heard a language that I did not understand. 
PSA.81.6	It said ‘I took the weight off his shoulders.
PSA.81.6	His hands did not have to carry a heavy basket any more.
PSA.81.7	When you had trouble, you called to me and I made you safe.
PSA.81.7	I gave you help from the centre of the storm.
PSA.81.7	I 
PSA.81.8	My people, hear me! You are near to danger.
PSA.81.8	Israel, I really want you to listen to me!
PSA.81.9	There should not be another god among you
PSA.81.9	and you certainly should not go down on your knees to another god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.’ 
PSA.81.11	But my people did not listen to my voice
PSA.81.11	and Israel did not obey me. 
PSA.81.12	And so I let them follow their own ideas.
PSA.81.12	They did whatever they wanted to do.
PSA.81.13	I want my people to listen to me!
PSA.81.13	I want Israel to walk in my ways!
PSA.81.14	Then I would quickly beat all their enemies
PSA.81.14	and fight against all those that are angry with them. 
PSA.81.15	The people that hate the 
PSA.81.15	and this will happen for a long time.
PSA.81.16	But he would feed him Israel with the best 
PSA.81.16	and I would give you Israel plenty of 
PSA.82.1	God is the leader of a meeting of the powerful ones.
PSA.82.1	He is telling the gods what he has decided. 
PSA.82.2	He says ‘How long will you not be fair to people?
PSA.82.2	How long will you say that the 
PSA.82.3	Be fair and give help to:
PSA.82.3	· people that are weak
PSA.82.3	· children with dead parents
PSA.82.3	· people that are poor
PSA.82.3	· anyone that has nothing
PSA.82.4	Make the poor people safe and give them the help that they need.
PSA.82.4	Take them away from the power of the godless. 
PSA.82.5	They the godless know nothing and they understand nothing.
PSA.82.5	They walk about in 
PSA.82.5	The ground beneath them moves about. 
PSA.82.6	I God say, ‘You are gods
PSA.82.6	and you are all sons of the 
PSA.82.7	But you will die like Adam.
PSA.82.7	You will fall like rulers.’ 
PSA.82.8	God, stand up and rule the earth,
PSA.82.8	because all the countries in it belong to you. 
PSA.83.1	God, do not seem to be asleep!
PSA.83.1	Do not remain quiet and do nothing, God!
PSA.83.2	For look, your enemies are all doing something.
PSA.83.2	The people that hate you are getting ready to fight you. 
PSA.83.3	They are making clever 
PSA.83.3	They are deciding together what to do with those people that you love.
PSA.83.4	They are saying, ‘Come on, we will destroy their country.
PSA.83.4	Then nobody will ever remember the name of Israel.’
PSA.83.5	They are deciding together what to do.
PSA.83.5	They are agreeing to do something against you.
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7	The people doing this are from:
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7	· Edom and the Ishmaelites
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7	· Moab and the Hagrites
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7	· Gebal, Ammon and Amalek
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7	· Philistia and Tyre
PSA.83.8	Even Assyria has joined them.
PSA.83.8	They have made the sons of Lot Moab and Ammon strong.
PSA.83.9	Do to them what you did to Midian
PSA.83.9	and to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon.
PSA.83.10	They died at Endor
PSA.83.10	and they became 
PSA.83.11	Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb.
PSA.83.11	Make all their 
PSA.83.12	They said, ‘Let us take all the country that belongs to God.’ 
PSA.83.13	God, blow them away like 
PSA.83.14	As fire burns a forest and lights the mountains,
PSA.83.14	so they are on fire. 
PSA.83.15	Go after them with bad weather
PSA.83.15	and frighten them a lot with your storms.
PSA.83.16	Make their faces ashamed
PSA.83.16	so that they will look for your name, 
PSA.83.17	Let them always be ashamed and very frightened.
PSA.83.17	Let them become so ashamed that then they die!
PSA.83.18	Then they will know that your name is 
PSA.83.18	And they will know that you are the 
PSA.84.1	people love your 
PSA.84.2	I want very much to go to the place where the 
PSA.84.2	I want it so much that it is making me feel weak!
PSA.84.2	All that I am and all that I feel is crying out to the Living God!
PSA.84.3	Even the 
PSA.84.3	and the 
PSA.84.3	There she may keep her babies.
PSA.84.3	They are in places near your 
PSA.84.3	 of Many Armies.
PSA.84.3	You are my king and my God. 
PSA.84.4	The people that live in your house are very happy.
PSA.84.4	They can always tell you how great you are.
PSA.84.5	The people that you make strong are very happy.
PSA.84.5	They want to come to you in 
PSA.84.6	As they pass through a dry valley,
PSA.84.6	it seems to become a place with wells of water in it.
PSA.84.6	The autumn rains cover the valley with pools.
PSA.84.7	The people become stronger as they go,
PSA.84.7	until each one appears before God in Zion. 
PSA.84.8	 God of Many Armies,
PSA.84.8	hear the words that I am praying!
PSA.84.8	God of 
PSA.84.8	SELAH
PSA.84.9	God, look at our 
PSA.84.9	And look kindly at the face of your king. 
PSA.84.10	One day in your temple 
PSA.84.10	is better than a thousand days somewhere else.
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand at the door of God's house
PSA.84.10	than sit in the houses of 
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	He gives 
PSA.84.11	He gives good things to people that do what is right. 
PSA.84.12	 of Many Armies,
PSA.84.12	everybody is very happy that 
PSA.85.1	You 
PSA.85.2	You 
PSA.85.2	and you 
PSA.85.3	You were not angry with them any more
PSA.85.3	and you turned away from your 
PSA.85.4	But now turn us again, God.
PSA.85.4	You are the God that makes us safe.
PSA.85.4	Stop being so angry with us. 
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us for ever?
PSA.85.5	Will you always be 
PSA.85.6	Will you not turn to us again and give us new life?
PSA.85.6	Then your people will be happy and 
PSA.85.7	, show us your kind love!
PSA.85.7	Give to us the help that makes us safe!
PSA.85.8	I will listen to what God the 
PSA.85.8	He will give 
PSA.85.8	But they must not turn back to become fools. 
PSA.85.9	Certainly he will make safe those that obey him.
PSA.85.9	Then his 
PSA.85.10	Kind love will meet 
PSA.85.11	and goodness will look down from the 
PSA.85.12	Yes! The 
PSA.85.12	and our land will give much fruit. 
PSA.85.13	Goodness will go before him
PSA.85.13	and make a way for his feet.
PSA.86.1	Because I am weak and need help. 
PSA.86.2	Save me from death because I am one of your people.
PSA.86.2	Keep me your servant safe. You are my God.
PSA.86.2	I am someone that is 
PSA.86.3	My 
PSA.86.3	All through the day, I am praying this to you.
PSA.86.4	Make me your servant happy!
PSA.86.4	Because I lift up myself to you, my Lord.
PSA.86.5	My Lord, you are good. Also, you 
PSA.86.5	You give your kind love to everyone that prays to you.
PSA.86.6	And listen to my voice when I cry for mercy.
PSA.86.7	On the day that I have trouble I will pray to you,
PSA.86.7	because you can answer me.
PSA.86.8	None among the gods is like you, my Lord.
PSA.86.8	And nobody can do what you can do.
PSA.86.9	All the countries that you have made will come
PSA.86.9	and 
PSA.86.9	They will say how great your name is.
PSA.86.10	For you are great. You do great things.
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	, teach me your way. I will walk in your 
PSA.86.11	Make my heart united when I think of your name.
PSA.86.12	I will 
PSA.86.12	I will always tell people that you are really great!
PSA.86.13	I will do this because there is so much of your kind love to me.
PSA.86.13	You will save me from going to the lowest part of 
PSA.86.14	God, 
PSA.86.14	A group of cruel men is trying to kill me.
PSA.86.14	They do not think about you.
PSA.86.15	But you, my Lord, are a God that loves people and gives them mercy.
PSA.86.15	You are slow to become angry and you are full of kind love.
PSA.86.15	You do not leave your people when they have trouble.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and give me mercy. Make me your servant strong
PSA.86.16	and make the son of your woman servant safe.
PSA.86.17	Show me something that tells me that you are good.
PSA.86.17	Let my enemies see it and be ashamed.
PSA.86.17	Because you, 
PSA.87.1	He built it on the mountains of 
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.2	He loves them more than all the places where 
PSA.87.3	People say 
PSA.87.4	I will remember the people that I know, from Rahab and Babylon;
PSA.87.4	also from Philistia, Tyre and Ethiopia.
PSA.87.4	I will remember that this man was born there.
PSA.87.5	They will say in Zion, ‘A man – this man – was born there.’
PSA.87.5	So he – the 
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	‘This man was born there.’
PSA.87.6	SELAH 
PSA.87.7	The singers and the 
PSA.87.7	‘All my 
PSA.88.1	I always cry to you in the day and at night for help.
PSA.88.2	I want you to hear the words that I am praying.
PSA.88.2	Listen to my 
PSA.88.3	Because I have a lot of trouble
PSA.88.3	and my life is coming near to 
PSA.88.4	People say that I am among those that are going to the 
PSA.88.4	I am 
PSA.88.5	I am almost with those that are already dead.
PSA.88.5	I am like dead people lying in their 
PSA.88.5	You do not remember them any more
PSA.88.5	and you cannot give them help where they are.
PSA.88.6	You are putting me in the lowest Pit,
PSA.88.6	in a very dark and deep place.
PSA.88.7	You are very angry with me.
PSA.88.7	You are like a heavy sea,
PSA.88.7	pouring all over me and knocking me down. 
PSA.88.8	You have taken my best friends away from me.
PSA.88.8	You have made me seem very bad to them.
PSA.88.8	The place that I am in is like a prison that I cannot leave. 
PSA.88.9	My eyes are weak because I am so sad.
PSA.88.9	, every day I pray to you.
PSA.88.9	I lift my hands up to you while I pray.
PSA.88.10	Do you do 
PSA.88.10	Do dead people get up and say that you are great?
PSA.88.11	Do people talk about your kind love in the grave?
PSA.88.11	Do they say in 
PSA.88.12	Do they know about your miracles in dark places.
PSA.88.12	Do they know about the good things that you do
PSA.88.12	in the land where people forget everything.
PSA.88.13	But 
PSA.88.13	Every morning I pray to you.
PSA.88.14	, why are you throwing me away?
PSA.88.14	Why do you hide your face from me?
PSA.88.15	I have been ill and near to death since I was young.
PSA.88.15	You have let bad things happen to me
PSA.88.15	and I do not know what to do.
PSA.88.16	Your 
PSA.88.16	You are attacking me and destroying me!
PSA.88.17	The things that you do, they are all round me like a 
PSA.88.17	They are on every side of me.
PSA.88.18	You have taken away from me my friends
PSA.88.18	and the people that love me.
PSA.88.18	My only friend is 
PSA.89.1	I will always sing about the kind love of the 
PSA.89.1	I will tell my children and my grandchildren
PSA.89.1	that you will do what you have promised.
PSA.89.2	Yes! I will say that nothing will ever stop your kind love for us.
PSA.89.2	You will do the things that you promised in 
PSA.89.3	God had said in heaven
PSA.89.3	‘I have made a 
PSA.89.3	I have made special promises to my servant David. 
PSA.89.4	Someone from your family will always be king.
PSA.89.4	And there will always be a place where they will rule as king.’
PSA.89.5	In 
PSA.89.5	Also, the 
PSA.89.5	know that you will do what you have promised. 
PSA.89.6	For who is there in heaven that is 
PSA.89.6	Which of the 
PSA.89.7	God frightens very much the 
PSA.89.7	He makes them more afraid than anyone else does.
PSA.89.8	 God of Many Armies, who is as strong as you are, 
PSA.89.8	And you do everything that you have promised!
PSA.89.9	You are the ruler of the boiling sea.
PSA.89.9	When the water rises up, you make it quiet again.
PSA.89.10	You broke Rahab and killed it!
PSA.89.10	With your strong arm, you destroyed your enemies.
PSA.89.11	The skies belong to you and so does the earth.
PSA.89.11	You made the world and everything that is in it.
PSA.89.12	You made places in the north and in the south.
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon praise you when they hear your name.
PSA.89.13	You have a strong arm; your hand is powerful;
PSA.89.13	you have lifted up your right hand to use your power.
PSA.89.14	You have built your 
PSA.89.14	Your kind love and the fact that you keep your promises go in front of you. 
PSA.89.15	The people are very happy when they know how to 
PSA.89.15	, they will walk in the light from your face.
PSA.89.16	They will praise your name all day
PSA.89.16	and talk about your 
PSA.89.17	Your 
PSA.89.17	and by your 
PSA.89.18	Yes! Our 
PSA.89.18	and our king belongs to the 
PSA.89.19	A long time ago, you spoke to your servants.
PSA.89.19	It was like a dream. You said to them,
PSA.89.19	‘I have given help to a brave soldier.
PSA.89.19	I have chosen a young man from the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David my servant.
PSA.89.20	I have poured my special oil over him to make him king.
PSA.89.21	My hand will make him strong and,
PSA.89.21	Yes! My arm will make him powerful.
PSA.89.22	No enemy will win a war against him
PSA.89.22	and no 
PSA.89.23	I will destroy his enemies before him
PSA.89.23	and kill those that hate him.
PSA.89.24	I will do everything that I have promised him.
PSA.89.24	Also, I will give him my kind love.
PSA.89.24	And by my name I will raise his 
PSA.89.25	I will put his left hand over the sea

PSA.89.26	He, David, will say to me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, and the Rock that makes me safe.’
PSA.89.27	Also, I will make him as my first born son.
PSA.89.27	He will be the most high of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	I will always give him my kind love
PSA.89.28	and my 
PSA.89.29	One of his family will always be king,
PSA.89.29	as long as there are skies above us.
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31	If his

PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31	· and do not obey my 
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31	· say that my laws are bad
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31	· and do not do what I tell them to do
PSA.89.32	I will 
PSA.89.32	and the wrong things they do with a 
PSA.89.33	But I will not take my kind love from him David
PSA.89.33	and I will not 
PSA.89.34	I will not break my covenant with him
PSA.89.34	or change any of my promises.
PSA.89.35	At one time I made a promise.
PSA.89.35	Because I am 
PSA.89.36	His descendants will always continue
PSA.89.36	and his 
PSA.89.37	Like the moon, it will always be there.
PSA.89.37	From the sky, it will see everything that happens.
PSA.89.38	But you have said ‘no’ to your 
PSA.89.38	You have turned away from him
PSA.89.38	because you have become angry with him.
PSA.89.39	You have 
PSA.89.39	You threw his 
PSA.89.40	You have broken all the walls round his city.
PSA.89.40	You have destroyed all his strong places.
PSA.89.41	Everyone that goes near him robs him.
PSA.89.41	Everybody that lives near him laughs at him.
PSA.89.42	You have made all his enemies strong,
PSA.89.42	you have made them all happy because they beat him.
PSA.89.43	You made the edge of his 
PSA.89.43	and you have not given him help in war.
PSA.89.44	You have taken away his authority as king
PSA.89.44	and you threw his 
PSA.89.45	He does not look 
PSA.89.45	You have dressed him in 
PSA.89.46	Will you always hide yourself?
PSA.89.46	Will your great 
PSA.89.47	Remember that my life is so short!
PSA.89.47	Have you 
PSA.89.48	What man can live and not die?
PSA.89.48	Who can save himself from the power of 
PSA.89.49	Lord, where is the kind love that you gave us in past times?
PSA.89.49	Where are the special promises that you made to David?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, that people have 
PSA.89.50	Many countries have said bad things to me.
PSA.89.51	, your enemies laugh at the king that you have chosen.
PSA.89.51	They 
PSA.89.52	Always 
PSA.90.2	You were God before the mountains were born.
PSA.90.2	You were God before you were as a mother to the earth and the world.
PSA.90.2	You always were and you always will be God. 
PSA.90.3	You make people go back to being powder in the ground when they die.
PSA.90.3	You say, ‘Go back to the ground, sons of Adam.’ 
PSA.90.4	For you see a thousand years as just a day that passes.
PSA.90.4	The years are as a few hours in the night when they are over. 
PSA.90.5	You pour the sleep of death on them the sons of Adam.
PSA.90.5	They become as new grass in the morning. 
PSA.90.6	In the morning, it grows well;
PSA.90.6	but by the evening, it becomes dry and it dies. 
PSA.90.7	You destroy us because you are angry.
PSA.90.7	Because you are so angry, you make us very much afraid. 
PSA.90.8	You see in front of you the wrong things that we do.
PSA.90.8	Your light even shows the secret bad things that we do!
PSA.90.9	All our days hurry past because you are angry with us.
PSA.90.9	We finish our years in just the time it takes for a cry. 
PSA.90.10	The number of our days is 70 years.
PSA.90.10	Or maybe 80 years if we are strong.
PSA.90.10	Yet, even in the best years of our lives,
PSA.90.10	we have trouble and we are not really happy.
PSA.90.10	And they soon go and we hurry away towards death.
PSA.90.11	The people that you frighten when you become so angry will know. 
PSA.90.12	Teach us to count well our days.
PSA.90.12	Then we will get a heart that thinks as God thinks. 
PSA.90.13	, how long will it be until you change your mind?
PSA.90.13	Be kind to your servants! 
PSA.90.14	Give us your kind love every morning.
PSA.90.14	Then we will sing and be happy for as long as we live. 
PSA.90.15	Make us happy for as long as you have hurt us.
PSA.90.15	Make us happy for as many years as we have had trouble. 
PSA.90.16	Let us your servants see the work that you do.
PSA.90.16	And show how great you are to our children. 
PSA.90.17	Let the Lord our God show how happy he is with us.
PSA.90.17	Let him make the work that our hands do continue.
PSA.90.17	Let the work that our hands do continue. 
PSA.91.1	Whoever stays in the secret place of the 
PSA.91.1	will remain under the shadow of the 
PSA.91.2	I will say to the 
PSA.91.2	‘You are my safe place and my strong 
PSA.91.2	You are my God and I am 
PSA.91.3	He God really will save you from the

PSA.91.5+PSA.91.6	· bad spirits at night,
PSA.91.5+PSA.91.6	· or the 
PSA.91.5+PSA.91.6	· or illnesses that come when it is dark,
PSA.91.5+PSA.91.6	· or something bad that may destroy you at midday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand people may die by your side.
PSA.91.7	Ten thousand people may die by your right hand.
PSA.91.7	But the danger will not come near to you.
PSA.91.8	Your eyes will see it and watch,
PSA.91.8	while it destroys bad people.

PSA.91.11	They will make you safe everywhere that you go.
PSA.91.12	Their hands will give you help
PSA.91.12	so that you will not even hurt your feet on a stone. 
PSA.91.13	You will walk on the 
PSA.91.13	The young lion and the 
PSA.91.14	God says I will make the person safe that loves me.
PSA.91.14	Danger will not hurt him that knows and trusts in my name.
PSA.91.15	He will pray to me and I will answer him.
PSA.91.15	When he has trouble, I will be with him.
PSA.91.15	I will save him and make him famous.
PSA.91.16	I will make him happy with a long life.
PSA.91.16	He will enjoy what I will do for him. 
PSA.92.1	It is good to tell the 
PSA.92.1	and to make music to your name, Most High God.
PSA.92.2	It is good to talk about your kind love in the morning.
PSA.92.2	And to talk every night about how you do what you have promised.

PSA.103.1	I say to myself: 
PSA.103.1	Everything that is in me, praise his 
PSA.103.2	I say to myself: Praise the 
PSA.103.2	And never forget any of the good things that he has given you!
PSA.103.3	I say to myself: He 
PSA.103.3	He makes you well again when you are ill. 
PSA.103.4	He 
PSA.103.4	His kind love and 
PSA.103.5	He gives you the good things that you want.
PSA.103.5	So, you become strong again as a young 
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	for all 
PSA.103.7	He showed Moses his plans
PSA.103.7	and he showed the 
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	He is slow to get angry and has a lot of kind love.
PSA.103.9	He will not always say that we are wrong.
PSA.103.9	He will not always be angry.
PSA.103.10	We do wrong things.
PSA.103.10	He does not 
PSA.103.11	The sky is high above the earth.
PSA.103.11	So his kind love is great to those people that love him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	so far has he taken our sins from us.
PSA.103.13	As a father is kind to his children,
PSA.103.13	so the 
PSA.103.14	Because he knows how he made us,
PSA.103.14	he remembers that we are only 
PSA.103.15	The life of a man is as short as the life of grass!
PSA.103.15	He lives as short a time as the wild flowers in a field!
PSA.103.16	The wind blows over it and it dies!
PSA.103.16	Nothing remembers it any more.
PSA.103.17	But the kind love of the 
PSA.103.17	will always be with those that are afraid of him.
PSA.103.17	And his 
PSA.103.18	They will be with those people that do what they have agreed to do.
PSA.103.18	They will be with those people that remember to obey his rules. 
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	He is king over everything.
PSA.103.20	Praise the 
PSA.103.20	You are strong and powerful.
PSA.103.20	You do what he tells you to do and you obey his word.
PSA.103.21	You are his servants that do what he wants you to do.
PSA.103.22	Everything that he has made
PSA.103.22	and everything that he rules over, praise the 
PSA.103.22	I say to myself, praise the 
PSA.104.1+PSA.104.2	I say to myself, ‘
PSA.104.1+PSA.104.2	, my God, you are very great!
PSA.104.1+PSA.104.2	As a person wears clothes, you wear 
PSA.104.1+PSA.104.2	You have put the skies as a roof over the earth.
PSA.104.3	You have built your home above the waters that are over the skies.
PSA.104.3	The clouds carry you and you ride on the wind.
PSA.104.4	The winds carry your messages
PSA.104.4	and burning fires are your servants.
PSA.104.5	The 
PSA.104.5	Nobody will ever move it.
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep sea as clothes cover a person.
PSA.104.6	The waters were higher than the mountains.
PSA.104.7	When you shouted the waters ran away.
PSA.104.7	At the sound of your 
PSA.104.8	The waters moved over the mountains.
PSA.104.8	They went down into the valleys.
PSA.104.8	They went to the place that you had made for them.
PSA.104.9	You made a mark that they could not cross.
PSA.104.9	Never again will the waters cover the earth. 
PSA.104.10	You make water come out of the ground into the valleys.
PSA.104.10	You make the rivers go between the hills.
PSA.104.11	They give water to every wild animal.
PSA.104.11	The wild 
PSA.104.12	The birds of the air make their homes by the streams
PSA.104.12	and they sing from the trees near the streams.
PSA.104.13	You pour water on to the mountains from your home above the sky.
PSA.104.13	The earth is happy with the results of what you do.
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	You make grass to grow for the cows and sheep.
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	And you make plants grow that people can use.
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	This is how people get food from the earth:
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	· wine alcohol that makes people happy,
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	· oil that makes people's faces shine, and
PSA.104.14+PSA.104.15	· bread that makes people strong. 
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	They are the cedar trees in Lebanon, which he planted.
PSA.104.17	The birds make their 
PSA.104.17	The 
PSA.104.18	The wild goats live in the high hills
PSA.104.18	and the 
PSA.104.19	The moon shows us which season it is.
PSA.104.19	The sun knows when to go down. 
PSA.104.20	You 
PSA.104.20	When it is dark, all the wild animals come out of their 
PSA.104.21	The young 
PSA.104.21	They look for the food that God gives to them.
PSA.104.22	When the sun shines again, they go back to their 
PSA.104.22	There they lie down.
PSA.104.23	This is when people go out to work.
PSA.104.23	They work until it is evening.
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of the 
PSA.104.24	You were very 
PSA.104.25	There is the sea. It is so big and so wide.
PSA.104.25	It is full of creatures, more than anyone can count.
PSA.104.25	In it there are small and large animals and plants. 
PSA.104.26	Ships sail on it. 
PSA.104.27	All of them hope that you will give them food when they need it.
PSA.104.28	When you give it to them they pick it up.
PSA.104.28	When you open your hand they have plenty of good things.
PSA.104.29	When you hide your face they become very frightened.
PSA.104.29	When you take away their 
PSA.104.30	Then you send out your breath and make new creatures.
PSA.104.30	You make everything on earth new. 
PSA.104.31	I want the 
PSA.104.31	I want the 
PSA.104.32	When the 
PSA.104.32	When he touches the mountains, they give out smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	I will always sing 
PSA.104.34	I hope that my thoughts make him happy,
PSA.104.34	because the 
PSA.104.35	I want the 
PSA.104.35	I do not want very bad people to live any more.
PSA.104.35	I say to myself, ‘Praise the 
PSA.105.1	Say ‘thank-you!’ to the 
PSA.105.1	Tell everybody his name.
PSA.105.1	Tell people in every country what he has done.
PSA.105.2	Sing songs to him, make music for him.
PSA.105.2	Speak about all the great things that he has done.
PSA.105.3	Be 
PSA.105.3	Everybody that goes to the 
PSA.105.4	Visit the 
PSA.105.4	Always go to him in his house.
PSA.105.5	Remember the great things that he has done.
PSA.105.5	Remember his 
PSA.105.6	Abraham your 
PSA.105.6	The 
PSA.105.7	He, the 
PSA.105.7	What he says is to everyone that lives on the earth. 
PSA.105.8	He will always remember his 
PSA.105.8	He will never, never forget his promises. 
PSA.105.9	He will remember the covenant that he made with Abraham
PSA.105.9	and the special promises that he made to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	He made it sure to Jacob with a 
PSA.105.10	and to the people of Israel with a covenant
PSA.105.10	that will never have an end. 
PSA.105.11	He said, ‘I will give to you Jacob the land of Canaan.
PSA.105.11	It will belong to you, people of Israel.’
PSA.105.12	Once, there was only a small number of them the people of Israel.
PSA.105.12	There were only a few of them and they were 
PSA.105.13	They moved from country to country, from one 
PSA.105.14	The 
PSA.105.14	He was angry with kings and gave help to his people.
PSA.105.15	He said, ‘Do not hurt my special servants.
PSA.105.15	Do not 
PSA.105.16	The 
PSA.105.16	He destroyed all the food that they were storing.
PSA.105.17	But he sent a man into Egypt before them.
PSA.105.17	He was Joseph, that his brothers sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	In Egypt they put his feet into 
PSA.105.19	They did this until what he 
PSA.105.19	Until the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent someone to let him out of prison.
PSA.105.20	The ruler of the peoples made him free.
PSA.105.21	He the king made him Joseph master of his house.
PSA.105.21	He made him ruler of all that he had.
PSA.105.22	He gave him power over his 
PSA.105.22	and authority over the leaders of the country.
PSA.105.23	Then all Israel came into Egypt
PSA.105.23	and Jacob lived in the land of Ham. 
PSA.105.24	The 
PSA.105.24	He made them more powerful than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He made the Egyptians 
PSA.105.25	They thought of bad things to do against the 
PSA.105.26	The 
PSA.105.26	Also, he chose Aaron.
PSA.105.27	Moses and Aaron told everybody the things that the 
PSA.105.27	He would do 
PSA.105.28	He sent 
PSA.105.28	But the Egyptians did not obey him.
PSA.105.29	He changed their rivers into blood and killed their fish.
PSA.105.30	Then 
PSA.105.30	they even went into the bedrooms of their rulers!
PSA.105.31	The 
PSA.105.31	Insects called lice were everywhere in their country.
PSA.105.32	He changed their rain into 
PSA.105.32	and there was 
PSA.105.33	He attacked their 
PSA.105.33	and he destroyed the trees everywhere in their country.
PSA.105.34	The 
PSA.105.34	There were too many locusts to count!
PSA.105.35	They ate all the plants in their country,
PSA.105.35	they ate all their 
PSA.105.36	Then the 
PSA.105.36	He killed all the 
PSA.105.37	So the 
PSA.105.37	They took valuable things made of 
PSA.105.37	And nobody among the Israelites had any trouble.
PSA.105.38	The Egyptians were happy when they went,
PSA.105.38	because they were afraid of the Israelites. 
PSA.105.39	The 
PSA.105.39	and a fire to give them light at night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he sent birds called quails.
PSA.105.40	Also, he fed them with bread from the skies.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and water poured out from it.
PSA.105.41	It moved as a river through the dry places. 
PSA.105.42	This happened because the 
PSA.105.42	He gave it to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	So, he led the people that he had chosen out from Egypt.
PSA.105.43	They were so happy that they sang and they shouted!
PSA.105.44	The 
PSA.105.44	They enjoyed the results of their work.
PSA.105.45	So his people could obey his rules and do what he told them to do.
PSA.106.1	His kind love will always remain. 
PSA.106.2	Nobody can tell about all the great things that the 
PSA.106.2	Nobody can 
PSA.106.3	The people that obey his rules are very happy.
PSA.106.3	They always do what is right.
PSA.106.4	, do not forget me when you do something good for your people.
PSA.106.4	Give me help also when you make them safe.
PSA.106.5	Then I will:
PSA.106.5	· enjoy the good things that you do for your people,
PSA.106.5	· be happy together with them,
PSA.106.5	· praise you with the people that belong to you.
PSA.106.6	We have 
PSA.106.6	We have done wrong things; we have been very, very bad. 
PSA.106.7	When our fathers were in Egypt, they did not understand your 
PSA.106.7	They forgot the kind love that you often gave to them.
PSA.106.7	They did not obey the 
PSA.106.8	But he saved them because of his name.
PSA.106.8	He showed everybody that he was very powerful.
PSA.106.9	He shouted at the Sea of Reeds and it became dry.
PSA.106.9	He led his people through the deep parts of it.
PSA.106.9	It was as if they went through a 
PSA.106.10	He saved them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.10	He 
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their enemies.
PSA.106.11	Not one of them remained alive. 
PSA.106.12	Then God's people believed his promises
PSA.106.12	and they all sang and 
PSA.106.13	But they soon forgot what the 
PSA.106.13	They did not wait for him to tell them his plan.
PSA.106.14	In the 
PSA.106.14	And they 
PSA.106.15	So he gave them what they asked for.
PSA.106.15	But he also sent an illness that made them die.
PSA.106.16	Then they became 
PSA.106.16	when they were staying in the desert.
PSA.106.16	They were also 
PSA.106.16	who was a special servant of the 
PSA.106.17	God made a hole in the ground and Dathan fell into it.
PSA.106.17	God buried Abiram and all his family.
PSA.106.18	Then God sent a fire to their group of people.
PSA.106.18	The fire destroyed those very bad people.
PSA.106.19	They made a 
PSA.106.20	They stopped 
PSA.106.20	Instead, they worshipped the 
PSA.106.21	They forgot the God that had saved them
PSA.106.21	and all the great things that he had done in Egypt.
PSA.106.22	They forgot the 
PSA.106.22	They forgot the things that surprised them so much by the Sea of 
PSA.106.23	So God said that he would destroy them.
PSA.106.23	But Moses stood up and argued with God.
PSA.106.23	He prayed that an angry God would not destroy them. 
PSA.106.24	Later they said that they were afraid to go into the good land of Canaan.
PSA.106.24	They did not believe the promise of God.
PSA.106.25	They said bad things about God in their 
PSA.106.25	They did not obey the 
PSA.106.26	So he lifted up his hand and said that they would die in the 
PSA.106.27	He said that their children would die in other countries.
PSA.106.27	This was after he had moved them all over the world. 
PSA.106.28	Then they agreed to be the servants of the false god called Baal of Peor.
PSA.106.28	They ate the food given to gods that were never alive.
PSA.106.29	These things made the 
PSA.106.29	He sent a 
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas stood up and 
PSA.106.30	Then God stopped the plague.
PSA.106.31	The 
PSA.106.31	People will always remember it. 
PSA.106.32	They made the 
PSA.106.32	So, trouble came to Moses because of what they did.
PSA.106.33	They made Moses angry and he spoke without thinking. 
PSA.106.34	The 
PSA.106.34	but they did not.
PSA.106.35	They mixed with the peoples of Canaan and learned to do as they did. 
PSA.106.36	They 
PSA.106.37	They killed their sons and their daughters for these idols! 
PSA.106.38	Their sons and their daughters had done nothing wrong,
PSA.106.38	but they killed them for these idols.
PSA.106.38	The idols were the false gods of Canaan
PSA.106.38	and these murders made the land dirty.
PSA.106.39	The 
PSA.106.39	They became as 
PSA.106.40	So the 
PSA.106.40	and he really did not like them. 
PSA.106.41	He gave them into the hand of other countries
PSA.106.41	and their enemies ruled over them. 
PSA.106.42	Their enemies 
PSA.106.42	and made them do whatever they wanted Israel to do. 
PSA.106.43	Often the 
PSA.106.43	But again and again, they decided not to obey him
PSA.106.43	and they did more and more things that were wrong.
PSA.106.44	Yet the 
PSA.106.44	He saw that they had trouble.
PSA.106.45	He remembered what he had agreed.
PSA.106.45	Because of his kind love, he changed his mind.
PSA.106.46	He made all the people that oppressed them feel sorry for them!
PSA.106.47	Save us, our 
PSA.106.47	Then we will be very happy to thank you and to 
PSA.106.48	Praise him now and always! Let everybody say, ‘
PSA.107.1	Thank the 
PSA.107.1	His kind love will never stop.
PSA.107.2	People must say that the 
PSA.107.2	when he has redeemed them from the power of an enemy.
PSA.107.3	He brought them from countries to the east, to the west,
PSA.107.3	to the north; and from the sea. 
PSA.107.4	They moved from place to place in the wild country.
PSA.107.4	They did not find the way to a city to live in.
PSA.107.5	They were hungry and wanted a drink.
PSA.107.5	They thought that they were going to die.
PSA.107.6	Then they prayed to the 
PSA.107.6	And he saved them from the danger that they were in.
PSA.107.7	He led them by an easy road to a city where they might live.
PSA.107.8	They must thank the 
PSA.107.8	And they must thank him for the 
PSA.107.9	His people have enough to drink
PSA.107.9	and he fills the hungry people with good things.
PSA.107.10	Some people sat in 
PSA.107.10	They were 
PSA.107.11	This happened because they did not obey the words of God.
PSA.107.11	They laughed at the plans of the Most High. 
PSA.107.12	Hard work made them listen to him.
PSA.107.12	When they fell down, there was nobody to help them. 
PSA.107.13	Then they prayed to the 
PSA.107.13	And he saved them from the danger that they were in. 
PSA.107.14	He led them out of the darkness and the shadow of death.
PSA.107.14	He broke the 
PSA.107.15	They must thank the 
PSA.107.15	And they must thank him
PSA.107.15	for the 
PSA.107.16	They must thank him because he broke the metal gates
PSA.107.16	and destroyed the iron bars. 
PSA.107.17	Fools went away from the right road
PSA.107.17	and were in pain because of their 
PSA.107.18	They would not eat any food, so they nearly died. 
PSA.107.19	Then they prayed to the 
PSA.107.19	And he saved them from the danger that they were in.
PSA.107.20	He sent his word and he 
PSA.107.20	He saved them from death. 
PSA.107.21	They must thank the 
PSA.107.21	And they must thank him
PSA.107.21	for the wonderful things that he does for people.
PSA.107.22	They must give 
PSA.107.22	And they must sing about what he has done. 
PSA.107.23	Some went down to the sea, to work in deep waters.
PSA.107.24	They saw the 
PSA.107.25	He spoke and a wind started. A storm lifted up the sea.
PSA.107.26	The sailors went up to the sky then down into deep places.
PSA.107.26	The danger made them afraid.
PSA.107.27	It was not possible to stand up, so they fell over like drunks.
PSA.107.27	They did not know what to do! 
PSA.107.28	Then they prayed to the 
PSA.107.28	And he saved them from the danger that they were in.
PSA.107.29	He stopped the noise of the storm and made the sea become quiet.
PSA.107.30	They were happy when it became quiet.
PSA.107.30	He showed them the way to the port that they wanted to reach. 
PSA.107.31	They must thank the 
PSA.107.31	And they must thank him
PSA.107.31	for the wonderful things that he does for people.
PSA.107.32	The people must say that he is great when they meet together.
PSA.107.32	Their leaders must 
PSA.107.33+PSA.107.34	The people who live in some places are very bad.
PSA.107.33+PSA.107.34	In those places, God will make:
PSA.107.33+PSA.107.34	· rivers become 
PSA.107.33+PSA.107.34	· wells of water become dry ground
PSA.107.33+PSA.107.34	· good ground become salt 
PSA.107.35	He can make desert places become pools of water
PSA.107.35	and dry ground become wells of water. 
PSA.107.36	He can give a place to hungry people where they can build a city to live in.
PSA.107.37	They can 
PSA.107.37	Then they will bring home much food.
PSA.107.38	He will be kind to them so that they grow in number.
PSA.107.38	Their animals will not decrease in number. 
PSA.107.39	Then they began to decrease in number
PSA.107.39	because of 
PSA.107.40	He just laughed at their leaders.
PSA.107.40	And he took them into roads that led nowhere. 
PSA.107.41	But he lifts people that are in need out of their trouble.
PSA.107.41	And he makes their families grow like wild animals. 
PSA.107.42	Good people see it and it makes them happy.
PSA.107.42	Bad people just shut their mouths!
PSA.107.43	People that are not 
PSA.107.43	Then they will understand the kind love of the 
PSA.108.1	God, I have decided always to belong to you!
PSA.108.1	I will sing your 
PSA.108.2	Wake up, 
PSA.108.2	I will sing before the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will sing your praises everywhere.
PSA.108.4	Your kind love is great. It is higher than the clouds.

PSA.108.6	Use your right hand to answer us!
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	God did answer us from his 
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	He said:
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· I will be the master.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· I will make a parcel of Shechem.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· I will measure the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· Gilead is mine.

PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· Edom is where I will throw my shoes.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	· Philistia will be something for me to laugh at. 
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me into the strong city?
PSA.108.10	Who will take me into Edom? 
PSA.108.11	You have said that you would not be our God any more.
PSA.108.11	But God, will you really not go with our armies?
PSA.108.12	Give to us help against the enemy,

PSA.109.4	I love them and pray for them.
PSA.109.4	But they 
PSA.109.5	I do good things for them, but they pay me back with bad things.
PSA.109.5	I love them, but they hate me.
PSA.109.6	Put an 
PSA.109.6	Also, make somebody stand by his right hand side to 
PSA.109.7	Make him be 
PSA.109.7	And make his words show that he has done wrong things.
PSA.109.8	Make his life a short one
PSA.109.8	and let somebody else be leader instead of him.
PSA.109.9	Make his children have no father
PSA.109.9	and make his wife a

PSA.109.10	Destroy their home and send them away from it.
PSA.109.11	Make the lender of money take everything that he had.
PSA.109.11	And let strangers get everything that he worked for.
PSA.109.12	Do not let anybody be kind to him.
PSA.109.12	Do not let anybody be kind to the children that he has left without a father.

PSA.109.16	He killed people that were poor.
PSA.109.16	He killed people that needed many things.
PSA.109.16	He killed people that had nobody to give them help.

PSA.109.17	so I want bad things to happen to him!
PSA.109.17	He did not like to say good things about people;
PSA.109.17	so I want nobody to say good things about him!
PSA.109.18	He said bad things about people as often as he put on clothes.
PSA.109.18	I want these bad things to go into his body as the water that he drinks.
PSA.109.18	I want them to go into his bones like oil. 
PSA.109.19	Then the bad things that he says will cover him like his clothes.
PSA.109.19	They will cover him like the belt that he wears every day.
PSA.109.20	This is how I want the

PSA.116.12	What can I give to the 
PSA.116.13	I will offer a cup of

PSA.118.3	‘His kind love will always be with us.’
PSA.118.4	Everyone that is afraid of the

PSA.119.65	as your word says.
PSA.119.66	Teach me. Then I will choose and know what is right.
PSA.119.66	I will do that because I 
PSA.119.67	Before I was in trouble with you I made mistakes.
PSA.119.67	But now I keep to your 
PSA.119.68	You are good and you do good things.
PSA.119.68	Teach me your 
PSA.119.69	but your 
PSA.119.70	Their 
PSA.119.70	but I love your 
PSA.119.71	My trouble was good for me.
PSA.119.71	It made me learn your 
PSA.119.72	Teaching from your mouth is better for me
PSA.119.72	than a lot of 
PSA.119.73	Your hands 
PSA.119.73	Help me to understand and learn your 
PSA.119.74	The people that are afraid of you will be happy.
PSA.119.74	They will be happy when they see me.
PSA.119.74	This is because I am 
PSA.119.75	You were right when you sent me trouble.
PSA.119.76	Now your kind love makes me feel better.
PSA.119.76	You promised this to your servant in your 
PSA.119.77	Send your love to me and I will live!
PSA.119.77	Your 
PSA.119.78	because they say lies about me without any reason.
PSA.119.79	The people that are afraid of you will turn to me again.
PSA.119.79	They understand your 
PSA.119.80	My 
PSA.119.80	I will not be ashamed.
PSA.119.81	I feel weak while I wait for you to save me.
PSA.119.81	My hope is in your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes are closing while I look for your 
PSA.119.82	I say, ‘When will you 
PSA.119.83	I am like a 
PSA.119.83	but I will not forget your 
PSA.119.84	The life of your servant is not very long.
PSA.119.84	When will you make the people that 
PSA.119.85	Your 
PSA.119.86	All your 
PSA.119.86	But people still 
PSA.119.87	People on earth almost destroyed me,
PSA.119.87	but I did not stop following your guidelines.
PSA.119.88	Your kind love gives me life.
PSA.119.88	I will obey your 
PSA.119.90	Your 
PSA.119.90	You have fixed the earth and it will remain.
PSA.119.91	They remain today as your rules say they must.
PSA.119.91	They are all your servants. 
PSA.119.92	If your 
PSA.119.92	then my great 
PSA.119.93	I will never forget your 
PSA.119.93	because in them you give me life.
PSA.119.94	I am yours, save me!
PSA.119.94	Do it because I have looked for your guidelines.
PSA.119.95	The 
PSA.119.95	but I am studying your 
PSA.119.96	I see that all that is good on earth will finish.
PSA.119.96	But your 
PSA.119.97	I love your 
PSA.119.97	I think about it all day long.
PSA.119.98	Your 
PSA.119.98	Your commands are always with me.
PSA.119.99	I understand more than all my teachers
PSA.119.99	because I think about your commands.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the old people
PSA.119.100	because I follow your 
PSA.119.101	I do not let my feet walk in any 
PSA.119.101	because I obey your word.
PSA.119.102	I do not turn away from your rules,
PSA.119.102	because you teach me.
PSA.119.103	Your 
PSA.119.103	They are like something that tastes good.
PSA.119.104	Your guidelines give me help to understand things,
PSA.119.104	so I hate every wrong path.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a 
PSA.119.105	and a light to my path.
PSA.119.106	I have really promised to keep your 
PSA.119.106	and I will do it.
PSA.119.107	People have hurt me very much.
PSA.119.107	Give me the life that your word promises.
PSA.119.108	And I pray that you will teach me your rules.
PSA.119.109	I am always in danger,
PSA.119.109	but I never forget your 
PSA.119.110	but I do not go away from your 
PSA.119.111	Your 
PSA.119.111	and they make my 
PSA.119.112	I will make my heart obey your instructions always, to the end.
PSA.119.113	I hate the people that do not believe you.
PSA.119.113	But I love your 
PSA.119.114	You are my secret place where I can hide.
PSA.119.114	I put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.115	Go away from me, you bad people!
PSA.119.115	I will obey my God's 
PSA.119.116	Give me help and life, as your word promises.
PSA.119.116	And do not make me ashamed, because I hope in you.
PSA.119.117	Give me help and I will be safe.
PSA.119.117	I will always obey your 
PSA.119.118	You turn away from people that do not follow your laws.
PSA.119.118	This is because they speak lies.
PSA.119.118	And they are not honest.
PSA.119.119	You destroy all the bad people in the world as 
PSA.119.119	For this reason I love your 
PSA.119.120	Am afraid of you and it makes my body 
PSA.119.120	I am afraid of your rules.
PSA.119.121	I was 
PSA.119.121	Do not give me to my 
PSA.119.122	Make sure that good things happen to your servant.
PSA.119.122	Do not let 
PSA.119.123	My eyes have stopped seeing that you are saving me.
PSA.119.123	They do not see your righteous 
PSA.119.124	Do with your servant what your kind love suggests.
PSA.119.124	Teach me your 
PSA.119.125	I am your servant. Explain your 
PSA.119.125	so that I understand them.
PSA.119.126	It is time for the 
PSA.119.126	People have not obeyed your 
PSA.119.127+PSA.119.128	I hate every wrong path because:
PSA.119.127+PSA.119.128	· I love your 
PSA.119.127+PSA.119.128	· I think that all your 
PSA.119.129	I obey your 
PSA.119.129	because they are 
PSA.119.130	When I read your words they bring light.
PSA.119.130	They help people that do not know enough to understand things.
PSA.119.131	My mouth is wide open as I 
PSA.119.131	This is because I am so 
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and have 
PSA.119.132	Your rules say that you will do this.
PSA.119.132	You will do this to people that love your name.
PSA.119.133	Make my feet follow your 
PSA.119.133	Do not let 
PSA.119.134	Make me free from 
PSA.119.134	and I will follow your 
PSA.119.135	Show a kind face to your servant
PSA.119.135	and teach me your 
PSA.119.136	Streams of water come from my eyes
PSA.119.136	because people do not obey your 
PSA.119.137	and your rules are good.
PSA.119.138	The 
PSA.119.138	And we can 
PSA.119.139	I am so 
PSA.119.139	But my enemies do not listen to your words.
PSA.119.140	We have found that your 
PSA.119.140	Your servant loves them.
PSA.119.141	I am not important and people do not like me.
PSA.119.141	But I will not forget your 
PSA.119.142	You are always righteous and fair.
PSA.119.142	Your 
PSA.119.143	An enemy brought me trouble,
PSA.119.143	but your 
PSA.119.144	Your instructions are always fair.
PSA.119.144	Make me understand them and find life.
PSA.119.145	I cried with all my 
PSA.119.145	‘I will obey your 
PSA.119.146	‘Save me
PSA.119.146	and I will keep to your 
PSA.119.147	I woke up before dawn and cried to you for help.
PSA.119.147	I want all that you promised in your word.
PSA.119.148	I stayed up all night
PSA.119.148	and thought about your 
PSA.119.149	Listen to my voice, because you are loving and kind.
PSA.119.149	, keep me alive as your rules promise me.
PSA.119.150	The people that 
PSA.119.150	They want to do something very bad to me.
PSA.119.150	They are far away from your 
PSA.119.151	, you are near to me.
PSA.119.151	All your 
PSA.119.152	I have known about your instructions for a long time.
PSA.119.152	And I have known that you made them to continue always.
PSA.119.153	Look at my trouble!
PSA.119.153	Save me because I do not forget your 
PSA.119.154	Fight my fight for me and 
PSA.119.154	Keep me alive as your 
PSA.119.155	They do not look for your 
PSA.119.156	because your rules keep me alive.
PSA.119.157	Many enemies 
PSA.119.157	but I do not go away from your 
PSA.119.158	I see people doing such bad things that I hate them.
PSA.119.158	But, I do not stop obeying your sayings.
PSA.119.159	See how I love your 
PSA.119.159	Keep me alive through your kind love.
PSA.119.160	All your words are true.
PSA.119.160	All your 
PSA.119.161	But it is your word that really makes my 
PSA.119.162	I am very happy with your 
PSA.119.162	I am like someone that finds great riches.
PSA.119.163	I do not like 
PSA.119.163	Your 
PSA.119.164	I 
PSA.119.164	because of your 
PSA.119.165	People that love your teaching have a lot of 
PSA.119.165	Nothing will make them fall down.
PSA.119.166	while I obey your 
PSA.119.167	I will keep to your 
PSA.119.167	because I love them so much.
PSA.119.168	I follow your 
PSA.119.168	because you see all that I do.
PSA.119.169	I am calling to you for help, 
PSA.119.169	I want to understand your word.
PSA.119.170	Hear what I pray and have 
PSA.119.170	Save me, as your 
PSA.119.171	My lips will pour out 
PSA.119.171	because you are 
PSA.119.172	My 
PSA.119.172	because all your 
PSA.119.173	I want your hand to come to my help
PSA.119.173	because I chose to follow your 
PSA.119.174	, I want you to save me.
PSA.119.174	Your teaching makes me very happy.
PSA.119.175	Give me life so that I can praise you.
PSA.119.175	May your rules give me help.
PSA.119.176	I have become like a lost sheep.
PSA.119.176	Look for your servant,
PSA.119.176	because I have not forgotten your 
PSA.120.1	I cried to the 
PSA.120.1	and he answered me.
PSA.120.2	, save me from lips that tell 
PSA.120.2	And save me from a false 
PSA.120.3	What will he do to you
PSA.120.3	and what else will happen to you, you false tongue?
PSA.120.4	The sharp 
PSA.120.4	like wood that is burning.
PSA.120.5	It is bad for me to live in Mesech,
PSA.120.5	with a home among the 
PSA.120.6	I have lived too long with the people that hate 
PSA.120.7	I want peace, but when I say this they want war.
PSA.121.1	When I look up to the hills I find no help there.
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	He made the 
PSA.121.3	He will not let your foot 
PSA.121.3	The one that 
PSA.121.4	It is certain that he will not sleep.
PSA.121.4	The one that guards Israel will never sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun will not hurt you in the day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon at night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	He is the one that guards your life.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	And he guards you when you come in.
PSA.121.8	He will do this now and always.
PSA.122.1	It made me very happy when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	‘We will go into the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Now our feet are standing inside your gates, Jerusalem!
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is a city with buildings that fit near together.
PSA.122.4	The 
PSA.122.4	They go there to thank the 
PSA.122.5	The 
PSA.122.5	Also, they sit there to 
PSA.122.6	Pray for the 
PSA.122.6	Pray that the people that love Jerusalem will be safe.
PSA.122.7	‘I pray that there will be peace inside your walls.
PSA.122.7	And I pray that it will be safe inside your big houses.’
PSA.122.8	Because of my brothers and friends I will pray,
PSA.122.8	‘I want peace inside you.’
PSA.122.9	Because of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will hope for good things for you.
PSA.123.1	I lift up my eyes to you God.
PSA.123.1	You are sitting in 
PSA.123.2	Our eyes look to the 
PSA.123.2	· like men who are servants look to the hands of their masters;
PSA.123.2	· like a woman who is a servant looks to the hand of her 
PSA.123.2	, have 
PSA.123.3	Have mercy on us, 
PSA.123.3	We have had more than enough 
PSA.123.4	We have had more than enough contempt
PSA.123.4	from the 
PSA.124.1	If the 
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3+PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	if the 
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3+PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	· they would have eaten us alive because they were so angry,
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3+PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	· waters would have rushed over us
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3+PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	and a deep river would be over our heads,
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3+PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	· the angry waters would have gone over our heads and drowned us. 
PSA.124.6	We will say good things to the 
PSA.124.6	He did not let them eat us. 
PSA.124.7	We are free and still alive, like a bird that got out of a 
PSA.124.7	The trap became broken and we are free. 
PSA.124.8	The name of the person that sent us help is the 
PSA.124.8	He made 
PSA.125.1	People that 
PSA.125.1	Nothing will move it; it will always be there. 
PSA.125.2	Jerusalem has mountains all round it.
PSA.125.2	Also, the 
PSA.125.3	That is, the land that the 
PSA.125.3	If they did, the righteous people might start doing bad things themselves.
PSA.125.4	Do good things, 
PSA.125.4	Good people are 
PSA.125.5	But 
PSA.125.5	Take them away with the wicked people.
PSA.125.5	Let Israel be at 
PSA.126.1	An army was attacking Zion.
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like people that were dreaming! 
PSA.126.2	Then we laughed a lot.
PSA.126.2	And we shouted because we were so happy!
PSA.126.2	And people in other countries said to each other,
PSA.126.2	‘The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.3	and we are very, very happy.
PSA.126.4	The 
PSA.126.4	It will be like water coming into a dry place where there is a lot of sand. 
PSA.126.5	People that are crying will go out and plant seeds.
PSA.126.5	Later they will sing as they pick the fruits.
PSA.126.6	Someone will go out crying, but with a basket of seeds.
PSA.126.6	He will come home laughing, with a lot of food. 
PSA.127.1	If the 
PSA.127.1	There are men who watch for danger.
PSA.127.1	But if the 
PSA.127.2	If you work all day for food, from early morning to late at night,
PSA.127.2	you will get nothing.
PSA.127.2	It is God who gives sleep. He gives it to the people that he loves. 
PSA.127.3	Children are something that God gives.
PSA.127.3	The fruit of your body is a gift from him.
PSA.127.4	The sons of a young man are like 
PSA.127.5	The man with many of them will be very happy.
PSA.127.5	He will not be ashamed when he meets his enemies in the city gates. 
PSA.128.1	Everyone that is 
PSA.128.1	They will 
PSA.128.2	You will eat the things that your hands have worked for.
PSA.128.2	You are very sure that you will. You will be happy!
PSA.128.2	Good things will happen to you!
PSA.128.3	Your wife in your house will be like a 
PSA.128.3	Your sons round your table will be like branches of an 
PSA.128.4	The 
PSA.128.4	This is how he does it. Make a note of that. 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.5	Then you will see that Jerusalem is a good place for as long as
PSA.128.5	you are alive. 
PSA.128.6	You will see your grandsons and there will be 
PSA.129.1	My enemies have often hurt me since I was a child.
PSA.129.1	Israel can now say this.
PSA.129.2	They have often hurt me since I was a child,
PSA.129.2	but they have not beaten me. 
PSA.129.3	They ploughed on my back
PSA.129.3	like a farmer ploughing long 
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	He has cut me free from my enemies. 
PSA.129.5	Everybody that hates Zion will be ashamed.
PSA.129.5	So they will turn away.
PSA.129.6	They will become like a green plant on a roof.
PSA.129.6	It dies before it starts to grow! 
PSA.129.7	A gardener cannot fill his hand (with it)
PSA.129.7	or a farmer fill his pocket. 
PSA.129.8	People that go past will not say,
PSA.129.8	‘We want the 
PSA.129.8	They will not say
PSA.129.8	‘We want good things to happen to you in the name of the 
PSA.130.2	Turn your ears to hear what I am saying to you. 
PSA.130.3	, if you make a note of 
PSA.130.4	But you 
PSA.130.5	I will wait for the 
PSA.130.5	I will wait for him and 
PSA.130.6	I want the Lord more than people want the morning to come,
PSA.130.6	more than people want the morning. 
PSA.130.7	Israel, hope in the 
PSA.130.7	because with the 
PSA.130.8	He will 
PSA.131.1	I do not try to do things that are too important for me.
PSA.131.1	I do not try to do things that are too hard for me. 
PSA.131.2	Really, I have made myself 
PSA.131.2	I am like a young child with its mother.
PSA.131.2	Yes, I am like a young child with its mother. 
PSA.131.3	Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.132.2	He promised the 
PSA.132.2	He made this special promise to the 
PSA.132.3	‘I will not go into my house or get into my bed.
PSA.132.4	I will not shut my eyes or go to sleep
PSA.132.4	until I find a place for the 
PSA.132.5	It will be a place where the Mighty One of Jacob will live.’ 
PSA.132.6	We heard that it was at Ephratah.
PSA.132.6	And we found it in the fields of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	We will go into the place where he lives.
PSA.132.7	And we will 
PSA.132.8	Get up, 
PSA.132.8	Go in yourself, with the 
PSA.132.8	The ark shows that you are strong.
PSA.132.9	I pray that all your 
PSA.132.9	and all your 
PSA.132.9	They will shout because they are so happy.
PSA.132.10	Remember your servant David
PSA.132.10	and do not turn away the face of your 
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	He will not turn from it.
PSA.132.11	‘I will put the fruit of your body on your 
PSA.132.12	Your children should obey my rules.
PSA.132.12	And they should do what I will teach them.
PSA.132.12	Then their children will always sit on your throne.’
PSA.132.13	The 
PSA.132.13	He wants it for a place to live in.
PSA.132.14	‘This is where I will always rest. This is what I want.
PSA.132.14	So I will live here’, he said.
PSA.132.15	‘I will do a lot of good things for her.
PSA.132.15	I will give food to the poor people in her.
PSA.132.16	All her 
PSA.132.16	They will shout because they are so happy.
PSA.132.17	There I will make David very strong.
PSA.132.17	The light of my 
PSA.132.18	His enemies will be ashamed.
PSA.132.18	But his 
PSA.133.1	See how good it is.
PSA.133.1	And see what pleasure it brings when brothers stay together. 
PSA.133.2	It is as a sweet 
PSA.133.2	It goes down on to the beard, as it did on to Aaron's beard.
PSA.133.2	It then poured down over his clothes. 
PSA.133.3	It is like the 
PSA.133.3	It also pours down on to the mountains of Zion.
PSA.133.3	The 
PSA.133.3	There is always life there. 
PSA.134.1	Come, all you servants of the 
PSA.134.1	And say good things to the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands to where he lives.
PSA.134.2	And say good things to him. 
PSA.134.3	Say good things to the 
PSA.134.3	He made the 
PSA.135.1	Praise him, you servants of the 
PSA.135.2	You are standing in the house of the 
PSA.135.2	You are standing in the 
PSA.135.3	Praise the 
PSA.135.3	Praise his name with songs, because it is 
PSA.135.4	Praise his name because the 
PSA.135.4	Israel is his own 
PSA.135.5	Praise his name because I know that the 
PSA.135.5	Our 
PSA.135.6	The 
PSA.135.6	He does this in the sky and on the earth.
PSA.135.6	And he does it in the deepest parts of the sea.
PSA.135.7	The 
PSA.135.7	He sends rain with 
PSA.135.7	He brings winds from where he stores them. 
PSA.135.8	God destroyed the 
PSA.135.9	He sent signs to 
PSA.135.9	He did them to warn 
PSA.135.10	He destroyed many countries and killed many kings.
PSA.135.11	He killed Sihon the king of the

PRO.1.1	These are the 
PRO.1.2	Here are the 
PRO.1.3	They can help you to understand life. They can teach you how to live a good 
PRO.1.4	They can cause a person who knows nothing to become clever. And they teach young people what they should know. And they teach them the right way to live.
PRO.1.5	These 
PRO.1.6	In that way, they can understand the thoughts that 
PRO.1.7	You must be afraid of the 
PRO.1.8	Listen, my son, to the words of your father. And do not forget what your mother taught you. 
PRO.1.9	A circle of leaves round your head and a 
PRO.1.10	When bad men try to cause you to 
PRO.1.11	They may say, ‘Come with us. We will find someone to kill. We will attack people who have not done anything wrong.
PRO.1.12	They may be alive and well when we find them. But they will be dead when we leave them.
PRO.1.13	We will get lots of valuable things and we will fill our houses with them.
PRO.1.14	Come and join us. Our money will be your money. And your money will be our money.’
PRO.1.15	My son, do not go with people like that. Stay away from them.
PRO.1.16	They cannot wait to do something bad. They are always in a hurry to kill.
PRO.1.17	The bird that you want to catch may be watching you. So do not show the bird how you will catch it.
PRO.1.18	In the same way, these men want to kill other men. But in the end, they will die themselves.
PRO.1.19	This is the end of everyone who will kill people to take things from them. That person will die himself as a result.
PRO.1.20	Listen! Someone 
PRO.1.21	She speaks in the city. She shouts loudly at the gates, and in all places where people meet.
PRO.1.22	‘Some silly people enjoy being silly. Some people enjoy 
PRO.1.23	I will let you know my thoughts and how I feel. Listen when I tell you about danger.
PRO.1.24	I shouted to you and I asked you to come. But you refused to come. Nobody listened to what I was saying.
PRO.1.25	You refused to listen to my 
PRO.1.26	So, when you are in trouble, I will 
PRO.1.27	You may be afraid as if you were in a storm. Your troubles may be dangerous like a very strong wind. Pain and problems may happen to you.
PRO.1.28	Then you will shout to me, but I will not answer. You will look for me everywhere, but you will not find me.
PRO.1.29	You have never liked to hear 
PRO.1.30	You have never wanted to listen to my 
PRO.1.31	So now other people will 
PRO.1.32	Silly people and 
PRO.1.33	But whoever listens to me will live safely. And so he will be really quiet. And he will not be afraid of bad things that might happen to him.’
PRO.2.1	Learn what I teach you, my son. And never forget what I ask you to do.
PRO.2.2	Listen to my 
PRO.2.3	Yes, do not stop asking for 
PRO.2.4	Look for 
PRO.2.5	So you will know how to be afraid of the 
PRO.2.6	It is the 
PRO.2.7	He helps good people to be 
PRO.2.8	He keeps people safe who are fair to other people. And he watches over those people who obey him.
PRO.2.9	Listen to me. So you will know what is right. You will know what are true and fair words. You will know what you should do.
PRO.2.10	You will become 
PRO.2.11	Your good thoughts and the things that you understand will help you. They will be like someone who is watching over you to keep you safe.
PRO.2.12	So you will not do the wrong thing. They will keep you from people who want to cause trouble.
PRO.2.13	Those people are like people who leave the straight paths. They are like people who walk in dark ways.
PRO.2.14	Those people enjoy doing the wrong things. They enjoy doing bad things for no good reason.
PRO.2.15	Those people will not do the right thing. They always do very bad things.
PRO.2.16	An 
PRO.2.17	She leaves her own husband. And she forgets the promises that she said to God at the time of her marriage.
PRO.2.18	If you go to her house, you will travel the road to death. Her paths will lead to where dead people are.
PRO.2.19	Nobody who visits her will ever return. He will never return to the way to 
PRO.2.20	So you must do as good people do. And you must live a good life.
PRO.2.21	People who are good will live in the country. 
PRO.2.22	But God will remove the bad people from this country. He will pull 
PRO.3.1	Do not forget what I teach you, my son. Always remember what I ask you to do.
PRO.3.2	What I teach will give you a long and good life. And it will give you 
PRO.3.3	Do not let love go, and always do right things. Keep them like valuable stones round your neck and never forget them.
PRO.3.4	If you do that, you will make God happy. And you will make people happy too.
PRO.3.5	Always 
PRO.3.6	Remember the 
PRO.3.7	Do not think about yourself as 
PRO.3.8	If you do, it will be like good medicine. It will be like medicine that makes your body well. And it will be like something that makes your bones strong.
PRO.3.9	Obey the 
PRO.3.10	If you do, you will not have enough places to store everything from your farm. And you will have more 
PRO.3.11	My son, the 
PRO.3.12	A father may be happy that his son is doing good things. But he will tell him if his son has done something wrong. The 
PRO.3.13	Happy is anyone who becomes 
PRO.3.14	It is better than 
PRO.3.15	It is better to be 
PRO.3.16	If you are 
PRO.3.17	When you are 
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.20	The 
PRO.3.21	My son, remember my 
PRO.3.22	That will keep your 
PRO.3.23	You will walk and you will not fall. Your feet will keep to the path.
PRO.3.24	You will not be afraid when you go to bed. And you will sleep well.
PRO.3.25	Bad things happen to bad men. But you will not have to be afraid about bad things that might surprise you.
PRO.3.26	You will be able to 
PRO.3.27	Do not refuse to do good things to those that need it. Always do good things to them when you can.
PRO.3.28	Do not ask anyone to wait until tomorrow if you can help them today.
PRO.3.29	The man who lives next to you 
PRO.3.30	Do not quarrel with other people for no good reason when they have never done anything wrong to you.
PRO.3.31	You should not want to be like bad people. Do not do anything that they do.
PRO.3.32	The 
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.34	The 
PRO.4.1	Listen to what your father teaches you my sons. If you listen, you will understand.
PRO.4.2	The things that I am teaching you are good. So remember them.
PRO.4.3	When I was a little boy, the one son of my parents,
PRO.4.4	my father taught me. He said,
PRO.4.4	‘Remember what I say. And never forget it. Obey my words. If you do, you will live.
PRO.4.5	Look for words that are 
PRO.4.6	If you obey my 
PRO.4.7	To learn 
PRO.4.8	If you love 
PRO.4.9	Everyone will speak well about you when they hear your 
PRO.4.10	Listen to me, my son, and accept my words. If you do, the years of your life will be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught you 
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your steps will be sure. And when you run, you will not fall.
PRO.4.13	Always remember what you have learnt. Do not forget it. The things that you have learnt will give you 
PRO.4.14	Do not go where bad people go. Do not follow the ways of bad people.
PRO.4.15	Do not do it! Keep away from every bad thing! Refuse it and go on your way.
PRO.4.16	Bad people cannot sleep unless they have done something wrong. They lie awake unless they have caused someone to fall.
PRO.4.17	To do bad things is like food and drink to bad men.
PRO.4.18	But the road that good people travel along is like the sunrise. It gets brighter and brighter until it is really day.
PRO.4.19	But the road of bad people is as dark as night. They fall. But they cannot see what has caused them to fall.
PRO.4.20	Listen to what I say, my son. Listen to my words.
PRO.4.21	Never let my words leave you. Think about them and obey them.
PRO.4.22	They will give 
PRO.4.23	Be careful how you think. Your thoughts make you the person that you are.
PRO.4.24	Never say anything that is not true.
PRO.4.25	Look straight in front of you. And watch where you are going.
PRO.4.26	You must decide to do things carefully. So whatever you do will be right.
PRO.4.27	Keep away from bad people and walk on a straight path. Do not go one step off the right way.
PRO.5.1	My son, listen to my 
PRO.5.2	If you do, you will always choose to do the right thing. And your words will show that you are 
PRO.5.3	The lips of the wife of another man will be as sweet as 
PRO.5.4	But in the end, she gives you something that is like a 
PRO.5.5	She will take you down to the world of dead persons. The road that she walks is the road to death.
PRO.5.6	She does not think about the way to 
PRO.5.7	So listen to me, my sons. Never forget what I am saying.
PRO.5.8	Keep away from a woman like that! Do not even go near the door of her house.
PRO.5.9	If you do, other people will not speak well about you. You will die young because a cruel person will kill you.
PRO.5.10	Strangers will take all your money. What you have worked for will go into a stranger's house.
PRO.5.11	Near the end of your life, you will shout out because your body will be so sick and weak.
PRO.5.12	You will say, ‘I certainly should have learned. People told me that I was doing the wrong things. But I thought that it was not important.
PRO.5.13	I did not listen to my teachers. I did not want to do what they said.
PRO.5.14	In front of all the people I lost the importance that they once gave to me.’
PRO.5.15	Enjoy sex with your own wife.
PRO.5.16	If you have children by other women, they will not help you.
PRO.5.17	Your children should grow up to help you. They should not grow up to help strangers.
PRO.5.18	So be happy with your wife. You married her when you were young. Enjoy the woman that you married.
PRO.5.19	She is pretty and she is as nice to watch as a young animal. Let her body keep you happy at all times. Always enjoy her love.
PRO.5.20	You should not give your love to another woman, my son. You should not go to another man's wife.
PRO.5.21	The 
PRO.5.22	The bad things that a bad person does cover him like a 
PRO.5.23	He will not let anyone tell him that he is wrong. So he will die. He will be like a 
PRO.6.1	You may have promised to pay the debts of a friend or of a stranger.
PRO.6.2	You may have let a man use your words and promises for his own purposes.
PRO.6.3	So now, you are in the power of that man. Hurry to him and ask him quietly to make you free from your promise.
PRO.6.4	Do not let yourself sleep or even stop to rest.
PRO.6.5	Like a bird or a wild animal that runs away from the hunter, make yourself free.
PRO.6.6	Lazy people should learn a lesson from the way that 
PRO.6.7	They have no leader or ruler,
PRO.6.8	but they prepare their food during the summer. They get it at the time of 
PRO.6.9	You lie in bed too long, you lazy man! It seems that you will never get up out of bed!
PRO.6.10	‘I will have only a short sleep’, he says. ‘I will stop work and I will rest for a short time.’
PRO.6.11	But while you sleep you will lose all your things. It is as if someone robs you.
PRO.6.12	Bad people go about and they tell everybody false things.
PRO.6.13	They send messages with their eyes, their feet and their fingers. They want people to believe what is false.
PRO.6.14	They think about how to say what is not true. They decide to do bad things all the time. They cause quarrels everywhere.
PRO.6.15	Because of this, very bad trouble will happen to them. It will happen quickly and they will not be able to make things better.
PRO.6.16	There are 6 things that the 
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	A person who thinks that he is great
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	A mouth that speaks false things
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	Hands that kill people that have done nothing wrong
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	A mind that decides to do what is wrong
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	Feet that hurry to do bad things
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	A person who gives false reports of what he has seen
PRO.6.17+PRO.6.18+PRO.6.19	Someone who causes trouble among friends.
PRO.6.20	Obey your father's rules, my son. And never forget what your mother taught you.
PRO.6.21	Do not forget their words. Think about them often.
PRO.6.22	When you walk, they will lead you. When you sleep, they will keep you safe. When you wake up, they will speak to you.
PRO.6.23	Their rules and what they taught you are like a light. They told you when you did wrong things. And that showed you how to live.
PRO.6.24	They can keep you away from bad women. An 
PRO.6.25	Do not want these beautiful women. And do not let them cause you to do wrong things.
PRO.6.26	A 
PRO.6.27	You cannot carry fire next to your body and not burn your clothes.
PRO.6.28	A man cannot walk over a fire and not burn his feet.
PRO.6.29	It is like that when a man sleeps with another man's wife. 
PRO.6.30	Someone may rob to get food when he is hungry. So people do not think that he is bad.
PRO.6.31	But if someone catches him, he must pay back more. He must pay back 7 things for each thing that he took. He must give up everything that he has in his house.
PRO.6.32	But an 
PRO.6.33	Men will hit him. They will no longer think that he is a good man. They will never forget his 
PRO.6.34	The husband will have bad thoughts about the 
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any money. He will refuse any amount of gifts.
PRO.7.1	Remember what I say, my son. Never forget my rules.
PRO.7.2	If you obey my rules, you will live. Keep my words as you keep your eyes safe.
PRO.7.3	Remember my words. Think about them all the time.
PRO.7.4	Love 
PRO.7.6	Once I was looking out of the window of my house.
PRO.7.7	I saw a group of young men who did not know very much. Among them was a boy who was not 
PRO.7.8	He was walking along the street near the house of a certain woman, and he passed her house.
PRO.7.9	It was in the evening after it was dark.
PRO.7.10	Then she met him. Her clothes were like those that an 
PRO.7.11	She was a bad woman. She never did what she should do. Her feet never stayed at her home.
PRO.7.12	Sometimes she stood in the streets and sometimes she stood in the market place. She waited at the corners of the streets.
PRO.7.13	She put her arms round the young man and she kissed him. She looked into his eyes.
PRO.7.14	She said, ‘I have meat from the 
PRO.7.15	So I came out to meet you. I was looking for you, and I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have covered my bed with cloths from Egypt.
PRO.7.17	And the colour of it and the smell of it are beautiful.
PRO.7.18	Come, let me lie all night in your arms. We can enjoy ourselves with love all night long.
PRO.7.19	My husband is not here. He has gone away on a long journey.
PRO.7.20	He took plenty of money with him and he will not be back for two weeks.’
PRO.7.21	She tried to cause him to 
PRO.7.22	Immediately he followed her like an 
PRO.7.23	Then they kill that man with sharp sticks. He was like a bird that hurries into a 
PRO.7.24	So, my sons, listen to me. Listen to what I say.
PRO.7.25	Do not love that kind of a woman. Do not go after her.
PRO.7.26	She has caused the death of many men. They are too many to count.

PRO.8.1	Listen. You should be able to hear the 
PRO.8.2	You will hear these words high on the hills along the way. You will hear these words where the paths meet.
PRO.8.3	Next to the gates that go into the city, you will hear these words. Someone will be shouting them aloud at the doors where you go in.
PRO.8.4	‘I shout out to all of you, to everyone on earth.
PRO.8.5	You who do not have 
PRO.8.6	Listen to my very good words. All that I tell you is right.
PRO.8.7	What I say is true. I 
PRO.8.8	Everything that I say is true. None of my words are false. They do not turn people on to the wrong path.
PRO.8.10	Choose my 
PRO.8.12	I, 
PRO.8.13	Those who are afraid of the 
PRO.8.14	I tell people how to do the right things. I am 
PRO.8.15	I help kings to rule, and I help rulers to make fair rules.
PRO.8.16	I help rulers to rule. And I help officers who work for the king. I help all the fair 
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me. Whoever looks for me will find me.
PRO.8.18	I make people rich and great. I help people not to waste their money. And I help them to do the right things.
PRO.8.19	What you get from me is better than gold. It is better even than the best gold. It is better than the best 
PRO.8.20	I walk the way that is good. I follow the paths that are fair.
PRO.8.21	I make those people rich who love me. I fill their houses with valuable things.

PRO.8.29	He said how high the waters of the sea should rise. They must not rise any higher than what he said. I was there when he 
PRO.8.30	I was next to him and I was a help to him every day. I gave him pleasure always. I was happy to be with him.
PRO.8.31	I was happy in his whole world and all the people gave me pleasure.
PRO.8.32	So, my sons, listen to me. Do as I say. If you do, you will be happy.
PRO.8.33	Listen to your teacher. If you are 
PRO.8.34	Happy is the man who listens to me. He watches every day at my gates, and he waits at my door.

PRO.9.2	She has prepared her meat and she has mixed her

PRO.9.16	‘Anyone who is silly should come in here’, she says. And she says to any man who has no

PRO.10.5	The man who cuts the plants in his field in the summer is a 
PRO.10.6	God will do many good things for people who live good lives. The words of bad people hide the fact that they are very angry.
PRO.10.7	It is a pleasure to remember good people. But when bad people die, everyone will forget their name.
PRO.10.10	Someone who does not speak true words causes trouble. But a 
PRO.10.11	The words of a good man are like the water that gives 
PRO.10.12	People who 
PRO.10.15	Money keeps rich people safe. But poor people die because they do not have money.
PRO.10.16	The money that good people receive for their work keeps them alive. But what bad people receive is 
PRO.10.17	People may tell a man that he is wrong. If he listens, he will live. But the man who refuses to listen is making a big mistake.
PRO.10.18	Some people say what is not true. They hide the fact that they 
PRO.10.19	The more you talk, the more possible it is for you to 
PRO.10.20	The words of a good person are like the best 
PRO.10.21	The words of a good person will help many people. But you can kill yourself if you are not 
PRO.10.22	Good things from the 
PRO.10.23	A 
PRO.10.24	Bad people will get what they are afraid of. Good men will get what they want.
PRO.10.25	When the storm has finished, bad people are no longer there. But good people are always safe.
PRO.10.26	Do not send a lazy person with a message. He will be like bad 
PRO.10.27	If you are afraid of the 
PRO.10.28	What good people hope for makes them happy. What bad people hope for does not happen.
PRO.10.29	The 
PRO.10.30	Good people will always be safe. But bad people will not stay in the country.
PRO.10.31	Good people speak 
PRO.10.32	Good people say kind things. But bad people say things that are not kind.
PRO.11.1	The 
PRO.11.2	Some people think that they are great. But they will really be ashamed. But people who do not think like that speak 
PRO.11.3	Good people are 
PRO.11.4	Much money will not help you on the day of your death. But if you are a good person you can save your 
PRO.11.5	An 
PRO.11.6	The good things that good men do will keep them safe. But the bad 
PRO.11.7	A bad man dies. And then what he wants dies with him. All that he wanted from his power becomes nothing.
PRO.11.8	Trouble does not destroy a good man, but it happens to the bad man instead.
PRO.11.9	People without God can destroy you by the way that they talk. But 
PRO.11.10	When good men do well, people in the city will be happy. Also, people will be happy when bad men die. The people will shout because they are happy.
PRO.11.11	A city becomes great when good men want it to be happy. But the words of bad men destroy it.
PRO.11.12	A silly man thinks that the people near to him are not important. But a man who is 
PRO.11.13	If a man talks too much, he tells people secrets. You can tell your secret to a man who is 
PRO.11.14	The people in a country will fall if it has no 
PRO.11.15	If you promise to pay the debt of a stranger, you will be sorry. If you do not promise things like that, you will be safe.
PRO.11.16	People think that a beautiful woman is great. But strong men only get money.
PRO.11.17	A kind man causes good things to happen to himself. A cruel man causes trouble for himself.
PRO.11.18	The money that bad men get because of their work will not do any good thing on their behalf. But the man who does the right things will receive good things.
PRO.11.19	The man who decides to do right things will live. But anyone who does wrong things will die.
PRO.11.20	The 
PRO.11.21	Be sure about this: The 
PRO.11.22	A beautiful woman may refuse to know what is good. A woman like that is like a gold ring in a pig's nose.
PRO.11.23	What good people want always causes good things to happen. Bad people may get what they want. But then God will 
PRO.11.24	One man gives away his money and he gets even more. Another man refuses to pay his servants for what they have done. And he becomes poor.
PRO.11.25	If you give away your money, you will receive more. If you help other people, they will help you.
PRO.11.26	A man may want to keep the seeds that people can eat from the plants in his field. People will speak bad words against him if he is waiting to get more money. But they will say good things if he sells those seeds to them.
PRO.11.27	The man who looks for good things will be very happy. But the man who looks for trouble will get trouble.
PRO.11.28	A man may think that his money will save him. But he will fall like the leaves in autumn. But the good man will not fall. His valuable things will be like the green leaves in summer.
PRO.11.29	The man who causes trouble for his family will have nothing in the end. And the 
PRO.11.30	The man who decides to do good things lives a really good life. The man who wins 
PRO.11.31	Men who are good receive many good things. You can be sure that bad men will receive 
PRO.12.1	Some people like to know things. And they want to know when they are wrong. But 
PRO.12.2	Good people give pleasure to the 
PRO.12.3	A man who is bad will never be safe. But good people will never need to be afraid.
PRO.12.4	A good wife gives pleasure to her husband and she makes him happy. But a bad wife makes her husband ashamed. She causes him to be like a man who has weak bones.
PRO.12.5	The 
PRO.12.6	The words of very bad people can cause murder. But the words of good people can save lives.
PRO.12.7	Bad men will die and they will not have any children. But the families of good men will live.
PRO.12.8	People speak well about a 
PRO.12.9	A man may let people think that he is important. But this same man may not have enough food to eat. It is bad to be a man like that. People may think that another man is not important. But, if that man has a servant, it is better to be a man like that.
PRO.12.10	Good people are kind to their animals. But very bad people are always cruel.
PRO.12.11	A farmer who does much work has plenty to eat. But a 
PRO.12.12	Bad people look for bad things to do. But good people do well in everything that they do.
PRO.12.13	The words of bad men get them into trouble. But a good man will get out of trouble.
PRO.12.14	When you say all things well, you will get many good things. And when you do all things well, people will give you many good things.
PRO.12.15	The way of a 
PRO.12.16	A 
PRO.12.17	You can believe a man who usually speaks true words. But you cannot believe a man who speaks 
PRO.12.18	Careless words can cut like a sharp knife. But to speak 
PRO.12.19	A false word continues for only a short time. But true words continue for all time.
PRO.12.20	Those people who are bad decide to do bad things. But those people who help other people to live without trouble will be happy.
PRO.12.21	Nothing bad will happen to good people. But nothing but trouble will happen to bad people.
PRO.12.22	The 
PRO.12.24	Much work will give you power. But if you are lazy, you will become a servant.
PRO.12.25	If you are afraid, you will not be happy. But kind words will make you happy.
PRO.12.26	A good man is like a guide to his friend. But bad people are like someone who has gone on to the wrong path.
PRO.12.27	The lazy man does not cook the animals that he caught. But another man works well. His good things are very important to him.
PRO.12.28	Good men are like men who follow the road to 
PRO.13.1	A 
PRO.13.2	Good people will get good things for what they say. Bad people like to fight.
PRO.13.3	The man who is careful with his words keeps his 
PRO.13.4	A lazy person may want something, but he will not get it. A person who does a lot of work will receive many good things.
PRO.13.6	When good people do right things, it keeps them safe. But when 
PRO.13.7	Some people want other people to think that they are rich. But really, they have nothing. Other people want people to think that they are poor. But really, they have a lot of money.
PRO.13.8	A rich man must use his money to save his 
PRO.13.9	Good people seem to shine like a bright light. But bad people are like a light that is going out.
PRO.13.10	A man may think that he is great. But he only causes quarrels. But the man who listens to good words is 
PRO.13.11	If you have not received your money in an 
PRO.13.12	Someone may not receive what he hopes for. So he is very sad. But he may get what he wants. If he does, he is very happy.
PRO.13.13	Do not refuse to listen to 
PRO.13.14	The words of 
PRO.13.15	People like anyone who speaks 
PRO.13.16	Careful people think before they do anything. Silly people let everybody see how silly they are.
PRO.13.17	A bad man brings a message and he causes trouble to himself. But you can 
PRO.13.18	If a man refuses to learn he will be poor. He seems like a 
PRO.13.19	How good it is to get what you want! But silly people 
PRO.13.20	The man who has 
PRO.13.21	Trouble seems to follow 
PRO.13.22	When a good man dies, his grandchildren get his money. But a 
PRO.13.23	A poor man may have a lot of food from his farm. But a bad man near to him may destroy it.
PRO.13.24	If you do not 
PRO.13.25	The good man has enough food to eat, but bad men are always hungry.
PRO.14.1	The 
PRO.14.2	An 
PRO.14.4	When a farmer has no 
PRO.14.5	An 
PRO.14.6	Some people laugh about 
PRO.14.7	Stay away from silly people. They have nothing to teach you.
PRO.14.8	A clever person knows what to do. So he is 
PRO.14.9	Silly people are not sorry when they 
PRO.14.10	When you are happy, you yourself are happy. When you are sad, you yourself are sad. Nobody else is happy or sad with you.
PRO.14.11	The house of a good person will not fall, but anything can destroy the house of a bad person.
PRO.14.12	There is a way that seems right to a man. But in the end, it leads him to death.
PRO.14.13	A man may be sad even when he is laughing. He may smile but he may still not be happy in the end.
PRO.14.14	A man who was good may now be bad. A man like that receives a lot of bad things. But a good man receives a lot of good things.
PRO.14.15	A 
PRO.14.16	A 
PRO.14.17	An angry man does silly things. And people 
PRO.14.18	People who do not know anything get into trouble. But careful people become 
PRO.14.19	Bad people must bend their knees to good people. And they must ask the good people to be kind to them.
PRO.14.20	Nobody likes poor people, not even those near to them. But rich people have many friends.
PRO.14.21	A man may think that he is better than those near to him. A man like that is a 
PRO.14.22	People who try to do bad things make a mistake. But those who do good things for other people will find love and 
PRO.14.23	All work causes you to have money. But people who talk too much become poor.
PRO.14.24	To a 
PRO.14.25	Someone may speak true words about what he has seen. If he does, he will keep 
PRO.14.26	When a man is afraid of the 
PRO.14.27	To be afraid of the 
PRO.14.28	When a king rules many people, he is great. But without the people, he is nothing.
PRO.14.29	A patient man can understand many things, but an angry man does not know anything.
PRO.14.30	A mind that does not have trouble causes the body to be well. But when someone thinks bad thoughts about other people, he becomes sick.
PRO.14.31	A man may be cruel to poor people. But really he thinks bad things about God who 
PRO.14.32	When bad men do wrong things, they destroy themselves. But good men have hope even in death.
PRO.14.34	A country becomes great when it does right things. But 
PRO.14.35	A 
PRO.15.1	A person stops being angry when people answer him kindly. But a cruel word makes a person angry.
PRO.15.2	When 
PRO.15.3	The 
PRO.15.4	Kind words cause 
PRO.15.5	A 
PRO.15.6	Good people have many valuable things in their house. But the valuable things of bad people cause them trouble.
PRO.15.7	It is 
PRO.15.8	The 
PRO.15.9	The 
PRO.15.10	If you do wrong things, you will receive 
PRO.15.11	Death and the things that destroy people lie open in front of the 
PRO.15.12	Some people laugh about 
PRO.15.13	When people are happy, they smile. But when they feel sad inside themselves, their 
PRO.15.15	All the days of poor people are sad. But happy people enjoy life.
PRO.15.16	You may be poor but you obey the 
PRO.15.17	It is good to eat vegetables with people that you love. That is better than to eat good meat with people who 
PRO.15.18	Angry people cause quarrels, but patient people cause everything to be quiet.
PRO.15.19	If you are lazy, you will find difficulty everywhere. But if you are 
PRO.15.20	A 
PRO.15.22	Good ideas become like nothing without the 
PRO.15.23	When you hear the right word at the right time, it makes you happy.
PRO.15.24	A 
PRO.15.25	The 
PRO.15.26	The 
PRO.15.27	A man may want to get a lot of money in ways that are not 
PRO.15.28	Good people think before they answer. Bad people answer quickly, but the answer causes trouble.
PRO.15.29	The 
PRO.15.30	A face that smiles makes you happy. Good news makes you feel better.
PRO.15.31	You can tell some men that they have done wrong things. Your words could save their 
PRO.15.32	Some men 
PRO.15.33	When a man is afraid of the 
PRO.16.1	We may have good ideas. But only the 
PRO.16.2	Whatever you do may be right in your own mind. But the 
PRO.16.3	If you bring your ideas to the 
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.5	Some people think that they are great. The 
PRO.16.6	God will cover your 
PRO.16.7	When you give pleasure to the 
PRO.16.8	It is better to be poor and good than to get rich and not to be fair.
PRO.16.9	You may have your ideas. But it is the 
PRO.16.10	The king speaks with authority from God. He will be a good 
PRO.16.11	The 
PRO.16.12	Kings 
PRO.16.13	Kings like to hear honest words. They will love those people who speak true words.
PRO.16.14	If the king becomes angry, someone may die. So a 
PRO.16.15	When the king smiles, it means 
PRO.16.16	It is better to become 
PRO.16.17	A good man keeps away from what is bad. So watch where you are going. It may keep your 
PRO.16.18	A man may think that he is great. He will really destroy himself in the end. A man may think that he is better than everyone else. A man like that will soon fall.
PRO.16.19	A man may think that he is great. So he robs other people. You should not receive any of those things when he gives them out. It is better not to have those things and to live among poor people. It is better to think that you are not important.
PRO.16.20	If you listen to good words, you will do well. A man who 
PRO.16.21	A 
PRO.16.22	For a 
PRO.16.25	There is a way that seems right to a man. But, in the end, it causes his death.
PRO.16.26	It is not a bad thing when a worker feels hungry. It causes him to work more.
PRO.16.27	Bad people look for ways to hurt other people, and even their words are like a fire.
PRO.16.28	A bad man causes quarrels. And the careless words of a man can cause friends to be separate.
PRO.16.29	A cruel man causes those near to him to believe false things. And he causes them to do wrong things.
PRO.16.30	A man may close one eye when he looks at you. Or he may move his lips in a strange way. Be careful, because he may be thinking about something bad.
PRO.16.31	Long life is a gift to good people. Grey hair is like the beautiful thing that kings wear on their heads.
PRO.16.32	A patient man does not become angry quickly. He is better than a strong man. A man like that is better than a soldier who beats the enemies in a city.
PRO.16.33	People use 
PRO.17.1	You may have to eat a bit of dry bread. But to eat it with a quiet mind is better than to eat plenty in a house full of quarrels.
PRO.17.2	A 
PRO.17.3	Fire will show how good gold and 
PRO.17.4	Bad people listen to bad ideas. Those who speak false words listen to false words.
PRO.17.5	You should not say things that are not kind about poor people. If you do, you are not speaking well about God. You should not be happy when trouble has happened to someone. If you are, God will 
PRO.17.6	Grandparents enjoy their grandchildren. In the same way, children think that their parents are great.
PRO.17.7	It does not seem right when a 
PRO.17.8	Some people think that a 
PRO.17.9	People may do bad things to you. If you want them to love you, do not remember those bad things. Remember that those bad things can cause a quarrel among very good friends.
PRO.17.10	You can tell a 
PRO.17.11	A man that always causes trouble wants bad things to happen. So a cruel man will tell him bad news.
PRO.17.12	When someone takes a young animal away from its mother, the mother is very angry. But it is better to meet this mother animal than to meet a 
PRO.17.13	Do not give bad things for what is good. If you do, bad things will always happen to you and to your family.
PRO.17.14	To start a quarrel is like the first small hole in a 
PRO.17.15	People may let a man be free when he has done wrong things. Or they may 
PRO.17.16	Money does not do anything good for a 
PRO.17.17	A friend loves at all times and a brother is always there to help at the bad times.
PRO.17.18	Only a 
PRO.17.19	A man who loves a quarrel really loves 
PRO.17.20	A man who thinks wrong things cannot do well. The man who speaks false words gets into trouble.
PRO.17.21	To have a 
PRO.17.22	A happy mind is like good medicine. But when you are sad and lonely you will become ill.
PRO.17.23	Bad 
PRO.17.24	A 
PRO.17.25	To have a 
PRO.17.26	It is not good to 
PRO.17.27	A 
PRO.17.28	Even a 
PRO.18.1	People who are not friendly with other people think only about themselves. They will refuse to listen to what everyone else knows to be right.
PRO.18.2	A 
PRO.18.4	The words that a 
PRO.18.5	You should not refuse to 
PRO.18.6	When a 
PRO.18.7	When a 
PRO.18.9	A lazy person is like someone who destroys things.
PRO.18.10	The name of the 
PRO.18.11	Rich people think that their money makes them safe like high, strong walls round a city.
PRO.18.12	Something will happen to destroy a 
PRO.18.13	Listen before you answer. If you do not listen, you are a silly 
PRO.18.14	When a man is sick, his 
PRO.18.16	If you want to meet a great person, take a gift to him. Then it will be easy.
PRO.18.17	Two men may argue with each other. The first man will seem right until the second man speaks.
PRO.18.18	Two powerful men may argue. Then they can use 
PRO.18.19	You may make a brother angry. It will be difficult to become friends with him again. It will be more difficult than it would be to beat the people in a strong city. And it is more difficult to stop quarrels than it is to get into a strong building.
PRO.18.20	You have to live with the result of the words that you speak.
PRO.18.21	Words are able to save 
PRO.18.22	If you find a wife, you find a good thing. It shows that the 
PRO.18.23	A poor man asks for help, but a rich man replies with angry words.
PRO.18.24	A man with many friends may lose them. But there is a friend who keeps nearer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	It is better to be poor but 
PRO.19.2	Not to know the facts is not good. And if you hurry, you will get into trouble.
PRO.19.3	Some people do silly things and so they destroy themselves. Then they get angry with the 
PRO.19.4	Rich people are always finding new friends. But poor people only have a few friends. And poor people cannot even keep those friends.
PRO.19.5	If you tell 
PRO.19.6	Many people try to be a friend of an important person because of the gifts that he gives to them.
PRO.19.7	The family of a poor man does not want to know him. His friends do not want to know him. Even if he shouts to them, he cannot find them.
PRO.19.8	It is good for a man to learn all that he can. Remember what you learn. If you do, you will get good things.
PRO.19.9	If you tell 
PRO.19.11	A man who speaks 
PRO.19.12	When the king is angry he makes a noise like a 
PRO.19.13	A father loses all his money when his son is a 
PRO.19.14	When his parents die a man can receive their house and money. But only the 
PRO.19.15	A lazy man sleeps during the day. And that kind of man will be hungry.
PRO.19.16	If you obey God's rules, you will live. If you are careless about them, you will die.
PRO.19.17	To be kind to a poor man is the same as to give money to the 
PRO.19.18	When your son is young, do not help him to his death. 
PRO.19.19	Do not help an angry man, because he will get into trouble all the time. If you help him, you will have to do it again and again.
PRO.19.20	If you listen to 
PRO.19.21	A man may have lots of ideas. But the 
PRO.19.22	It is a good thing for a man to be kind. And it is better to be poor than to tell 
PRO.19.23	If you are afraid of the 
PRO.19.24	A lazy man puts his hand into his food. But then he is too lazy to put the food into his own mouth.
PRO.19.26	The man who robs his father is a bad son. And the man who sends his mother away from his home will make her ashamed.
PRO.19.27	Son, listen when someone is teaching you. If you do not, you will soon forget their 
PRO.19.28	Nobody can stop a bad 
PRO.19.29	People will 
PRO.20.1	When you drink too much alcohol you become loud and silly. And you want to fight people. It is not 
PRO.20.2	An angry 
PRO.20.3	Any 
PRO.20.4	A lazy farmer who does not plough his fields in winter will have nothing to eat in the summer.
PRO.20.5	The thoughts of a man are like deep waters. But a 
PRO.20.6	Many men say that they love other people. But there are not many men that you can 
PRO.20.7	An 
PRO.20.8	A king looks at a man. Then he will know if that man is bad.
PRO.20.9	Nobody can say, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’ Nobody can say, ‘I have not 
PRO.20.10	Some people weigh or measure things in a wrong way. The 
PRO.20.11	What children do is important. It shows what they are like. And you will know if they are 
PRO.20.12	The ears are to hear with and the eyes are to see with. The 
PRO.20.13	Too much sleep will make you poor. If you keep awake, you will have plenty of food.
PRO.20.14	A man may buy something at a good price. But he says that the price is too much. He goes away. Then he likes to say that he was really clever. He was clever because he bought something so cheap.
PRO.20.16	You should not promise to pay the debts of a stranger. That would be silly. If you do, you might lose your own clothes or your things.
PRO.20.17	You may eat something that is not yours. It may seem good when you taste it. But soon it will seem like sand.
PRO.20.18	Ask for help when you do not know what to do. If you do, you will do well. Do not go to war unless you prepare for it. First ask 
PRO.20.19	Stay away from people who talk too much. They will tell everybody about your secrets.
PRO.20.20	Do not speak bad words to your parents. If you do, you will soon die. Your 
PRO.20.21	The more easily you get rich, the less good it will do to you in the end.
PRO.20.22	Do not say, ‘You have hurt me so I will hurt you.’ The 
PRO.20.23	The 
PRO.20.24	The 
PRO.20.25	Be careful before you say a promise to God. You might not be able to do what you promised.
PRO.20.26	A 
PRO.20.27	The 
PRO.20.28	A king will continue to live for as long as he rules 
PRO.20.29	Young men show how strong they are. Grey hair shows that a man is old and 
PRO.20.30	Often only pain can cause us to change what we do.
PRO.21.1	The 
PRO.21.2	Everybody thinks that he always does right things. But it is the 
PRO.21.3	Do what is right and fair. That gives pleasure to the 
PRO.21.4	Bad people think that they are better than anyone else. That is a 
PRO.21.5	A careful man thinks before he does anything. So he will have plenty. A man may not think before he does anything. That man will become poor.
PRO.21.6	You may get money because you tell 
PRO.21.8	Bad people do wrong things. Good people do what is right.
PRO.21.9	It is better to live on the roof of your house than to live with a wife that argues.
PRO.21.10	Bad people want to do bad things all the time. They are not kind to anyone.
PRO.21.11	A 
PRO.21.12	The 
PRO.21.13	Some people refuse to listen when poor people ask for help. So nobody will listen when they ask for help.
PRO.21.14	If someone is angry with you, give him a gift. This secret gift will make him quiet.
PRO.21.15	When anyone does right things, good people are happy. But bad people are often very much afraid.
PRO.21.16	A man may refuse to understand what is right. If he refuses, he will die.
PRO.21.17	The man who loves pleasure will become poor. A man who eats expensive food will never get valuable things. A man who drinks too much alcohol will never get valuable things.
PRO.21.18	Bad people cause to themselves the pain that they try to cause to good people.
PRO.21.19	It is better to live in wild places than to live with a wife who is always quarrelling.
PRO.21.21	If you are kind and 
PRO.21.22	A 
PRO.21.23	Be careful what you say. If you are careful, bad things will not happen to you.
PRO.21.24	A 
PRO.21.25	Lazy people refuse to work. They will die before they need to die.
PRO.21.26	They think only about what they would like to have. But a good man gives away his money and he does not count the cost.
PRO.21.27	The 
PRO.21.28	You cannot believe a man who tells 
PRO.21.29	Good people believe in themselves. But bad people hide what they really believe.
PRO.21.30	You cannot know anything if the 
PRO.21.31	You can make horses ready for war. But it is the 
PRO.22.1	If you have to choose a good name or lots of money, choose a good name. You should want people to think that you are great. That is better than 
PRO.22.2	Rich people and poor people meet together. The 
PRO.22.3	A 
PRO.22.4	Do not think that you are important. And be afraid of the 
PRO.22.5	Stay away from the paths of bad people. They are dark and dangerous.
PRO.22.6	Teach children how they should live. They will remember it all their lives.
PRO.22.7	People lend money. They rule over those who receive it. And rich people rule over poor people.
PRO.22.8	A bad man who causes trouble for other people will cause trouble for himself. He will no longer have the power to rule over other people.
PRO.22.9	Give some of your food to poor people. The 
PRO.22.10	Send away a man who is too 
PRO.22.11	Some men love to do what is right in front of the 
PRO.22.12	The 
PRO.22.13	A lazy man stays in his house. He says, ‘There is a 
PRO.22.14	The mouth of an 
PRO.22.15	A child loves to do silly things. You must hit him when he does wrong things. If you do, he will learn to do right things.
PRO.22.16	A man may take money from poor people because he hopes to become rich. Another man may give gifts to rich people because he hopes to become rich. But both those men will become poor.
PRO.22.17	Listen. I will teach you what 
PRO.22.18	If you remember those things, you will be happy. Try to remember them and to repeat them.
PRO.22.19	I want you to hope in the 
PRO.22.20	I have written down 30 
PRO.22.21	Someone may send you to discover what is true. If he does, you should bring back the right answer.
PRO.22.22	You are stronger than poor people. It is wrong to do cruel things to them. Sometimes, when they bring people to the rulers, those people do not have anybody to speak on their behalf.
PRO.22.23	The 
PRO.22.24	Do not be a friend to people who are very, very angry.
PRO.22.25	You might become like them and you might always be an angry person.
PRO.22.26	Do not promise to pay the money that someone else should have paid.
PRO.22.27	If you are unable to pay, they will take away even your bed.
PRO.22.28	Do not move the old stones that your fathers and their fathers put there. They show the border of your land.
PRO.22.29	The king will give work to a man who works well. But he has to do better than most men.
PRO.23.1	When you sit down to eat with a ruler be careful.
PRO.23.2	Even if you enjoy your food, do not eat too much of it.
PRO.23.3	Do not want his special food. He put it there so that you would seem like a 
PRO.23.4	Do not try to get rich and so make yourself ill.
PRO.23.5	Your money can go very quickly. It can seem to grow 
PRO.23.6	A man can be too careful about his money. His food seems good when you taste it. But do not eat it or want it.
PRO.23.7	He says, ‘Please have some more’, but he is thinking, ‘Do not have any more.’
PRO.23.8	The food will make you sick and all your nice words will mean nothing.
PRO.23.9	Do not speak 
PRO.23.10	Never move an old stone that shows the border of someone's land. Never take the land from children who have neither father nor mother.
PRO.23.11	The 
PRO.23.12	Listen to your teacher. And learn all that you can.
PRO.23.13	Your children must obey you. If you hit them with a stick, you will not kill them.
PRO.23.14	Hit them with a stick. It will save their lives.
PRO.23.15	Son, if you become 
PRO.23.16	I will be very happy when I hear you speak words of 
PRO.23.17	Do not want to be the same as very bad people. Obey the 
PRO.23.18	If you do, you will be happy in future days. And what you hope for will not come to an end.
PRO.23.19	Listen, my son, and remember to live a 
PRO.23.20	Do not be a friend of people who drink too much alcohol. Do not be a friend of people who eat too much.
PRO.23.21	They will become poor. And if you sleep too much, your clothes will soon have holes in them.
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father. You would not be alive without him. Your mother will get old. But do not think that she is not important then.
PRO.23.23	Buy 
PRO.23.24	The father of a good man will be happy. He can have pleasure in a 
PRO.23.25	Give pleasure to your father and mother. And make your mother happy.
PRO.23.26	Watch me, my son. Be happy to live as I live.
PRO.23.28	They take husbands away from their wives. They take men who are not theirs. This happens to more men all the time.
PRO.23.29+PRO.23.30	Show to me someone who drinks too much alcohol. And he likes to taste new drinks. Then I will show to you someone who is sad and sorry for himself. He always causes quarrels. He is always saying that something is wrong. His eyes are red. His body has marks where he has hurt himself.
PRO.23.31	Do not look at 
PRO.23.32	In the end, it bites like a snake with all its poison.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things. And you will not think or speak easily.
PRO.23.34	You will be like a man on a ship who is asleep in a storm.
PRO.23.35	‘They hit me’, he says, ‘but they did not hurt me. They hit me and I do not remember it. I hope that I will wake up soon. I need another drink.’
PRO.24.1	Do not want for yourself what bad people have. Do not want to be with them.
PRO.24.2	To cause trouble is all that they think about. They say that they will hurt people.
PRO.24.3	A 
PRO.24.4	When he knows what to do, he can fill his rooms with beautiful and valuable things.
PRO.24.5	A 
PRO.24.6	You must think carefully before you go to war. You can win only if you listen to the words of many 
PRO.24.7	A 
PRO.24.8	People will know the man who makes 
PRO.24.9	Any idea that a 
PRO.24.10	If you are weak in times of trouble, you are very weak.
PRO.24.11	You may see people who are leading a man to his death. Or you may see people who are going to their own death. Then you should save those people.
PRO.24.12	You may say that you knew nothing about this. But God knows your thoughts. He knows whether they are right or wrong. He always watches you. He will give gifts to you because of what you have done. He will 
PRO.24.13	Son, eat 
PRO.24.14	In the same way, 
PRO.24.15	Some bad people rob 
PRO.24.16	Trouble might happen 7 times to 
PRO.24.17	Do not be happy when trouble happens to your 
PRO.24.18	The 
PRO.24.19	Do not be afraid of bad people. Do not want to be like them.
PRO.24.20	A bad man will not have anything good in future times. He will not have anything to hope for.
PRO.24.21	Be afraid of the 
PRO.24.22	The life of a man can change in a moment. God and the king can cause problems that could destroy those men.
PRO.24.23	These are also 
PRO.24.24	A 
PRO.24.25	It will be well with 
PRO.24.26	A true friend gives an honest answer.
PRO.24.27	Finish the work outside and in your fields. After that, build your house.
PRO.24.28	Do not say wrong things about a person who lives near to you. Do not tell 
PRO.24.29	Do not say, ‘I will do to him what he did to me. I will 
PRO.24.30	I walked past the field of a lazy person. And I walked past the 
PRO.24.31	There were weeds over all the ground. And the wall of stones round them had fallen down.
PRO.24.32	I looked at this and I thought about it. Then I learned a lesson.
PRO.24.33	Perhaps you say, ‘I will sleep for a short time. I will put my hands together and I will rest.’
PRO.24.34	But while you are asleep you will become poor. You will become as poor as when a man had robbed you. You will be as if a soldier had taken away all your things.
PRO.25.1	These are more of the 
PRO.25.2	God hides things because he is great. But great kings discover things.
PRO.25.3	You never know what a king is thinking. His thoughts are beyond us like the sky that is so high above us. His thoughts are beyond us like the earth that is so deep beneath us.
PRO.25.4	Take the dirt out of the 
PRO.25.5	Keep very bad men away from the king. Then his government will be good.
PRO.25.6	Perhaps you may stand in front of the king. Do not try to cause him to think that you are great. And do not stand where the important people stand.
PRO.25.7	It will be good if the king asks you to sit on a more important seat. That would be better than if he asks you to give your seat to someone more important than you.
PRO.25.8	Do not be too quick to tell a ruler about something that you have seen. Another man may tell the ruler something different. You may be wrong. Then you will not know what you should do.
PRO.25.9	If you and another man argue, try to agree with him. Do not tell his secrets.
PRO.25.10	If you do tell his secrets, everyone will hear them. People will always think that you are a bad person.
PRO.25.11	A 
PRO.25.12	The words of a 
PRO.25.13	A good man may bring messages from his master. He helps his master who sent him. He is like cold water during the time of 
PRO.25.14	Some people promise things that they never give. They are like clouds and wind that bring no rain.
PRO.25.15	A careful man who works slowly can change the thoughts of a ruler. And a careful word can change the thoughts of an angry man.
PRO.25.16	Never eat more 
PRO.25.17	Do not visit the people who live near to you too often. They may get tired of you and you will make them angry.
PRO.25.18	Some men tell 
PRO.25.19	A man who is not 
PRO.25.20	To sing to a sad man is the same as to put salt into places on his body that hurt. Or it is like someone who takes away his coat on a cold day.
PRO.25.21	If your 
PRO.25.22	You will make him ashamed and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind brings rain. And a man who tells 
PRO.25.24	It is better to live on the roof than to live in a house with a quarrelling wife.
PRO.25.25	As cold water is to a tired person, so is good news from a far away country.
PRO.25.26	Sometimes a good person does what a very bad person wants him to do. It is like when you drink dirty water. It is like when you take water from a dirty well.
PRO.25.27	Too much 
PRO.25.28	An angry man is a weak man. He is like a city without walls that an enemy attacks.
PRO.26.1	It is not right to say good words about a 
PRO.26.2	Sometimes people may say bad words about you. They may hope that bad things will happen to you. But if you have not done anything wrong, those words will have no power over you. They are like birds that never stop flying.
PRO.26.3	You have to hit a 
PRO.26.4	You are silly if you answer a silly question. You are as silly as the person who asked the question.
PRO.26.5	If someone asks a silly question, give him a silly answer. So he will know that he is not so 
PRO.26.6	If you let a 
PRO.26.7	A 
PRO.26.8	To speak well about a 
PRO.26.9	When a 
PRO.26.10	A soldier who fights everyone is no help to his master. The man who gives work to a 
PRO.26.11	A sick dog cannot keep in its stomach what it has eaten. But then the dog eats it again. That is like a 
PRO.26.12	Some men think that they are 
PRO.26.13	A lazy man does not go out of the house. He says that there is a 
PRO.26.14	A lazy person turns over in bed. A door opens and closes. And he is like that door.
PRO.26.15	A lazy man puts his hand into his food. But then he is too tired to put the food into his own mouth.
PRO.26.16	A 
PRO.26.17	Only a 
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	A man may tell 
PRO.26.20	Without wood, a fire goes out. When nobody argues about other people, quarrels stop.
PRO.26.21	With wood, a fire continues to burn. In the same way, a man who causes trouble causes a quarrel to continue.
PRO.26.22	To say bad things about other people is like when you eat nice food.
PRO.26.23	Nice words from a bad man are like a cheap pot that shines.
PRO.26.24	A man who 
PRO.26.25	The words of a bad man may seem good. But do not believe him, because there are 7 
PRO.26.26	He may hide his 
PRO.26.27	If a man digs a very deep hole, he will fall into it. If a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him.
PRO.26.28	If you tell 
PRO.27.1	Do not say what great things you will do tomorrow. You do not know what will happen between now and then.
PRO.27.2	Let other people say how good you are. Let a stranger do it. Never do it yourself.
PRO.27.3	Stone is heavy and sand is heavy too. But the silly words of a 
PRO.27.4	An angry man is a cruel man who destroys everything. But a man is worse who will do anything to get other people's things.
PRO.27.5	A good friend will tell you when you have done something wrong. He will tell you even in front of other people. That is better than someone who loves you secretly.
PRO.27.6	Do not let the painful words of a friend frighten you. But be careful when an 
PRO.27.7	A person who is full of food will refuse 
PRO.27.8	A man may leave his home. Then he is like a bird that leaves its home.
PRO.27.10	Do not forget your friends and do not forget the friends of your father. If you are in trouble, do not ask someone from your family for help. A friend who lives near to you can help you. He can help you more than your family if they live far away.
PRO.27.11	If you are 
PRO.27.12	A careful man can see danger and he will hide himself. But the 
PRO.27.13	Take a coat from someone who promises to pay the debts of a stranger or of an 
PRO.27.14	Do not say nice things to your friends early in the morning with loud words. They will think that you are using bad words against them.
PRO.27.15	On some days, the rain continues to fall and it never stops. A wife who always quarrels is like that.
PRO.27.16	You can never keep her quiet. Anyone who can keep her quiet could stop the wind! And he could hold 
PRO.27.17	People learn from each other, as an iron tool makes iron sharp.
PRO.27.18	A careful man will eat the fruit from his own trees. And a master will give gifts to a man that is a good servant.
PRO.27.19	A man can see his face in water. In the same way, a man can understand the thoughts of another man.
PRO.27.20	The place of the dead people is never full. In the same way, the eyes of a man never get tired because they continue to look.
PRO.27.21	Fire cleans gold and heat cleans valuable metals. In the same way, if a man hears good words about himself, he will show his true nature.
PRO.27.22	Even when you hit a 
PRO.27.23	Always watch over your sheep and your cows.
PRO.27.24	A man can lose his valuable things and a country can lose its king.
PRO.27.25	You cut the yellow grass and new grass appears. Then you cut the green grass on the hills.
PRO.27.26	You make clothes from your sheep. When you sell your goats, you can use the money to buy a field.
PRO.27.27	Your other goats will give enough milk for you, for your family and for your servants.
PRO.28.1	The bad man runs when nobody is running after him. But a good person is as brave as a 
PRO.28.2	When the people in a country 
PRO.28.3	A poor man that does bad things to weak people is like a lot of rain. It is like rain that destroys the 
PRO.28.4	Men that do not obey the rules speak well about bad people. But men that obey the rules are against bad people.
PRO.28.5	Bad people do not understand what is fair. But there are people that want to know the 
PRO.28.6	It is better to be poor and 
PRO.28.7	A son that obeys the rules is 
PRO.28.8	Some men get rich when they demand too much money from people. But their valuable things will go to someone that is kind to poor people.
PRO.28.9	Someone may not obey God's rules. God will not listen to the words that he prays. God 
PRO.28.10	If you cause an 
PRO.28.11	Rich people always think that they know everything. But a poor person who understands people knows better.
PRO.28.12	When good people have power, everybody is happy. But when bad people have power, good people hide.
PRO.28.13	The man who hides his 
PRO.28.14	Always be afraid of the 
PRO.28.15	Poor people have no help against a very bad ruler. He is as dangerous as an angry 
PRO.28.16	A silly ruler will become a cruel master. An 
PRO.28.17	Someone that has done a murder will have to run. And he will have to hide. He will have to hide until the day that he dies. No man should help him.
PRO.28.18	If you are 
PRO.28.19	A farmer that works well will have plenty of food to eat. But the man that loves to dream during the day will always be poor.
PRO.28.20	The lives of 
PRO.28.22	Some people think only about themselves and they never give gifts. People like that are in a great hurry to get rich. They do not know how soon they will become poor.
PRO.28.23	A man may tell his friend that the friend has done something wrong. In the end, the friend will like that man. He will like him more than a man who says nice words to him.
PRO.28.24	Some people think that it is not wrong to rob their parents. But a person like that is as bad as a destroyer.
PRO.28.25	Some people think that they are great. They cause many quarrels. But someone who 
PRO.28.26	He that 
PRO.28.27	If you give to the poor people, you will never need anything for yourself. If you do not help the poor people, many people will say bad words about you.
PRO.28.28	People hide when bad men become rulers. But good men will get their power, and the good men will rule again.
PRO.29.1	A man should not refuse to listen when someone checks his words. If he refuses to listen again and again, something will destroy him very quickly. And nothing will be able to make it better.
PRO.29.2	If you show to me a good ruler, I will show to you happy people. If you show to me a bad ruler, I will show to you sad people.
PRO.29.3	A man that loves 
PRO.29.4	When the king makes fair rules, he will have a strong country. But when he takes money to do wrong things, he will destroy his country.
PRO.29.5	Do not tell your friends that they are really great. If you continue to tell this to them, it will cause you to have a difficult time.
PRO.29.6	A bad man cannot 
PRO.29.7	Good people want good rules for poor people. Bad people have no interest in poor people.
PRO.29.8	People that 
PRO.29.9	If a 
PRO.29.10	Men that want to kill people will 
PRO.29.11	Silly people show that they are angry. 
PRO.29.12	When a ruler listens to 
PRO.29.13	The 
PRO.29.14	If the rules of the king are fair to the poor people, he will rule for a long time.
PRO.29.15	Do not let a child do always what he wants to do. If he is wrong, hit him. Or tell him that he must not do it. You should not let a child do whatever he wants to do. If you do, he will make his mother ashamed.
PRO.29.16	When rulers are bad people, more and more people will 
PRO.29.17	Do not let your children do always what they want to do. So they will not make you ashamed of them. They will always make you happy.
PRO.29.18	Only God can be the leader of a country. Without him, people do what they want to do. Happy are those people who obey God's rules.
PRO.29.19	If you use only words you cannot cause servants to obey you. Even if they understand you, they will not obey you.
PRO.29.20	A man may speak before he thinks. Better things will happen to a 
PRO.29.21	You may give to a servant everything that he wants. You may have done this since he was a child. If you do, one day he will be like a son. He will take everything that is yours.
PRO.29.22	An angry man causes quarrels and angry men 
PRO.29.23	People will not always like a man that is 
PRO.29.24	When a man helps someone to rob other people he becomes his own enemy. The 
PRO.29.25	If you are afraid of other people you will never feel safe. But if you 
PRO.29.26	Everybody wants to speak with the ruler. But only the 
PRO.29.27	The good man does not like the bad man, and the bad man does not like the good man.
PRO.30.1	These are the 
PRO.30.2	I am sillier than any other man is. And I do not have the 
PRO.30.3	I have never known words of 
PRO.30.4	Tell me who has gone to God's home. And tell me who has come back. Tell me who has held the wind in his hands. Tell me who has covered the waters with his coat. Tell me who has 
PRO.30.5	God does everything that he promises to do. You can 
PRO.30.6	Do not mix your words with his words. If you do, he will say, ‘You are wrong.’ And he will show that you tell 
PRO.30.7	I ask you, God, to do two things for me before I die. Please do not say, ‘No’.
PRO.30.8	Keep me from 
PRO.30.9	I might have more than I need. Then I might say that I do not need you. But if I am poor, I might rob people. Then I would make you ashamed of me.
PRO.30.10	Do not say bad words to a servant about his master. If you do, the servant will 
PRO.30.11	There are people who say very bad words about their fathers. They are not kind to their mothers.
PRO.30.12	Some people think that they are always right. But they do bad things anyway.
PRO.30.13	Some people think that they are very good. Oh, how good they think that they are!
PRO.30.14	Some people seem to have teeth like knives. They rob and destroy the poor people. That is the work that they do.
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	A 
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	There are 3 things that are never happy. And there are 4 things that are never full:
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	· the world of dead people
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	· a woman without children
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	· dry ground that needs rain
PRO.30.15+PRO.30.16	· a fire that never stops.
PRO.30.17	There is a man who looks at his father. And he says bad things to him. There is a man who 
PRO.30.18+PRO.30.19	There are 3 things that are too difficult for me to understand. There are 4 things that I do not know about:
PRO.30.18+PRO.30.19	· how a large bird flies in the sky
PRO.30.18+PRO.30.19	· how a snake moves on a rock
PRO.30.18+PRO.30.19	· how a ship sails over the sea
PRO.30.18+PRO.30.19	· the way of a man with a young woman.
PRO.30.20	This is the way of an 
PRO.30.20	She eats and she washes her mouth. Then she says, ‘I have not done anything wrong.’
PRO.30.21+PRO.30.22+PRO.30.23	There are 3 wrong things on the earth and there are 4 very bad things:
PRO.30.21+PRO.30.22+PRO.30.23	· a slave who becomes a king
PRO.30.21+PRO.30.22+PRO.30.23	· a 
PRO.30.21+PRO.30.22+PRO.30.23	· a woman who has not had a husband then gets one
PRO.30.21+PRO.30.22+PRO.30.23	· a servant woman who takes the place of the woman that she works for.
PRO.30.24+PRO.30.25+PRO.30.26+PRO.30.27+PRO.30.28	There are 4 small animals in the world that are very 
PRO.30.24+PRO.30.25+PRO.30.26+PRO.30.27+PRO.30.28	· 
PRO.30.24+PRO.30.25+PRO.30.26+PRO.30.27+PRO.30.28	· There are small animals that are weak. But they make their homes among the rocks.
PRO.30.24+PRO.30.25+PRO.30.26+PRO.30.27+PRO.30.28	· 
PRO.30.24+PRO.30.25+PRO.30.26+PRO.30.27+PRO.30.28	· You can catch a 
PRO.30.29+PRO.30.30+PRO.30.31	There are 3 things that seem powerful. They seem powerful when they walk. There are 4 things that are good to see. They are good to see walking:
PRO.30.29+PRO.30.30+PRO.30.31	· 
PRO.30.29+PRO.30.30+PRO.30.31	· the 
PRO.30.29+PRO.30.30+PRO.30.31	· a male goat
PRO.30.29+PRO.30.30+PRO.30.31	· a king with his army round him.
PRO.30.32	You may think about yourself as good when you really are not so good. If you think like that, you are silly. Put your hand over your mouth. Also put your hand over your mouth if you want to do bad things.
PRO.30.33	If you mix milk for a long time you will make butter. If you hit someone's nose, it bleeds. If you make people angry, you will cause a quarrel for yourself.
PRO.31.1	These are the serious words that King Lemuel's mother taught to him. 
PRO.31.2	You are the son that I prayed for. Let me tell you this.
PRO.31.3	Do not spend all your money on women. They have destroyed kings.
PRO.31.4	Listen, Lemuel. Kings should not drink 
PRO.31.5	When kings drink alcohol, they forget the rules. And they are not fair to poor people.
PRO.31.6	Alcohol is for people who are dying. And 
PRO.31.7	They should drink alcohol. Then they will forget that they are poor. And they will no longer remember that they are sad.
PRO.31.8	Speak on behalf of people that cannot speak on behalf of themselves. Watch over poor people. And supply what they need.
PRO.31.9	Speak on behalf of them and rule with 
PRO.31.10	How difficult it is to find a wife that does all things well! She is worth much more than valuable stones.
PRO.31.11	Her husband knows that she will help him. He will never be poor.
PRO.31.12	As long as she lives, she does only good things for him.
PRO.31.13	She is always busy. She makes cloth and she enjoys her work.
PRO.31.14	A ship brings food from all parts of the world. In the same way, she brings food from far away places.
PRO.31.15	She gets up while it is still night to prepare food for her family. She tells her servant women what they should do.
PRO.31.16	She thinks about a field and she buys it with her own money. And she plants fruit bushes to make 
PRO.31.17	She is strong and she works well.
PRO.31.18	She knows the cost of everything that she makes. And she works late into the night.
PRO.31.19	She makes her own cloth from the beginning to the end.
PRO.31.20	She gives money to poor people. And she helps people that need help.
PRO.31.21	All her family have warm clothes, so snow is not a problem.
PRO.31.22	She makes beautiful cloths to cover all her beds. She wears good clothes of beautiful colours.
PRO.31.23	Everybody in the city knows her husband. He is one of the rulers of the country.
PRO.31.24	She makes clothes and she sells them. Some men buy and sell all things. She makes belts to sell to them.
PRO.31.25	She is strong and future times have no problems for her. People think that she is great.
PRO.31.26	She speaks with 
PRO.31.27	She is always busy. And every day she carefully watches everything that happens in her house.
PRO.31.28	Her children love her. They say that she is good. Her husband says that too.
PRO.31.29	He says, ‘Many women are good wives, but you are the best of them all.’
PRO.31.30	A beautiful woman may not be 
PRO.31.31	Give her the things that she herself has made. Remember her because of all that she has done. Everyone should speak well about her.
ECC.1.1	These are the Teacher's words. The Teacher was 
ECC.1.2	‘Nothing has a purpose’, he said.
ECC.1.2	‘None of the things that happen has a purpose.’
ECC.1.3	People work for their whole lives.
ECC.1.3	But they get nothing for the work that they do here on the earth.
ECC.1.4	People are born and they live on the earth. At the end of their lives, they die.
ECC.1.4	But the earth continues as it has always continued.
ECC.1.5	The sun still rises in the morning and it goes down in the evening.
ECC.1.5	And it does the same thing each day.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows to the south and it turns to the north.
ECC.1.6	It blows round and round, but it always returns.
ECC.1.7	All rivers go to the sea, but they never fill the sea.
ECC.1.7	In the end, the water returns. It returns to where it came from.
ECC.1.8	Life makes us tired. It makes us so tired that we could not tell anyone about it.
ECC.1.8	Nothing that we see can ever make us happy.
ECC.1.8	Nothing that we hear will ever cause true pleasure for us.
ECC.1.9	Future events will be the same as past events were.
ECC.1.9	What people have done, they will do again.
ECC.1.9	There is nothing that is new anywhere on the earth.
ECC.1.10	We can say, ‘Look! Here is something new.’
ECC.1.10	But it is not true! It was here already, many years ago.
ECC.1.10	It was here before we were born.
ECC.1.10	We soon forget people who have died.
ECC.1.11	We do not remember what they did many years ago.
ECC.1.11	It will be the same in future years.
ECC.1.11	People will remember things that they have seen during their lives.
ECC.1.11	But many events happened before they were born. They will not remember those events.
ECC.1.12	I said these things when I was the king of my country, Israel. I lived in the city called 
ECC.1.13	I also studied a lot and I was very 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the things that happen on the earth. There is no reason for any of them. It is like somebody who tries to catch the wind.
ECC.1.15	People may do things that are wrong.
ECC.1.15	This is like something that you have bent.
ECC.1.15	When you have bent it, you cannot make it straight again.
ECC.1.15	Neither can you count things that are not there.
ECC.1.16	‘I have become a really great man’, I told myself. ‘There have been other kings who have ruled in Jerusalem. But I am more 
ECC.1.17	I wanted to learn all that I could learn about 
ECC.1.18	If I learn to be very 
ECC.1.18	If I learn a lot about many things, that will be very painful for me. 
ECC.2.1	‘I will enjoy my life’, I thought. ‘I will make myself happy. That will be good.’ But it was not good. I enjoyed myself, but my life was not worth anything. 
ECC.2.2	It was silly to laugh all the time. I could look for things to make me happy. But they would not make my life worth anything. 
ECC.2.3	So I decided to drink 
ECC.2.4	I made some great things. I built houses for myself and I planted many 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and parks. I planted many fruit trees in the gardens and parks. 
ECC.2.6	I made large pools to give water for the trees. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male slaves and female slaves. Their sons and their daughters became my slaves too. Many people lived in Jerusalem before I did. And many of them had animals. But I had more cows and sheep than anyone else had. 
ECC.2.8	I ruled many countries. And I got 
ECC.2.9	I was the most famous person who had ever lived in Jerusalem. And I was very 
ECC.2.10	If I wanted to have something, I took it.
ECC.2.10	If I wanted to do something, I did it.
ECC.2.10	And I enjoyed my work.
ECC.2.10	I liked what I got from it.
ECC.2.11	Then I thought about the things that I had done.
ECC.2.11	I thought about all my difficult work.
ECC.2.11	But, in the end, I still saw that nothing had a purpose.
ECC.2.11	It was like somebody who tries to catch the wind.
ECC.2.11	None of the things that I had done had any value.
ECC.2.12	Then I decided to think about how a 
ECC.2.12	I wanted to think also about how a fool lives.
ECC.2.12	I said to myself, ‘The next king will not do any more than I have done.’
ECC.2.13	I know that light is better than the dark.
ECC.2.13	And I saw that it is better to be 
ECC.2.13	To be a fool is worse.
ECC.2.14	A 
ECC.2.14	A fool shuts his eyes when he walks.
ECC.2.14	But at the end of their lives, they both die.
ECC.2.15	Then I thought to myself, ‘Like the fool, I will die.
ECC.2.15	So, if I am 
ECC.2.15	I said to myself, ‘This too means nothing.’
ECC.2.16	People do not remember 
ECC.2.16	That is because people will forget everything at some future time.
ECC.2.16	Even 
ECC.2.17	So I was not happy with my life. And my work on the earth does not make me happy now. All of my work was worth nothing. It was like somebody who tries to catch the wind. 
ECC.2.18	I will die in the end. Then some other person will enjoy the things that I have made. 
ECC.2.19	That person may be a 
ECC.2.20	So I became sad about all my work on the earth. 
ECC.2.21	A man may know how to do his job well. He may do his work well and after that, he dies. Then all that he had will become another man's things. And that man will not have worked for it. This too means nothing and it is very sad. 
ECC.2.22	People have to do a lot of work on this earth. But they get nothing that they can keep. 
ECC.2.23	Every day, their work disappoints them and it makes them sad. Even at night, their minds do not rest. All their work means nothing. 
ECC.2.24	We should eat and we should drink. And we should enjoy our work. There is nothing better that we can do than those things. I believe that these are gifts from God. 
ECC.2.25	Without God's help, nobody can have enough food to eat. And nobody can be happy. 
ECC.2.26	If we obey God, he will help us. He will make us 
ECC.3.1	There is a right time for everything that we do under the sun.
ECC.3.2	There is a time to be born. And there is a time to die.
ECC.3.2	There is a time to plant seeds. Then the seeds will grow and they will become plants. And there is a time to pick the plants.
ECC.3.3	There is a time to kill. And there is a time to make people well.
ECC.3.3	There is a time to destroy something. And there is a time to build it again.
ECC.3.4	There is a time to weep. And there is a time to laugh.
ECC.3.4	There is a time to be sad. And there is a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	There is a time to throw stones away. And there is a time to pick them up.
ECC.3.5	There is a time to kiss. And there is a time to say goodbye.
ECC.3.6	There is a time to look for something. You look for something that you have lost.
ECC.3.6	And there is a time to stop looking for it.
ECC.3.6	There is a time to keep things.
ECC.3.6	And there is a time to throw them away.
ECC.3.7	There is a time to tear something down. And there is a time to mend it.
ECC.3.7	There is a time to be quiet. And there is a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	There is a time to love. And there is a time to 
ECC.3.8	There is a time to fight. And there is a time not to fight.
ECC.3.9	People get nothing for all the work that they do. 
ECC.3.10	Their work is very difficult. And God has caused it to be like that. 
ECC.3.11	But he also causes all things to happen at the right time. He puts questions in our minds. We want to know what happens after our death. We cannot understand all the things that God has done. 
ECC.3.12	We should enjoy our lives. There is nothing better that we can do than that. We should also do good things during our lives. 
ECC.3.13	We should get pleasure from what we eat. We should enjoy what we drink. And we should be happy when we are doing our work. These are all gifts from God.
ECC.3.14	Everything that God does will be for all time. We cannot do anything more than what God has done. We cannot take anything away from what he has done. God wants us to 
ECC.3.15	Future events will be the same as past events were.
ECC.3.15	God causes the same things to happen again and again. 
ECC.3.16	I saw something else about the people who live in this world.
ECC.3.16	People should say if something is wrong. But they say that it is right.
ECC.3.16	They should be fair to each other but they are not fair.
ECC.3.17	‘God will be the 
ECC.3.17	Everything will happen at the right time.
ECC.3.18	‘Perhaps God wants us to know that we are like animals’, I thought. 
ECC.3.19	Like animals, we live and then we die. We really are the same as animals. So our life means nothing for us or for them. 
ECC.3.20	People and animals go to the same place. God made animals and people from the same dry material on the ground. And when they die, they both become dry material on the ground again. 
ECC.3.21	We need to know what happens after our death. We think that the 
ECC.3.22	So we should enjoy our work. That is the best thing that we can do. That is what God wants us to do. But we do not know what there is after death. 
ECC.4.1	In every place on the earth, I saw cruel people.
ECC.4.1	Some people were crying because the cruel people were hurting them.
ECC.4.1	There was nobody to help them.
ECC.4.1	They were too weak to help themselves.
ECC.4.2	‘It is better to be dead. That is better than to be alive’, I said to myself.
ECC.4.3	‘The most happy people are those who have not been born.
ECC.4.3	They do not see the bad things that happen on the earth.’
ECC.4.4	We do not like other people to have more than we have. That is why we work for many hours each day. That is why we try to do very many things. This, too, is like somebody who tries to catch the wind.
ECC.4.5	Fools refuse to work.
ECC.4.5	They die because they have no food.
ECC.4.6	It is better to be happy with a little food.
ECC.4.6	Some people work for more food than they need. But that is not right.
ECC.4.6	It is like somebody who tries to catch the wind.
ECC.4.7	Again, on the earth I saw something else that has no purpose.
ECC.4.8	Some people live alone.
ECC.4.8	They cannot give things to friends or to children because they have no friends or children.
ECC.4.8	They are not happy with the things that they have.
ECC.4.8	But they continue to work so that they can get more.
ECC.4.8	They should ask themselves, ‘Whom are we working for?’
ECC.4.8	They should ask themselves why they do not enjoy their life more.
ECC.4.8	After their death, all that they have will not be theirs any longer. All those things will be another person's things.
ECC.4.8	Their lives will have meant nothing. This is like sad work.
ECC.4.9	It is good to have a friend.
ECC.4.9	You can enjoy the work that you and your friend do together.
ECC.4.10	If you fall, a friend can help you.
ECC.4.10	You may fall when you are alone.
ECC.4.10	If you do that, you really are in trouble.
ECC.4.11	If two people sleep together, they keep each other warm.
ECC.4.11	If you sleep alone, you will be cold in the night.
ECC.4.12	A strong person might hurt you.
ECC.4.12	But if you have a friend, your friend can help you. And you can fight so that the strong person will not hurt you.
ECC.4.12	Somebody has said, ‘A 
ECC.4.13	You may be poor and you may be young. But anyway it is a good thing to be 
ECC.4.14	You may have been in a prison and you may be very poor. Your father may not be a king, but you could become a king. 
ECC.4.15	I once knew a young person. That young person became a powerful king after another king had died. 
ECC.4.16	Many people thought that he was a good king. Nobody could even count the people who thought that. But in future years, nobody will remember him. This, too, is like somebody who tries to catch the wind. 
ECC.5.1	Be careful about anything that you do in the 
ECC.5.2	You should think before you speak.
ECC.5.2	You should think before you promise something to God.
ECC.5.2	God is in 
ECC.5.2	You are here on the earth.
ECC.5.2	And you do not see as much as God sees.
ECC.5.2	Do not say to God more than you have to say.
ECC.5.3	If you think about your troubles too much, you will dream about bad things.
ECC.5.3	If you talk too much, you will say silly things.
ECC.5.4	You should do what you have promised to God. You should do it when you can. You should not wait before you do it. Only a fool would not do what he had promised to God. 
ECC.5.5	Do not promise to do something that you might not do. It would be better not to promise anything. 
ECC.5.6	Only say things that are true. You should not say to the 
ECC.5.7	It is silly to dream all the time. Remember that. It is also silly to talk all the time. But you should obey God because he is a great God.
ECC.5.8	The poor people who live in your country may be hungry. But the government does not help them, and the government is not fair to them. Do not be surprised about that. The government's officers do not decide what to do. Other more important people tell them what they must do. The king is the most important person in the country. 
ECC.5.9	When people pay money to the government, the king receives a lot of it.
ECC.5.10	You may love money.
ECC.5.10	But you will never have enough money.
ECC.5.10	You may like to have valuable things.
ECC.5.10	But you will always want to have more of them. This is silly.
ECC.5.11	If you have a lot of money, other people will want some of it.
ECC.5.11	You will not enjoy the money that you have.
ECC.5.11	Other people will spend it for you.
ECC.5.12	A man who has worked all day will sleep well at night.
ECC.5.12	This is true even if he did not eat very much food.
ECC.5.12	But the rich man cannot sleep well because he has eaten too much.
ECC.5.13	I have seen something else that is not fair on the earth.
ECC.5.13	People may get a lot of money.
ECC.5.13	But, if they try to keep it,
ECC.5.13	it will be bad for them.
ECC.5.14	At a future time, they may discover that they have lost all their money.
ECC.5.14	Then, after they die, there will be no money for their children.
ECC.5.15	They were born with nothing.
ECC.5.15	When they die, they will have nothing.
ECC.5.15	They cannot take anything with them when they leave this earth.
ECC.5.15	They will have nothing for all their work.
ECC.5.16	That is not fair.
ECC.5.16	People leave this earth, as they came into it, with nothing.
ECC.5.16	They live as if they were trying to catch the wind.
ECC.5.16	But after all their work, they have nothing.
ECC.5.17	During their lives, they are always sad, angry and sick.
ECC.5.18	God has given to us a short life on this earth. I think that we should enjoy our lives. We should eat and drink. And we should do our work well. That is what God wants us to do. 
ECC.5.19	If you are rich, you will have many things. You should enjoy those things. You should enjoy your work, too. This is a gift from God to you. 
ECC.5.20	God will keep you busy and he will make you happy. You will be too busy to think about your troubles each day. 
ECC.6.1	On this earth, there is something else that is not fair. 
ECC.6.2	God may give to you all the things that you want. He may give riches to you. And he may give to you money to spend. He may give to you a house to live in. But he may not let you enjoy those things. Somebody that you do not even know may get them all. That is not fair and it will confuse you a lot. 
ECC.6.3	You may live for a long time and you may have many children. But you may not enjoy your life. When you die, people may not bury you properly. A child that is dead at its birth does not have a good life. But your life is worse than that. 
ECC.6.4	A child like that will never live to see the sun. 
ECC.6.5	It will not even have a name. It will leave this earth and it will go to a dark place. But that child will have more 
ECC.6.6	You may live for a very long time, but you may not enjoy your life. We all go to the same place after we die. This is what will happen. Remember that.
ECC.6.7	We work so that we will have food.
ECC.6.7	But we never have enough food.
ECC.6.8	Our lives have not been more happy because we have been 
ECC.6.8	A fool would be as happy as we have been.
ECC.6.8	We may try to live in the right way.
ECC.6.8	But that does not make us happier if we are still poor.
ECC.6.9	It is not good always to want more things.
ECC.6.9	We should enjoy the things that we have. That is better.
ECC.6.9	Somebody who wants more things all the time is silly.
ECC.6.9	He is like somebody who tries to catch the wind.
ECC.6.10	God decided a long time ago what we should be like.
ECC.6.10	We cannot argue with God about that. He is very much stronger than we are.
ECC.6.11	If we talk too much, we will say silly things.
ECC.6.11	It is better not to talk a lot.
ECC.6.12	We live for only a few years and our lives mean nothing. Our lives are like shadows that pass over the earth. We do not know the best way to live. We do not know what will happen after our death. 
ECC.7.1	You may be a nice person.
ECC.7.1	So it is good if people know that.
ECC.7.1	There was a day when you were born. But the day when you die will be better.
ECC.7.2	You may enjoy a party.
ECC.7.2	But it is better for you if you go to a 
ECC.7.2	There, you will think about the day when you will die.
ECC.7.2	We will all die in the end. It is good to remember that.
ECC.7.3	It is better to be sad than it is to be happy.
ECC.7.3	We learn more about ourselves when we are sad.
ECC.7.4	A 
ECC.7.4	A fool thinks about how to enjoy his life.
ECC.7.5	You can listen to a fool who is singing songs.
ECC.7.5	But it is better to listen to a 
ECC.7.5	He can tell you if you do a wrong thing.
ECC.7.6	Some sharp, hard plants make a lot of noise when they burn. But they do not make much heat.
ECC.7.6	Fools make a lot of noise when they laugh. But they never do anything good.
ECC.7.7	It is wrong to receive a 
ECC.7.8	It is good when you start to do some new work.
ECC.7.8	But it is better to finish that work.
ECC.7.8	Do your work well even if you have to do it slowly.
ECC.7.8	Some people may be 
ECC.7.9	Do not get angry quickly. That is what fools do.
ECC.7.9	Try to forget the bad things that people may have done to you.
ECC.7.10	You may think that your life is difficult.
ECC.7.10	You may think that it was easier before now.
ECC.7.10	It is not wise to think like that.
ECC.7.10	So do not think like that.
ECC.7.11	It is as good to be 
ECC.7.12	Money can keep you safe. And 
ECC.7.12	But if you are 
ECC.7.13	Think about the things that God has done.
ECC.7.13	If God has bent something, you cannot make it straight.
ECC.7.14	If your life is good, you should be happy.
ECC.7.14	But bad things may happen to you.
ECC.7.14	God causes good things to happen and he also causes bad things to happen. Remember that.
ECC.7.14	You do not know what will happen next.
ECC.7.15	I do not know why I am alive.
ECC.7.15	But I have seen two things during my life.
ECC.7.15	I have seen that good people have died. They died when they were young.
ECC.7.15	They always did the right thing but they died like everyone else.
ECC.7.15	I have seen that some bad people live for many years.
ECC.7.16	Be careful that you do not kill yourself.
ECC.7.16	That might happen if you try to be too good or too 
ECC.7.17	Be careful that you do not die too soon.
ECC.7.17	That might happen if you are a fool or a bad person.
ECC.7.18	Try to live your life in a way that is in the middle.
ECC.7.18	You can do that if you try to love God. And you can do it if you try to obey him.
ECC.7.19	A 
ECC.7.20	But even good men do not always do what is right.
ECC.7.20	Sometimes they make mistakes.
ECC.7.21	Do not listen to all the things that people say about you.
ECC.7.21	Even your servant may say bad things about you.
ECC.7.22	Do not forget that you, too, have said bad things.
ECC.7.23	I wanted to be 
ECC.7.23	Many things have happened to me during my life.
ECC.7.23	And I wanted to discover the reason for them.
ECC.7.24	But I could not discover a good reason.
ECC.7.24	It was too difficult for me.
ECC.7.25	So I decided to learn many things.
ECC.7.25	I wanted to become 
ECC.7.25	And I wanted to get answers to all my questions.
ECC.7.25	I believed that it was silly to be a fool.
ECC.7.25	I wanted to discover if this was true.
ECC.7.26	I learned that it is dangerous to meet a bad woman.
ECC.7.26	She is a worse thing than death itself.
ECC.7.26	She says that she loves you.
ECC.7.26	But if you listen to her, you will do wrong things.
ECC.7.26	Do what God wants people to do. If you do that, a woman like that will not catch you.
ECC.7.26	But that bad woman will catch the man who does not obey God's rules.
ECC.7.27	I used all my 
ECC.7.28	But I have failed.
ECC.7.28	I do know that there is one good man in every thousand men.
ECC.7.28	But I have not found a good woman.
ECC.7.29	I did learn one thing.
ECC.7.29	God made us to be good people.
ECC.7.29	But we have become bad people.
ECC.8.1	A person's 
ECC.8.1	It will do that, even when things have made him sad.
ECC.8.1	But only a few people are 
ECC.8.1	And only a few people really understand things. 
ECC.8.2	Perhaps you promised to God that you would obey the king. You should do what you promised to do. 
ECC.8.3	If you are with the king, do not leave too quickly. The king can do anything that he wants to do. So do not join a group of people who do not want to obey him. 
ECC.8.4	Do not argue with the king because he is very powerful. Nobody can tell him that he must not do something.
ECC.8.5	Everyone who obeys the king will be safe.
ECC.8.5	And a 
ECC.8.5	And he knows when he should do it
ECC.8.5	And he knows how to do it.
ECC.8.6	You may have a difficult life.
ECC.8.6	But there is a right time for things to happen.
ECC.8.6	There is a right way to do things.
ECC.8.7	Nobody can tell what will happen in future days or years.
ECC.8.8	We do not know the day when we will die.
ECC.8.8	And we can do nothing to change that day.
ECC.8.8	We may fight against death, but we cannot win that fight.
ECC.8.8	Not even a bad person can do that.
ECC.8.9	I saw all these things and I thought about them a lot. I thought about the things that happen on the earth. I saw people who had power. They used that power to hurt people. 
ECC.8.10	I saw people bury the dead bodies of bad men. Those bad men had gone in and out of the holy place. The people in their city forgot all the bad things that those men had done. There is no good reason for any of this.
ECC.8.11	When bad people do wrong things, the 
ECC.8.12	A man may do many bad things and that bad man may live to a very old age. But I believe that God is fair. If you obey God, you will have a good life. 
ECC.8.13	If you do not obey God, you will not have a long life. Your life will be short, like a shadow. 
ECC.8.14	Here is something else that is not right. The 
ECC.8.15	So we should enjoy our lives as much as possible. The best thing that we can do is to enjoy everything. We should enjoy what we eat. And we should enjoy what we drink. We should all try to be happy. There are no other good things on this earth. God has given us each day in our life. We will have easier lives if we enjoy ourselves.
ECC.8.16	I have tried to understand the things that happen on this earth. I thought about those things all day and all night. I did not go to sleep. 
ECC.8.17	Then I saw all the things that God has done. Nobody can really understand the things that happen on the earth. That is what I discovered. We may be very 
ECC.9.1	I thought about all these things. I saw that God is very powerful. He decides what our lives will be like. That is true even if we are 
ECC.9.2	But what happens to us in the end will be the same. We may give 
ECC.9.2	We may be good or we may be bad.
ECC.9.2	When we have promised something to God, we may do that thing. Or we may not do it.
ECC.9.2	What happens to us in the end will be the same, anyway.
ECC.9.3	After our death, the same thing will happen to us. There will be no difference in that. That is not fair. So people decide to live like fools. They do not try to be good. And then they die. 
ECC.9.4	It is not very good to be a dead 
ECC.9.5	We know that we will all die in the end.
ECC.9.5	But dead people do not know anything.
ECC.9.5	And when they are dead, they cannot enjoy their life.
ECC.9.6	Dead people have gone from the earth and people do not remember them.
ECC.9.6	Nobody that is dead can love another person.
ECC.9.6	Nobody that is dead can 
ECC.9.6	Dead people cannot change the things that happen on the earth.
ECC.9.7	It is good to be happy. It is good to enjoy what you eat. And it is good to enjoy what you drink. God has pleasure in what you do. 
ECC.9.8	You should put on your best clothes and you should comb your hair well. 
ECC.9.9	Your life will be short and it will be difficult. But you love your wife, so enjoy your life together. That is the way to live on the earth. 
ECC.9.10	And do your work well. You will soon leave the earth. Then it will not be possible for you to work. You will not think about future events. You will not know anything.
ECC.9.11	I saw another thing that happens on the earth.
ECC.9.11	The runner who can run most quickly does not always finish first.
ECC.9.11	The strongest soldier may not win the war.
ECC.9.11	People will not always feed you because you are 
ECC.9.11	If you are clever, good things will not always happen to you.
ECC.9.11	You may not become rich even if you do your work well.
ECC.9.11	Good things and bad things happen to us all.
ECC.9.12	Bad things can happen to all of us.
ECC.9.12	A fish does not know when somebody will catch it.
ECC.9.12	A bird does not know when somebody will catch it.
ECC.9.12	That is like us. We do not know when something bad will happen. 
ECC.9.13	I saw another example of 
ECC.9.14	There was a city that only a few people lived in. A foreign king attacked that city. His army was ready to knock down the walls round the city. 
ECC.9.15	But a poor man, who was very 
ECC.9.16	So, it may be good to be strong. But it is better to be 
ECC.9.17	A 
ECC.9.17	When he speaks quietly, it is good to listen to him.
ECC.9.17	The loud words of a king that is a fool do not mean a lot. The quiet words of a 
ECC.9.18	A 
ECC.9.18	You may be 
ECC.10.1	A jar of 
ECC.10.1	So one silly thing can destroy the good things that a 
ECC.10.2	If you are 
ECC.10.2	If you think like a fool, you will do wrong things.
ECC.10.3	We know that fools are silly.
ECC.10.3	It is easy to recognise a fool.
ECC.10.3	You have only to watch what he does.
ECC.10.3	Then you will see that he is a fool.
ECC.10.4	Do not leave your job when your master gets angry.
ECC.10.4	Be quiet and say nothing to him.
ECC.10.4	Your master will forget that you have made him angry.
ECC.10.4	He will still let you work for him.
ECC.10.5	I have seen something on the earth that is very bad.
ECC.10.5	I saw a ruler who did the wrong thing.
ECC.10.6	Rulers give power to fools. But they do not give it to rich people.
ECC.10.7	Rulers let slaves ride on horses.
ECC.10.7	But the masters of those slaves have to walk.
ECC.10.8	If you dig a deep hole, you will fall into it.
ECC.10.8	If you knock down a wall, a snake will come out. And it will bite you.
ECC.10.9	You will hurt yourself when you are getting stones from under the ground.
ECC.10.9	If you are cutting wood, a piece of it might hurt you.
ECC.10.10	If your axe is not sharp, it will be difficult to use.
ECC.10.10	If you are 
ECC.10.11	You may know how to cause a snake to do what you want it to do.
ECC.10.11	But that will not help you if the snake bites you first.
ECC.10.12	People like a 
ECC.10.12	But a fool's own words can hurt the fool badly.
ECC.10.13	Fools do not think before they speak.
ECC.10.13	They say things and then those things cause problems for them. And those things cause problems for other people, too.
ECC.10.14	And fools always talk a lot.
ECC.10.14	They talk about things that may happen.
ECC.10.14	But none of us really knows what future things will be like.
ECC.10.15	When a fool does some work, it soon makes him tired.
ECC.10.15	He is so tired that he forgets the way to town.
ECC.10.16	Sometimes a country will have a very young king.
ECC.10.16	If he rules like a child, there will be bad problems in that country.
ECC.10.16	And the leaders of the country might go to parties all the time. And then the problems will be worse.
ECC.10.17	But a country will become rich if its ruler is 
ECC.10.17	It will become rich if its leaders do not go to parties all the time.
ECC.10.18	A man may be too lazy to do repairs to the roof on his house.
ECC.10.18	If he does not do the repairs, water will get into the house. And the house will fall down.
ECC.10.19	Eat good food and drink good 
ECC.10.19	When you have a lot of money, you can buy anything. You can buy anything that you want.
ECC.10.20	Do not say bad things about the king.
ECC.10.20	Do not say bad things about rich people.
ECC.10.20	Do not even think that you might do that.
ECC.10.20	A little bird may hear you. And it might tell people what you said. 
ECC.11.1	Give money to anybody who needs it.
ECC.11.1	At some future time, you may be poor and other people will then give money to you.
ECC.11.2	You do not know when you will need help.
ECC.11.2	So, if seven or eight people need money, give it to them.
ECC.11.3	When clouds are full of water, there will be rain on the earth.
ECC.11.3	If there is too much wind, a tree will fall. Wherever the tree falls, there it will lie.
ECC.11.4	If you are always thinking about the wind, you will not plant seeds.
ECC.11.4	If you are always watching the clouds, you will never pick any plants.
ECC.11.5	Before a baby is born, it grows inside its mother.
ECC.11.5	Nobody can explain how that happens.
ECC.11.5	Nobody can explain the things that God does.
ECC.11.5	So do not be surprised about that.
ECC.11.5	Remember that God made the world.
ECC.11.5	And he made everything that is in the world.
ECC.11.6	Plant your seeds early in the morning.
ECC.11.6	You should plant seeds all day, until the evening.
ECC.11.6	Some of the seeds may grow.
ECC.11.6	Perhaps all the seeds will grow.
ECC.11.7	Light is good.
ECC.11.7	So people are happy when they see the sun.
ECC.11.8	You should enjoy the things that you do each day.
ECC.11.8	You should do that even if you live to a very old age.
ECC.11.8	You may live for many years but, in the end, you will die.
ECC.11.8	And you will be dead for a very long time.
ECC.11.8	There is nothing that means anything after that.
ECC.11.9	Enjoy your life while you are young.
ECC.11.9	Do the things that you want to do.
ECC.11.9	The things that you see will give you pleasure, too.
ECC.11.9	But God watches the things that you do. You should remember that.
ECC.11.9	He will want to know why you did those things.
ECC.11.10	Do not think about the good things that you do not have.
ECC.11.10	And do not do things that cause pain in your body.
ECC.11.10	You cannot always be young.
ECC.11.10	We all become old. 
ECC.12.1	While you are young, you should 
ECC.12.1	In future years, you will say, ‘I do not enjoy my life longer.’
ECC.12.2	In the end, you will not see the light that comes from the sun.
ECC.12.2	And will you not see the moon or the stars.
ECC.12.2	There will always be black clouds in the sky.
ECC.12.3	Your arms will move from one side to the other side when you do not want them to move.
ECC.12.3	Your legs will become weak.
ECC.12.3	You will have only a few teeth.
ECC.12.3	Your eyes will not see well.
ECC.12.4	Your ears will not hear well.
ECC.12.4	You will not hear the noise of people at their work.
ECC.12.4	At night, you will not sleep well.
ECC.12.4	But you will hear the birds when they sing. Then you will wake up because of that.
ECC.12.5	You will be afraid to climb up a hill.
ECC.12.5	You will be afraid to walk along a road.
ECC.12.5	Your hair will become white.
ECC.12.5	It will be like white flowers on a bush.
ECC.12.5	You will feel very tired all the time.
ECC.12.5	And you will not want to have sex any longer.
ECC.12.5	We will all die in the end.
ECC.12.5	When we die, people will be sad.
ECC.12.5	Many of them will be on the streets.
ECC.12.5	And they will cry because we have died.
ECC.12.6	In the end, the valuable jar will break.
ECC.12.6	The water pot will break. The 
ECC.12.6	You will not get water from the well any longer.
ECC.12.7	So, in the end, we will all die.
ECC.12.7	People will bury our dead bodies under the ground.
ECC.12.7	Our 
ECC.12.8	Nothing on the earth has a purpose.
ECC.12.8	I have seen all the things that happen on the earth.
ECC.12.8	None of them has a purpose.
ECC.12.9	I was a 
ECC.12.10	I saw all the things that happen on the earth. I tried to explain them. My words are all true. 
ECC.12.11	A farmer uses a stick when he wants his animals to move. 
ECC.12.12	You are my son. So listen to what I say. Do not listen when people teach you other things. There are many books. If you study them all, you will be very tired.
ECC.12.13	With a few words, I can describe everything that you must know. You should 
ECC.12.14	We may do good things. Sometimes we do wrong things. We think that nobody sees us. But God sees the things that we do. And he will ask us to explain the answer to this question: ‘What have we done with our lives here on the earth?’ 
SNG.1.1	Solomon's Song of Songs. 
SNG.1.2	I really want him to kiss me with his lips.
SNG.1.2	Your love makes me happier than 
SNG.1.3	You have put something on your body.
SNG.1.3	Certainly, it has a lovely smell.
SNG.1.3	The sound of your name causes me pleasure like that too.
SNG.1.3	I am not surprised that the young women love you!
SNG.1.4	Take me away with you. Come quickly.
SNG.1.4	I want the king to take me into his rooms. 
SNG.1.4	We are very happy!
SNG.1.4	You make us happy.
SNG.1.4	Your love is better than 
SNG.1.4	I agree! They are right to think about you like that. And they are right to love you like that.
SNG.1.5	It is dark like the 
SNG.1.5	It is dark but lovely like the curtains in Solomon's 
SNG.1.6	Do not continue to look at me because my skin is dark.
SNG.1.6	The sun has made my skin like this.
SNG.1.6	My mother's sons were angry with me.
SNG.1.6	They caused me to work in the 
SNG.1.6	So I could not watch over my own 
SNG.1.7	I love you.
SNG.1.7	Tell me where your sheep eat the grass.
SNG.1.7	Where do you lead your sheep so that they can rest at midday?
SNG.1.7	When I am near your friends with their animals,
SNG.1.7	I do not want to wear a 
SNG.1.8	You are the most beautiful woman of all.
SNG.1.8	If you do not know where to find me,
SNG.1.8	follow the marks from the feet of the sheep.
SNG.1.8	Let your young goats eat grass by the 
SNG.1.9	You are my best friend. I love you more than anyone else.
SNG.1.9	You seem to me like a female horse that pulls one of 
SNG.1.10	Your face is beautiful with ear-rings.
SNG.1.10	Round your neck are valuable stones, which make it very pretty.
SNG.1.11	We will make ear-rings for you. We will make them out of gold with pieces of 
SNG.1.12	The king was lying down and he was eating.
SNG.1.12	I had put something on my skin that has a lovely smell.
SNG.1.12	This smell moved into the air.
SNG.1.13	To me, the man that I love is like a little bag of 
SNG.1.13	He is like the little bag of 
SNG.1.14	To me he is like a group of 
SNG.1.14	He is like flowers that grow in the 
SNG.1.15	How beautiful you are!
SNG.1.15	My best friend, you are very beautiful! Your eyes are like 
SNG.1.16	You are very handsome and you love me.
SNG.1.16	You are very lovely!
SNG.1.16	This green field of fresh, long grass is our bed.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are the 
SNG.1.17	The trees, with green leaves all of the time, are above us like a roof.
SNG.2.1	I am a wild flower of Sharon.
SNG.2.1	I am a 
SNG.2.2	Among other young women, my best friend that I love is like a 
SNG.2.3	Among the other young men, the man who loves me is like an apple tree.
SNG.2.3	He is like an apple tree among the trees of the forest.
SNG.2.3	I love to sit in his shade.
SNG.2.3	His fruit is sweet.
SNG.2.3	It tastes nice.
SNG.2.4	He has taken me to the 
SNG.2.4	Everyone can see that he loves me.
SNG.2.5	I am weak with love.
SNG.2.5	So, give 
SNG.2.5	Give apples to me to keep me awake.
SNG.2.6	His left arm is under my head.
SNG.2.6	His right arm draws me near to him.
SNG.2.7	please do not cause someone to feel love for another person;
SNG.2.7	not until he or she wants to.
SNG.2.7	I am saying this because I really mean it.
SNG.2.7	I 
SNG.2.8	Listen! I hear the man who loves me!
SNG.2.8	Look! He is coming!
SNG.2.8	He moves quickly across the mountains.
SNG.2.8	He runs and he jumps. He comes over the hills.
SNG.2.9	The man who loves me is like a 
SNG.2.9	Look! There he is! He is standing behind our wall.
SNG.2.9	He is looking through the windows.
SNG.2.9	He is trying to see through the 
SNG.2.10	The man who loves me spoke. He said to me,
SNG.2.10	‘My beautiful best friend, I love you.
SNG.2.10	Please get up and come with me.
SNG.2.11	See! The winter is past. The rains have finished.
SNG.2.12	Flowers are appearing in country places.
SNG.2.12	It is now the season to sing.
SNG.2.12	Near here, we can hear the lovely sound that the 
SNG.2.13	The new fruit on the 
SNG.2.13	The smell from the flowers on the 
SNG.2.13	My beautiful best friend, I love you.
SNG.2.13	Please get up and come with me.’
SNG.2.14	You are like a 
SNG.2.14	You are like a 
SNG.2.14	Show your face to me because it is lovely.
SNG.2.14	Let me hear your voice because it has a beautiful sound.
SNG.2.15	Catch the 
SNG.2.15	Catch the little 
SNG.2.15	They destroy our 
SNG.2.16	The man who loves me is mine.
SNG.2.16	And I am his.
SNG.2.16	He eats slowly among the 
SNG.2.17	My best friend that I love,
SNG.2.17	turn round until the dawn.
SNG.2.17	Until the shadows have gone, be like a 
SNG.2.17	Or be like a young male 
SNG.3.1	All night I lay in bed.
SNG.3.1	I looked for the man that I love.
SNG.3.1	I looked for him but he did not appear.
SNG.3.2	I thought, ‘I will get up now and I will go into the city.
SNG.3.2	I will look everywhere for the man that I really love.
SNG.3.2	I will go through all the streets.
SNG.3.2	I will look in all the market places.’
SNG.3.2	So I looked for him.
SNG.3.2	But I did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The 
SNG.3.3	They walked through the streets of the city.
SNG.3.3	They found me.
SNG.3.3	I said, ‘Have you seen the man that I love very much?’
SNG.3.4	I passed them.
SNG.3.4	Just then, I found the man that I love!
SNG.3.4	I hugged him. I would not let him go.
SNG.3.4	I held him until I had brought him to my mother's house.
SNG.3.4	I brought him to my mother's room.
SNG.3.4	(There my life started, in my mother's body.)
SNG.3.5	please do not cause someone to feel love for another person;
SNG.3.5	not until he or she wants to.
SNG.3.5	I am saying this because I really mean it.
SNG.3.5	I 
SNG.3.6	Who is this who is appearing from the empty land?
SNG.3.6	What is this smoke that is rising?
SNG.3.6	There is a lovely smell of 
SNG.3.6	The smell of the 
SNG.3.7	Look! It is King Solomon's 
SNG.3.7	The soldiers are very brave. They are the best in Israel.
SNG.3.8	All of them wear a 
SNG.3.8	They have all fought in many wars.
SNG.3.8	They are ready for the dangers of the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made the 
SNG.3.9	He made it out of wood from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made the 
SNG.3.10	He used gold for the part where the passenger's feet rest.
SNG.3.10	The 
SNG.3.10	They were careful to make it beautiful inside.
SNG.3.11	Look at King Solomon who is wearing his 
SNG.3.11	His mother put the 
SNG.3.11	She put it on him on his marriage day.
SNG.3.11	It was the day that he was very happy. 
SNG.4.1	How beautiful you are!
SNG.4.1	My best friend that I love, you are certainly very beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your 
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a group of goats.
SNG.4.1	It is like goats that are coming down 
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are white like a group of sheep.
SNG.4.2	They are like sheep after someone has cut off their dirty 
SNG.4.2	They are like sheep that are coming out of the pool of water.
SNG.4.2	Each tooth is one of a pair. Not one of them is alone.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are bright red.
SNG.4.3	They are bright red like a 
SNG.4.3	Your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	The sides of your face are round like the halves of a 
SNG.4.3	Your 
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the beautiful, important 
SNG.4.4	The 
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like two young 
SNG.4.5	They walk slowly among the 
SNG.4.6	Until the dawn, I will go to the mountain of 
SNG.4.6	Until the shadows go, I will go to the hill with the lovely smell.
SNG.4.7	You are my best friend and I love you.
SNG.4.7	I find that every part of you is beautiful.
SNG.4.7	There is no part of you that is not lovely.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	You are my new wife.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Come down from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir.
SNG.4.8	Come down from the highest part of Hermon.
SNG.4.8	Come away from the 
SNG.4.8	and from the places in the mountains where there are 
SNG.4.9	I love you so much that I never want to leave you.
SNG.4.9	You are my sister and my new wife.
SNG.4.9	After one glance of your eyes, I knew that I wanted you more than anyone else.
SNG.4.9	I see one of the valuable stones that hang round your neck.
SNG.4.9	And then I know that you are the most valuable person to me. 
SNG.4.10	Your love to me is certainly very good, my sister, my new wife.
SNG.4.10	It gives to me more pleasure than when I drink 
SNG.4.10	You have a smell that is lovelier than any 
SNG.4.11	Your lips taste sweet, my new wife.
SNG.4.11	They taste like 
SNG.4.11	Milk and 
SNG.4.11	The smell of your clothes is like the smell of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	You are like a garden that you have locked up, my sister, and my new wife.
SNG.4.12	You are like a 
SNG.4.12	You are like a 
SNG.4.12	Water cannot rise from it.
SNG.4.13	Your garden is full of 
SNG.4.13	There are fruits that many people like.
SNG.4.13	There are 
SNG.4.14	There are 
SNG.4.14	There are many different plants that have lovely smells.
SNG.4.14	There are 
SNG.4.14	All the best 
SNG.4.15	You are like a 
SNG.4.15	You are like a well that is full of water.
SNG.4.15	The water now comes quickly down from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind! Come, south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden so that its lovely smell will move all over the place.
SNG.4.16	I really want the man that I love to come into his garden.
SNG.4.16	Let him taste the best fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have come into my garden, my sister and my new wife.
SNG.5.1	I have taken my 
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my 
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my 
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends, and drink. You love each other!
SNG.5.1	Drink until you no longer need a drink. 
SNG.5.2	I slept but my 
SNG.5.2	Listen! The man who loves me is knocking.
SNG.5.2	‘Open the door for me, my sister’, he said.
SNG.5.2	‘You are my best friend that I love the most.
SNG.5.2	To me you are like a 
SNG.5.2	Nobody is lovelier than you.
SNG.5.2	Water from the night air covers my head.
SNG.5.2	My hair is very wet.’
SNG.5.3	I said, ‘I have taken off my day clothes.
SNG.5.3	I do not want to put them on again.
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet.
SNG.5.3	I do not want them to get dirty again.’
SNG.5.4	The man who loves me pushed his hand through the hole in the door.
SNG.5.4	My heart began to go quicker for him.
SNG.5.4	I could feel it and I could almost hear it.
SNG.5.5	I stood up to open the door for the man who loves me.
SNG.5.5	My hands were wet with 
SNG.5.6	I opened the door for the man who loves me. But he had left.
SNG.5.6	He was gone.
SNG.5.6	I felt full of love for him when he spoke.
SNG.5.6	I looked for him but I did not find him.
SNG.5.6	I spoke his name loudly but he did not answer.
SNG.5.7	The 
SNG.5.7	They found me while they were walking through the streets of the city.
SNG.5.7	They hit me and they hurt me.
SNG.5.7	And the marks on my body show this.
SNG.5.7	Those 
SNG.5.8	Please find the man who loves me, 
SNG.5.8	If you find him, please speak to him about me.
SNG.5.8	Please tell him that I am weak with love.
SNG.5.9	You are the most beautiful among women.
SNG.5.9	How is the man that you love better than other men?
SNG.5.9	How is he better than other men, that you ask us to say this?
SNG.5.10	His face and his body shine because of the sun.
SNG.5.10	He is the greatest among 10,000 men.
SNG.5.11	His head is valuable like 
SNG.5.11	The hairs on his head are black, but they are not straight.
SNG.5.11	They are black like the night with no moon.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like 
SNG.5.12	They are like 
SNG.5.12	They sometimes shine like valuable stones.
SNG.5.13	The sides of his face are like 
SNG.5.13	His lips are like 
SNG.5.14	His arms are like long round pieces of gold
SNG.5.14	and some valuable stones are over them.
SNG.5.14	His body is like 
SNG.5.14	A few valuable, blue stones make it even more beautiful.
SNG.5.15	His legs are straight and strong like round pieces of beautiful stone.
SNG.5.15	His feet are of 
SNG.5.15	He is tall like Lebanon, quite as handsome as its best 
SNG.5.16	His mouth is very nice in every way.
SNG.5.16	Everything about him is lovely.
SNG.5.16	This is the man who loves me.
SNG.5.16	This is my friend, 
SNG.6.1	You are the most beautiful among women.
SNG.6.1	Where has the man who loves you gone?
SNG.6.1	Which way did he turn so that we can look for him with you?
SNG.6.2	The man who loves me has gone down to his garden.
SNG.6.2	He has gone to where the plants with a lovely smell grow.
SNG.6.2	He has gone there to walk in the gardens and to pick 
SNG.6.3	This man loves me and I am his. And he is mine.
SNG.6.3	He is walking among the 
SNG.6.4	You are my best friend that I love the most.
SNG.6.4	You are as beautiful as Tirzah.
SNG.6.4	You are as lovely as Jerusalem.
SNG.6.4	Everyone sees you easily.
SNG.6.4	You are like an army that is holding up its beautiful cloth with bright colours. 
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me.
SNG.6.5	They cause a lot of pleasure for me.
SNG.6.5	But the pleasure is too strong for me!
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a group of goats.
SNG.6.5	It is like goats that are coming down from 
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are white like a group of sheep.
SNG.6.6	They are like clean sheep that come out of the pool.
SNG.6.6	Each tooth is one of a pair. Not one of them is alone.
SNG.6.7	The sides of your face are round like the halves of a 
SNG.6.7	Your 
SNG.6.8	There may be 60 queens.
SNG.6.8	And a king may have 80 other wives.
SNG.6.8	He may have many young women who do not yet have children.
SNG.6.8	There may be too many for him to count!
SNG.6.9	But there is only one woman that I want.
SNG.6.9	Nobody is like her in any way.
SNG.6.9	She is lovely like a 
SNG.6.9	She is mine.
SNG.6.9	Nobody else is lovelier.
SNG.6.9	She is the special daughter of her mother.
SNG.6.9	The woman who gave birth to her likes her best among all her children.
SNG.6.9	The young women saw that she was now happier.
SNG.6.9	The queens and the other wives said ‘Well done!’
SNG.6.9	They all said.
SNG.6.10	‘She appears like the dawn.
SNG.6.10	She is lovelier every moment like the sunrise.
SNG.6.10	She is as pretty as the moon.
SNG.6.10	She is very beautiful to look at!
SNG.6.10	She is bright, like the sun.
SNG.6.10	There she stands, beautiful and important.
SNG.6.10	It is like the way that God has put each star like a king or a queen in its place.’ 
SNG.6.11	I went down to the small wood where there are trees with dry, hard fruit.
SNG.6.11	I wanted to see what had started to grow in the valley.
SNG.6.11	I wanted to see if the 
SNG.6.11	I wanted to see if the 
SNG.6.12	I did not have time to understand everything about it.
SNG.6.12	But I knew that I really wanted her.
SNG.6.12	This put me among the king's 
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, 
SNG.6.13	Come back! Come back!
SNG.6.13	We want to look at you for a long time.
SNG.6.13	Do not look for a long time at the 
SNG.6.13	Do not look at her as you would look at the dance at 
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your feet in 
SNG.7.1	How beautifully your legs move!
SNG.7.1	They are like valuable stones
SNG.7.1	that a 
SNG.7.2	Your 
SNG.7.2	Your stomach is the shape of many plants that a farmer has picked for food.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like two young 
SNG.7.3	born to their mother on the same day.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like an 
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon, by the gate that is called Bath Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the 
SNG.7.4	the building from where people can look towards Damascus. 
SNG.7.5	At the top, your head is like the mountain that is called Mount Carmel.
SNG.7.5	Like a 
SNG.7.5	Your hair hangs down and it shines like long, thin pieces of 
SNG.7.5	It is like 
SNG.7.5	It is so beautiful that a king would keep his eyes towards it all the time!
SNG.7.6	You are very, very beautiful.
SNG.7.6	I love you.
SNG.7.6	Many things about you give a lot of pleasure to me.
SNG.7.7	You are tall like a 
SNG.7.7	Your breasts are like groups of fruit that are very near to each other.
SNG.7.8	I said, ‘I will climb the 
SNG.7.8	I want your breasts to be like the groups of fruit on the 
SNG.7.8	I want the smell from your mouth to be like apples.
SNG.7.9	I want your mouth to be like 
SNG.7.9	I want the 
SNG.7.9	I want to pour it slowly over his lips and over his teeth.
SNG.7.10	This man loves me and I am his.
SNG.7.10	He wants me very much.
SNG.7.11	You love me!
SNG.7.11	Come! I want us to go away from the towns.
SNG.7.11	I suggest that we stay in the villages for the night.
SNG.7.12	We can go early to the 
SNG.7.12	We can see if the 
SNG.7.12	We can see if the flowers have opened.
SNG.7.12	We can see if the 
SNG.7.12	There I will give my love to you.
SNG.7.13	The 
SNG.7.13	There is every good thing to eat at our door.
SNG.7.13	You love me and I have stored new and old things for you. 
SNG.8.1	I want you to be like a brother who drank at my mother's breasts!
SNG.8.1	I want us to be like a brother and sister.
SNG.8.1	So, if I found you outside, I would kiss you.
SNG.8.1	And nobody would think about me as a bad person.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you to my mother's house.
SNG.8.2	I would bring you to the mother who has taught me.
SNG.8.2	I would give to you 
SNG.8.2	I would give to you my 
SNG.8.3	His left arm is under my head and his right arm draws me near to him.
SNG.8.4	please do not cause someone to feel love for another person;
SNG.8.4	not until he or she wants to.
SNG.8.4	I am saying this because I really mean it.
SNG.8.4	I 
SNG.8.5	Someone is coming up from the dry, empty place with the man who loves her!
SNG.8.5	Her head is against the man's shoulder.
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree, I woke you.
SNG.8.5	There your life started in your mother's body.
SNG.8.5	There your mother was in pain during your birth.
SNG.8.6	Draw me near to you like a 
SNG.8.6	Put me like a 
SNG.8.6	Keep me there always because love is as strong as death.
SNG.8.6	A dead person in a hole in the ground never comes out alive again.
SNG.8.6	A man who loves his wife will never let another man take her away from him.
SNG.8.6	And I do not want you to love another woman.
SNG.8.6	Love burns like a red-hot fire.
SNG.8.6	It burns like the hottest part of a large fire.
SNG.8.7	Lots of water cannot put it out.
SNG.8.7	Rivers cannot carry it away.
SNG.8.7	A rich man might give everything that he has to buy someone's love.
SNG.8.7	But people would tell him that he was very silly! 
SNG.8.8	My brothers had said:
SNG.8.8	‘We have a younger sister.
SNG.8.8	Her breasts have not yet grown.
SNG.8.8	What will we do on her behalf when it is the time for her to marry?’
SNG.8.9	My friends said:
SNG.8.9	‘If she is a wall, we will build 
SNG.8.9	If she is a door, we will put boards of 
SNG.8.10	I am a wall.
SNG.8.10	My breasts are like 
SNG.8.10	So, to him, I have become like someone who gives pleasure to him.
SNG.8.11	King Solomon had a 
SNG.8.11	People could come and they could pay 11 
SNG.8.12	But my own 
SNG.8.12	The 11 
SNG.8.12	I give 2 
SNG.8.13	You have been in the garden with your friends for a long time.
SNG.8.13	Let me hear your voice!
SNG.8.14	You love me. Come away.
SNG.8.14	Be like a 
ISA.1.1	This is what Isaiah, the son of Amoz, 
ISA.1.2	Hear the 
ISA.1.3	A cow knows its master. And a horse knows where the farmer feeds it. But Israel's people do not know me. My people do not understand me.’
ISA.1.4	Oh! You are a country of people who do not obey me. All your people are like people who are carrying heavy things. They are the wrong things that you have done. You are a family of people who are always doing bad things. You are sons who destroy everything. They have left the 
ISA.1.5	So, you continue to fight against God. God will only hurt you again. Your whole head is not well and your whole heart is ill.
ISA.1.6	From the part under the feet, even to the head, there is no health in you. There are only places where people have hit you. There are only places that hurt. People have cut you until you bleed. Nobody has cleaned you. Nobody has tied a cloth round the places where you are bleeding. Nobody has put medicine on them.
ISA.1.7	Your country is empty. Fire has burned your cities. Foreign people have taken everything from your fields. They did it in front of you. Strangers have destroyed your country.
ISA.1.8	The 
ISA.1.9	Unless the 
ISA.1.10	Hear what the 
ISA.1.11	‘All your 
ISA.1.12	You come to appear in front of me at certain times. But nobody asked you to do that. Do not walk heavily round my 
ISA.1.13	Do not bring gifts to me that do not mean anything! I do not like your 
ISA.1.14	I really do not like your new moon meetings and your 
ISA.1.15	I will hide my eyes from you, when you lift up your hands to me. I will not listen to you, even if you pray often. Your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean! Take away the bad things that you are doing. Then I will not see them. Do not continue to do what is wrong.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do what is right. Your purpose must be 
ISA.1.18	Come, now’, the 
ISA.1.19	Agree with me. And obey me. If you do those things, you will eat the best food in the country.
ISA.1.20	But if you do not do those things, the 
ISA.1.21	Oh! The City that loved the 
ISA.1.22	Your 
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are fighting against God. And they are friends of robbers. They all accept gifts from people. And then they help people that they should not help because of those gifts. And they all hope for gifts like those. But they do not help children who have no father. They do not help those children when people hurt them. The 
ISA.1.24	So the 
ISA.1.25	And I will turn my hand against you. And I will burn with very hot fire everything that makes you not clean. So then you will be clean.
ISA.1.26	And I will give back to you your 
ISA.1.27	God will use 
ISA.1.28	But he will kill people who 
ISA.1.29	Really, they will be ashamed of their special trees called oaks. You have found a lot of pleasure in them. The gardens that you have chosen will make you really ashamed.
ISA.1.30	You will be like an oak tree with dying leaves. You will be like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	The strong man will become like something that burns easily. His work will be like something that causes things to burn. They will both burn together and nobody will put out the fire.
ISA.2.1	This is what Isaiah, the son of Amoz, ‘
ISA.2.2	This is what will happen in the last days. The mountain, where the house of the 
ISA.2.3	And people from many countries will come to it. And they will say, ‘Come! We will go to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.4	God will be the 
ISA.2.5	Jacob's people, come and we will walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	But you, 
ISA.2.7	Their country is full of 
ISA.2.9	So, the 
ISA.2.10	Go into the holes in the rocks and hide in the ground. Hide because you are afraid. You are afraid of what the 
ISA.2.11	The 
ISA.2.12	Yes! The 
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	The 
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· the high, the really high 
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· the 
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· the very high mountains
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· the highest hills
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· tall buildings
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· strong walls
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· boats from Tarshish
ISA.2.13+ISA.2.14+ISA.2.15+ISA.2.16	· beautiful ships.
ISA.2.17	The 
ISA.2.18	And nobody will see any of the 
ISA.2.19	And people will run to holes in the sides of the rocks and to holes in the ground. They will run because they are afraid of the 
ISA.2.20	In that day, people will throw away their 
ISA.2.21	But then people will run to large holes in the rocks and to holes in the sides of mountains. They will run because they are afraid of the 
ISA.2.22	Do not ask human people to help you. They are so weak that they might die very soon! They are worth nothing.
ISA.3.1	I will show you what the 
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	He will take away these people:
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the strong man and the soldier
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the 
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the person who uses 
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the captain of 50 soldiers and the very important man
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the person who tells people the best thing to do and the good worker
ISA.3.2+ISA.3.3	· the person who uses 
ISA.3.4	‘And I, the 
ISA.3.5	The people will be cruel to each other. Each man will be cruel to another man. And each man will be cruel the person who lives near him. Young people will say bad things to older people. And bad people will say bad things to good people.
ISA.3.6	Then a man will hold his brother strongly in the house of his father. The man will say, ‘You have a coat. So, you can be our leader! Then you can rule over these buildings that the enemy destroyed!’
ISA.3.7	On that day, the brother will refuse. He will say, ‘I cannot help! There is no food and no coat in my house. Do not choose me as a leader of people.’
ISA.3.8	That will happen because the leaders of Jerusalem and Judah have started to fall. Then they have fallen down. Their words and the things that they do are against the 
ISA.3.9	Their faces show what they are really like. It is clear that they have 
ISA.3.10	Tell the very good people that good things will happen to them. They will enjoy the results of the good things that they have done.
ISA.3.11	The very bad person will be very sad. He will have great trouble. Here is the reason. What he has done to other people will happen to him.
ISA.3.12	Children are cruel to my people and women rule over them. My people, your leaders have not ruled you well. They have led you away from the right paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	The 
ISA.3.15	· ‘Do not hit my people, so that they break into pieces.
ISA.3.15	· You are like someone who walks on the faces of the poor people.
ISA.3.15	You must stop being cruel to them.’
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.17	So the 
ISA.3.18+ISA.3.19+ISA.3.20+ISA.3.21+ISA.3.22+ISA.3.23	In that day, the 
ISA.3.24	There will not be 
ISA.3.26	And the gates of 
ISA.4.1	In that day, 7 women will find one man and they will hold him. They will say, ‘We will eat our own bread and we will wear our own clothes. But, let us call ourselves by your name. Take away our 
ISA.4.2	In that day, the Branch of the 
ISA.4.3	Everyone who remains in 
ISA.4.4	That will happen when the 
ISA.4.5	The 
ISA.4.6	It will be a place to hide from the heat in the day. And it will be a place to hide from storms and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Now I will sing for the person that I love. I will sing a song of love about his 
ISA.5.1	‘The person that I love has a 
ISA.5.2	He dug the ground and he removed the stones. He planted the best 
ISA.5.2	He made a tall building in the middle of the 
ISA.5.2	He also made a place to make 
ISA.5.2	But bad 
ISA.5.3	And now, listen to me, you people who live in Jerusalem. And listen, all you people who live in Judah. You decide who was wrong. Decide whether I or my 
ISA.5.4	There was nothing else that I ought to have done for my 
ISA.5.5	And now I will tell you what I will do to my 
ISA.5.6	I will make the land so that nobody can use it. Nobody will 
ISA.5.7	Now the 
ISA.5.8	The people who build one house next to another house will be very sad. Also, they join one field to another field. They do that until there is no more room. So you people live alone on the land.
ISA.5.9	I have heard the 
ISA.5.10	Also, large parts of the 
ISA.5.11	There will be trouble for the people who get up early in the morning. They do that so that they can get a drink of alcohol. They go to bed late in the evening, so that 
ISA.5.12	At their parties there is music from 
ISA.5.13	So my people will go into 
ISA.5.14	So 
ISA.5.15	So the 
ISA.5.16	But his 
ISA.5.17	Then the sheep will eat grass as they do in their own fields. Young sheep will eat in the rich people's houses that the enemy destroyed.
ISA.5.18	Some people do very bad things everywhere that they go. They are like someone who pulls something behind him with pieces of 
ISA.5.19	Those people who say, ‘The 
ISA.5.20	There are people who call wrong things right. And they call right things wrong. They say, ‘It is light’, when it is dark. And they say, ‘It is dark’, when it is light. They say that 
ISA.5.21	Some people think that they are 
ISA.5.22	Some people think that they are great. They think that because they drink a lot of 
ISA.5.23	They do not 
ISA.5.24	So as certainly as fire burns dry plants, parts of them will fall into pieces. And as fire burns away dry grass, their flowers will blow away like small pieces of dirt. That will happen because they refused to obey the 
ISA.5.25	So the 
ISA.5.26	Also, the 
ISA.5.27	Nobody is tired; nobody falls down. Nobody rests; nobody sleeps. Nobody has a belt that they have not fastened. And nobody has broken a part of a shoe.
ISA.5.28	Their 
ISA.5.29	They 
ISA.5.30	On that day, the enemy will 
ISA.6.1	In the year when King Uzziah died, I saw the 
ISA.6.2	Above him were 
ISA.6.3	One 
ISA.6.4	When each 
ISA.6.5	Then I said, ‘I am very frightened! I am a man with lips that are not clean. And I live among people with lips that are not clean. And with my own eyes I have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the 
ISA.6.7	And he touched my mouth with it. And he said, ‘Look! This has touched your lips and it has taken away your 
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the 
ISA.6.9	And God said, ‘Go! And tell this to the people (in Judah):
ISA.6.9	· “Always listen, but you will never understand!
ISA.6.9	· Always look. But you will never see what it means!”
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of these people fat. Close their ears and shut their eyes. If you do not do that, they will see with their eyes. They will hear with their ears and they will understand with their hearts. Then they will turn and I will make them well again.’
ISA.6.11	Then I said, ‘For how long, 
ISA.6.11	· ‘Do it until their enemy destroys the cities. Then nobody will live there.
ISA.6.11	· Do it until nobody lives in the houses.
ISA.6.11	· Do it until they cannot use the land in any way.
ISA.6.11	· 
ISA.6.12	Do it until the 
ISA.6.12	· And do it until an enemy has destroyed many places inside this country.
ISA.6.13	And even if one in every 10 places still has living people in it, an enemy will burn those places again! They will do it as they burn 
ISA.7.1	Ahaz became the king of Judah. He was the son of Jotham and Jotham was the son of Uzziah. When Ahaz was king, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the king of Israel, both attacked Jerusalem. But they did not win the fight. Pekah was the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.2	People told this to (Ahaz, who was from) the 
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	The 
ISA.7.5	(The rulers of) Syria and 
ISA.7.6	‘We must attack Judah. We will frighten the people. We will destroy their country and it will become ours. We will make the son of Tabeal king there.’ 
ISA.7.7	The 
ISA.7.8	It will not happen, because the capital city of Syria is Damascus. And the king of Damascus is Rezin. And 65 years from now 
ISA.7.9	And the capital city of 
ISA.7.10	And the 
ISA.7.11	He said, ‘Ask the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, ‘I will never ask for a message or ask the 
ISA.7.13	And Isaiah said, ‘Now listen, you 
ISA.7.14	So the 
ISA.7.15	One day he will know the difference between right things and wrong things. Then he will not be too young to eat butter or sugar. 
ISA.7.16	The child will know how to choose right things. He will also know how to refuse bad things. He will know those things before he is very old. But even before the child knows those things, enemies will make two countries empty. The countries are the countries of the two kings that you are afraid of.
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	Then the 
ISA.7.19	And they will all come and they will land on these places:
ISA.7.19	· the valleys with high sides
ISA.7.19	· the holes in the rocks
ISA.7.19	· all the bushes with 
ISA.7.19	· all the places where there is water.
ISA.7.20	On that day, the 
ISA.7.21	On that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats. 
ISA.7.22	They will give a lot of milk. So he will have butter to eat. Everyone who remains in the country will eat butter and sugar. 
ISA.7.23	On that day, in every place where there were 1000 
ISA.7.24	A man will go there with a bow and 
ISA.7.25	Nobody will go to the hills because they will be afraid of the 
ISA.8.1	And the 
ISA.8.2	And I will ask two special people to come to me. They must say what is true. One will be Uriah the 
ISA.8.3	Then I went to the 
ISA.8.4	Before the child knows how to say “my father” or “my mother” this will happen. The king of Assyria will carry away the valuable things from Damascus and from Samaria.’
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	‘These people have refused to accept the waters of 
ISA.8.7	So, see what will happen. The 
ISA.8.8	Then its water will come quickly into Judah. It will rise over its sides and it will go over the land. It will even reach people's necks! His 
ISA.8.9	Join together against your enemies, you people, but they will kill almost all of you. Listen carefully, all you far countries. Get ready for war, but your enemies will kill almost all your people. Get ready to fight. But your enemies will kill almost all of you.
ISA.8.10	Make 
ISA.8.11	Now the 
ISA.8.12	‘You must not think, “Everything that these people call a secret 
ISA.8.13	Instead, be afraid of the 
ISA.8.14	That is because he will be a safe place.
ISA.8.14	But for both 
ISA.8.15	Many people's feet will hit something and they will fall. The 
ISA.8.16	Tie up what I have said (in a 
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for the 
ISA.8.18	Here am I and the children that the 
ISA.8.19	And they will say to you, ‘Ask the 
ISA.8.20	Listen again to what I have said. And listen to what I have taught you. If people say different things, there is no dawn for them. And that is why they say the wrong things. 
ISA.8.21	Then they will go through the country and they will not be very happy. They will not have enough to eat. And so they will become angry. They will look up (to where God lives). Then they will say bad things about their king and about their God. 
ISA.8.22	And they will look to the earth. But they will see that it is dark. And they will see that people are not very happy. In the dark, people will be very sad. It will push people into something even blacker.
ISA.9.1	But at a future time everything will be better for the people who were not very happy. In past years, God let trouble happen to the people in the places called Zebulun and Naphtali. But in future years, he will send 
ISA.9.1	· the country by the sea
ISA.9.1	· the land at the other side of the River Jordan
ISA.9.1	· Galilee, where people from other countries live.
ISA.9.2	The people who walk in the dark will see a great light. The light will shine on those people who live on land full of dark shadows.
ISA.9.3	You (
ISA.9.4	That is because, as in the fight with Midian, you will break these things:
ISA.9.4	· the 
ISA.9.4	· the sticks that they hit our backs with
ISA.9.4	· the stick that hurts us.
ISA.9.5	Then they will burn as material for the fire every boot that soldiers wore in war. And they will burn the clothes with blood on them.
ISA.9.6	They will do that because a child is born for us. God has given a son to us. And that son will always have authority to rule. And people will call him by these names:
ISA.9.6	· 
ISA.9.6	· Great God
ISA.9.6	· Father for Always
ISA.9.6	· Leader who brings 
ISA.9.7	His authority will become greater. And the 
ISA.9.8	The 
ISA.9.9	And all the people who live in 
ISA.9.10	‘We built houses with 
ISA.9.11	But the 
ISA.9.12	The people from Syria on the east and the people from Philistia on the west have opened their mouths. It is like they have eaten Israel. But the 
ISA.9.13	But the people did not turn to him who hit them. Neither did they go to the 
ISA.9.14	So, in one day, the 
ISA.9.15	The head means the older men and the important people. The tail means the (false) 
ISA.9.16	The leaders of this people lead them away from what is true. They confuse the people that they are leaders of.
ISA.9.17	So the 
ISA.9.18	The wrong things that people do burn like a fire. Fires eat up 
ISA.9.19	He is very angry, so the 
ISA.9.20	They will take food on their right side, but they will still be hungry. And they will eat what is on the left side. But it will not fill them. Everyone will eat the body of the person who lives near him.
ISA.9.21	The people from the 
ISA.10.1	Some people make rules that are not fair. They also make rules that are cruel to other people. There will be trouble for the people who make those rules.
ISA.10.2	They do these things:
ISA.10.2	· Some people need many things. But their rulers do not let them get what is fair.
ISA.10.2	· They take away what poor people should have.
ISA.10.2	· They rob women whose husbands are dead. They rob them of everything.
ISA.10.2	· And they are cruel to children whose parents are dead.
ISA.10.3	You cannot do anything when God 
ISA.10.4	You may go to be with the people who are in a prison. Or perhaps you will die with those that the enemy kills in war. Those are the only two things that can happen to you. But the 
ISA.10.5	The people in Assyria will be very sad. I will use them like a stick, because I am angry. They will be like someone who hits (Israel's people) with a heavy stick. They will do that because I am very, very angry.
ISA.10.6	I will send the people from Assyria against this 
ISA.10.7	But that is not what Assyria's people are thinking. Their ideas are different. They want to beat as many countries as they can. They want to destroy them.
ISA.10.8	They 
ISA.10.9	The city that is called Calno is like Carchemish. Hamath is like Arpad and Samaria is like Damascus.
ISA.10.10	I got power over all those places and I took their 
ISA.10.11	So I will do to Jerusalem and to her 
ISA.10.12	The 
ISA.10.13	This is what the king of Assyria says. ‘I have done this because I am very strong. Also, I am very clever. So I know what I should do. I have removed the borders between countries. Also, I have taken their valuable things. Like a wild animal, I have attacked their people.
ISA.10.14	My hand found the valuable things of many countries. I did that as one finds a bird's home. I have got power over all the earth as easily as people take eggs from a bird's empty home. And it was like not one 
ISA.10.15	The 
ISA.10.16	So the 
ISA.10.17	And (the 
ISA.10.18	The 
ISA.10.19	Only a few forest trees will remain. Even a child will be able to count those that do remain!
ISA.10.20	When that happens, this will happen to the 
ISA.10.20	· They will not try to get help from the country that beat them.
ISA.10.20	· Instead, they will really want to get all their help from the 
ISA.10.21	A 
ISA.10.22	Israel, only a 
ISA.10.23	That will happen because the 
ISA.10.24	So, this is what the 
ISA.10.25	But soon I will not be angry with you. Instead, I will be angry with the people from Assyria and I will kill them. 
ISA.10.26	And it will be like the 
ISA.10.27	In that day, the weight will come off your shoulder. The 
ISA.10.28	Assyria's army will attack Aiath. He will pass through Migron. He will store his things at Michmash.
ISA.10.29	They will pass through the hills, and they will stay for a night at Geba. The people in Ramah will be afraid and the people in Gibeah of Saul will run away.
ISA.10.30	People in Gallim, shout for help! Listen, people in Laishah. Answer them, people in Anathoth.
ISA.10.31	The people in Madmenah will run away. And those who live in Gebim will rush to a safe place.
ISA.10.32	He will stop at Nob on the day that he arrives there. He will move his fist angrily towards the people who live in 
ISA.10.33	But look! The 
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the trees in the forest with an axe. Also, the great trees from Lebanon will fall down.
ISA.11.1	The part of the Tree of Jesse that is still there will start to grow. Then a Branch will grow from the part of it that is under the ground.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	· a 
ISA.11.2	· a 
ISA.11.2	· a 
ISA.11.3	To obey the 
ISA.11.4	But what he decides about poor people will be with 
ISA.11.5	He will wear true 
ISA.11.7	Cows and 
ISA.11.8	And a small baby will play near the hole where a dangerous snake lives. And a young child will put his hand on to the home of another dangerous snake.
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt nor kill each other in all my 
ISA.11.10	In that day, the 
ISA.11.11	And on that day, my 
ISA.11.12	The 
ISA.11.14	But together they will attack the low hills of Philistia to the west. They will beat the people to the east of Israel. They will fight against Edom and Moab, and the people in Ammon will obey them.
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.16	And there will be a good road from Assyria for the 
ISA.12.1	You will say in that day, ‘I 
ISA.12.2	Listen! God has made me safe! I will continue to 
ISA.12.3	You will enjoy the fact that you are safe. It will be like when people happily get water from good wells.
ISA.12.4	And you will say in that day, ‘
ISA.12.5	Sing 
ISA.12.6	Everyone who lives in 
ISA.13.1	These are serious words about Babylon that Isaiah the son of Amoz ‘saw’. 
ISA.13.2	Lift up a sign on an empty hill. Shout aloud to them and lift a hand! Then they will go through the gates of the kings.
ISA.13.3	I myself have sent my special men. I have told them what they must do. Also, my brave soldiers must say that I am very angry. I have sent them. They are my 
ISA.13.4	Listen to the sound of a very big crowd! They are people who are on the mountains! Listen to the sound of these people. They are shouting while they come together from many countries! The 
ISA.13.5	People are coming from a country that is a long way from here. They are coming from the ends of the skies. The 
ISA.13.6	Weep, because the day of the 
ISA.13.7	Everybody's hands will become weak because of it. And every human heart will become very weak.
ISA.13.8	And they will be very much afraid. They will hurt and they will feel a lot of pain. They will be afraid like a woman who is having a baby. They will look at each other and their faces will frighten each other.
ISA.13.9	Think! The day of the 
ISA.13.10	Yes! The stars in the skies, all of them, will give no light. When the sun appears in the morning, it will still be dark. The moon will not shine.
ISA.13.11	I will cause very bad things to happen to the world. And I will 
ISA.13.12	I will make men harder to find than the best gold. And men and women will be more difficult to find than gold from Ophir.
ISA.13.13	So I will cause the skies to 
ISA.13.14	And people will look at each other and they will run away to their own country. They will be like wild animals that run away from the hunter. Or they will be like sheep with nobody to lead them.
ISA.13.15	The foreign army will kill with sharp knives anyone who tries to run away. And they will kill with the 
ISA.13.16	They will break young children into pieces while the children's parents watch. They will rob the people's homes and they will have sex with their wives.
ISA.13.17	Look, I will cause the 
ISA.13.18	Their bows will kill the young men. They will not be kind to babies. And they will not seem sorry for the children.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed them. That will happen even if other countries think, ‘Babylon is beautiful.’ The people in 
ISA.13.20	But people will never live there again. And none of its children will ever live there again. No Arab will put his 
ISA.13.21	Only wild animals will lie down there. Its houses will be full of 
ISA.14.1	The 
ISA.14.2	And the foreign people will take the people of Israel and they will bring them to their own country, Israel. Then Israel's people will rule the foreign people in the 
ISA.14.3	On that day, this will happen. The 
ISA.14.3	· all your pain and illnesses
ISA.14.3	· the cruel way that your enemies caused you to work.
ISA.14.4	You will laugh at the king of Babylon. Then you will say to him, ‘Now you cannot be cruel to us, nor can you attack us!
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	The rulers of Babylon hit many people because they were angry with them. They never stopped hitting them. They were very angry, so they attacked other countries. They never stopped fighting them.
ISA.14.7	But now there is no war in the whole world and it can rest. Everyone is so happy that they are singing!
ISA.14.8	Even the 
ISA.14.9	When you arrive there, you will get much interest from the people in 
ISA.14.10	All of them will speak to you and they will say this. “Even you have become as weak as we are! You have become like us!”
ISA.14.11	Your 
ISA.14.12	‘Look at you! You have fallen from the skies!
ISA.14.12	You shine. You are called the Son of the Dawn!
ISA.14.12	You made many countries low, but now you are low yourself!
ISA.14.13	You said in your mind, “I will go up into the 
ISA.14.13	I will put my seat above the stars of God.
ISA.14.13	I will sit in the mountain in the far north with God's leaders.
ISA.14.14	I will rise above the tops of the clouds. I will be like the 
ISA.14.15	But he has brought you down to 
ISA.14.16	‘The people who see you will really look at you. They will think this about you. “This is the man who caused the earth to 
ISA.14.17	This is the man who made the world like a 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of all the countries – yes! all of them – lie down in a good place. Each king lies in his own 
ISA.14.19	But you, they will throw you out without a 
ISA.14.20	They will not bury you with those other kings. Here are the reasons:
ISA.14.20	· You have destroyed your country.
ISA.14.20	· You have killed your own people.
ISA.14.20	Nobody will ever remember again this son of very bad people!
ISA.14.21	Prepare a place where they will kill his children. They will kill them because their parents 
ISA.14.22	‘I will fight against them’, says the 
ISA.14.23	The 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	I will kill the man from Assyria in my country. Also, I will put him under my feet on my mountains. Then, he will not be cruel to my people. Also, they will not have to carry his heavy weights again.’ 
ISA.14.26	That is the 
ISA.14.27	It is the 
ISA.14.28	In the year that King Ahaz died, Isaiah received this message:
ISA.14.29	‘Do not feel happy, you people in Philistia. God has broken the stick that hit you. But from that stick a dangerous snake will come. And from that snake will come a snake that can fly!
ISA.14.30	The poorest people among my people will sleep safely. And they will be able to feed their sheep in my green fields. But I will cause your people in Philistia to die because there will be no food. And I will kill the people who remain.
ISA.14.31	Gate of the city, cry! City itself, scream! Move away, all you people in Philistia! Do that because smoke will come from the north. Everybody in that army will march quickly.’ 
ISA.14.32	‘What should we say to the people who bring messages from the government? Say that the 
ISA.15.1	This is a serious message about Moab.
ISA.15.1	It is true! In one night an enemy destroyed Ar. But Moab did not make any noise.
ISA.15.1	It is true! In one night an enemy destroyed Kir in Moab. But Moab did not make any noise.
ISA.15.2	The people in Dibon have gone up to their 
ISA.15.3	They are wearing hairy cloth in the streets. On the roofs of their houses they are weeping. And in the open places in their towns they are weeping. There are a lot of 
ISA.15.4	Then the people in Heshbon and Elealeh cried aloud. People as far as Jahaz heard the sound! The soldiers of Moab cry aloud because they are afraid. The minds of Moab's people are afraid.
ISA.15.5	Inside, I feel like a man who is crying aloud for Moab! Its people have run away as far as Zoar and Eglath-Shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	It is true! They weep while they climb up the hill to Luhith.
ISA.15.5	It is true! On the road to Horonaim they shout aloud, ‘An enemy has destroyed us!’ 
ISA.15.6	It is true! It is not wet; it is dry in the Valley of Nimrim.
ISA.15.6	It is true! The grass is dead. Nothing new is growing. And there is nothing that is green.
ISA.15.7	So, they carry away over the little River of the 
ISA.15.8	It is true! The sounds of people who ask for help reach the edges of Moab. People as far as Eglaim heard Moab's sad songs. Moab's sad songs reached Beer-Elim.
ISA.15.9	It is true! Blood fills the waters of Dimon.
ISA.15.9	It is true! More bad things will happen to Dimon. A 
ISA.16.1	Send young sheep from the ruler of the country to Jerusalem. Send them from Sela across the 
ISA.16.2	The women from Moab are crossing the River Arnon. They are like birds that are learning to fly. The mother bird pushes those little birds out from their home.
ISA.16.3	Tell us what we should do! Be fair about what you say! Cause your shadow over us to seem like it is night in the middle of the day! Hide the 
ISA.16.4	Let the people from Moab who are running away stay with you. Hide them from the enemy that is killing them.
ISA.16.4	It is true! People will not be cruel to those who are weak. People will not destroy things. People who fight will 
ISA.16.5	Someone from David's 
ISA.16.6	We have heard about the 
ISA.16.7	So Moab weeps. All Moab weeps for itself. Sing a sad song. And cry for the cakes that they made with very dry 
ISA.16.8	It is true! There are no plants in the fields in Heshbon. And there is nothing on the 
ISA.16.9	Because of that, I weep for the 
ISA.16.9	It is true! The noise of war has fallen on your plants and on your fruit. 
ISA.16.10	Nobody is really happy in the fields. Nobody sings in the 
ISA.16.11	So, I cry deep inside me for Moab. It is like the sad sound of a 
ISA.16.12	And when the people in Moab come to their 
ISA.16.13	Those are the words that the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	This is a serious message about Damascus. Look! The enemy broke the city called Damascus into a lot of stones.
ISA.17.2	Nobody lives in the cities of Aroer. They have become places where groups of animals lie down. Nobody makes them afraid.
ISA.17.3	There are no strong cities in 
ISA.17.4	On that day, the 
ISA.17.5	And it was like when a farmer got all the 
ISA.17.6	There was not much (in Israel). It was like when someone has hit an 
ISA.17.7	On a day like that, people should obey their 
ISA.17.8	They should not think that the 
ISA.17.9	On that day, Israel's strong cities became like empty cities. They were like those other empty forests and woods. People had left them when Israel first attacked them. So the cities were empty groups of stones. 
ISA.17.10	They were empty for these reasons:
ISA.17.10	You forgot the God who made you safe.
ISA.17.10	You did not remember the Rock that hid you from danger.
ISA.17.10	You planted gardens for a false god and you planted 
ISA.17.11	So, there were no fruits. On the day that you planted them, you caused them to grow well. They had flowers on the morning that you planted them! But all that finished in a day that was very sad. And there was pain that nothing could take away.
ISA.17.12	Oh, listen! The people in many countries are 
ISA.17.13	The people in those countries are 
ISA.17.14	Look! In the evening everyone is very much afraid. And in the morning nobody is there! That will happen to anyone who takes things from us. It will happen to anyone who robs us.
ISA.18.1	Oh! There is a country where the ships seem to have 
ISA.18.2	It is sending messages by people in boats that they made from 
ISA.18.3	Everybody who lives in the world and on the earth, listen to this. You will see a sign on the tops of the mountains. You will hear the sound of a 
ISA.18.4	This is what the 
ISA.18.5	Then, before the 
ISA.18.6	He will leave them all for the birds that catch small animals in the mountains. And they will eat them. He will leave them to the wild animals on the land. The birds will feed on them all the summer. And the wild animals will feed on them all the winter.
ISA.18.7	At that time, people brought gifts to the 
ISA.19.1	This is a serious message about Egypt.
ISA.19.1	Look! The 
ISA.19.2	‘I will cause Egypt's men to fight against Egypt's men. A man will fight against his brother. A man will fight against the man who lives near him. A city will fight against a city and a 
ISA.19.3	I will pour out the 
ISA.19.4	And I will let a cruel master get power over Egypt. And a powerful king will rule over its people.’ That is what the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters of the sea will become dry. And the river will have no water and so it will become dry.
ISA.19.6	And the 
ISA.19.7	And the plants at the side of the river Nile will die. And the plants near where the river goes into the sea will die. Everything that people plant by the river will become dry. The wind will blow it away and there will be nothing there.
ISA.19.8	And the fishers will be very sad. Then, everyone who throws a 
ISA.19.9	There are other people who work with the 
ISA.19.10	That will destroy the 
ISA.19.11	The leaders of Zoan are really fools! The best people in 
ISA.19.13	The leaders in Zoan have made themselves into fools. The leaders of Noph have confused each other. The leaders of those groups of people have caused Egypt to choose wrongly. 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	There is nothing that anybody in Egypt can do. They may be like a head or like a tail, a branch on a 
ISA.19.16	In that day the people in Egypt will be afraid, like women. They will be afraid when the 
ISA.19.17	The name of the country called Judah will frighten the people in Egypt very much. When people say the name Judah, they will be afraid of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day, five cities in the country called Egypt will speak the language of 
ISA.19.19	In that day, there will be an 
ISA.19.20	Those two things will be like notices to tell everyone in Egypt about the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a road from Egypt to Assyria. People from Assyria will go to Egypt and people from Egypt will go to Assyria. People from Egypt and Assyria will 
ISA.19.24	In that day, Israel will be the third country with Egypt and Assyria. Good things will happen in the middle of the country. 
ISA.19.25	The 
ISA.20.1	In that year (711 
ISA.20.2	At that time, the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	This is what the king of Assyria will do. He will take away people from Egypt as 
ISA.20.5	They will not be very happy and they will be ashamed. They had hoped that Cush would help them. And they had said that Egypt would help them also. 
ISA.20.6	The people who live along this coast will say in that day, “Look! This happened to the people that we wanted to help us. We went to them for help. We did that because we wanted to get away from the king of Assyria. And now, we do not know how to get away from him.” ’
ISA.21.1	This is a serious message about the 
ISA.21.2	I received a difficult message. The robber robs and the destroyer destroys. Elam, go up (to Babylon)! People from (the country called) Media, attack (Babylon)! The 
ISA.21.3	All those things hurt me. Bad pains attack me. They are like the bad pains that a woman feels. She feels them when she has a baby. What I hear bends me over. And that is why I cannot listen. What I see frightens me. And that is why I cannot look.
ISA.21.4	It confuses my mind. I am very much afraid. I wanted a quiet evening. But now that quiet evening has become a time when I am very much afraid.
ISA.21.5	They prepare a special meal. They put down the carpets. They eat and they drink. Officers, make your 
ISA.21.6	This is what the 
ISA.21.7	If he reports one of these, cause him to watch.
ISA.21.7	· a rider
ISA.21.7	· a pair of men on horses
ISA.21.7	· a rider on a 
ISA.21.7	· a rider on a 
ISA.21.7	And he must watch very well.’
ISA.21.8	Then the man who watched shouted. He said, ‘
ISA.21.9	And look! Someone is coming! It is a rider; it is a man with a pair of horses!’ The rider reports and he says this. ‘An enemy has destroyed Babylon! The enemy has destroyed it! All the 
ISA.21.10	My people, they have hurt you. They have hurt you very much. But I have told you what I have heard from the 
ISA.21.11	This is a serious message about Dumah. Someone is shouting to me from Seir. They are asking, ‘
ISA.21.12	The 
ISA.21.13	This is a serious message about Arabia. 
ISA.21.14	There you will give water to people who need a drink. People who live in Tema will give bread to the 
ISA.21.15	Do that because they are running away from all this:
ISA.21.15	· 
ISA.21.15	· 
ISA.21.15	· bows that soldiers have bent
ISA.21.15	· the dangerous 
ISA.21.16	This is what my 
ISA.21.17	Only a few of the men who use bows among the soldiers from Kedar will remain. That will happen because the 
ISA.22.1	This is a serious message about the Valley that Isaiah saw in a 
ISA.22.2	Your city is full of noise. And it is full of people who are rushing about. The town is having a party! The 
ISA.22.3	The enemy caught all your leaders who ran away. The enemy did not have to use one bow. Some of them ran a long way away, but the enemy caught them all!
ISA.22.4	So I said, ‘Leave me alone! Let me cry the saddest 
ISA.22.5	That is because the 
ISA.22.6	(People will say), ‘People from Elam carried baskets of 
ISA.22.7	So your best valleys will be full of 
ISA.22.8	The 
ISA.22.9	You will see that there are many holes in the walls of the City of David. Also, you will get water from the Lower Pool.
ISA.22.10	Then you will count the houses in Jerusalem. And you will knock down the houses. And you will use the materials to make the walls of Jerusalem stronger.
ISA.22.11	You may have built a place inside the walls of Jerusalem to put water from the Old Pool. But you have not looked to its 
ISA.22.12	And then the 
ISA.22.13	But look! Everybody is happy, they are very happy. They are killing cows and sheep. They will eat meat and drink. They are saying, ‘We will eat (a lot) and we will drink (a lot). We will do that because tomorrow we will die.’
ISA.22.14	But this is what the 
ISA.22.15	This is what the 
ISA.22.16	Say to him, “You should not be here. God did not say that you can be here. You have cut in the rock here a 
ISA.22.17	Watch it happen! The 
ISA.22.18	Then he will make you like a ball; he will make you like a ball. Then he will throw you like a ball into a wide country. You will die there. There your great 
ISA.22.19	I will remove you from your job. And he will throw you down from the place where you are an officer.’ 
ISA.22.20	‘And this is what will happen in that day. I will tell my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah that he must come.
ISA.22.21	And I will put on him your special clothes, (Shebna) and I will tie your special belt round him. And I will give your authority to him. Then Eliakim will become like a father to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to the people in Judah.
ISA.22.22	And I will put the key of the family of David on his shoulder. What he opens, nobody will close. What he closes, nobody will open.
ISA.22.23	And I will fix him in his place like a strong 
ISA.22.24	But the whole weight of his father's family will seem to hang on him like that 
ISA.22.25	This is what the 
ISA.23.1	This is a serious message about Tyre.
ISA.23.1	Cry aloud, you people in the ships that go to Tarshish. An enemy has destroyed it. There is not one house to return to. They heard about it in the country called Cyprus.
ISA.23.2	Weep, you people who live on the island. Weep, you 
ISA.23.4	You people who live in Sidon, be ashamed. Be ashamed, because the sea has spoken. The people in the power of the sea, (Tyre), have said, ‘Our city has not been 
ISA.23.5	When the people in Egypt receive the news, they will be in a lot of pain at the report from Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish! Cry aloud, you people who live on the island.
ISA.23.7	This is the city where you had many parties. It is old, very old. Some people from this city walked a long way to live in foreign countries.
ISA.23.8	People do not know who made those 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Travel through your country, people in Tarshish, as easily as the people in Egypt travel along the River Nile. Travel because now, nobody will stop you.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.12	Then he said, ‘Do not continue your parties. The enemy has been cruel to you, you people who live in Sidon. Get up! Cross over to Cyprus. Even there you will not find rest for yourselves.’
ISA.23.13	Look at the country called Babylon! Its people are all dead! The armies from Assyria made it a place for wild animals to live in. They (the men from Assyria) built small mountains of earth. Then they climbed on them so that they could attack it. They took everything away from its strong buildings and they destroyed Babylon.
ISA.23.14	Cry aloud, you ships of Tarshish. Your enemies have destroyed your strong port.
ISA.23.15	At that time people will forget Tyre for 70 years. That is how long one king lives. At the end of 70 years something will happen to Tyre. It is like the song about the 
ISA.23.16	‘
ISA.23.16	walk about the city with your 
ISA.23.16	Play it well. Sing many songs.
ISA.23.16	Then people will remember you again.’
ISA.23.17	At the end of 70 years the 
ISA.23.18	And this will happen: All the money that Tyre gets and all the 
ISA.24.1	Understand this! The 
ISA.24.2	It will be the same for all these people:
ISA.24.2	· the people and the 
ISA.24.2	· the servant and his master
ISA.24.2	· the girl who is a servant and her 
ISA.24.2	· the buyer and the seller
ISA.24.2	· the lender and the 
ISA.24.2	· the person who has lent money and the person who has 
ISA.24.3	Enemies will completely destroy the land. They will take everything from it. The 
ISA.24.4	The land will be dry and it will die. The world will become weak and it will die. The important people in the country will become weak.
ISA.24.5	The people who live in the country have made it like something dirty. That happened for these reasons:
ISA.24.5	· They have not obeyed God's rules.
ISA.24.5	· They have changed God's rules.
ISA.24.5	· They have decided to forget God's 
ISA.24.6	That is why a 
ISA.24.7	There is no 
ISA.24.8	The happy sound of the 
ISA.24.9	People do not sing because they cannot drink 
ISA.24.10	Enemies have destroyed the city so that it is without shape. People locked every house so that the enemy could not get in.
ISA.24.11	People shout for 
ISA.24.12	Enemies have destroyed the city. They knocked down the gates of the city and they destroyed them.
ISA.24.13	This will happen through all the country and among other countries. They will be empty like an 
ISA.24.14	There are people who shout aloud with their 
ISA.24.15	So 
ISA.24.16	From every part of the country we hear songs that 
ISA.24.16	But I said, ‘I have become thin and weak! I have become thin and weak! So I am very sad! Bad people are doing bad things. Yes, the bad people are being really very bad!’
ISA.24.17	People in the country, 
ISA.24.18	The person who runs away from the sound of 
ISA.24.19	All those things have completely broken the land. They have torn the land into pieces. They have moved the land very much.
ISA.24.20	The earth walks like a man who is a drunk. It moves about like a 
ISA.24.21	On that day, the 
ISA.24.22	The 
ISA.24.23	The 
ISA.25.2	And you have broken the city into a hill of stones. You have destroyed the strong city. The strong city that foreign people live in has gone. Nobody will build it again. 
ISA.25.3	So, a strong country will 
ISA.25.4	That is because you 
ISA.25.5	And the storm was like heat in a dry sandy place. You, 
ISA.25.6	The 
ISA.25.7	And on this mountain the 
ISA.25.8	He will destroy death for always. The 
ISA.25.9	On that day they will say, ‘Look! This is our God! We wanted him to make us safe. And so we have waited for him to come. This is the 
ISA.25.10	The power of the 
ISA.25.11	And the people from Moab will put their hands into it. They will be like a swimmer who puts out his hands in the water. They may be clever with their hands. But they will go down like someone who cannot swim.
ISA.25.12	And the 
ISA.26.1	In that day, people will sing this song in the country called Judah.
ISA.26.1	‘We have a strong city. The 
ISA.26.2	‘Open the gates of the city, so that the 
ISA.26.3	You, 
ISA.26.4	Always, always believe the 
ISA.26.5	He brings down low the people who live in 
ISA.26.6	Feet will walk on it. The feet of the poor people and of the weak people will walk over it.’
ISA.26.7	The path that 
ISA.26.8	Yes, 
ISA.26.9	My mind wants you in the night time and my 
ISA.26.10	Bad people will not learn, if nobody 
ISA.26.14	Now the other 
ISA.26.18	We were going to have a baby. We could not keep still and we cried with the pain. But only wind came out! We have not made the earth safe. And no new people have been born who can live on the earth.
ISA.26.19	But your dead people will live again. Their bodies will rise up from the 
ISA.26.20	My people, go into your rooms and shut the doors behind you. Hide yourselves for a short time, until the 
ISA.26.21	Look, the 
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	‘In that day, sing about a field where 
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.4	I am not angry. If there were 
ISA.27.5	Or he should 
ISA.27.6	The days will come when 
ISA.27.7	The 
ISA.27.9	So this is how Jacob will be sorry because of his 
ISA.27.10	Then the strong city will be empty. Everybody who lived there will leave it. It will be like a dry sandy place. Nobody will go there. Young cows will eat the grass and they will lie down there. They will eat everything on the branches of the trees.
ISA.27.11	When their branches become dry, people will break them off the trees. The women will come and they will make fires with them. That will happen because these people do not understand things. So, their 
ISA.27.12	And in that day this will happen. The 
ISA.27.13	And in that day this will happen. Someone will make a sound on a big 
ISA.28.1	There will be a very sad day in 
ISA.28.2	Look! The 
ISA.28.3	His feet will walk on the 
ISA.28.4	And 
ISA.28.5	In that day the 
ISA.28.6	The 
ISA.28.7	But 
ISA.28.8	They are sick over all their tables. And there is nowhere that is not dirty.
ISA.28.9	(They say,) ‘He is teaching what he knows to us! He is explaining his message to us! He thinks that we are babies! And he thinks that we have just stopped drinking milk! He thinks that we have just come from our mother's breast!
ISA.28.10	His message is like this: “One rule after another rule. One rule after another rule. One group of words after another group of words. One group of words after another group of words. A little here, a little there.” ’
ISA.28.11	So, with foreign lips and a strange language the 
ISA.28.12	He said to these people, ‘This is a place to rest. Let the tired people rest.’ And he said, ‘This is a place to be quiet in.’ But they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	So then, the 
ISA.28.14	So, listen to the 
ISA.28.15	What you are really saying is this. ‘We have made a 
ISA.28.16	So the 
ISA.28.17	Do what is right and fair. If you do those things, I will help you. But if not, the rain of ice will carry away the 
ISA.28.18	I will stop your 
ISA.28.19	Every time that it comes to you, it will carry you away. Certainly, every morning, any day and any night, it might come over you. And, if you understand the message, then you will be very much afraid.’
ISA.28.20	(You know what people say.) ‘The bed is so short that you cannot lie in it. The blanket is so narrow that you cannot put it round yourself.’
ISA.28.21	But the 
ISA.28.22	So, do not laugh in a bad way at me. If you do laugh at me, your 
ISA.28.23	Listen. And hear me when I speak! Listen to me. And hear what I am saying!
ISA.28.24	The farmer ploughs because he wants to plant seeds. But he does not plough every day. He does not always break his ground into small pieces.
ISA.28.25	When he has made the ground flat, he plants 
ISA.28.26	His God teaches him. And his God tells him the right thing to do.
ISA.28.27	Farmers do not remove 
ISA.28.28	But they do use a special machine to get 
ISA.28.29	The 
ISA.29.1	There will be a very sad day in 
ISA.29.2	But I will bring trouble to 
ISA.29.3	And I will do these things: My army will attack you. They will be in a circle round you. I will put an army against you on every side. I will build things against you to attack you.
ISA.29.4	Then you will become 
ISA.29.5	But your enemies will become like many small bits of dirt. And the crowds of cruel soldiers will be like dead bits of a plant in the wind. That is because, in a moment,
ISA.29.6	the 
ISA.29.7	That will happen to all the many countries that attack 
ISA.29.8	It will be like a hungry man who dreams. He dreams that he is eating something. But, look! He wakes and he is still hungry! Or it will be like a 
ISA.29.9	That will hit you so that you become like fools. And you will not believe it! You will become 
ISA.29.10	No, it will be because the 
ISA.29.11	And all this 
ISA.29.12	Or, give the book to someone who cannot read. Say, ‘Read it, please.’ But he will answer, ‘I do not know how to read.’
ISA.29.13	The 
ISA.29.14	‘So watch it happen! I will surprise these people again. I will surprise them again and again! Some people can rightly use what they know. But they will not be able to. The people with good minds will not be able to use them.’
ISA.29.15	There will be a very sad day for those people who do these things:
ISA.29.15	· They really try to hide from the 
ISA.29.15	· They work in dark places.
ISA.29.15	· And they say, ‘Nobody knows us.’
ISA.29.15	· And they say, ‘Nobody sees us.’
ISA.29.16	You turn things the wrong way up! In your minds, you confuse the 
ISA.29.17	In a very short time, (the country called) Lebanon will become a garden of fruit trees. And Carmel will be like a forest.
ISA.29.18	At that time, people who could not hear will hear. They will hear someone who is reading words from a book. And people who could not see will see. And they will not remain in shadows and in the dark.
ISA.29.19	And the 
ISA.29.20	That is because cruel people will go. People who laugh in a bad way at God will not appear anywhere. And the 
ISA.29.21	Those bad people do these things:
ISA.29.21	· They say that a man has done something wrong with only a word.
ISA.29.21	· They make a 
ISA.29.21	· And they do not let a man who has not done anything wrong get a fair result.
ISA.29.22	So this is what the 
ISA.29.23	They will see their children, which my hands made, among them. Then they will 
ISA.29.24	Also, people whose minds are confused will understand things. Some people always say that something is wrong. But then, they will be happy to learn things.’
ISA.30.1	‘It is a very sad day for children who do not obey their father’, says the 
ISA.30.2	They hurry to go down to Egypt. But they do not ask me what to do. They ask for 
ISA.30.3	But 
ISA.30.4	Their leaders have arrived in Zoan and their people with authority have gone to Hanes.’ 
ISA.30.5	‘The people (in Egypt) will not be able to help them. So everyone will be ashamed. They will not bring any help to you. They will not really bring any help to you. They will only make you very much more ashamed.’
ISA.30.6	Here are sad words about the animals that go through the 
ISA.30.6	· 
ISA.30.6	· snakes and dangerous snakes that fly.
ISA.30.6	Here they (the leaders of Judah) carry their valuable things on the backs of horses. And they carry their very valuable things on the backs of other animals. They do that on behalf of people who cannot help them!
ISA.30.7	Egypt is like an empty place. The people there will not send any help. So, I call Egypt ‘Rahab who does not do anything.’
ISA.30.8	Now go! Write it down on a piece of stone for them. Also, write it in a book. Then, in future days, it will always be there to read.
ISA.30.9	These people are people who do not obey the 
ISA.30.10	They say to the 
ISA.30.11	Leave this path. Get off this road. Do not hold the 
ISA.30.12	So, this is what the 
ISA.30.13	So this will happen. This 
ISA.30.14	The 
ISA.30.15	Now this is what the 
ISA.30.16	So you said, ‘No! We will run away on horses.’ So you will run away. You said ‘We will ride away very quickly.’ So the people who run after you will move quickly.
ISA.30.17	A thousand men will run away from only one enemy. You will all run away from 5 of them! They will leave you like a sign on the top of the mountain, or like a 
ISA.30.18	So the 
ISA.30.19	Yes! You people of 
ISA.30.20	In past years, the 
ISA.30.21	And your ears will hear a word near you, but behind you. When you turn to the right or to the left it will say, ‘This is the way. Walk in it.’ 
ISA.30.22	And you will not use your 
ISA.30.23	The 
ISA.30.24	And the cows and the horses that work on the ground will eat the best food for animals. Farmers will use a big farm-fork and a spade to give it to them. 
ISA.30.25	And on every tall mountain and on every high hill, water will come down in streams. That will happen on the day when high buildings fall. And many people will die. 
ISA.30.26	Also, the moon will shine as bright as the sun. And the light of the sun will be 7 times brighter. It will be like the light of 7 days at the same time! That will happen when the 
ISA.30.27	Look! The 
ISA.30.28	From his mouth comes something that is like a lot of water. It will reach up to a person's neck. He moves the people from many countries so that they become separate. And then he will destroy those 
ISA.30.29	And you (my people) will sing! It will be like the nights of your important 
ISA.30.30	Then the 
ISA.30.31	The voice of the 
ISA.30.32	He will hit them with his stick. He will use his stick to 
ISA.30.33	The 
ISA.31.1	It will be a sad day for those people who go down to Egypt. They want help and horses from Egypt. They think that 
ISA.31.2	But the 
ISA.31.3	The men in Egypt are only men. They are not God. Their horses are animals, not 
ISA.31.4	This is what the 
ISA.31.5	The 
ISA.31.6	People of Israel, turn back to the 
ISA.31.7	Turn back to him because in that day everyone must throw away their gold and 
ISA.31.8	A 
ISA.31.9	‘(The king of Assyria, who is like) their rock, will run away. He will run away because he is very afraid. And the leaders (of his army) will run away because they are all afraid of the war 
ISA.32.1	A king will be a good 
ISA.32.2	Then each leader will be like a place to hide from the wind. And he will be like someone who covers us from the storm. He will be like streams of water in a dry place. And he will be like the shadow of a big rock in very dry land.
ISA.32.3+ISA.32.4	Now think about these things:
ISA.32.3+ISA.32.4	· The eyes of people who see will never shut.
ISA.32.3+ISA.32.4	· And the ears of people who hear will really listen.
ISA.32.3+ISA.32.4	· Some people are too quick to speak. But then, those people will wait to understand.
ISA.32.3+ISA.32.4	· And the 
ISA.32.5	Then they will not again call a fool clever. They will not say that a 
ISA.32.6	A fool says silly things and his mind thinks about bad things:
ISA.32.6	· He does things that are against God's rules.
ISA.32.6	· He says wrong things about the 
ISA.32.6	· He does not give food to hungry people.
ISA.32.6	· And he does not give a drink to 
ISA.32.7	The things that a 
ISA.32.8	But a good person wants to do good things. Also, he does the good things that he promised to do.
ISA.32.9	You women who have no problems, get ready. Listen to my voice. You ladies who feel very safe, hear my words to you.
ISA.32.10	In less than a year, you women who feel very safe will 
ISA.32.12	Hit your breasts for these reasons.
ISA.32.12	There are no good fields.
ISA.32.12	The 
ISA.32.13	And the ground where our people work gives only plants with 
ISA.32.13	Yes, do it because there are no happy homes in the happy city.
ISA.32.14	It is a fact that the king will go from his beautiful house. The city where many people live will be empty. The hill (in Jerusalem) and the tall building, where people watch for enemies, will always be homes for animals. They will be a happy place for wild horses to live in. And there will be fields there where groups of animals eat the grass.
ISA.32.15	That will happen until God pours his Spirit on us from above the earth. Then, the wild places will become gardens and the gardens will become forests.
ISA.32.16	Then people will decide fairly in the wild places. And they will do good things in the fields that contain plenty of fruit.
ISA.32.17	And when people do good things, there will be no war. When people do good things there will be a quiet and safe time. It will continue for a long time.
ISA.32.18	My people will live in a place where there is no war. Their homes will be safe and they will sleep without pain.
ISA.32.19+ISA.32.20	Ice may knock down the trees in the forest. But, even then, people who plant seeds by the stream will be happy. Even if a storm completely destroys the city, they will let their cows and horses go to the fields freely.
ISA.33.1	It will be very sad for you, the country that destroys other countries. No other country has destroyed you, yet. It will be sad for you, the country that is not honest with other countries. No other country has not been honest with you yet. But when you stop destroying other countries, one country will destroy you. And when you stop not being honest with other countries, they will not be honest with you.
ISA.33.3	At the sound of a voice, people run away. When you go to war, the people in other countries run away.
ISA.33.4	People get things together after a war, as a 
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	He will make your lives safe and you will keep your money. Here are the valuable things that he gives to you:
ISA.33.6	· You will have the right answers for questions.
ISA.33.6	· You will know everything that you need to know.
ISA.33.6	· You will be properly afraid of the 
ISA.33.7	Look! The brave men from Jerusalem weep in the streets. Officers went (to Assyria). They asked for the war to stop. Now they cry very sad 
ISA.33.8	The important roads are empty and nobody travels on the smaller roads. The enemy stopped the 
ISA.33.9	The land itself is very sad and it is becoming dry. Lebanon is ashamed and it is dying. Sharon is like a sandy place and the leaves in Bashan and Carmel are dying.
ISA.33.10	The 
ISA.33.11	You make dry grass and you call it straw. Your own 
ISA.33.12	It will burn the bones of people to make 
ISA.33.13	You people who are a long way from here, listen. Listen to what I have done! And you people who are near, understand. Understand that I am very powerful.’
ISA.33.14	The 
ISA.33.15	The answer is the person who is like this:
ISA.33.15	· He is very good. And he speaks what is right.
ISA.33.15	· He is never cruel to people to get money from them.
ISA.33.15	· His hands will not accept money to do wrong things.
ISA.33.15	· He closes his ears against ideas to kill people.
ISA.33.15	· And he shuts his eyes, so that he does not think about bad things.
ISA.33.16	That person will be the person who lives on high places. That person's safe place will be in the rocks. People like that will always have food and their drink will not stop.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see that the king is beautiful. Your eyes will see a country that reaches to places a long way from here.
ISA.33.18	Your mind will think about when you were afraid. You will say, ‘The enemy-officer who counted things has gone! The man who weighed everything has gone! The man who counted high buildings has gone!’
ISA.33.19	You will never see those cruel people again. They speak words that you cannot understand. Their language is strange and you cannot understand it.
ISA.33.20	Look at 
ISA.33.21	It is there (in Jerusalem) that the 
ISA.33.22	The 
ISA.33.23	The 
ISA.33.24	Nobody who lives in 
ISA.34.1	Come near to me, you people in all countries, and listen to me.
ISA.34.1	All you people, think about what I am saying to you.
ISA.34.1	Hear me, all the earth, and everything that is in it.
ISA.34.1	Listen, all the world, and all that comes from it.
ISA.34.2	Yes! The 
ISA.34.2	And he is right to be very angry against all their armies.
ISA.34.2	The 
ISA.34.2	He will send them to their deaths.
ISA.34.3	Nobody will bury the dead bodies.
ISA.34.3	The dead bodies will fill the air with a very bad smell.
ISA.34.3	Their blood will go down on the mountains.
ISA.34.4	And every army in the skies will be like water.
ISA.34.4	And the skies will close up like a book.
ISA.34.4	And all their armies will fall
ISA.34.4	like leaves that fall from a 
ISA.34.4	They will fall like the fruit called figs from a fig tree.
ISA.34.5	When my 
ISA.34.5	it will come down on Edom.
ISA.34.5	There are people there that I have decided to kill.
ISA.34.5	My 
ISA.34.6	The 
ISA.34.6	He will put it into blood. He will cover it with meat.
ISA.34.6	It is the blood of young sheep and goats.
ISA.34.6	It is the meat from inside male sheep.
ISA.34.6	Yes! The 
ISA.34.6	He will kill many people in the country called Edom. 
ISA.34.7	And wild cows will fall with them.
ISA.34.7	Young male cows will die with old cows.
ISA.34.7	Blood will go into their land.
ISA.34.7	Meat will go into their earth.
ISA.34.8	The 
ISA.34.8	And he is right to do that.
ISA.34.8	It will be a year when the 
ISA.34.8	And it will be a year when he 
ISA.34.9	The streams in sandy places in Edom will turn into 
ISA.34.9	Its ground will turn into 
ISA.34.9	Its land will become 
ISA.34.10	Nobody will put out the fire in the day or in the night.
ISA.34.10	Smoke from the fire will rise up for a long time.
ISA.34.10	The land will be empty from one century to the next century.
ISA.34.10	Nobody will ever pass through it again.
ISA.34.11	But lots of 
ISA.34.11	And 
ISA.34.11	And the 
ISA.34.11	It will make it without shape.
ISA.34.11	He will pull over it a special line that will make it empty.
ISA.34.12	Edom's leaders will have nothing there that they can call a 
ISA.34.12	And all its officers will 
ISA.34.13	And 
ISA.34.13	Weeds and 
ISA.34.13	The country will be a home for 
ISA.34.14	Wild animals and 
ISA.34.14	And wild goats will make a noise to each other.
ISA.34.14	Also, the bad female 
ISA.34.14	And she will find for herself a place in which to stay.
ISA.34.15	The 
ISA.34.15	And she will keep her eggs there until they become baby birds.
ISA.34.15	And she will keep them safe under the shadow of her 
ISA.34.16	Look in the 
ISA.34.16	‘They will all be there.
ISA.34.16	Not one of them will be without her 
ISA.34.16	The 
ISA.34.16	And his 
ISA.34.17	The 
ISA.34.17	And his hand will give those places to them with the line that measures.
ISA.34.17	They will have that country always.
ISA.34.17	They will live in it from one century to the next century.’
ISA.35.1	The sandy place and the dry land will be happy.
ISA.35.1	The wild places will feel happy and flowers will grow there.
ISA.35.2	Many flowers will appear quickly in those places.
ISA.35.2	The land will be very happy.
ISA.35.2	So it will seem to sing. And it will seem to shout aloud!
ISA.35.2	It will be as beautiful as Lebanon.
ISA.35.2	It will seem like places in Carmel and in Sharon.
ISA.35.2	Those places will see the 
ISA.35.2	They will see that our God is very, very great.
ISA.35.3	Make your weak hands strong.
ISA.35.3	Make the knees that will not hold you up strong.
ISA.35.4	Say to the people who are very much afraid,
ISA.35.4	‘Be strong! Do not be afraid! Your God will come.
ISA.35.4	He will come to 
ISA.35.4	He will come and he will save you.’
ISA.35.5	Then he will open the eyes of people who are cannot see.
ISA.35.5	And he will make well the ears of people who cannot hear.
ISA.35.6	Then people who cannot walk now will jump like 
ISA.35.6	And people who cannot speak now will shout.
ISA.35.6	That will be because they are very happy.
ISA.35.6	Yes! God will pour water into the wild, dry places.
ISA.35.6	And he will pour streams of water into the sandy places.
ISA.35.7	Then the hot sand will become a pool of water.
ISA.35.7	And water will come up from the ground that is very dry.
ISA.35.7	In the places where 
ISA.35.8	And there will be a high road there, a way.
ISA.35.8	Its name will be ‘The 
ISA.35.8	People who are 
ISA.35.8	It will be for those people who walk on the Way.
ISA.35.8	Fools who are very bad people will not walk on it.
ISA.35.9	No 
ISA.35.9	No dangerous wild animals will walk on it.
ISA.35.9	Nobody will find those animals there.
ISA.35.9	But people that the 
ISA.35.10	And the people that the 
ISA.35.10	And they will sing while they go into 
ISA.35.10	And they will never stop enjoying themselves. It will show on their faces.
ISA.35.10	Everywhere that they go they will be very, very happy.
ISA.36.1	King Hezekiah had ruled Judah for nearly 14 years. Then, King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the cities in Judah that had high, strong walls. He became the ruler of all the cities except Jerusalem and they became his. 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent the leader of his soldiers from Lachish. He came to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The leader had a large army with him. He stopped at the stream of water that went from the higher pool. It was on the road, near the place where people wash clothes.
ISA.36.3	And these people came out to meet him:
ISA.36.3	· Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah. He was the most important servant in the king's beautiful house.
ISA.36.3	· Shebna, the leader of the government.
ISA.36.3	· Joah, the son of Asaph. He was the king's writer.
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	And the soldiers' leader said to those men, ‘Now please say this to Hezekiah. This is what the Great King, the king of Assyria, says to you:
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· “You should not believe that you will be safe!
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· Words cannot tell you what you should do!
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· And they cannot give to you the power that you need for war!
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· You want to fight against me.
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· Perhaps you think that someone will help you.
ISA.36.4+ISA.36.5	· But I do not know anyone who will help you!
ISA.36.6	Think about it! I know that you are hoping for help from Egypt. But Egypt is like a stick that people use. It helps them to walk. But it will break! If you push on it, it will go into your hand, like a sharp piece of 
ISA.36.7	But you might say to me, ‘We are 
ISA.36.8	And now’, said Rabshakeh, the leader, ‘agree today with my master, who is the king of Assyria. And I will give you 2000 horses, if you can put 2000 riders on them! 
ISA.36.9	You cannot beat any officer who works for my master. You could not beat that officer even if every other officer was more important than him. But you are still hoping that Egypt will send 
ISA.36.10	And there is something else. Surely I would not attack and destroy this country without help from the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah spoke to Rabshakeh. They said, ‘Please, speak to your servants in the Aramaic language, because we do understand it. Do not speak to us in 
ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh said, ‘My master did not send me to say these things only to you and to your master. He sent me to say them to these people too. I mean these people who are sitting on the wall of the city. Like you, they will have to eat the material that their own body wastes. And they will have to drink the water that their own body wastes.’
ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood up. He shouted in a loud voice in 
ISA.36.14	This is what the king of Assyria says to you. “Do not let Hezekiah tell you what is not true. Hezekiah cannot save you. 
ISA.36.15	And do not let Hezekiah cause you to 
ISA.36.16	Do not listen to Hezekiah! And do not obey him!” This is what the king of Assyria says to you. “Do not have a war with me. Come out of your city to me. Then you will all eat the 
ISA.36.17	Do that until I come to you. Then I will take you away to a country like your own country. It is a country where 
ISA.36.18	Do not listen to Hezekiah and do not obey him. He will be like a man who leads you the wrong way. He says that the 
ISA.36.19	The gods (of the cities called) Hamath and Arpad could not help them. The gods (of the city called) Sepharvaim could not help it. None of those gods saved Samaria. 
ISA.36.20	None of those gods has saved his own country from my power. Can the 
ISA.36.21	But the people were quiet and they did not answer him one word. They did that because King (Hezekiah) had said, ‘Do not answer him.’
ISA.36.22	Then these people came to Hezekiah:
ISA.36.22	· Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah. He was the most important servant in the king's beautiful house.
ISA.36.22	· Shebna, the leader of the government.
ISA.36.22	· Joah, the son of Asaph. He was the king's writer.
ISA.36.22	They tore their clothes. And they told the king all the words that Rabshakeh had said.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard the report of his servants, he tore his clothes. Then he put on cheap hairy cloth and he went into the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim and Shebna and the leaders of the 
ISA.37.3	And they told Isaiah, ‘This is what Hezekiah says. “There are many problems at this time. It is a time to be ashamed. The problems are like a child who is ready for its birth. But its mother is not strong enough for it to be born. 
ISA.37.4	Perhaps the 
ISA.37.5	So Hezekiah's servants came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, ‘Tell your master that the 
ISA.37.7	Listen to me! I will put a 
ISA.37.8	Then, the king of Assyria left the city called Lachish. People told Rabshakeh that the king had left Lachish. So Rabshakeh left Jerusalem and he found the king of Assyria. The king was fighting against the city called Libnah. 
ISA.37.9	Then people told the king of Assyria this about Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia. They said, ‘He has come out from Ethiopia to fight against you.’ And when they said that to the king of Assyria, he sent people to Jerusalem with a message. They had this message for King Hezekiah. 
ISA.37.10	‘Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah. Say, “You are hoping that your God will help you. But do not let your God tell you what is not true. Your God says that the king of Assyria will not destroy Jerusalem. 
ISA.37.11	But you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. They destroyed them completely. And your God will not save you. 
ISA.37.12	The gods of those other countries did not save them. My 
ISA.37.13	The kings of Hamath and Arpad have gone. The king of the city called Sepharvaim has gone. And the kings of Hena and Ivvah have gone.” ’
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the people who brought the message. And he read it and then he went up to the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the 
ISA.37.16	‘
ISA.37.17	, turn your ears to me and hear me. 
ISA.37.18	It is true, 
ISA.37.19	They threw their gods into the fire. They destroyed them because they were not really gods. Human hands made them from wood and stone. 
ISA.37.20	So now, our 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah, who was the son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah. ‘This is what the 
ISA.37.22	this is what the 
ISA.37.22	“The 
ISA.37.22	she does not like you; she laughs at you.
ISA.37.22	The Daughter of Jerusalem,
ISA.37.22	she moves her head about after you.
ISA.37.23	Who is it that you have said bad things about? They were not true!
ISA.37.23	Who is it that you have shouted at?
ISA.37.23	Who is it that you have looked at 
ISA.37.23	The answer is the 
ISA.37.24	You have used your servants to say bad things about the 
ISA.37.24	You have said, ‘With many of my 
ISA.37.24	I have gone up very high mountains,
ISA.37.24	the highest mountains in Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I have cut down its tallest 
ISA.37.24	and I have cut down the best of its 
ISA.37.24	I went to its highest places and to its best forests.
ISA.37.25	I dug wells and I drank the water from them.
ISA.37.25	I made all the rivers in Egypt dry with the parts under my feet.’
ISA.37.26	You said that but surely, you have heard this!
ISA.37.26	I decided what to do a long time ago!” says the 
ISA.37.26	“I decided what to do in past years!
ISA.37.26	Now it has happened.
ISA.37.26	You have caused strong cities to become mountains of stones.
ISA.37.27	The people in them are not strong.
ISA.37.27	They are not happy. And they are confused.
ISA.37.27	They are like plants in a field.
ISA.37.27	They are like the new parts of young green plants.
ISA.37.27	They are like grass on the roof of a house.
ISA.37.27	The hot winds burn them before they can grow.
ISA.37.28	I know everything about you.
ISA.37.28	I know when you sit down.
ISA.37.28	And I know when you go out.
ISA.37.28	And I know when you come in.
ISA.37.28	And I know when you shout 
ISA.37.29	You have shouted 
ISA.37.29	and you have said bad things about me.
ISA.37.29	So I will put my 
ISA.37.29	And I will put my 
ISA.37.29	And I will cause you to return home by the same way that you came.”
ISA.37.30	And this will be a sign for you, Hezekiah.
ISA.37.30	“This year, you will eat what grows from its own seeds.
ISA.37.30	And in the second year, you will eat what grows from the first year's seeds.
ISA.37.30	But in the third year you will plant seeds and you will pick plants for food.
ISA.37.30	And you will plant again the 
ISA.37.31	And this will happen also to the people who remain in Judah.
ISA.37.31	They will be like plants that put 
ISA.37.32	That will happen because a 
ISA.37.32	And the people who remain will come out from 
ISA.37.32	The 
ISA.37.33	This is what the 
ISA.37.33	“He will not come into this city,
ISA.37.33	and he will not shoot an 
ISA.37.33	He will not stand in front of it with a 
ISA.37.33	He will not build mountains of earth against it.
ISA.37.34	He will return to Assyria by the way that he came,
ISA.37.34	and he will not come into this city.”
ISA.37.34	That is the promise of the 
ISA.37.35	“So I will make this city safe and I will save it.
ISA.37.35	I will do that to keep my good name.
ISA.37.35	I promised my servant David that I would do it. That is why I will do it.” ’
ISA.37.36	Then an 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib, who was the king of Assyria, took his army away. He returned to Assyria and he stayed there in Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	He was 
ISA.38.1	At that time, Hezekiah was very ill. He nearly died. And Isaiah the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and he prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	And he said, ‘Please remember, 
ISA.38.4	Then the 
ISA.38.5	‘Go and say this to Hezekiah. “This is what the 
ISA.38.6	I will save you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria. And, I will keep this city (Jerusalem) safe.” ’ 
ISA.38.7	And Isaiah said, ‘The 
ISA.38.8	You can see the shadow of the sun when it falls on the stairs. They are the stairs that King Ahaz built. I will cause the shadow to go back ten steps on these stairs.’ And the shadow did go back ten steps!
ISA.38.9	This is a 
ISA.38.10	I said, ‘I hope that I will not really go through the gates of 
ISA.38.10	I hope that death will not take from me my other years.’
ISA.38.11	I said, ‘I will not see the 
ISA.38.11	I will not live on this earth and see the 
ISA.38.11	I will never see these people again.
ISA.38.11	I will never be with the people who are living in this world.
ISA.38.12	The 
ISA.38.12	He did it as easily as someone packs away the 
ISA.38.12	He has caused my life to come to an end.
ISA.38.12	It is like when someone finishes making a carpet. He rolls it up.
ISA.38.12	It is like when someone has made some cloth.
ISA.38.12	He cuts it away from the machine that he made the cloth with.
ISA.38.12	In a day and in a night God brought me to my end.
ISA.38.13	I waited quietly until the dawn.
ISA.38.13	Then, like a 
ISA.38.13	In a day and in a night God brought me to my end.
ISA.38.14	I cried like a 
ISA.38.14	I made a sad noise like a 
ISA.38.14	My eyes became weak while I looked to the skies.
ISA.38.15	I do not know what I can say. The 
ISA.38.15	And the 
ISA.38.15	I will live quietly, because I felt so sad inside me.
ISA.38.16	By all these things, my 
ISA.38.16	You gave my health back to me and you have let me live.
ISA.38.17	Really, it was good for me to have such trouble.
ISA.38.17	Your love did not let the 
ISA.38.17	because you threw all my 
ISA.38.18	People who are in 
ISA.38.18	Dead people cannot sing and they cannot 
ISA.38.18	People who go down to the 
ISA.38.19	People who are alive and not dead can thank you.
ISA.38.19	I am doing it today.
ISA.38.19	A father tells his children about your love.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	Then we will sing in the 
ISA.38.20	We will sing with the music of 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah said this earlier. ‘Make a hot cake of 
ISA.38.22	And Hezekiah had asked, ‘What will show me that I will be able to go up to the 
ISA.39.1	When those things happened, Merodach-Baladan was the king of Babylon. He was the son of Baladan. Merodach-Baladan sent Hezekiah letters and a gift. People had told him that Hezekiah was ill. But now people told him that Hezekiah was better. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was happy to meet the officers from the king of Babylon. Hezekiah showed to them the places where he stored his valuable things. He showed to them what was there. He showed to them 
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the 
ISA.39.4	And Isaiah asked, ‘What did they see in your house?’ So Hezekiah said, ‘They saw everything that is in my house. There is nothing among my valuable things that I did not show to them.’ 
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‘Hear what the 
ISA.39.6	“This is what will certainly happen. Soldiers from Babylon will take everything that is in your beautiful house to Babylon. They will take everything that your 
ISA.39.7	“And some of your own sons, your grandsons and their sons, too, will go to Babylon. Soldiers from Babylon will cause them to go there. And they will become 
ISA.39.8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, ‘The words that you said from the 
ISA.40.1	‘Say kind words to my people. Say kind words to them’, says your God.
ISA.40.2	‘Speak to the minds of the people in Jerusalem and tell this to them:
ISA.40.2	· Your time as soldiers in a war has finished.
ISA.40.2	· God has 
ISA.40.2	· And the 
ISA.40.3	A voice is shouting, ‘Prepare a road for the 
ISA.40.4	God's servants will raise up the lower parts of every valley. And they will make every mountain and hill lower. The ground that nobody has dug will become like a garden. And they will make the hilly places flat.
ISA.40.5	Then, people will see the 
ISA.40.6	A voice is saying, ‘Shout something aloud!’ But I say, ‘What should I shout?’ The voice answered, ‘Everybody is like grass and all their 
ISA.40.7	Grass will die and a flower will fall to the ground. That will happen because the 
ISA.40.8	Grass will die and a flower will fall to the ground. But a word that our God speaks will be true for all time.
ISA.40.9	You, the servant who is bringing good news to 
ISA.40.10	Look! The 
ISA.40.11	‘He will be like a 
ISA.40.12	Only God has done these things:
ISA.40.12	· He measured all the waters in the sea in one of his hands.
ISA.40.12	· He saw that the skies were as wide as one of his hands.
ISA.40.12	· He put all the dirt of the earth into a bucket.
ISA.40.12	· He weighed the mountains on the 
ISA.40.12	· He weighed the hills in a 
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	There is nobody who has done these things:
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· Nobody understood the mind of the 
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· Nobody, as his helper, told him what he should do.
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· He did not ask anybody to be his 
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· Nobody taught him the proper way to do things.
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· Nobody taught him what things to know about.
ISA.40.13+ISA.40.14	· Nobody showed him the way to understand things.
ISA.40.15	Surely, the countries are like a very small quantity of water in a bucket. They are like small bits of dirt on the 
ISA.40.16	All the trees from Lebanon are not enough to make a fire for his 
ISA.40.17	All the countries in the world are like nothing in front of the 
ISA.40.18	You cannot find anyone else who is like God.
ISA.40.18	You cannot say that he is like any false god.
ISA.40.19	An able man makes a false god. An able worker covers it with gold. He also makes something from 
ISA.40.20	Some people are too poor to give a gift like that. They choose a wood that will not soon fall into pieces. They will look for an able man who will make a false god from the wood. But that false god cannot move.
ISA.40.21	Think about certain things.
ISA.40.21	· You should know certain things.
ISA.40.21	· You should have heard those things.
ISA.40.21	· Somebody should have told them to you from the beginning.
ISA.40.21	· You should have understood them since God made the earth.
ISA.40.22	These are the things: God sits on a special seat where the earth and the sky meet. And the people on the earth seem like small insects to him. He hangs out the skies like a curtain. And he makes them like a 
ISA.40.23	He is the God who makes kings into nothing. He takes away the power from world leaders, so that they have no power.
ISA.40.24	Those leaders are like plants. As soon as somebody plants them, God will blow on them. And as soon as somebody puts them into the ground, they will die. As soon as they put 
ISA.40.25	The 
ISA.40.25	· ‘You cannot say that I am like anybody.
ISA.40.25	· Nobody is as good as (or better than) I am.’
ISA.40.26	Turn your eyes up and look at the skies. He is the God who 
ISA.40.27	You 
ISA.40.28	You surely know this. You surely have listened to it! The 
ISA.40.29	He makes tired people strong and he gives more 
ISA.40.30	Even young people get tired and they lose their 
ISA.40.31	But people who hope for help from the 
ISA.41.1	‘You islands, be quiet when you come to me. And everybody must become strong again. They must move towards the front (of the 
ISA.41.2	The 
ISA.41.2	· The 
ISA.41.2	· The 
ISA.41.2	· The 
ISA.41.2	· The 
ISA.41.3	The man will run after them, but he himself will move on safely. He will go on a path very quickly. His feet will almost not touch the ground while he travels.
ISA.41.4	I am the God who will do those things. And I will cause them to happen’, says the 
ISA.41.5	The people on the islands heard that and they were afraid. It frightened the people at the far places of the earth very much. They came near to each other. They met together.
ISA.41.6	Each country helped another country. Each person said to his brother, ‘Be strong!’
ISA.41.7	The careful worker said good things to the worker who makes things out of gold. The man with a hammer said to another worker, ‘What you have put together is good.’ Then he made the 
ISA.41.8	‘But you, Israel, are my servant. Jacob, I have chosen you. You are the 
ISA.41.9	‘I brought you from the ends of the earth. I brought you from its far corners. I have said, “You are my servant. I have chosen you. I have not refused to let you be my servant.
ISA.41.10	So do not be afraid, because I am with you. Do not be sad, because I am your God. I will make you strong and I will help you. Really, I will hold you with my right hand. It is strong and it wins wars.”
ISA.41.11	Everybody who is angry with you will certainly be ashamed. They will lose their good name. Those who fight you will become like nothing. And they will die.
ISA.41.12	Even if you look for your enemies, you will not find them. The people who fight against you will 
ISA.41.13	That will happen because I am the 
ISA.41.14	Do not be afraid, you 
ISA.41.15	‘Watch this happen! I will cause you to become like a machine that 
ISA.41.16	You will make them into separate small pieces. Then the wind will pick them up and a strong wind will blow them away. But you will be happy with the 
ISA.41.17	Poor people and people who need water look for water. But there is none. Their mouths are dry because they need a drink. I, the 
ISA.41.18	I will make rivers on hills where nothing grows. And I will make wells of water in the valleys. I will make pools of water in the sandy places. And I will make wells where the ground is dry.
ISA.41.19	I will put these kinds of trees into the sandy places: cedar, acacia, myrtle and olive. And I will put together into the 
ISA.41.20	Then people will see that. They will know that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	The 
ISA.41.22	Bring your

ISA.41.27	Remember, I, God was the first person to tell it to 
ISA.41.28	I looked, but there is nobody among the people. They do not have any

ISA.42.16	I will lead 
ISA.42.17	I will turn back people who believe in

ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.22	But an enemy has robbed these people and he has taken things from them. The enemy has caught them all in holes in the ground or he has hidden them in prisons. The enemy took these people and nobody has saved them. They themselves are what the robber took. And nobody said, ‘Send them back.’
ISA.42.23	Not many among you will listen to this! Not many among you will think about it in the future!
ISA.42.24	Who gave 
ISA.42.25	So the 
ISA.43.1	But now, this is what the 
ISA.43.2	I will be with you, when you go through (dangerous) waters. And when you go through rivers they will not carry you away. When you walk through fire it will not burn you. And the fire will not make a fire out of you.
ISA.43.3	I will save you, because I, the 
ISA.43.4	I think that you are valuable and very good. Because of that, and because I love you, I will do this. I will take men for you and I will take people for your life.
ISA.43.5	Do not be afraid, because I am with you. I will bring your people from the east and I will fetch you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will say to people in the north, “Give them back!” And I will say to people in the south, “Do not keep them where they are.” Bring my sons from far places and my daughters from the ends of the earth.
ISA.43.7	Bring everyone who is called by my name. I 
ISA.43.8	Lead out those people with eyes who are

ISA.43.10	You are my 
ISA.43.11	I, only I, am the 
ISA.43.12	It was I, and not a foreign god among you, who showed that to you. And I saved you and I told it to you. You are my 
ISA.43.13	‘Yes! From a long time ago, I am God. Nobody can save himself from my power. When I do something, nobody can change it.’
ISA.43.14	This is what the 
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.16+ISA.43.17	This is what the 
ISA.43.16+ISA.43.17	· He made a road through the sea.
ISA.43.16+ISA.43.17	· He made a path through the great waters.
ISA.43.16+ISA.43.17	· He drew 
ISA.43.16+ISA.43.17	· He caused them to lie there so that they would never get up again. He put them out and he blew them out, like a light.
ISA.43.18	The 
ISA.43.19	Look! I will do something that is new! Now it appears quickly. Surely, you can see it. I am making a road in the sandy places. And I am making streams in the wild places.
ISA.43.20	The wild animals, 
ISA.43.21	They are the people that I made for myself. I did it so that they could 
ISA.43.22	But you did not pray to me, 
ISA.43.23	It was not to me that you brought sheep. You did not burn them to offer them to me. What you put at one side did not 
ISA.43.24	You did not bring any sweet plants for me. You did not give to me large amounts of meat from the animals that you burned. Instead, you caused me to carry your 
ISA.43.25	I, but yes, I am he who sweeps away your 
ISA.43.26	Remember with me what happened a long time ago. We should talk about it together. You think that you have not 
ISA.43.27	Your first

ISA.44.27	I said to the watery deep sea, “Be dry!” And I made your streams dry.
ISA.44.28	I say about Cyrus, “He is like my sheep-farmer. And he will do everything that gives pleasure to me.” Cyrus will say about Jerusalem, “Build it again!” And he will say about the

ISA.45.19	I have not spoken secretly. I have not spoken from somewhere that is a dark country. I did not say to the 
ISA.45.20	Bring yourselves together! And come and put yourselves into a group. You are people who are running away from other countries. Some people carry 
ISA.45.21	Speak! Tell us what will happen! Also, decide this together. Who said a long time ago what would happen? Who said it in past years? It was I, the 
ISA.45.22	Turn to me and I will make you safe. Do that, everybody on the earth. Do that because I am God. I am God and there is no other God.
ISA.45.23	I, myself, have promised something to you. Because I am honest I have said it. I will not change anything that I have said. Everybody will go down on their knees in front of me. And everybody will promise to obey me.
ISA.45.24	People will say this about me. “Only with the

ISA.46.5	No god is like me! 
ISA.46.6	Some people pour out gold from a bag. And they weigh out 
ISA.46.7	They lift it on to their shoulders and they carry it. They put it in its place and it stands there. It cannot move from that place. If anyone shouts out to it, it does not answer. It cannot save anybody from his troubles.
ISA.46.8	Remember this and fix it in your mind. Do not forget it, you people who fight against me.
ISA.46.9	Remember the things that happened a long time ago. I am God and there is no other God. I am God and there is nobody like me.
ISA.46.10	I told you at the beginning what will happen at the end. I told you from a long time ago about future things that will happen. I am the Person who says this: My purpose will not change. And I will do everything that I want to do.
ISA.46.11	I will send someone from the east like a bird that catches small animals. And I will get a man from a country that is a long way from here. He will cause my purposes to happen. I really will do the things that I have promised to do. I have made a

ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people. I made what was mine not clean. I gave them into your power, but you were not kind them. You even made the old people into slaves.
ISA.47.7	You said, “I will always continue to be queen. I will always be queen!” But you did not think about these things. You did not think about what might happen to you.
ISA.47.8	Now, listen to me, you women who love pleasure. You do not say what is true about your 
ISA.47.9	But both of those things will happen to you in one moment. They will happen in only one day. You will lose your children and you will become a

ISA.47.11	Then bad things will happen to you. And you will not know what 
ISA.47.12	So continue with your 
ISA.47.13	All the things that you have learned have made you very tired! The people who look at different parts of the skies should stand up. Those people who study the stars should stand up. They say what will happen each month. Cause them to save you from what will happen to you.
ISA.47.14	Surely, they are like dry grass! Fire will burn them away. They cannot save themselves from the heat of the fires. That is not the wood that will bake their bread. It is not a fire to sit by.
ISA.47.15	That is all that they have done on your behalf. You worked with them since you were children. They were your friends. But now each of them continues to make mistakes. There is nobody to save you.’
ISA.48.1	‘Listen to this, you people of 
ISA.48.2	They even call themselves people who live in the 
ISA.48.3	I told you a long time ago about the things that would soon happen. I myself said that they would happen. And I caused everybody to know about them. Then, quickly, I caused those same things to happen!
ISA.48.4	This is why I did it. I want to cause you to think differently. But that will be difficult. I knew that it would be difficult. It seems that your minds have become like very hard iron! The front of your head seems like 
ISA.48.5	So I told you things a long time ago. Before they happened, I told you about them. Then you could not say, “My 
ISA.48.6	You heard those things. Now look at them all. Agree that I told you about them! From now, I will tell you new things. They will be things that you do not know. They will be things that I hid from you.
ISA.48.7	I 
ISA.48.8	Nobody has told you about them and you have not understood them. From a long time ago your ear has not listened to them. I know well that you do not always obey me. People said that you fought against me from your birth.
ISA.48.9	I will not be angry immediately, because of the name that I have. So that people will 
ISA.48.10	I have made you clean, but not as people make 
ISA.48.11	I do that on behalf of myself, yes, on behalf of myself! Really, I cannot let people say bad things about me. And so, I will not give my 
ISA.48.12	Listen to me, you people of 
ISA.48.13	My own hand put out the parts that are under the earth. And my right hand hung up the skies. When I speak to them, they all stand up together.
ISA.48.14	All of you, come together and listen to me. Not one of your 
ISA.48.15	I, yes, I have spoken. Also, I have asked him to follow me. I will bring him (to Babylon). He will do what he has to do. And he will do it well.
ISA.48.16	Come near to me and listen to this. From the first time that I spoke about it, it was not a secret. When it happens, I will be there.
ISA.48.16	And now the 
ISA.48.17	This is what the 
ISA.48.18	I told you what you should do. You should have listened to what I said. Then your 
ISA.48.19	Your children, and your children's children, would be as many as there are little bits in the sand. I would never forget their names. And I would make it certain that enemies would never destroy their 
ISA.48.20	Leave Babylon! Run from the people in 
ISA.48.21	They did not need a drink when he led them through sandy places. He poured water from a rock for them. He broke the rock and water rushed out.
ISA.48.22	‘There is no

ISA.49.2	And he made my mouth like a sharp 
ISA.49.3	He said to me, ‘You are my servant. You are Israel. In you I will show to everybody that I am beautiful.’
ISA.49.4	But I said that my work had no purpose. I said that I had done all that work for nothing. But the 
ISA.49.5	And now the 
ISA.49.5	· He did it to bring 
ISA.49.5	· Also, he did it to bring Israel to himself.

ISA.49.6	· I will bring back the 
ISA.49.6	· And I will bring together the people from Israel that I have kept alive.
ISA.49.6	I will also make you like a light for the people in other countries. Then you will bring the news that I can save people to the ends of the earth.’
ISA.49.7	This is what the 
ISA.49.8	This is what the 
ISA.49.9	You will say to the people who are in a prison, “Come out.” And you will say to those people who are in the dark, “Be free!”
ISA.49.9	They will eat food at the sides of the roads. And there will be food for them on every empty hill.
ISA.49.10	They will not be hungry and they will not need a drink. The heat of the sun in the sandy places will not hurt them. He who loves them will be their guide. And he will lead them to water that comes up from the ground.
ISA.49.11	I will make all my mountains into roads. And I will build up all my roads on higher ground.
ISA.49.12	Look! People will come from places that are a long way from here. And look! Some people will come from the north and some people will come from the west. Some people will even come from the place called Sinim.’
ISA.49.13	Everything in the skies, shout because you are so happy! Everything on the earth, be very happy! Sing loudly, you mountains! Do that because the 
ISA.49.14	But 
ISA.49.15	(The 
ISA.49.16	Look! I have written your names on my own hands. Your walls (of Jerusalem) are always in front of me.
ISA.49.17	Your sons will hurry back to you. People beat you and they destroyed you. But those people will leave you.
ISA.49.18	Use your eyes and look all round you. All your sons will come together. They will return to you. I am alive’, says the 
ISA.49.19	The enemy broke you and they destroyed you. They made your country empty. But now your country will be too small for your people. The people who destroyed you will be a long way from here.
ISA.49.20	Children were born to you while you were a 
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your mind, “I do not know how these people were born to me. I was a 
ISA.49.22	The 
ISA.49.23	Then kings will be like fathers for you and their queens will be like mothers to your children. They will go down on their knees in front of you. Their faces will look to the ground. And they will taste the dirt by your feet. Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.24	You cannot take things away from strong soldiers. And you cannot save 
ISA.49.25	But this is what the 
ISA.49.26	The people who are cruel to you will eat their own bodies. I will cause them to do that. They will become drunks with their own blood, like it was 
ISA.50.1	The 
ISA.50.2	Nobody was there when I came. Nobody answered when I spoke to my people. My arm was not too short to 
ISA.50.3	I can make the sky dark. And I can cause it to be like I have covered it with hairy cloth.’
ISA.50.4	(The servant says), ‘The 
ISA.50.5	The 
ISA.50.6	I offered my back to the people who hit me. And I offered my face to the people who pulled out my beard. I did not hide my face when they did those things. They laughed in a bad way at me and they

ISA.50.9	Watch this happen! The 
ISA.50.10	Perhaps someone among you is afraid of the 
ISA.50.11	But now, go and walk in the light of your fires. Everyone who has lit a fire must do that. So must everybody who has got for themselves something on fire. You must go in the light of the fires that you have made. This is what you will receive from me. You will lie down in very great pain.

ISA.51.17	Awake, awake! Get up, people in Jerusalem! The 
ISA.51.18	You have had many sons. But among all your sons, there was nobody to be your guide. You have taught many sons. But among all those sons, there was nobody who could lead you by the hand.
ISA.51.19	These two things have destroyed you. I do not know anyone who can make you strong again. An enemy broke all your buildings and they destroyed them. The 
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fallen down. They lie at the end of every street. They are like animals that something has caught. The 
ISA.51.21	So, hear this, you people that God is hurting. You are like drunks. But it is not because you have drunk 
ISA.51.22	The 
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hands of the people who are cruel and 
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake, 
ISA.52.2	Remove the dirt from yourselves. Get up and sit on your special high seat, (Jerusalem). Make yourself free from the

ISA.52.4	And the 
ISA.52.5	And now, this is what I have got here’, says the 
ISA.52.6	So, my people will know my name. So, in that day, my people will know this. I said what would happen. Yes, I said it!’
ISA.52.7	The feet of the people who bring good news will be beautiful. They will be beautiful while they run on the mountains. The people who bring good news will tell you, ‘There is no war and there is no danger.’ They will say to 
ISA.52.8	Listen! The men who watch over your city are saying something. They are so happy that they are all shouting together. When the 
ISA.52.9	Sing aloud together, you places in Jerusalem that the enemy destroyed. Do that because the 
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.11	Leave! Leave! Go out from there. Do not touch anything that is not clean. Go out from inside it! Those people who will carry the

ISA.52.13	Look! Everything that my servant says will be good. It will be right. I will raise him up and I will lift him up to an important place. And I will make him very important.
ISA.52.14	They hit his body, so that it did not seem like the body of a man. They changed his shape, so that it was not like the shape of any human person. And when many people looked at him, they felt sick.
ISA.52.15	But he will surprise the people in many countries! Kings will shut their mouths because of him. Here are the reasons:
ISA.52.15	· They will see things that nobody told them about.
ISA.52.15	· And they will understand things that they have not heard about.
ISA.53.1	It almost seems that nobody has believed our message. And it almost seems that nobody has seen the Arm of the 
ISA.53.2	The Servant grew up in front of him (the 
ISA.53.3	People did not like him. And they caused him to go away. He was a man who often felt very sad. And he knew what pain felt like. He was like someone that people hid their faces from. People did not like him. And we decided that he was not worth anything.
ISA.53.4	Surely, he lifted up our pain from us! And he took away the things that cause us to feel sad. But we thought that he had become ill. We thought that God had hit him very badly. And we thought that he was sick.

ISA.53.10	But it was the 
ISA.53.11	Death will hurt his 
ISA.53.12	So, I will give many peoples to him. And he will have the strong people as his gift. These are the reasons. He poured out his life until he died. He let people count him in with bad people. Also, he carried the 
ISA.54.1	‘Sing, woman who cannot have a child. Sing, you who have never had a baby. Sing a song and shout! Then, you will be very happy! Sing, you, who never had the pain of the birth of a baby. Do that, because the lonely woman will have more sons than the woman with a husband.’ This is what the 
ISA.54.2	‘Make bigger the space that your 
ISA.54.3	Do that, because your land will become larger, both to the right side and to the left side. Your children and their children will cause people to go from their own countries. Your children will live in the empty cities of the people who go away.

ISA.55.5	‘So you too will ask a country that you do not know to come to you. And a country that does not know you will hurry to you. That will happen because the

ISA.55.11	It is the same with the word that I speak. It will not return to me empty. It will do what I want it to do. And it will cause the purpose that I sent it for to happen.

ISA.57.2	A good man dies. Then he goes into a place where there is 
ISA.57.3	But you, come here! You are sons of a woman who does 
ISA.57.4	Tell me whom you are laughing at in a bad way. Tell me about whom you are saying bad things. You push your

ISA.57.6	Your place is among the flat stones in the deep valley. Yes, you should be with them. Yes, you have poured out drink, to offer it to your false gods. And you have offered 
ISA.57.7	You have made your bed on a high and tall hill. You went there to offer things to your false gods.
ISA.57.8	You have put your notice behind your door, where the door opens. But you left me and you opened your bed. You climbed into it and you opened it wide. You agreed with those people whose beds you loved. You saw a hand to help you. 
ISA.57.9	You went to the king with 
ISA.57.10	All your journeys made you very tired. But you would not say, ‘We cannot continue to hope.’ You became strong again and so you did not stop trying.
ISA.57.11	Perhaps someone is frightening you, so that you do not

ISA.57.14	He will say, ‘Build up a road! Build it up. Make a road. Remove the things that do not let my people use the road.’
ISA.57.15	The High God, who is Above Everything, is speaking. He is the God who will always be alive. His name is

ISA.57.19	God will cause his people to speak words of

ISA.58.11	Then the

ISA.59.3+ISA.59.4	· People think about how they can cause trouble. And then they do bad things.

ISA.59.6	They cannot use 
ISA.59.7	They hurry along on their feet so that they can do bad things. They pour out the blood of people who have not done anything bad. They rush to do that. Their thoughts are bad thoughts. They break and destroy things. They do that everywhere that they go.

ISA.59.10	Like 
ISA.59.11	We all make angry noises, like 
ISA.59.12	That is because we have done many wrong things. You, God, see those wrong things. And our 
ISA.59.13	We have not obeyed the 
ISA.59.14	So, it is like we have sent away fair rules. And 
ISA.59.15	People cannot find what is true anywhere. Also, good people become people that bad people try to kill.
ISA.59.15	And the 
ISA.59.16	There was nobody who would do anything about it. He saw that. And he thought that it was bad. So his own arm made his people safe. And with his own

ISA.60.4	Open your eyes and look all round you. Everybody is coming together and they are coming to you. Your sons will come from a long way away and you will carry your daughters in your arms.
ISA.60.5	Then you will look and you will shine! And you will feel like your heart is jumping. And it will feel bigger inside you. That will happen because they will bring valuable things from across the seas to you. The valuable things from other countries will come to you.

JER.1.1	Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, spoke to the people of Israel. He was a 
JER.1.2	God spoke to him when Josiah, son of Amon, had been king of Judah for 13 years. 
JER.1.3	God continued to speak to him all the time that Josiah's son, Jehoiakim, was king. And he went on speaking to Jeremiah for the 11 years and 5 months, that Zedekiah was king. Zedekiah was a son of King Josiah. After this, enemies took the people from Jerusalem away to a far country.
JER.1.4	God spoke to me. 
JER.1.5	‘I knew you even before I made your body inside your mother's body. I chose you before you were born. I decided that you must be a

JER.1.18	Today I have made you as strong as a city with great walls. You will be like a tree that someone has made out of iron. You will be like a metal wall to stand against the whole 
JER.1.19	They will fight against you. But they will not win, because I am with you. I will save you’, says the 
JER.2.1	God spoke to me again. 
JER.2.2	‘Speak to the people in Jerusalem’, he said.
JER.2.2	‘I remember how you used to love me. That was when I first made you my people.
JER.2.2	You loved me as a young wife loves her husband.
JER.2.2	You followed me through a wild place,
JER.2.2	where nobody grew any food.
JER.2.3	Israel belonged to me. It was special.
JER.2.3	It was like the first food that grew on my land.
JER.2.3	Anyone else who ate that food was doing something bad.
JER.2.3	And I caused bad things to happen to them.’
JER.2.3	The 
JER.2.4	‘Listen to what the 
JER.2.4	and all the families in Israel.’
JER.2.5	This is the 
JER.2.5	‘Your 
JER.2.5	But I did nothing that was wrong. But they went a long way from me.
JER.2.5	They went to gods of wood and stone that could not do anything for them.
JER.2.5	And then they could not do anything for themselves.
JER.2.6	They did not ask the 
JER.2.6	He brought them out of Egypt.
JER.2.6	He led them through the place where nothing grows,
JER.2.6	an empty place with many valleys.
JER.2.6	It was a dry and dark place.
JER.2.6	Nobody goes through it and nobody lives in it.
JER.2.7	I, the 
JER.2.7	where you could eat very good food.
JER.2.7	But you came and you made my country like something dirty.
JER.2.7	You made it too bad for me to look at.
JER.2.8	The 
JER.2.8	And the 
JER.2.8	Your leaders did not obey me.
JER.2.8	The 
JER.2.8	They hoped that gods of wood and stone would help them.

JER.2.13	They have left me. I am like a river of living water.

JER.2.13	These holes cannot hold water. They let water run away.
JER.2.14	Israel's people are not slaves, born to be servants.
JER.2.14	But they have become slaves to their enemies.
JER.2.15	The enemies attacked them like 
JER.2.15	They have destroyed their country.
JER.2.15	They have burnt their towns and nobody lives in them.
JER.2.16	The men from Memphis and Tahpanhes have removed all the hair from your heads.
JER.2.16	So they have made you ashamed.
JER.2.17	You have caused this to happen.
JER.2.17	It is because you stopped following the 
JER.2.17	He was leading you in the way that you should go.
JER.2.18	The water of the River Shihor in Egypt is not better to drink than yours is.
JER.2.18	And the water from the river of Assyria is not better to drink than yours is.
JER.2.19	The very bad things that you have done will

JER.2.19	You have gone away from the 
JER.2.19	And you are not afraid to make me angry.
JER.2.19	Those are very bad things and they will cause you to have very bad pain.
JER.2.19	You must think about that and you must understand it.’
JER.2.19	That is what the great, powerful 
JER.2.20	‘You stopped working for me a long time ago.
JER.2.20	You cut through any thing that tied us together.
JER.2.20	You said, “I will not work for you!”
JER.2.20	So you sold yourselves to any people that would take you.
JER.2.20	You were like a woman that sells sex. 
JER.2.21	But I had planted you like a young 
JER.2.21	You were strong and you had good strong 
JER.2.21	Tell me how you became weak, 
JER.2.22	You may wash yourselves with clean water,
JER.2.22	and you may use a lot of soap’, says the most powerful 
JER.2.22	‘But you will always seem 
JER.2.23	You say that you are not 
JER.2.23	And you say that you do not run after 
JER.2.23	But remember what you did in the valley.
JER.2.23	Think carefully what you have done.
JER.2.23	You are like a fast female animal.
JER.2.23	You run all over the country.
JER.2.24	You are like a wild female horse
JER.2.24	that lifts its nose in the air.
JER.2.24	It is looking for a male horse.
JER.2.24	Nobody can keep it from what it wants.
JER.2.24	Any males who follow it will catch it easily.
JER.2.24	You are like that.
JER.2.25	Do not run for so long that you become tired.
JER.2.25	Do not run for so long that your feet hurt.
JER.2.25	“I cannot change”, you say.
JER.2.25	“I love foreign gods. I must obey them!”
JER.2.26	A man may take things that are not his.
JER.2.26	He is ashamed when people catch him.
JER.2.26	So the people of Israel are ashamed.
JER.2.26	They, their kings, their officers, and their 
JER.2.27	They say to a piece of wood, “You are my father.”
JER.2.27	They call a stone their mother.
JER.2.27	They have turned away from me.
JER.2.27	They do not show their faces to me.
JER.2.27	But then troubles happen to them.
JER.2.27	“Come and save us!” they ask me.
JER.2.28	I tell them to ask the gods that they made for themselves.
JER.2.28	Ask them to come and save you.
JER.2.28	Ask for their help when you have troubles.
JER.2.28	Judah, you have many towns.
JER.2.28	And you have as many gods.’
JER.2.29	‘You must not

JER.2.30	‘I 
JER.2.30	But they would not turn back to me.
JER.2.30	You have killed your

JER.2.31	‘Think about my message, you people who are alive today’, says the 
JER.2.31	‘I have not been like a place where nothing grows.
JER.2.31	I have not been like a dark place where nobody lives.
JER.2.31	But my people say, “We can go where we like.
JER.2.31	We do not want to visit you any more.”
JER.2.32	A young woman does not forget her pretty things.
JER.2.32	A wife does not forget her valuable gifts.
JER.2.32	But my people have forgotten me for many years.
JER.2.33	You are so clever. You can always find love!
JER.2.33	Very bad women, even, can learn from you.
JER.2.34	Your clothes have blood on them.
JER.2.34	That blood gave life to people who never hurt you.
JER.2.34	It was the blood of people who never took your things.
JER.2.35	But still you say, “I have not done anything that is wrong.
JER.2.35	God is not angry with me!”
JER.2.35	But I will 
JER.2.35	You say “I have not 
JER.2.35	So I will 
JER.2.36	You look at 
JER.2.36	You want to change.
JER.2.36	You know now that Assyria cannot help you.
JER.2.36	And you will soon know that Egypt cannot help you.
JER.2.37	You will become slaves.
JER.2.37	You will leave your country with your hands on your heads.
JER.2.37	The 
JER.2.37	They will not help you.’
JER.3.1	‘A man may

JER.3.1	If her first husband returned to her, he would not be

JER.3.1	And you want to return to me’, says the 
JER.3.2	‘Look at the tops of the hills.
JER.3.2	You have loved other gods on all of them.
JER.3.2	You sat by the side of the road, waiting for lovers.
JER.3.2	You waited to catch men.
JER.3.2	You have made the country bad.
JER.3.2	It is dirty with all the wrong things that you have done.
JER.3.2	You have loved other gods when you should have loved me.
JER.3.3	That is why I have not sent any rain to you.
JER.3.3	And that is why the spring rains have not come.
JER.3.3	But you seem to be quite happy.
JER.3.3	You are not ashamed.
JER.3.4	But you say to me, “You have been my friend, who has loved me all my life.
JER.3.5	Surely you cannot be angry with me!
JER.3.5	You cannot always be angry.”
JER.3.5	Those are the things that you say.
JER.3.5	But you do as many wrong things as you can.’

JER.3.6	‘They have not been

JER.4.14	You must not hold on to your bad thoughts.

JER.4.22	They are like children who do not know anything.
JER.4.22	They understand nothing.
JER.4.22	They know how to do bad things.
JER.4.22	But they have no idea how to do good things.’
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth,
JER.4.23	and it had no shape.
JER.4.23	I looked at the sky,
JER.4.23	and its light was gone.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains,
JER.4.24	and they kept moving about.
JER.4.24	All the hills were moving.
JER.4.25	I looked, and I did not see any people.
JER.4.25	All the birds had flown away.
JER.4.26	I looked at the good country, but no plants grew there.

JER.4.28	I have spoken and I will not turn back.’
JER.4.29	The people in every town will run away
JER.4.29	when they hear the sound of soldiers and horses.
JER.4.29	Some of them hide in bushes.
JER.4.29	Some of them climb up among the rocks.
JER.4.29	All the towns are empty.
JER.4.29	Nobody lives in them.
JER.4.30	You are like a woman who wears bright red clothes.
JER.4.30	You are like a woman who wears things of gold.
JER.4.30	You paint your eyes,
JER.4.30	but that does not help you.
JER.4.30	The men that you loved do not give 
JER.4.30	They want to kill you.
JER.4.31	I can hear that people are shouting. It is like the noise of a woman while her baby is being born.
JER.4.31	It is like the noise of a woman while her first child is being born.
JER.4.31	It is the people in Jerusalem, who are shouting for help.
JER.4.31	They shout and they say,
JER.4.31	‘I am very weak, and I am getting weaker.
JER.4.31	I am afraid that they will kill me.’

JER.5.3	You hit them, but they would not change.
JER.5.3	They would not do the things that you wanted.
JER.5.3	They held on to the bad things that they were doing.
JER.5.3	And they refused to turn away from them.
JER.5.4	‘These are poor people, and they are fools’, I thought.
JER.5.4	‘They do not know what the 
JER.5.4	They have no idea what he wants.
JER.5.5	So I will go to speak to the leaders.
JER.5.5	They will certainly know what the

JER.5.5	But every one of them turned away from him.
JER.5.5	They said that they were not his slaves.
JER.5.6	A big wild animal from the forest will attack them for that.
JER.5.6	Another animal will tear them into pieces.
JER.5.6	Other animals will wait near their towns to hurt anyone who leaves.
JER.5.6	That is because they have turned so far from the

JER.5.13	If that is true, let it happen to them.’
JER.5.14	‘So the people have said this’,
JER.5.14	says the strong and powerful 
JER.5.14	‘I will make the words in your mouth like a fire.

JER.5.16	They are all powerful soldiers.

JER.5.17	and the food that you have stored.
JER.5.17	They will take your sons and daughters.
JER.5.17	They will eat your sheep and cows.
JER.5.17	They will take the fruit from your trees.
JER.5.17	They will fight and break down the strong cities.

JER.5.24	They do not say to themselves,
JER.5.24	“We must 
JER.5.24	He gives the autumn and spring rains to us.
JER.5.24	Each year he makes sure that we have food.”
JER.5.25	But you have done many wrong things.
JER.5.25	So he has not sent rain or food to you.
JER.5.25	He has taken away good things because you have 
JER.5.26	Many bad men belong to my people.
JER.5.26	They hide like men who catch birds.
JER.5.26	They are like people who try to catch men.
JER.5.27	Their houses are full of valuable things
JER.5.27	that they have taken with 
JER.5.27	They are rich and powerful.
JER.5.28	Now they are fat and they seem good.
JER.5.28	They will never stop doing bad things.
JER.5.28	They do not try to help children who have no fathers.
JER.5.28	They do not help poor people to get what is theirs.
JER.5.29	I certainly must 
JER.5.29	says the 
JER.5.29	‘I must show them how angry I am.
JER.5.29	The people are very, very bad.’
JER.5.30	A really bad thing has happened in this country.
JER.5.31	The 
JER.5.31	The 
JER.5.31	And my people like what they do.
JER.5.31	I will stop all this. Then they will not know what to do.
JER.6.1	‘You 
JER.6.1	Run away from Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Make a noise with the 
JER.6.1	Shout over to Beth-Haccerem!
JER.6.1	Big trouble is coming from the north.
JER.6.2	I will send enemies to destroy Jerusalem and its people.
JER.6.2	It is such a lovely city.
JER.6.3	Men will come with the sheep that they keep.
JER.6.3	They will put their 
JER.6.3	Each man will have a small part of the land.
JER.6.4	Get ready to fight against it!
JER.6.4	Let us get up and attack at noon!
JER.6.4	But the day is getting dark.
JER.6.4	It is already evening.
JER.6.5	Rise up. Let us attack in the night.
JER.6.5	Let us destroy their strong cities!’
JER.6.6	The strong and powerful 
JER.6.6	‘Cut down the trees’, he said.
JER.6.6	‘Build high hills up to the walls of the city.
JER.6.6	I must 
JER.6.6	It is full of men who hurt other people.
JER.6.7	It contains so many people who do bad things.
JER.6.7	Bad things pour out from it, like water from a well.
JER.6.7	It is full of fights and of men who destroy.
JER.6.7	All the time I can see how sick and weak it is.’
JER.6.8	‘Listen to my words’, says the 
JER.6.8	‘If you do not listen, I will turn away from you.
JER.6.8	I will destroy your country.
JER.6.8	Then nobody will be able to live in it.’ 
JER.6.9	The strong, powerful 
JER.6.9	‘I will let the enemy take everything from Israel.
JER.6.9	They will take things like a farmer who is picking his fruit’, he said.
JER.6.10	‘I want to speak to people. And I want to tell them what may happen.
JER.6.10	But nobody will listen to me.
JER.6.10	They close their ears so that they cannot hear.
JER.6.10	They 
JER.6.10	It does not give any pleasure to them.
JER.6.11	But the 
JER.6.11	He is so angry that he cannot contain it.
JER.6.11	His 
JER.6.11	It will pour out on the groups of young men.
JER.6.11	It will cover both husbands and wives.
JER.6.11	It will pour over the very old people.
JER.6.12	I will give their houses to other people.
JER.6.12	Other people will take their fields and their wives.
JER.6.12	This will happen when I decide to 
JER.6.12	says the 
JER.6.13	‘All the people, important and not important, want to get more and more things.
JER.6.13	They all say things that are not true.
JER.6.14	They tell my people that there is no great trouble.
JER.6.14	They say that there is nothing to be afraid of.
JER.6.14	“
JER.6.14	But they do not have any 
JER.6.15	They are not ashamed of the wrong things that they do.
JER.6.15	They seem to think that there is nothing wrong about those things.
JER.6.15	They have forgotten how to be sorry.
JER.6.15	So they will fall when other people fall.
JER.6.15	I will bring them down when I decide to 
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	The 
JER.6.16	‘Stand at the place where the roads cross, and look,’ he said.
JER.6.16	‘Ask where the old ways lead.
JER.6.16	Find the good way, and walk along that way.
JER.6.16	Then I will give proper 
JER.6.16	But you said, “We will not walk that way.”’ 
JER.6.17	‘I gave you men to help you and to lead you. I said,
JER.6.17	“Listen for the noise of the 
JER.6.17	But you said, “We will not listen.”
JER.6.18	So listen to me, all you countries.
JER.6.18	Look. And you will see
JER.6.18	the things that I will do to them.
JER.6.19	Hear me, people on the earth.
JER.6.19	I am causing great trouble for these people.
JER.6.19	They will have trouble because they have done many wrong things.
JER.6.19	And they have not listened to my words.
JER.6.19	They have not obeyed my 
JER.6.20	I do not want nice smells from Sheba.
JER.6.20	I do not want oils from countries far away.
JER.6.20	The food and drink that you give to me
JER.6.20	do not give pleasure to me.’
JER.6.21	So this is the message from the 
JER.6.21	‘I will make things very difficult for you people.
JER.6.21	Both sons and their fathers will have difficulties.
JER.6.21	Friends and people who live near to each other will die.’
JER.6.22	The 
JER.6.22	‘Look, an army is coming from the country in the north.
JER.6.22	I am calling up a great people from the ends of the earth.
JER.6.23	They are carrying bows and 
JER.6.23	They are never kind and they never 
JER.6.23	They ride on their horses and
JER.6.23	it is like the noise of the sea.
JER.6.23	They are ready to fight,
JER.6.23	and they are coming to attack you, Jerusalem.’
JER.6.24	We have heard about them,
JER.6.24	and we are afraid.
JER.6.24	Pain is all over our bodies.
JER.6.24	It is like the pain of a woman who is having a baby.
JER.6.25	Do not go out into the fields.
JER.6.25	Do not walk along the roads.
JER.6.25	Our enemies have long, sharp knives.
JER.6.25	We are afraid that they are all round us.
JER.6.26	My people must become very sorry.
JER.6.26	They wear special clothes when someone dies.
JER.6.26	They must wear clothes like those.
JER.6.26	They cry with loud voices.
JER.6.26	They cry like a man whose only son has died.
JER.6.26	They do that because the enemy will quickly come to destroy us.
JER.6.27	‘My people are like metals.
JER.6.27	And you must 
JER.6.27	I want you to watch them.
JER.6.27	Then you can see what they do.’
JER.6.28	They never obeyed God.
JER.6.28	They tell stories that are not true. And they enjoy it.
JER.6.28	Their minds are as hard as iron.
JER.6.28	They all do very bad things.
JER.6.29	A very hot fire makes metals clean.
JER.6.29	I send 
JER.6.29	But it does not cause bad men to do what is good.
JER.6.30	God will throw them out like dirty metal.
JER.6.30	The 
JER.7.1	The 
JER.7.2	‘Stand at the gate of the 
JER.7.3	The great, powerful God of Israel says, ‘Change the things that you do. Do the right things. If you do that, I will let you live in this place. 
JER.7.4	People may say, “We are safe. This is the 
JER.7.5	You must really change. You must be fair to each other. 
JER.7.6	You must not be cruel to 
JER.7.7	If you obey me, then I will let you live in this country. This is the country that I gave to your 
JER.7.8	But you believe in words that are not true. They cannot help you.
JER.7.9	You take things that are not yours. And you kill people. You tell 
JER.7.10	And then you come to this, my house! You stand in front of this house that is mine. You say, “We are safe!” 
JER.7.11	My 
JER.7.12	‘Go to Shiloh. It was the first place that I chose as a house for my name. See what I did to it. I destroyed it because you had done so many bad things. 
JER.7.13	I spoke to you while you were doing those bad things’, the 
JER.7.14	I gave this 
JER.7.15	But I will push you away from me, as I pushed away the other 
JER.7.16	‘Jeremiah, you must not pray for this people. You must not ask me to help them. If you ask me, I will not listen to you. 
JER.7.17	You can see what they are doing in the towns in Judah. You see what they are doing in the streets in Jerusalem. 
JER.7.18	The children fetch wood and their fathers light a fire. The women prepare and cook cakes of bread. Then they offer them to the “Queen of 
JER.7.19	I am angry. But they are the people who will hurt themselves’, says the 
JER.7.20	‘So I will send out my 
JER.7.21	‘Continue to give your

JER.7.23	I also told them to obey me, and to keep all my 
JER.7.24	But they did not listen. They did not think that my words had any value. Instead, they did the bad things that they liked to do. They went away from me, and they did not want to come to me. 
JER.7.25	I sent my servants, the 
JER.7.26	But they did not listen to me. They did not try to do as I asked them. They went on doing the same bad things. And they did even worse things than their 
JER.7.27	‘Jeremiah, you will tell them all that I have said. But when you tell them, they will not listen to you. When you call them, they will not answer. 
JER.7.28	So you will have to speak to them. “The people in this country have not obeyed the 
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair. Sing sad songs on the empty hills. The 
JER.7.30	‘The people in Judah have done wrong things. I told them that those things were wrong’, says the 
JER.7.31	They have made big fires in Topheth. There, in Ben-Hinnom Valley, they burn their sons and daughters. I did not tell them to do that. I never thought to ask them to do such a thing. 
JER.7.32	So you must be careful. The day will come when it will not be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. No, it will be called Death Valley. They will put dead persons in the earth there, until it is full up. 
JER.7.33	Birds and animals will eat the dead persons, and nobody will make them afraid. They will not go away. 
JER.7.34	I will make the place quiet. Nobody will sing or be happy there. Nobody in the towns in Judah or in Jerusalem will have marriage parties. Nobody will live in the country any more.’
JER.8.1	‘Enemies will remove the bones of the kings of Judah and their officers. And they will remove the bones of the 
JER.8.2	The sun will shine on them, and the moon, too. My people worked for and loved the sun and moon. They 
JER.8.3	All the people in this bad country will want to die, and not to live’, says the great, powerful 
JER.8.4	Speak to the people, and tell them,
JER.8.4	‘When men fall down, they get up again.
JER.8.4	When a man goes away, he comes back.
JER.8.5	I ask why these people have turned away.
JER.8.5	The people in Jerusalem always turn away.
JER.8.5	They choose to believe things that are not true.
JER.8.5	They refuse to return to me.
JER.8.6	I have listened carefully.
JER.8.6	But they do not say what is right.
JER.8.6	Nobody is sorry for the bad things that they have done.
JER.8.6	They think, “Nobody knows what we have done.”
JER.8.6	Each person does the things that he wants.
JER.8.6	He is like a horse that is running to the fight.
JER.8.7	Even a big bird in the sky knows when it should go away.
JER.8.7	Small birds know when it is time for them to fly away.
JER.8.7	But my people do not know
JER.8.7	what I want them to do.’
JER.8.8	‘You must not say, “We know what is right.
JER.8.8	We know it because we have the 
JER.8.8	Your writers have written what is not true!
JER.8.9	Some people think that they are clever.
JER.8.9	Those people will be ashamed. Enemies will catch them like animals in a field.
JER.8.9	They have refused to hear the 
JER.8.9	They are not very clever.
JER.8.10	So I will give their wives to other men.
JER.8.10	Other men will have their fields.
JER.8.10	All people, rich and poor, want to have more and more things.
JER.8.10	Both 
JER.8.10	tell people things that are not true.
JER.8.11	They can see that my people have pain.
JER.8.11	But they say that it is not important.
JER.8.11	They say, “
JER.8.12	They are not ashamed of the wrong things that they do.
JER.8.12	They are not sorry.
JER.8.12	Their faces do not get red.
JER.8.12	So they will fall when other men fall.
JER.8.12	I will bring them down when I 
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	‘I will take away the fruit and seed from their fields’,
JER.8.13	says the 
JER.8.13	‘No 
JER.8.13	The leaves of the trees will dry up and die.
JER.8.13	I will take away everything that I have given to them.’ 
JER.8.14	We say to ourselves,
JER.8.14	‘We should not be sitting here like this.
JER.8.14	We must come together.
JER.8.14	Let us run to the cities with strong walls.
JER.8.14	We will die there!
JER.8.14	The 
JER.8.14	He has given to us water to drink that has poison in it
JER.8.14	because we have not obeyed him.
JER.8.15	We wanted 
JER.8.15	We wanted God to make us well, but he made us afraid.
JER.8.16	The people can hear the noise of the enemy's horses.
JER.8.16	They can hear them, even from Dan.
JER.8.16	All the country 
JER.8.16	They have come to destroy the country and everything in it.
JER.8.16	They will get power over the city and over all the people who live there.’
JER.8.17	‘I will send snakes to you that have poison in their mouths.
JER.8.17	Nobody can cause them to sleep.
JER.8.17	They will bite you’, says the 
JER.8.18	But now I feel weak and afraid.
JER.8.19	Listen to your people who are crying from a country far away.
JER.8.19	They ask if the 
JER.8.19	They think that their king has gone away.
JER.8.19	‘They have made me angry with their 
JER.8.19	Their foreign gods do not have any value.
JER.8.20	We have taken in all the food from the fields.
JER.8.20	The summer is finished.
JER.8.20	And you have not saved us.
JER.8.21	I am very sad because my people are so sad.
JER.8.21	I feel sad as if they were dead. And I am afraid for them.
JER.8.22	God has hurt his people so that no doctor can help them.
JER.8.22	He will not make them better.’
JER.9.1	‘My head should be like a river of water,
JER.9.1	and my eyes like a pool of tears.
JER.9.1	Then I would cry all day and night
JER.9.1	for my people who have died. 
JER.9.2	I would like to have a place to stay in the 
JER.9.2	Then I could leave my people.
JER.9.2	I could go away from them.
JER.9.2	They have all gone away from God like men who have left their wives for other women.
JER.9.2	Not one person 
JER.9.3	Their 
JER.9.3	They shoot words that are not true.
JER.9.3	These people win their fights when they say 
JER.9.3	They 
JER.9.3	They do not give

JER.9.4	‘Watch your friends.
JER.9.4	Every brother says words that are not true.
JER.9.4	So do not 
JER.9.4	And every friend speaks words that can hurt you.
JER.9.5	One friend will say words that are not true to another friend.
JER.9.5	Nobody speaks true words.
JER.9.5	They have taught their 
JER.9.5	They have 
JER.9.6	People say so many things that are not true.
JER.9.6	So they refuse to know me’,
JER.9.6	says the 
JER.9.7	So this is what the great, strong 
JER.9.7	‘I will see how 
JER.9.7	I want to make them more 
JER.9.7	A man uses a very hot fire to remove other metals from gold.
JER.9.7	It will be like that.
JER.9.7	I must do that because my people have 
JER.9.8	Their 
JER.9.8	It does not say things that are true.
JER.9.8	A man may speak kind words to his friend,
JER.9.8	but he is really trying to hurt him.
JER.9.9	I must 
JER.9.9	says the 
JER.9.9	‘I must be angry
JER.9.9	because the people in this country do not give

JER.9.10	So I will cry and I will be sad.
JER.9.10	No animals live on the hills where they ate the grass.
JER.9.10	The hills and mountains are empty.
JER.9.10	Nobody can hear the sound of cows and sheep.
JER.9.10	No birds fly in the air,
JER.9.10	and the animals are gone.
JER.9.11	I will make Jerusalem a hill of broken stones.
JER.9.11	Wild animals will live there.
JER.9.11	I will destroy the towns in Judah
JER.9.11	so that nobody can live there.’
JER.9.12	Nobody can understand this. The 
JER.9.13	‘It is because they have not obeyed my 
JER.9.14	They have left me and they have gone to 
JER.9.15	So the great, strong 
JER.9.16	I will send them to many foreign countries. Neither they nor their 
JER.9.17	‘Call the women who cry for people in trouble. Call them now!’
JER.9.17	the great powerful 
JER.9.17	‘Send for those who cry the loudest.
JER.9.18	Tell them to come quickly to make their sad noise.
JER.9.18	Then our eyes will make water.
JER.9.18	And it will be like rivers that fall from them.
JER.9.19	We can hear the sound of people who are crying in 
JER.9.19	“People have taken all our good things! We are very ashamed!
JER.9.19	We have to leave our country
JER.9.19	because our enemies have destroyed all our houses.” ’
JER.9.20	Now hear the 
JER.9.20	Listen to the words of his mouth.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters how to cry about their troubles.
JER.9.20	Teach each other sad songs.
JER.9.21	We are all dying. Dead bodies fill our strong cities.
JER.9.21	No children play in the streets.
JER.9.21	The open places of the city are empty.
JER.9.21	The young men have all gone.
JER.9.22	‘Men's dead bodies will lie on the open fields.
JER.9.22	Nobody will take them away’, says the 
JER.9.22	‘They will lie like plants that people have cut for food.
JER.9.22	But nobody will pick them up.’
JER.9.23	‘The 
JER.9.23	And the strong man must not say that he is strong’,
JER.9.23	says the 
JER.9.24	‘But they can say that they know me. And they can say that they understand me.
JER.9.24	Then they would be able to say that they were clever.
JER.9.24	They would know that I am the 
JER.9.24	They would know that I am kind.
JER.9.24	And I do only good things.
JER.9.24	I am fair when I 
JER.9.24	They would know that too.
JER.9.24	Those are the things that give pleasure to me’, says the 
JER.9.25	‘Very soon’, says the 
JER.9.26	I will 
JER.10.1	People in Israel, listen to what the 
JER.10.2	‘Do not do the things that people in other countries do’, he says.
JER.10.2	‘You should not be afraid of things that happen in the sky.
JER.10.2	You must not be like people in other countries. 
JER.10.3	The things that those people do have no value.
JER.10.3	They take a tree from the forest,
JER.10.3	and a worker gives shape to it with a knife.
JER.10.4	They make it pretty with 
JER.10.4	They fix it to the floor so that it will not fall.
JER.10.5	We put things like them in the fields.
JER.10.5	Our things save the fruit from the birds.
JER.10.5	And they cannot speak.
JER.10.5	Men carry 
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of them.
JER.10.5	They cannot hurt you
JER.10.5	and they cannot help you.’
JER.10.6	There is nobody like you, 
JER.10.6	You are great and your name is powerful.
JER.10.7	Everyone should 
JER.10.7	King of the countries.
JER.10.7	That is their duty.
JER.10.7	There is nobody like you in all the countries.
JER.10.7	No men are as 
JER.10.7	There is no king like you.
JER.10.8	All men are fools, and they learn from fools.
JER.10.8	Things that people have made out of wood cannot teach them anything.
JER.10.9	They cover the wood with 
JER.10.9	They make it pretty with gold from Uphaz.
JER.10.9	Then they take expensive clothes that men have made with their hands.
JER.10.9	They put them on this 
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	He is the God who is alive. He is the King who will always be alive.
JER.10.10	When he is angry, the earth moves like a leaf in the wind.
JER.10.10	When he is angry, the people in a country cannot stand.
JER.10.11	Speak to them. Say, ‘Your gods did not make the earth or the sky. The 
JER.10.12	But God made the earth by his power.
JER.10.12	Only he could do that.
JER.10.12	It was he who put the sky over the earth.
JER.10.13	When he shouts, there are loud noises in the sky.
JER.10.13	He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He causes the 
JER.10.13	And he brings the winds from the place where he hides them.
JER.10.14	Nobody knows God or understands him.
JER.10.14	Men who work to make things from metal are ashamed.
JER.10.15	They are silly because they do not have any value.
JER.10.15	God will destroy them when he 
JER.10.16	The God of Jacob is not like those 
JER.10.16	He made everything.
JER.10.16	He made Israel to be the people that he chose.
JER.10.16	He is the great and powerful 
JER.10.17	Get all your things together, ready to leave the country.
JER.10.17	Your enemies are all round you.
JER.10.18	This is what the 
JER.10.18	‘I will now throw out those people who live in this country.
JER.10.18	I will make their lives difficult,
JER.10.18	then their enemies will take them as their 
JER.10.19	I am hurt and in great pain.
JER.10.19	Nobody can make me well.
JER.10.19	I said to myself, ‘This is my pain, and I must live with it!’
JER.10.20	They have destroyed my 
JER.10.20	They have broken all its 
JER.10.20	My sons have gone away, and they are dead. 
JER.10.20	Now nobody will put up my 
JER.10.21	The 
JER.10.21	They do not ask the 
JER.10.21	so their work does not make them rich.
JER.10.21	And all their sheep have run away.
JER.10.22	Listen to the noise!
JER.10.22	People are coming from the country in the north.
JER.10.22	They will take the people out from the towns in Judah.
JER.10.22	Only wild animals will live there. 
JER.10.23	I know, 
JER.10.23	Only you can say where he should walk.
JER.10.24	Please lead me back to the right path, 
JER.10.24	Do not be angry with me.
JER.10.24	If you become angry, you might completely destroy me.
JER.10.25	Be angry, 
JER.10.25	Be angry with the 
JER.10.25	The people in those countries have completely destroyed your people,
JER.10.25	the 
JER.10.25	They have destroyed the country that you gave to your people.
JER.11.1	God spoke to Jeremiah, the 
JER.11.2	‘Listen to the rules of this

JER.11.6	‘Speak out all these words in the towns in Judah and the streets in Jerusalem’, the 
JER.11.7	I have said that all the time since I brought your 
JER.11.8	But they did not listen. They did not think that my rules were important. Instead, they did all the bad things that they wanted to do. All their thoughts were 
JER.11.9	‘The people in Judah and those who live in Jerusalem have agreed together. They have agreed to do wrong things. 
JER.11.10	They are doing the same 
JER.11.11	Because of that, the 
JER.11.12	The people in the towns in Judah and in Jerusalem will shout to the gods that they 
JER.11.13	Judah, you have different gods in every town. You have made 
JER.11.14	Jeremiah, do not pray for these people and do not ask me to do anything for them. I will not listen to them when they ask me for help.
JER.11.15	The people that I love are doing 
JER.11.15	They cannot stop me from 
JER.11.15	If you give gifts of meat to me, I will still 
JER.11.15	You enjoy doing these wrong things.’
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.16	It was beautiful and it gave much fruit.
JER.11.16	But now he will burn the tree with a loud noise,
JER.11.16	and he will break all its branches.
JER.11.17	The 
JER.11.18	I knew what the people wanted to do. The 
JER.11.19	I was like a young animal that is waiting for men to kill it. I had no idea what they had been saying.
JER.11.19	‘Sometimes people have to destroy the tree and its fruit’, they said. ‘In the same way, he must not go on living. Men will forget all about him.’ 
JER.11.20	‘But 
JER.11.21	The men in Anathoth wanted to kill me. “Do not go on telling us what the 
JER.11.22	So the 
JER.11.23	He said, ‘I will destroy all the men in Anathoth when I 
JER.12.1	You always 
JER.12.1	when I tell you about my problems.
JER.12.1	But I must ask you some questions.
JER.12.1	Why do bad people have such an easy life?
JER.12.1	Why does everything seem to happen in the way that pleases them?
JER.12.1	Why do you help the people who do not obey you to be very comfortable?
JER.12.2	They are like plants that you have planted. And they are growing.
JER.12.2	They grow and they make fruit.
JER.12.2	They talk about you a lot.
JER.12.2	But they do not think about what you want them to do.
JER.12.3	But you know me, 
JER.12.3	You watch me. And you 
JER.12.3	Take those bad men away like animals to kill them!
JER.12.3	Put them in a special place, ready to die.
JER.12.4	The country has been dry for a long time.
JER.12.4	The grass in every field is brown and dry.
JER.12.4	The people who live in this country are bad.
JER.12.4	So all the animals and birds have died.
JER.12.4	It is even worse than that. People are saying,
JER.12.4	‘He will not see what happens to us.’
JER.12.5	‘You get very tired when you try to run faster than other men.
JER.12.5	So you will never run faster than horses.
JER.12.5	You fall over on flat fields.
JER.12.5	So you will certainly fall near the River Jordan,
JER.12.5	when you are among many trees and bushes.
JER.12.6	Even your brothers and your own family
JER.12.6	are against you.
JER.12.6	They join in the attacks against you.
JER.12.6	Do not believe them,
JER.12.6	even when they speak kind words about you.’ 
JER.12.7	‘I will leave my house and I will go away.
JER.12.7	And my people's country will be empty.
JER.12.7	I will let their enemies take the people that I love.
JER.12.8	The people that belong to me
JER.12.8	are like a 
JER.12.8	They are like a 
JER.12.8	They shout, ready to jump on me.
JER.12.8	This is why I 
JER.12.9	The people that I chose are like a small bird.
JER.12.9	Their enemies are like big birds. They will attack them and they will kill them.
JER.12.9	Call to the wild animals
JER.12.9	to come and to eat them!
JER.12.10	My people are like a garden where soft plants grow.
JER.12.10	But the men who keep the garden are walking all over it.
JER.12.10	They are making my garden into a 
JER.12.11	It will become dry and empty
JER.12.11	and nothing will grow there.
JER.12.11	The whole country will become empty
JER.12.11	because nobody 
JER.12.12	Enemies will come over the empty country.
JER.12.12	They will come to destroy my people.
JER.12.12	Nobody will be safe in any part of the country.
JER.12.13	They will plant good seed, but bad plants will grow.
JER.12.13	My people will work very hard, but they will get nothing.
JER.12.13	Because I am very angry, they will not have any food.
JER.12.14	I will remove all the enemies who took this country. They took the country that I gave to my people, Israel. I will take them out of their countries. I will separate the people of Judah from them’, says the 
JER.12.15	‘But after I have taken away the people from Judah, I will be kind to them. I will bring them back, each to the country of his 
JER.12.16	Then they must learn to obey the rules of my people. They must give 
JER.12.17	But if the people in any country will not obey these rules, I will destroy it completely’, says the 
JER.13.1	‘Go. And buy a belt that someone has made from cloth. And put it round your body’, the 
JER.13.2	So I bought a belt, as the 
JER.13.3	The 
JER.13.4	‘Take the belt that you bought. You are now wearing it. Take it to the River Euphrates and hide it in a hole in the rocks.’ 
JER.13.5	So I went. And I hid it at the River Euphrates as the 
JER.13.6	Many days after that, the 
JER.13.7	So I went to the River Euphrates, to the place where I had hidden the belt. I dug it up. But it was dirty and I could not use it.
JER.13.8	Then the 
JER.13.9	‘I will destroy everything that has any value in Judah and in Jerusalem. I will make it like this belt. 
JER.13.10	These people are very bad. They refuse to listen to my words. They do what they want. They work for other gods and they 
JER.13.11	My people are like a belt. I tied all Israel's people and all Judah's people round myself. They should have been my people and they should have brought 
JER.13.12	‘You must speak to them. Say, “ ‘People should fill with 
JER.13.13	Then say to them, “I will make all the people who live in this country like drunks. All the kings, 
JER.13.14	I will hit them against each other like jars, whether they are old or young”, says the 
JER.13.15	Listen to me.
JER.13.15	Listen very carefully.
JER.13.15	Do not think that you do not need to listen!
JER.13.15	The 
JER.13.16	Give 
JER.13.16	before he makes it dark.
JER.13.16	Then your feet will not find the path,
JER.13.16	as the hills become dark.
JER.13.16	You want it to get light.
JER.13.16	But God will make it very dark.
JER.13.17	If you do not listen,
JER.13.17	I will weep in secret.
JER.13.17	You think that you do not need the 
JER.13.17	That is why I will cry.
JER.13.17	Water will fall from my eyes
JER.13.17	like a great river.
JER.13.17	This will happen because the 
JER.13.18	Speak to the king and to the queen, his mother.
JER.13.18	Say, ‘Come down from your 
JER.13.18	The gold 
JER.13.19	The cities in the south of Judah will not be open,
JER.13.19	and there will be nobody to open them.
JER.13.19	Enemies will take all the people in Judah to a foreign country.
JER.13.19	They will take them away completely.
JER.13.20	Look up. See people who are coming from the north.
JER.13.20	The people that made you important are gone.
JER.13.20	You are like 
JER.13.21	The 
JER.13.21	People from the country that was your special friend will rule over you.
JER.13.21	You will have pain,
JER.13.21	pain like the pain of a woman who is having a baby.
JER.13.22	You may ask, ‘Why is this happening to me?’
JER.13.22	It is because of the many wrong things that you have done.
JER.13.22	That is why people have torn off your clothes.
JER.13.22	And they have hurt you.
JER.13.23	A black man cannot make himself white,
JER.13.23	and an animal cannot change its colour.
JER.13.23	In the same way, you cannot do good things
JER.13.23	if you have always done 
JER.13.24	‘I will blow you away
JER.13.24	as the 
JER.13.25	That is what I have decided to do to you’, says the 
JER.13.25	‘I will do it because you have forgotten me.
JER.13.25	And you have listened to 
JER.13.26	I will pull off your clothes.
JER.13.26	You will be ashamed.
JER.13.27	You have had sex with women who are not your wives.
JER.13.27	And everyone will see that you have done that.
JER.13.27	They will know that men have paid women
JER.13.27	to have sex with them.
JER.13.27	I have seen the bad things that you do
JER.13.27	on the hills and in the fields.
JER.13.27	People in Jerusalem, you will never be happy.
JER.13.27	You should not always do wrong things.’ 
JER.14.1	This is what the 
JER.14.2	‘Judah's people are very sad. The people in their cities are tired.
JER.14.2	They are sitting on the ground and they are crying.
JER.14.2	Jerusalem's people are weeping.
JER.14.3	Rich men send their servants for water.
JER.14.3	But they do not find any water
JER.14.3	in the big holes where they keep it.
JER.14.3	They return with empty water jars.
JER.14.3	Their trouble is great and they are sad.
JER.14.3	They cover their heads.
JER.14.4	The ground has long holes in it
JER.14.4	because God has sent no rain.
JER.14.4	The farmers have great trouble.
JER.14.4	They cover their heads. 
JER.14.5	Mother animals let their new babies lie in the fields and they will leave them
JER.14.5	because the grass is dead.
JER.14.6	Wild horses stand on the empty hills and they are 
JER.14.6	They cannot see well because they do not have any food.’
JER.14.7	We know that we have done many bad things.
JER.14.7	But please help us, 
JER.14.7	People will give 
JER.14.7	We have been 
JER.14.7	We have not obeyed your 
JER.14.8	We 
JER.14.8	You saved us from our troubles.
JER.14.8	But now you are like a

JER.14.9	You are like a man who is surprised.
JER.14.9	He is surprised when enemies make him a

JER.14.9	You are among us, 
JER.14.9	People call us by your name.
JER.14.9	Do not leave us alone!
JER.14.10	‘This people love to go away from me.
JER.14.10	They let their feet go anywhere that they like.
JER.14.10	So they cannot please the

JER.14.10	And he will

JER.14.11	The 
JER.14.12	Even if they stop eating food, I will not listen to them. If they burn meat and seeds to offer to me, I will not accept their gifts. Instead, I will kill them. They will not have any food. Or they will become ill and they will die. I will send men to kill some of them’, the 
JER.14.13	‘
JER.14.14	‘The 
JER.14.15	So this is what the 
JER.14.16	And men will throw the people that listened to them into the streets of Jerusalem. They will die because they do not have any food. Or they may die because soldiers will kill them. Nobody will bury the dead people. They and their dead wives, sons and daughters will lie in the street. I will 
JER.14.17	Say this to them.
JER.14.17	‘Water runs from my eyes
JER.14.17	all day and all night and it does not stop.
JER.14.17	I am crying because a heavy

JER.14.18	I see dead people
JER.14.18	when I go into the country.
JER.14.18	Soldiers have killed them.
JER.14.18	In the city, I see dead people.
JER.14.18	They died because they did not have any food.
JER.14.18	Both 
JER.14.18	have gone to a place that they never knew.’
JER.14.19	I cannot believe that you have completely turned away from Judah.
JER.14.19	I cannot believe that you hate 
JER.14.19	You have hurt us so much
JER.14.19	that nobody can make us well again.
JER.14.19	We 
JER.14.19	But you have not done anything good for us.
JER.14.19	We 
JER.14.19	But we are only very afraid.
JER.14.20	We remember, too, the bad things that our 
JER.14.20	We have not obeyed you, and we have hurt you.
JER.14.21	We are bad. So people may think that you are bad because of that.
JER.14.21	We do not want that.
JER.14.21	We want people to give 
JER.14.21	Remember that you promised something to us.
JER.14.21	Please do what you promised to do.
JER.14.22	Gods that men made from wood and stone belong to other countries.
JER.14.22	They cannot bring rain.
JER.14.22	The sky itself does not make rain.
JER.14.22	No, you our 
JER.14.22	you bring rain.
JER.14.22	Only you can do all these things.
JER.14.22	So we hope that you will help us.

JER.15.8	More men will die than you can count.
JER.15.8	I will send an enemy at midday
JER.15.8	against mothers and young children.
JER.15.8	They will become afraid quickly.
JER.15.9	A mother who has 7 children will fall.
JER.15.9	And she will die.

JER.15.10	I am sorry, mother, that I was ever born.
JER.15.10	Everyone in the country is against me.
JER.15.10	I have not lent money and I have not taken it. 
JER.15.10	But everyone says bad things about me.
JER.15.11	‘I will save you so that I can do good things.
JER.15.11	I will cause your enemies to ask you for help.

JER.15.13	because you have done so many wrong things.
JER.15.13	You have done bad things all over the country.
JER.15.14	Your enemies will make you slaves.
JER.15.14	They will take you to a country that you do not know.
JER.15.14	I am very angry. And so I am like a fire that will burn you.’
JER.15.15	You understand my problems, 
JER.15.15	Remember me and 
JER.15.15	Please 
JER.15.15	You are patient but do not let them kill me. Remember me.
JER.15.15	They have made my life difficult because I work for you.
JER.15.16	Your words were like sweet food to me.
JER.15.16	They made me very happy.
JER.15.16	I belong to you, 
JER.15.17	I never sat with happy people at a party.
JER.15.17	I sat alone, because you had touched me.
JER.15.17	You had made me very angry.
JER.15.18	My pain has no end.
JER.15.18	And there is nothing that can help me to feel better.
JER.15.18	It seems to me that you are not always there.
JER.15.18	You are not always there when I need your help.

JER.15.20	You will be like a wall of strong metal.
JER.15.20	They will fight against you,
JER.15.20	but they will not win the fight.
JER.15.20	They will not win because I am with you.
JER.15.20	I will save you’, says the 
JER.15.21	‘I will save you from bad men who attack you.
JER.15.21	I will save you from people who want to hurt you.’
JER.16.1+JER.16.2	The 
JER.16.3	Sons and daughters who are born in this country will die from bad illnesses. Their mothers and fathers will die, too. 
JER.16.4	Their bodies will lie on the ground. And nobody will be sad and nobody will bury them. Nobody will give any

JER.16.8	And do not go into a house where they are having a party. Do not sit down with them to eat and to drink.’
JER.16.9	And the

JER.17.26	People will come from the towns and villages in Judah. They will come from the land that belongs to Benjamin. They will come from the hills and the little hills in the west. They will come from the south. They will bring animals, 
JER.17.27	If you do not obey me, I will 
JER.18.1	The 
JER.18.2	‘Go down to the 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the 
JER.18.4	He was working with 
JER.18.5	Then the 
JER.18.6	‘You 
JER.18.7	I may say at any time that I will break down a country. I may say that I will destroy it. 
JER.18.8	But the people in that country might hear my words. And they might stop doing the things that made me angry. Then I would change my mind. I would not cause the trouble that I had promised. 
JER.18.9	Or I might say that I will build up a country. I might say that I will make it strong. 
JER.18.10	But the people in that country might do wrong things, and they might not obey my rules. Then I would think again about the good things that I had said. I might not do them.’
JER.18.11	‘So now you must speak to the people who live in Judah and in Jerusalem. Tell them that the 
JER.18.12	But they will say to you, “We do not want to do that. We will continue to do what we want to do. We will do every bad thing that we choose to do.” ’
JER.18.13	So the 
JER.18.13	‘The people in other countries have never heard about anything like this.
JER.18.13	My people, Israel, have done a very wrong thing.
JER.18.14	The snow stays on the rocky sides of 
JER.18.14	Cold water never stops falling from its high rocks.
JER.18.15	But my people have forgotten me.
JER.18.15	They burn oils with a nice smell
JER.18.15	to give pleasure to gods that do not have any value.
JER.18.15	Those gods cause them to become lost.
JER.18.15	They go away from the right paths.
JER.18.15	They walk along side paths and poor roads.
JER.18.16	I will send their enemies to get power over their country.
JER.18.16	They will destroy everything in it.
JER.18.16	My people will be ashamed.
JER.18.16	Men who pass the country will be very surprised.
JER.18.16	They will show how sad they are.
JER.18.17	I will come to my people like the east wind.
JER.18.17	I will blow them like sand in front of their enemies.
JER.18.17	I will not show my face to them.
JER.18.17	I will turn my back to them when that day comes.’
JER.18.18	The people said, ‘Let us attack Jeremiah. We do not need him. The 
JER.18.19	Listen to me, 
JER.18.19	Hear what people are saying against me.
JER.18.20	I have tried to teach them well,
JER.18.20	but they will do bad things to me.
JER.18.20	Remember that I stood in front of you. And I spoke to you.
JER.18.20	I asked you not to be angry with them.
JER.18.21	So now cause them not to have any food.
JER.18.21	Let their enemies kill them with sharp knives.
JER.18.21	I want their wives to lose their husbands and their children.
JER.18.21	Let their enemies kill the men.
JER.18.21	And let the young men die while they are fighting.
JER.18.22	They will shout from their houses
JER.18.22	when you bring enemies to surprise them.
JER.18.22	They are trying to catch me in a hole
JER.18.22	or to tie me like an animal.
JER.18.23	But you, 
JER.18.23	the bad things that they want to do to me.
JER.18.23	Please do not 
JER.18.23	And do not forget the bad things that they have done.
JER.18.23	Watch as their enemies win the fight against them.
JER.19.1	The 
JER.19.2	Go out into Ben-Hinnom Valley, near to the Piece of Pot gate. There you must speak the words that I will give to you.
JER.19.3	Say, “Hear the 
JER.19.4	I will do that because you have brought foreign gods to this place. People have burnt animals here to offer to these gods. Neither their 
JER.19.5	People burned their own sons in fires on the high hills. They offered them to the 
JER.19.6	That is why this valley will have a new name’, says the 
JER.19.6	‘At a future time, it will not be called Topheth or Ben-Hinnom Valley. No, it will be called Death Valley.
JER.19.7	Judah and Jerusalem will not grow in the way that they want. In this place, I will cause their enemies to destroy them. They will kill those who live here. I will give their dead bodies to the birds and to the wild animals for food. 
JER.19.8	I will completely destroy this city so that people will be ashamed. Anyone who walks past it will see it. They will see that I have destroyed it. They will think that it did not have any value. That will be because of all its troubles. 
JER.19.9	Enemies who want to kill its people will be all round the city. And its people will not have any food. They will be so hungry that they will eat the dead bodies of their children and of each other.’”’
JER.19.10	Then break the pot that you bought. Break it in front of all those people who are watching you.
JER.19.11	Say to them, ‘The great and powerful 
JER.19.12	I will make this city like Topheth. That is what I will do to this city. And I will do it to those who live here. 
JER.19.13	I will make the houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah full of dead bones like Topheth. I will do that to all the places where they burned nice oils. And I will do that to all the places where they poured drinks. That is because they offered them to the stars in the sky and to other gods.”’
JER.19.14	Jeremiah returned from Topheth where he had given the 
JER.19.15	‘The great and powerful 
JER.20.1	Pashhur, son of Immer, was the leader of the 
JER.20.2	So he caused his men to hit Jeremiah, and to tie him up. They tied him on a seat by the highest gate. That is the gate of Benjamin at the 
JER.20.3	The next day, Pashhur let Jeremiah go. ‘The 
JER.20.4	‘The 
JER.20.5	I will give all the valuable things in the city to the people's enemies. I will give all your valuable things, the things that you have made, to them. They will take all the valuable things of the kings of Judah. They will take them away to Babylon because they have won their fight against you. 
JER.20.6	And they will take you, Pashhur, and everybody who lives in your house, to Babylon. You will die there and all your friends will die there too. You spoke 
JER.20.7	You caused me to believe something that was not true.
JER.20.7	You fought against me.
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I am. And you won.
JER.20.7	Nobody believes the words that I speak. They think all the time that I am a fool.
JER.20.8	Every time that I speak, I have to tell them bad things.
JER.20.8	I shout out that their enemies are all round them.
JER.20.8	And I shout that their enemies will fight. I shout that they will kill them.
JER.20.8	These words of yours make them angry with me.
JER.20.8	So they say bad things about me all the time.
JER.20.9	I want to keep quiet. I do not want to talk about you.
JER.20.9	I tried to do that. I said that I would not speak on your behalf.
JER.20.9	But then your words burned like a fire inside me. They did not give me any rest.
JER.20.9	I am too tired to hold them in. I cannot do it.
JER.20.10	I hear voices that say, ‘Everything round you should make you afraid!
JER.20.10	Let us tell the officers what he is saying.’
JER.20.10	All my friends are waiting for me to make a mistake. They say,
JER.20.10	‘Perhaps we can cause him to believe something that is not true.
JER.20.10	Then we can 
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	So those who are against me will fail. They will not win.
JER.20.11	They will fail completely. They will be very ashamed for all time.
JER.20.11	People will never forget that nobody should 
JER.20.12	Great and powerful 
JER.20.12	You know what they think. They think that they are right.
JER.20.12	Let me see you 
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Give 
JER.20.13	He saves the lives of poor people from the things that bad men do.
JER.20.14	I will put a 
JER.20.14	I do not want the day that I was born ever to be happy.
JER.20.15	I will put a 
JER.20.15	He made my father very happy. He said,
JER.20.15	‘You have a son!’
JER.20.16	I want the 
JER.20.16	The 
JER.20.16	Destroy that man like that.
JER.20.16	I want him to hear people who are crying in the morning.
JER.20.16	I want him to hear the shouts of men who fight at noon.
JER.20.17	The 
JER.20.17	I was not a dead body buried inside my mother.
JER.20.17	That body would have kept her big for her whole life.
JER.20.18	I do not know why I came out from my mother.
JER.20.18	I only get troubles and things that make me sad.
JER.20.18	People will only say bad things about me when I die.
JER.21.1	King Zedekiah sent Pashhur, son of Malchijah, and the 
JER.21.2	‘Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is attacking us’, they said.
JER.21.2	‘Ask the 
JER.21.3	‘Tell Zedekiah’, Jeremiah answered them, ‘that the 
JER.21.4	“You have 
JER.21.5	I will fight against you myself with my own hand. I am very strong and very angry. 
JER.21.6	I will attack all the people who live in this city. I will kill them with a very bad illness, both people and animals”.
JER.21.7	After that, the 
JER.21.8	And tell the people more. Tell them that the 
JER.21.9	Anyone who stays in the city will die from 
JER.21.10	I have decided to hurt this city and not to help it”, says the 
JER.21.10	“I will give it to the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.”
JER.21.11	Then to the king of Judah and to his family, say this:
JER.21.12	“
JER.21.12	You must 
JER.21.12	Perhaps men have taken things from another man.
JER.21.12	Then save that man from those who have taken his things.
JER.21.12	If you do not do that, I will be very, very angry.
JER.21.12	I will be angry because of the bad thing that you have done.
JER.21.12	I will be so angry that my 
JER.21.12	Nobody can put out that fire.
JER.21.13	I am your enemy, people in Jerusalem.
JER.21.13	You live over this valley on a rocky hill”,
JER.21.13	the 
JER.21.13	You say “nobody can attack us.
JER.21.13	Nobody can get into our strong city.”
JER.21.14	But I will 
JER.21.14	says the 
JER.21.14	‘I will light a fire in your trees.
JER.21.14	Then that fire will destroy everything that is round you.’
JER.22.1	‘Go down to the house of the king of Judah’, the 
JER.22.2	“Hear the 
JER.22.3	The 
JER.22.4	If you are careful to obey all these rules, your kings will stay here. The 
JER.22.5	But you will have trouble if you do not obey my rules’, the 
JER.22.6	The 
JER.22.6	‘I will make you like a 
JER.22.6	You may be like Gilead or like the mountains of Lebanon.
JER.22.6	But I will make you like towns where nobody lives.
JER.22.7	I will send enemies against you with their 
JER.22.7	They will cut down your strong walls of wood
JER.22.7	and they will throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	People from many countries will pass by. They will ask, “Why has the 
JER.22.9	Other people will answer, “They have not done what they promised to the 
JER.22.10	Do not cry because the king is dead. Do not be sad that he is gone.
JER.22.10	But cry much for the people that enemies have taken to a foreign country.
JER.22.10	Cry because they will never come back.
JER.22.10	They will never see their own country again.
JER.22.11	The 
JER.22.12	He will die in the place that they have taken him to. They have put him in a prison there. He will not see this country again.’ 
JER.22.13	‘A man might use the bad things that he does to build his 
JER.22.13	But he will never be happy.
JER.22.13	The person who is not fair to his workers will also never be happy.
JER.22.13	He causes people in his own country to work for nothing.
JER.22.13	He does not give to them the money for their work.
JER.22.14	He says, “I will build myself a great 
JER.22.14	I will build rooms on the ground and big rooms over them.
JER.22.14	I will make big windows and I will cover the walls with nice smelling wood.
JER.22.14	I will make it beautiful with red paint.”
JER.22.15	But red wood does not make you a greater king.
JER.22.15	Your father had enough food and drink.
JER.22.15	And he did what was right and fair. So his life was good.
JER.22.16	He helped people who were poor. And he helped those who needed his help.
JER.22.16	So everything was good for you.
JER.22.16	That happens when people know me’,
JER.22.16	the 
JER.22.17	‘But you only want to get rich in ways that are not fair.
JER.22.17	People do not do anything wrong, but you kill them.
JER.22.17	And you cause people to give money to you that is not yours.’
JER.22.18	So the 
JER.22.18	‘They will not be sad when he dies.
JER.22.18	They will not say, “My brother, how sad, my sister.”
JER.22.18	They will not say, “My poor master, how great he was.”
JER.22.19	They will bury him like a dead animal.
JER.22.19	They will pull his dead body to the gate and they will throw it outside Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon and shout.
JER.22.20	Shout loudly in Bashan.
JER.22.20	Shout out from Abarim.
JER.22.20	Shout because all your friends are gone.
JER.22.21	I did tell you that it would happen.
JER.22.21	But you thought that you were safe.
JER.22.21	And you said, “I will not listen!”
JER.22.21	You have been like that since you were young.
JER.22.21	You have not obeyed me.
JER.22.22	Your rulers will leave you, as if the wind had blown them away.
JER.22.22	Enemies will take your friends to a country far away.
JER.22.22	Then you will be ashamed and you will feel sad.
JER.22.22	You will be sorry for all the wrong things that you have done.
JER.22.23	Some of you live in Lebanon in houses of wood that smells nice.
JER.22.23	But you will shout with pain when you start to have troubles.
JER.22.23	It will be like the pain of a woman who is having a baby.’
JER.22.24	‘This is as sure as the fact that I am alive’, says the 
JER.22.25	I will give you to those men that you are afraid of. I will give you to those people who want to kill you. I will give Nebuchadnezzar and the people from Babylon power over you. 
JER.22.26	I will throw you and your mother into another country. I will send you both to a country that you do not know. It is a country where neither of you was born. You will both die there. 
JER.22.27	You will never return to the country where you want to be.’
JER.22.28	This man Coniah must be like a pot that somebody has broken. Nobody seems to want him.
JER.22.28	He and his children will go out into a country that they do not know.
JER.22.29	Country, country, country, listen to the 
JER.22.30	‘Write this man's name. Write it as the name of a man without any children.’
JER.22.30	The 
JER.22.30	‘Nothing good will happen to this man while he lives.
JER.22.30	And no good thing will happen to his 
JER.22.30	Not one 
JER.22.30	None of them will rule in Judah.’
JER.23.1	‘I will cause trouble to the rulers who are destroying my people. They cause them to run away’, the 
JER.23.2	So he says to them, ‘You rulers should 
JER.23.3	‘I myself will fetch all my people who are still alive. I will fetch them from the countries that they ran to. I will bring them back to their own country. There they will have children and they will grow in number.

JER.23.6	When he is ruling, Judah will be safe.
JER.23.6	And Israel will not be afraid then.
JER.23.6	People will give this name to him:
JER.23.6	“The 
JER.23.7	‘People will speak in a new way at a future time’, says the 
JER.23.8	But they will say, “This is as sure as the fact that the 
JER.23.9	I must speak about the 
JER.23.9	My mind is not happy.
JER.23.9	My body feels weak and ill.
JER.23.9	I am like a man who has drunk too much 
JER.23.9	The 
JER.23.10	The country is full of men who have sex with other men's wives.
JER.23.10	Because of that, the country is as dry as dead bones.
JER.23.10	And all the plants in the fields are dead.
JER.23.10	The 
JER.23.10	And they do not use their power in the right way.
JER.23.11	‘And the 
JER.23.11	Even in my 
JER.23.11	says the 
JER.23.12	‘Because of that, I will make it difficult for them to do their work.

JER.23.12	Many bad things will happen to them when I start to

JER.23.13	‘I saw a very bad thing that the 
JER.23.13	They were speaking the name of the 
JER.23.13	They did not tell my people things that were right.
JER.23.13	So they caused them to do wrong things.
JER.23.14	Some 
JER.23.14	were doing wrong things too.
JER.23.14	I saw them having sex with other men's wives.
JER.23.14	But they let people think that they were good.
JER.23.14	They say that it is good for men to do 
JER.23.14	So they let them continue to do things that are wrong.
JER.23.14	They seem as bad to me as were the people in Sodom.
JER.23.14	The people in Jerusalem are as bad as the people in Gomorrah.’ 
JER.23.15	So the great and powerful 
JER.23.15	‘I will cause them to eat food that tastes bad.
JER.23.15	And I will cause them to drink water that will make them ill.
JER.23.15	That is because of the things that the 
JER.23.15	They have caused all the people in the country to turn away from God.’
JER.23.16	The great and powerful 
JER.23.16	‘Do not listen to the words that the 
JER.23.16	They cause you to believe things that are not true.
JER.23.16	They tell you about pictures that they have made in their own minds.
JER.23.16	They do not speak the words that come from the 
JER.23.17	They continue to think that I am worth nothing.
JER.23.17	And they cause other people to think as they think.
JER.23.17	They say that the 
JER.23.17	“You will have 
JER.23.17	Nothing bad will happen to you.”
JER.23.17	Some people refuse to change the things that they are doing.
JER.23.17	But the 
JER.23.18	But none of them has been with the 
JER.23.18	They have not seen him and they have not heard his word.
JER.23.18	They have not listened to him.
JER.23.19	But you will see that the 
JER.23.19	He will be angry like a storm and a strong wind.
JER.23.19	He will knock down people who do wrong things.
JER.23.20	Nothing will cause the 
JER.23.20	He will finish completely everything that he wants to do.
JER.23.20	At a future time, you will understand all of this.
JER.23.21	I did not send these 
JER.23.21	But they have still run to tell their message to you.
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	but they have 
JER.23.22	If they had met with me,
JER.23.22	they would have spoken my words to the people.
JER.23.22	Then my people would have turned away from the things that are wrong.
JER.23.22	They would have stopped doing bad things.
JER.23.23	I can see things that happen a long way away.
JER.23.23	I do not see only what is close to me.
JER.23.24	Nobody can hide in a secret place
JER.23.24	so that I cannot see him’, says the 
JER.23.24	‘I am in all the earth and in all the sky’, says the 
JER.23.25	‘I have heard the things that these 
JER.23.26	They should stop speaking

JER.24.1	Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon took Jeconiah away to Babylon. Jeconiah was the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah. He took with him all Jeconiah's officers and all the men who had clever hands. After that, the 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good fruit, like the first fruit on a tree. The other basket had very bad fruit. It was so bad that nobody could eat it.
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.3	‘
JER.24.4	Then the 
JER.24.5	‘The 
JER.24.6	I will watch them, and I will cause good things to happen to them. I will bring them back to this country. I will build them like a strong building and I will not destroy them. I will put them where they can grow like a plant. And I will not pull them up. 
JER.24.7	I will cause them to want to know me, the 
JER.24.8+JER.24.9	But Zedekiah, his officers and the people who are still in Jerusalem are like the bad 
JER.24.10	I will send soldiers and illness to kill them. They will not have enough food to eat. So I will kill all the people still in the country that I gave to their

JER.25.2	So Jeremiah the 
JER.25.3	‘For 23 years the

JER.25.11	The whole country will be empty and nobody will live here. The people from all these countries will work for 70 years for the king of Babylon. 
JER.25.12	But after the 70 years, I will

JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	The people in Jerusalem and in all the towns in Judah drank from it. And their kings and officers also drank. Then God would break up all their country. He would make it a thing that people would turn away from. People would think that they did not have any value. And they would 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh, king of Egypt and all his officers, his slaves and all his people would drink from the cup. 
JER.25.20	And all the foreign people in Egypt would drink from it too. The kings that must drink from the cup include the kings of Uz and all the kings of Philistia. (The kings of Philistia include the kings of the people in Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron. And they include the king of all the people who are still at Ashdod.) 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab and Ammon 
JER.25.22	and all the kings of Tyre and Sidon would drink, too. The kings of the countries across the sea, 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, and Buz would drink from the cup. And everyone in far places would drink from the cup.

JER.26.22	But King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan, son of Achbor, to Egypt. He went with some other men. 
JER.26.23	They brought Uriah back to King Jehoiakim. The king caused his soldiers to kill Uriah. And they threw his dead body down in the place where they buried poor people.)

JER.28.17	In that same year, in the 7th month, Hananiah the 
JER.29.1	Jeremiah sent a letter from Jerusalem to Babylon. He sent it to the 
JER.29.2	(That was after Nebuchadnezzar had taken King Jeconiah and his mother. He had taken them to Babylon with Jeconiah's officers. The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem and all the men who worked with clever hands had gone with them.) 
JER.29.3	Zedekiah was the king of Judah. He sent some men to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. They were Elasah, son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, son of Hilkiah. Jeremiah gave his letter to them. It said this:

JER.29.5	‘Build houses and get comfortable. Plant gardens. And eat what grows in them. 
JER.29.6	You must marry each other and you must have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons, and let your daughters marry. Then they too can have sons and daughters. I want the numbers of the people of Israel in Babylon to grow more. I do not want them to become fewer.

JER.29.13	You will look for me. And you will find me when you really want to find me.’
JER.29.14	‘You will find me’, says the 
JER.29.15	You may say, ‘The

JER.32.4	Zedekiah, the king, will not be able to run away. They will take him to the king of Babylon and he will see his face. They will speak to each other. 
JER.32.5	Then he will take Zedekiah to Babylon. He will stay there until I come to see him. If you fight against the soldiers from Babylon, you will not win.’ The

JER.32.27	‘I am the 
JER.32.28	So I say this: I will give this city to the soldiers from Babylon. I will give it to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. They will get power over it. 
JER.32.29	The soldiers from Babylon who are attacking it will come in. And they will burn it with fire. They will burn down the houses where people made me angry. There they burned oils that smell nice on their roofs for

JER.32.38	They will be my people and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give the same purpose to all the people. I will do that so that their lives and their children's lives can be good. They will always give

JER.32.42	The 
JER.32.43	Men will buy fields in this country again. You say, “It is an empty country, without people or animals, because the soldiers from Babylon have taken them.” 
JER.32.44	But people will buy fields in this country for 
JER.33.1	Jeremiah was still in the prison in the yard where the king's soldiers were. God spoke to Jeremiah a second time while he was there. He said, 
JER.33.2	‘I am the 
JER.33.3	“Call to me and I will answer you. I will tell you great, strange things that you do not know.” 
JER.33.4	The 
JER.33.5	That was during their 
JER.33.6	But I will make the people in this city well again. I will make my people well. They will enjoy

JER.33.10	The 
JER.33.11	You will hear the voices of men and women who are just married. People will bring gifts to the house of the 
JER.33.11	“Give thanks to the great, powerful 
JER.33.11	because the 
JER.33.11	His love lasts for all time.”
JER.33.11	I will make the country as rich as it was before’, says the 
JER.33.12	The great and powerful 
JER.33.13	 will count their sheep again in the towns among the hills. And they will do that in the towns in the west and in the south. And they will count them in the land of Benjamin. They will do it again in the villages round Jerusalem. And they will count them in the towns in Judah’, says the 
JER.33.14	‘At a future time’, says the 
JER.33.15	David and his 
JER.33.16	At that time, the people from Judah and Jerusalem will come back and they will be safe. People will call the city, “The 
JER.33.17	The 
JER.33.18	And there will always be a

JER.33.21	My promise to David my servant, and to the 
JER.33.22	I will cause David my servant and the

JER.33.25	But the 
JER.33.26	I will never turn away from the 
JER.34.1	Nebuchadnezzar and his army and all the people from all the countries that he ruled were fighting. They were attacking Jerusalem and the towns that were near to it. At this time, Jeremiah heard the 
JER.34.2	‘The 
JER.34.3	You will not be able to run away because his soldiers will certainly catch you. They will give you to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes. And you will speak with him and you will see his face. Then you will go to Babylon.
JER.34.4	But listen to the promise of the 
JER.34.5	but you will die in 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah, the 
JER.34.7	At this time, the king of Babylon and his army were fighting against Judah. He was fighting against Jerusalem and Lachish and Azekah, the cities that he had not got power over yet. They were the only 
JER.34.8	King Zedekiah promised the people in Jerusalem that he would let their slaves go. After that, the 
JER.34.9	The king had said that no 
JER.34.10	All the officers and the people who promised to do that agreed with the king. They would not continue to have male or female slaves. They made them free men and women. 
JER.34.11	But after that, they did not do what they had promised to do. They took the people back and they made them slaves again.
JER.34.12	Then the 
JER.34.13	‘The 
JER.34.14	I said that you must do something. Each 7th year you must let any of your 
JER.34.15	A little time ago, you were sorry that you had not obeyed me. I had said that you must do a good thing. And you did it. Each man made his 
JER.34.16	But now you have turned back to your old ways. You have taken away my 
JER.34.17	So the 
JER.34.18	I will do this to the men who did not obey me. They will be like an animal that people offer to me. They will be like the young cow that they cut in half. They cut it in half so that they could walk between the pieces.’ 
JER.34.19	‘I will 
JER.34.20	I will give to their enemies power over them. The enemies will kill them and I will give their dead bodies to the birds and wild animals for food.’ 
JER.34.21	‘I will give Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his officers to the enemies who want to kill them. The army of the king of Babylon has left you. But I will give to them power over Zedekiah and his officers. 
JER.34.22	I will tell their army that they must return to this city. They will fight and they will get power over it. And they will burn it down. And I will destroy the towns in Judah so that nobody can live there.’
JER.35.1	The 
JER.35.2	‘Go to Rechab's 
JER.35.3	So I went to get all Rechab's 
JER.35.4	I took them into a room in the 
JER.35.5	Then I took some bowls of

JER.35.7	And you must not build houses, or plant seed or 
JER.35.8+JER.35.9	We have obeyed all the rules that our 
JER.35.10	We have obeyed completely all our 
JER.35.11	But, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came into this country, we came to Jerusalem. We said, “We must go to Jerusalem. We must save ourselves from the armies of Babylon and Aram.” So we stayed in Jerusalem.’
JER.35.12	Then the 
JER.35.13	‘The great, powerful 
JER.35.14	Jonadab, Rechab's son, said that his 
JER.35.15	I have sent my servants the 
JER.35.16	The 
JER.35.17	So the great and powerful 
JER.35.18	Then Jeremiah spoke to the 
JER.35.19	So the great and powerful 
JER.36.1	The 
JER.36.2	‘Write down all the words that I have spoken to you about Israel, Judah and the other countries. I began to speak to you when Josiah was king. Write everything that I have said from that time until now. 
JER.36.3	Perhaps the people of Israel will listen to my words. Perhaps they will hear about all the 
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah asked Baruch, son of Neriah to come. While Jeremiah spoke all the 
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah said to Baruch, ‘They will not let me go to the 
JER.36.6	So you must go to the 
JER.36.7	Perhaps they will ask the 
JER.36.8	Baruch, son of Neriah, did everything that Jeremiah the 
JER.36.9	The king said that he wanted the people to 
JER.36.10	Baruch stood in the room of Gemariah the 
JER.36.11	Micaiah, son of Gemariah, heard all the words of the 
JER.36.12	Then he went to the 
JER.36.13	Micaiah told everything that he had heard to them. He heard it when Baruch read to the people. 
JER.36.14	The officers sent Jehudi to speak to Baruch. (Jehudi's father was Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi.) They said, ‘Bring the piece of skin with the words that you read to the people. And come here.’ So Baruch, Neriah's son, went to them and he took the skin with him. 
JER.36.15	‘Please sit down and read it to us’, they said. So Baruch read it to them.
JER.36.16	They heard the words that Baruch had written. And they became afraid. They looked at each other and they said to Baruch, ‘We must tell the king what these words say.’ 
JER.36.17	They asked Baruch, ‘How did you write these words? Did you write them down as Jeremiah spoke them to you?’
JER.36.18	‘Yes’, said Baruch, ‘he spoke the words and I wrote them in ink on this skin.’
JER.36.19	‘You and Jeremiah go and hide yourselves’, the officers said to Baruch. ‘Do not tell anyone where you are.’
JER.36.20	The officers put the skin into Elishama's room. Elishama was the 
JER.36.21	They told the king about the skin on which Baruch had written God's words. So, he sent Jehudi to fetch it. Jehudi brought the skin from the room of Elishama the 
JER.36.22	The king was in his winter rooms. A fire was burning because it was the 9th month. 
JER.36.23	Jehudi read a small part of the words that Baruch had written on the skin. Then the king took a knife and he cut off that part of the skin. He threw it into the fire. Soon he had burned all the skin in the fire. 
JER.36.24	Neither the king nor the officers who were with him were afraid. And they did not want to show that they were sorry. So they did not tear their clothes. 
JER.36.25	Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah asked the king not to burn the skin on which Baruch had written. But he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	Instead, the king told his son Jerahmeel that he should take Baruch the 
JER.36.27	So the king burnt the piece of skin on which Baruch had written Jeremiah's words. After that, the 
JER.36.28	‘Take another piece of skin’, he said. ‘Write on it all the words that were on the other skin. That was the skin that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. 
JER.36.29	Also say to the king, “You burned the skin. And you asked why I wrote such bad things about Judah. You did not believe that the king of Babylon would come to destroy this country. You did not think that he would take both men and animals away from it.” 
JER.36.30	So the 
JER.36.31	His children and his servants have done bad things. I will 
JER.36.32	So Jeremiah took another piece of skin and he gave it to the 
JER.37.1	Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon would not let Coniah, son of Jehoiakim continue to be king of Judah. He chose Josiah's son Zedekiah to be the king of Judah instead. 
JER.37.2	Zedekiah did not listen to the words of the 
JER.37.3	But King Zedekiah sent a message to Jeremiah the 
JER.37.4	Jeremiah was a free man at this time. They had not yet put him into the prison. He could walk among the people. 
JER.37.5	The army of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had marched out of Egypt. People told the soldiers from Babylon who were round Jerusalem about that. So they went away.
JER.37.6	Then the 
JER.37.7	‘Speak to the king of Judah, who sent you to ask for my help’, he said. ‘Say to him, “Pharaoh's army, which marched out to help you, will turn back. They will return to Egypt, their own country. 
JER.37.8	Then the soldiers from Babylon will return and they will attack this city. They will get power over it and they will burn it completely.”
JER.37.9	The 
JER.37.10	You might win the fight against the whole army that is attacking you. There might be only sick men in their 
JER.37.11	The army from Babylon had left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army. 
JER.37.12	So Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the land of Benjamin. He wanted to visit his part of the country that was among his people. 
JER.37.13	When he came to the Benjamin gate of the city, Irijah, Shelemiah's son, stopped him. He was the captain of the soldiers at the gate. And he put Jeremiah into the prison. ‘You are going to join the soldiers from Babylon!’ he said. 
JER.37.14	‘That is not true!’ said Jeremiah. ‘I am not going to join the soldiers from Babylon.’ But Irijah would not listen to him. So he took Jeremiah, his 
JER.37.15	The officers were angry with Jeremiah. They hit him with a stick and they put him in the house of Jonathan the 
JER.37.16	They put Jeremiah in a small room with a high ceiling. It was deep under the house. He stayed there for a long time. 
JER.37.17	Then King Zedekiah sent for him and he brought him to his house. When they were alone, the king asked him, ‘Is there any message from the 
JER.37.17	‘Yes’, Jeremiah replied, ‘they will deliver you to the hands of the king of Babylon.’
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah spoke to King Zedekiah. ‘I do not know what bad things I have done to you or to your officers. I do not know why you have put me into the prison. 
JER.37.19	Your 
JER.37.20	I want you to help me. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the 
JER.37.21	Then King Zedekiah told his officers to put Jeremiah into the yard of his house with his soldiers. He told them to give bread from the bakers to him until there was no more bread in the city. So Jeremiah stayed in the yard with the soldiers.
JER.38.1	Some men heard the things that Jeremiah was telling all the people. They were Pashhur's son Shephatiah, Shelemiah's son Jehucal and Malchijah's son Pashhur. 
JER.38.2	Jeremiah had told the people that the 
JER.38.3	And the 
JER.38.4	Then the officers spoke to the king. ‘You should kill this man’, they said. ‘He is making the soldiers who remain in the city afraid. And the people are becoming afraid because of the things that he is saying to them. This man does not want to help these people. He wants to destroy them.’
JER.38.5	‘You can do what you want to do’, King Zedekiah said. ‘I cannot stop you.’
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah. And they put him in a big hole in the yard where the soldiers were. Malchijah, the king's son had made the hole to store water. They tied a long piece of 
JER.38.7	Ebed-Melech was an officer in the king's house. He came from the country called Ethiopia. People told him that other people had put Jeremiah into the hole in the yard. 
JER.38.8	He went out of the king's house and he spoke to the king. The king was sitting in the Benjamin gate of the city. 
JER.38.9	‘My master, the king’, he said. ‘these men have done very bad things to Jeremiah the 
JER.38.10	Then the king told Ebed-Melech what he should do. ‘Take 30 men with you’, he said. ‘And lift Jeremiah the 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-Melech took the men with him. He went to a room under the king's house and he found some old clothes and some pieces of cloth. He tied them to 
JER.38.12	‘Put these clothes under your arms’, he said. ‘Then tie the 
JER.38.13	Then they pulled Jeremiah out of the hole. And he stayed in the yard with the soldiers.
JER.38.14	Then King Zedekiah sent 
JER.38.15	‘If I give an answer to you, you may kill me’, Jeremiah said to the king. ‘I might tell you the things that you should do. But you would not listen to me.’
JER.38.16	But King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah. ‘I believe that the 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah spoke to Zedekiah. ‘The great and powerful 
JER.38.18	But you must let those officers get power over your 
JER.38.19	‘I am afraid of the 
JER.38.20	‘They will not give you to those 
JER.38.21	But if you do not give power over your 
JER.38.22	Your enemies will bring out all the women in the king of Judah's house. They will give them to the officers of the king of Babylon. Those women will say this to you:
JER.38.22	“You have believed the words of your friends. But they have said to you things that are not true.
JER.38.22	Your feet are stuck in the ground and your friends have left you alone.”
JER.38.23	The officers from Babylon will give all your wives and children to the soldiers from Babylon. You yourself will not get away. The king of Babylon will make you his 
JER.38.24	‘Do not tell anyone what we have talked about’, Zedekiah said to Jeremiah. ‘If you do tell them, you might die. 
JER.38.25	My officers may come. And they may ask you what we talked about. They may want to kill you if you do not tell them. 
JER.38.26	So say, “I was asking the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house where I might die.” ’
JER.38.27	All the officers did come to Jeremiah to ask about his meeting with the king. And he said everything that the king had told him to say. Nobody had heard what Jeremiah and the king had really said. So the officers did not ask him again.
JER.38.28	And Jeremiah stayed in the yard where the soldiers were. He stayed there until the day when the soldiers from Babylon got power over Jerusalem.
JER.39.1	This is how the soldiers of the king of Babylon got power over Jerusalem. After King Zedekiah had ruled Judah for eight years, Nebuchadnezzar marched to Jerusalem. His whole army went round the city to attack it. 
JER.39.2	And 10 years, 4 months and 9 days after Zedekiah had become king, soldiers from Babylon attacked Jerusalem. And they broke through the walls of the city. 
JER.39.3	Then the officers of the king of Babylon came into the city. And they sat in the Middle Gate. They were Nergal-Sar-Ezer, Samgar-Nebu, Sar-Sekim, an important officer and Nergal-Sar-Ezer, another important officer. There were also all the other officers of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.4	Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all his soldiers ran away when they saw them. They left the city at night, through the king's garden. They left through the gate between the two walls. And then they ran towards the flat land called the Arabah.
JER.39.5	But the soldiers from Babylon ran after them. And they caught them on the flat land near Jericho. They took Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He was at Riblah in the place called Hamath. 
JER.39.6	In that place, Nebuchadnezzar decided how he would 
JER.39.7	Then the soldiers destroyed Zedekiah's eyes. Then they put metal rings round his legs and they tied them together. Then they took him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	The soldiers from Babylon burned the king's house and the people's houses. They broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the king's own special soldiers, took away all the people who remained in Jerusalem. He took them as 
JER.39.10	But captain Nebuzaradan let some very poor people, who had nothing, remain in Judah. At that time he gave fields to them. Some of those fields had 
JER.39.11	Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had told Nebuzaradan, captain of his own soldiers, about Jeremiah. 
JER.39.12	‘Take him and be good to him. Do not hurt him. And do anything that he asks you to do’, he had said. 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan, an important officer called Nebushazban, Nergal-Sar-Ezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylon obeyed Nebuchadnezzar. 
JER.39.14	They sent for Jeremiah and they took him out of the yard. It was where Zedekiah's soldiers had put him. Then Gedaliah, who was Ahikam's son and Shaphan's grandson, took Jeremiah back to his own home. So Jeremiah stayed with his own people.
JER.39.15	The 
JER.39.16	‘Go. And tell Ebed-Melech from Ethiopia, this’, the 
JER.39.17	But I will save you on that day. They will not give you to the people that you are afraid of. 
JER.39.18	I will save you and soldiers will not kill you. You believed that I could keep you safe. So I will keep you safe, says the 
JER.40.1	Nebuzaradan, captain of the king's special soldiers, found Jeremiah at Ramah. They had tied him up with all the 
JER.40.2	Nebuzaradan said to Jeremiah, ‘The 
JER.40.3	And now, your God has done that. He has done all that he promised. He did that because your people did not obey the 
JER.40.4	But today I am taking off the 
JER.40.5	But before Jeremiah left, Nebuzaradan said, ‘Return to Gedaliah, who is Ahikam's son and Shaphan's grandson, and to the people. The king of Babylon has chosen Gedaliah to rule over the towns in Judah. Live with Gedaliah and all the people there. Or you can go to any other place that you want to go to.’
JER.40.5	Then Nebuzaradan gave food and a gift to Jeremiah and he let him go. 
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, at Mizpah. He stayed there with him and with the people who remained in Judah.
JER.40.7	Some 
JER.40.8	Some army officers and their men came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Nethaniah's son Ishmael, and Johanan and Jonathan, who were Kareah's sons. They came with Seraiah, who was Tanhumeth's son. The sons of Ephai from Netophah came. And the son of Jaazaniah from Maachah and their men also came.
JER.40.9	Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, saw that they were afraid. So he said, ‘Do not be afraid to be servants to the soldiers from Babylon. Stay here and 
JER.40.10	I myself will stay with you. I will speak on your behalf when the men from Babylon come. But you can take in the summer fruits and the food seeds and you can make 
JER.40.11	People told this news to the 
JER.40.12	So all those 
JER.40.13	Kareah's son Johanan and all the officers that were in the fields came to Gedaliah. 
JER.40.14	‘You should know that Baalis, king of Ammon, has sent Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, to kill you’, they said to him. But Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, did not believe them.
JER.40.15	Johanan, son of Kareah, went to speak to Gedaliah secretly. ‘Let me go and kill Ishmael, son of Nethaniah. And nobody will know about it’, he said. ‘We should not let him kill you. There are many 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, spoke to Johanan, son of Kareah. ‘Do not do anything like that’, he said. ‘The things that you are saying about Ishmael are not true.’
JER.41.1	Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, came to Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, at Mizpah in the 7th month. Ishmael was a 
JER.41.2	During the meal, Ishmael and his 10 men stood up and they killed Gedaliah, Ahikam's son. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. They killed Gedaliah with their 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed the 
JER.41.4+JER.41.5	The day after Gedaliah died, 80 
JER.41.6	Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was crying while he went. ‘Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam’, he said, when he met them. 
JER.41.7	They came into the city. Then Nethaniah's son Ishmael and the men who were with him killed them. They threw their dead bodies into a hole in the ground. 
JER.41.8	But 10 men said, ‘Do not kill us! We have 
JER.41.9	He had thrown Gedaliah's body into a hole that King Asa had dug. Asa had dug many holes to save himself from Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled this hole with dead bodies.
JER.41.10	Ishmael caused all the other people who were in Mizpah to become his 
JER.41.11	People told Johanan, Kareah's son, and the army officers with him about the bad things that Ishmael had done. 
JER.41.12	So they took all their men and they went to fight Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. They found him near the big pool in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	All the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan and the soldiers with him. They were happy when they saw them. 
JER.41.14	All the people that Ishmael had taken as 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, ran away from Johanan. He and 8 men went to Ammon.
JER.41.16	Johanan, Kareah's son, and the officers with him took away the people who had come from Mizpah. They were the people that he had saved from Ishmael, son of Nethaniah. Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. These people were the soldiers, women, children and officers that Johanan brought from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	These people went towards Egypt. They stopped at Geruth-Chimham on the way to Egypt. That is near Bethlehem. 
JER.41.18	They wanted to run away from the soldiers from Babylon. They were afraid because Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah. And the king of Babylon had said that Gedaliah should rule Israel.
JER.42.1	Then all the army officers and the people went to speak to Jeremiah the 
JER.42.2	‘Please listen to us and pray for us’, they said. ‘Pray to the 
JER.42.3	Ask the 
JER.42.4	‘I have heard you’, Jeremiah the 
JER.42.5	‘We will do everything that the 
JER.42.6	‘We have asked you to pray to the 
JER.42.7	Ten days after that, the 
JER.42.8	So Jeremiah brought Johanan, son of Kareah, and the soldiers and all the people together. He brought together all the people who were with him. He brought the important people and those who were not important. 
JER.42.9	‘You sent me to the 
JER.42.10	‘If you will stay in this country, I will build you up. I will plant you like a seed and you will grow. I will not pull you up and I will not kill you. I am sad about the way that I hurt you. That is why I will do this. 
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon. You are afraid of him now but do not be afraid of him’, says the 
JER.42.12	I will be kind to him. So then he will be kind to you and he will give your country back to you.’
JER.42.13	‘But you may not obey the 
JER.42.14	You may say, “No, we will go to live in Egypt where we will not have to fight. And we will have enough food there.” 
JER.42.15	Then listen to me, you few people from Judah who remain here. The great and powerful 
JER.42.16	you will die there. The soldiers that you are afraid of will kill you. Or you will not have enough food. 
JER.42.17	But all the people who decide to go to make their home in Egypt will die there. Soldiers will kill some of them. I will cause other people to die because they become ill. And other people will die because they do not have any food. Nobody will save any of them from the trouble that I will send. 
JER.42.18	The great and powerful 
JER.42.19	You people from Judah that are still here, I am speaking to you. The 
JER.42.20	You made a bad mistake when you asked me to pray to the 
JER.42.21	I told you today, but you still have not obeyed the 
JER.42.22	I will tell you something. You will die in the place where you want to live. Soldiers may kill you. Or you may die because you are ill. Or you will die because you do not have any food.’
JER.43.1	So Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	Then Hoshaiah's son Azariah and Kareah's son Johanan and some other men spoke to Jeremiah. All those men thought that they knew everything. They thought that they were better than other people. ‘You are speaking 
JER.43.3	But you are doing what Baruch, son of Neriah, wants. He is against us. He wants the soldiers from Babylon to kill us or to take us as 
JER.43.4	So Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the officers in the army did not obey the 
JER.43.5	Instead, Johanan and the officers led the people away from Judah. These were the few people who had returned to Judah. They had come from all the countries where their enemies had sent them. 
JER.43.6	They took with them the men, women and children and the king's daughters. Nebuzaradan, the captain of Nebuchadnezzar's special soldiers, had let those people remain with Gedaliah. (Gedaliah was Ahikam's son and Shaphan's grandson.) And Nebuzaradan had let Jeremiah the

JER.44.4	Again and again I sent my servants the 
JER.44.5	But the people did not listen to my words and they did not obey me. They did not stop doing wrong things. And they did not stop making nice smells to give pleasure to other gods. 
JER.44.6	So I became very angry. I 
JER.44.7	Now the great and powerful 
JER.44.8	You are making me very angry by the things that you have made with your hands. You are making nice smells to give pleasure to the gods of Egypt where you have come to live. Those things will destroy your 
JER.44.9	You must remember the 
JER.44.10	Even now your people have not become sorry. They have not agreed that they have done wrong things. They have not given any

JER.44.12	I will take away the few 
JER.44.13	I will 
JER.44.14	None of the few people from Judah who went to live in Egypt will return. They want very much to return to Judah. But not one 
JER.44.15	A large crowd came together from all the places in Egypt where they lived. The men knew that their wives were burning nice smelling oils to other gods. And there were many women with them. They spoke to Jeremiah. 
JER.44.16	‘You have said that the 
JER.44.17	‘We will certainly do everything that we want to do. We will make nice smells for the Queen of

JER.45.1	Baruch wrote down on a 
JER.45.2	these words that the

JER.45.4	Then the 
JER.45.5	You may want to be very important. Do not want that. I will 
JER.46.1	The 
JER.46.2	This is the message against the army of King Neco of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's king, fought with them at Carchemish on the River Euphrates. Nebuchadnezzar won that fight in the 4th year after Josiah's son Jehoiakim became king of Judah.
JER.46.3	‘Get ready to march to the fight!
JER.46.3	Prepare your 
JER.46.4	Make the horses ready to obey you.
JER.46.4	Stand ready with hard hats on your heads.
JER.46.4	Make sharp the knives that you throw.
JER.46.4	Put on strong clothes of leather and metal.
JER.46.5	I see that the army are afraid.
JER.46.5	They are running away.
JER.46.5	Their soldiers have not won the fight.
JER.46.5	They are running away fast.
JER.46.5	They do not look behind them.
JER.46.5	Everything round them makes them afraid’,
JER.46.5	says the 
JER.46.6	But they cannot run as fast as they need to run.
JER.46.6	The strong men cannot run away.
JER.46.6	They are falling by the River Euphrates.
JER.46.6	In the north, they fall down.
JER.46.7	A country is rising up.
JER.46.7	It rises like the great waters of the River Nile.
JER.46.8	Egypt is rising like the River Nile,
JER.46.8	like rivers of fast waters.
JER.46.8	Egypt says, ‘I will rise up and I will cover the earth.
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and I will kill their people.’
JER.46.9	The horses run fast.
JER.46.9	Men in their 
JER.46.9	The soldiers continue to march.
JER.46.9	Men from Ethiopia and Put are carrying their 
JER.46.9	Men from the people called Lydians are bringing their bows.
JER.46.10	But that day is a day when the 
JER.46.10	He is angry with his enemies and he will 
JER.46.10	His soldiers will kill with their 
JER.46.10	They will kill many people.
JER.46.10	They will be like a hungry man. He eats until he is not still hungry.
JER.46.10	The 
JER.46.10	He will offer them in a place in the north by the River Euphrates.
JER.46.11	Go to Gilead to get medicine to make you well.
JER.46.11	Go, you young women in Egypt.
JER.46.11	But many medicines will not make you better.
JER.46.11	Nothing will make you well.
JER.46.12	All countries will see that you are ashamed.
JER.46.12	All the people on earth will hear you when you cry.
JER.46.12	Two soldiers will knock against each other.
JER.46.12	They will fall down together.
JER.46.13	This is the message that the 
JER.46.14	‘Tell this to the people in Egypt and shout it in Migdol.
JER.46.14	And tell it to the people in Memphis and in Tahpanhes.
JER.46.14	“Get ready to fight because they are killing all the people round you.”
JER.46.15	Enemies will knock down your soldiers.
JER.46.15	They cannot stand because the 
JER.46.16	They will go on falling.
JER.46.16	They will fall over each other.
JER.46.16	They will say, “Get up. Let us return to our own people and to our own country.
JER.46.16	We want to run from these fights and from our enemies.”
JER.46.17	When they get back they will shout,
JER.46.17	“The king of Egypt is weak. He is like a loud noise.
JER.46.17	He is too late to win the fight.” ’
JER.46.18	The King, the great and powerful 
JER.46.18	‘I am giving a promise to you. Someone will come who will be great.
JER.46.18	He will be as great among men as Tabor and Carmel are great among the mountains.
JER.46.19	You people who live in Egypt, pack your things ready to go to a far country.
JER.46.19	They will destroy Memphis. Its buildings will lie in pieces and nobody will live there.
JER.46.20	Egypt is like a good cow that a fly from the north is coming to hurt.
JER.46.21	Egypt has bought soldiers. But they are like animals that men are ready to kill.
JER.46.21	They will run away together. They will not stand and fight.
JER.46.21	Now the day is coming when the 
JER.46.22	Egypt's people will run from the enemy when many men come near to attack it.
JER.46.22	They will attack it with axes.
JER.46.22	They will be like men who cut down trees,
JER.46.23	to destroy thick forests’, says the 
JER.46.23	‘There are too many enemies to count.
JER.46.23	They are like many insects that seem like a great cloud.

JER.46.24	The people from the north will make them their 
JER.46.25	‘Now I will 
JER.46.26	I will give them to those who want to kill them. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers will take them’, says the great and powerful 
JER.46.27	‘Do not be afraid, my servant Jacob. Do not be afraid of trouble, Israel.

JER.47.2	They will cover the towns and the people who live in them.
JER.47.2	The people will shout. All the people who live in the country will cry.
JER.47.3	They will cry when they hear the sound of horses
JER.47.3	and the noise of their enemies' war 
JER.47.3	They will hear them when they are coming.
JER.47.3	Fathers will not turn to help their children.
JER.47.3	Their hands will not move.
JER.47.4	This is the day when God will kill all the 
JER.47.4	He will not let anybody live to help Tyre and Sidon.
JER.47.4	The 
JER.47.4	He will remove those who remain by the sea. He will remove them from the country called Caphtor.
JER.47.5	The people in Gaza will be very sad.

JER.47.6	‘You shout to the 
JER.47.6	We want it to stop!

JER.48.1	‘I will cause the people in Nebo city to cry, because I will destroy it.
JER.48.1	The people in Kiriathaim city will be ashamed and its enemies will get power over it.
JER.48.1	They will break its strong buildings, and its people will be ashamed.
JER.48.2	Nobody will again say good things about Moab.
JER.48.2	In Heshbon, men will think about how they can destroy Moab.
JER.48.2	They will say, “Let us completely destroy that 
JER.48.2	And the town called Madmen will become completely quiet.
JER.48.3	You will hear sad voices from Horonaim.
JER.48.3	Its people will be afraid. And they will cry while enemies destroy it.

JER.48.34	It reaches from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-Shelishiyah.
JER.48.34	Even the River Nimrim has become dry.
JER.48.35	The people in Moab 
JER.48.35	They offer food to them on the high places.
JER.48.35	They burn nice smelling oils to their gods.
JER.48.35	I will cause them to stop that’, says the 
JER.48.36	‘So I am very, very sad for the people in Moab.
JER.48.36	I will sing a sad song.
JER.48.36	It is a song for the men in Kir-Heres

JER.48.45	And it burns the heads of the drunks who make a lot of noise.
JER.48.46	Cry, you people in Moab!
JER.48.46	I have destroyed the people of Chemosh.
JER.48.46	The enemy has taken your sons to a far country.

JER.49.37	They will run away from those who attack them.

JER.50.8+JER.50.9	Be the first people to leave Babylon.
JER.50.10	Enemies will take all the things that they want from Babylon.
JER.50.10	Every enemy will have enough things’, says the 
JER.50.11	‘Listen, you people who take away my things.

JER.50.14	All you men who can shoot 
JER.50.14	stand round Babylon.
JER.50.14	Shoot at it! Use all your

JER.50.15	Its people will let you get power over it. Its strong buildings will fall.
JER.50.15	You will pull down its walls.
JER.50.15	That is how the 
JER.50.15	You must do to them what they have done to other people.
JER.50.16	Do not let anyone remain in Babylon to work on the land.
JER.50.16	And do not let anyone remain to get food from the fields at the proper time.
JER.50.16	All the foreign workers will return to their own 
JER.50.16	All those workers will run away to their own country.
JER.50.17	Israel is like a group of sheep that have all run to different places.
JER.50.17	They ran away because 
JER.50.17	The first to eat them was the king of Assyria.
JER.50.17	The man who finished the meal was Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.’

JER.50.23	But now enemies have broken it into small pieces.
JER.50.23	It is now alone among the

JER.50.24	And now I have caught you!
JER.50.24	Your enemies found you and they got power over you. They got power over you because you did not obey the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.25	He has taken out the

JER.50.26	They will break open the places where people had put their food.
JER.50.26	They will break its buildings into pieces.
JER.50.26	They will destroy it completely. Nothing will still be there.
JER.50.27	They will kill all its young male cows.
JER.50.27	They will be sorry. They will all die. It is time for me to 
JER.50.28	‘People have run away from Babylon to

JER.50.29	You must 
JER.50.29	Do to them as they did to you.
JER.50.29	Do that because they 
JER.50.30	So, on that day, their young men will die in their streets.
JER.50.30	Then none of their soldiers will be able to fight’, says the 
JER.50.31	‘You think that you are very important.
JER.50.31	But you will see that I am against you’, says the great and powerful 
JER.50.31	‘That is because the day for your

JER.50.32	I will make a fire in your towns to burn up all who are near to it.’
JER.50.33	The great and powerful 
JER.50.33	‘You have been cruel to the people from Israel and Judah.
JER.50.33	You have taken them as 
JER.50.33	and you will not let them go.
JER.50.34	But the powerful 
JER.50.34	He will come to 
JER.50.34	He will fight hard to save them.
JER.50.34	Then their country will have rest.
JER.50.34	But Babylon's people will not have any rest.’
JER.50.35	‘I am sending an army against Babylon’, says the 
JER.50.35	‘I am against those who live in Babylon.
JER.50.35	And I am against its officers and its clever men.

JER.50.36	My 
JER.50.37	My army will attack its horses and its 
JER.50.37	and foreign men who fight for it.
JER.50.37	They will be as weak as women.
JER.50.37	I will cause them to give their valuable things to you.
JER.50.37	You will take them away.
JER.50.38	I will not send any rain and so its wet places will become dry places.
JER.50.38	Their country is full of 
JER.50.38	Their 
JER.50.39	Wild animals, including wild dogs, will live there.
JER.50.39	Birds that fly at night will live there, too.
JER.50.39	Men will never live there again.
JER.50.39	Nobody's sons or grandsons will live there.
JER.50.40	God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.50.40	and the towns near to them’, says the 
JER.50.40	‘Babylon will be like those towns,
JER.50.40	so nobody will live there, not one man.
JER.50.41	Look. You will see an army that is coming from the north.
JER.50.41	A great

JER.50.42	They have bows and knives that they throw.
JER.50.42	They are cruel and they are not kind.
JER.50.42	They make a noise like the moving sea while they ride on their horses.
JER.50.42	They are an army that is ready to attack you, people in Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard about them.
JER.50.43	He is weak because he is afraid.
JER.50.43	He feels pain like the pain of a woman who is having a baby.
JER.50.44	I will be like a 
JER.50.44	that is coming out of the woods by the River Jordan.
JER.50.44	I will come into your rich fields.
JER.50.44	I will soon cause the people in Babylon to run from their country.
JER.50.44	I will choose a man to do that, and nobody can stand against me.
JER.50.44	Nobody can stop me.’
JER.50.45	So now listen to the things that the 
JER.50.45	Hear about the things that he will do to their country.
JER.50.45	He will pull the young children away from their mothers.
JER.50.45	And he will completely destroy their good country
JER.50.45	because of the bad things that they have done.
JER.50.46	All the people in the world will hear how your people got power over Babylon.

JER.51.9	We would have made Babylon well if we could.
JER.51.9	But nobody can make it well.
JER.51.9	We will leave it and each person will go to his own country.
JER.51.9	Its 
JER.51.9	It is as great as how far the sky is from the earth.

JER.51.58	The 
JER.51.58	All the things that the 
JER.51.59	This is the message that Jeremiah gave to the officer Seraiah. He was the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah. Seraiah gave it when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah, Judah's king. It was in the 4th year of his rule. 
JER.51.60	Jeremiah had written his message on a piece of clean dry skin. He had written down all the 
JER.51.61	Jeremiah spoke to Seraiah. He said, ‘When you reach Babylon, certainly read all these words aloud. 
JER.51.62	Then say, “
JER.51.63	When you have finished reading all the words, tie a big stone to the skin. And throw the stone and the skin into the River Euphrates. 
JER.51.64	Then say, “Babylon will go down like that stone and it will never rise again. I will cause all these bad things. Its people will be too tired and too weak to do anything about it.” ’
JER.51.64	That is the end of Jeremiah's words.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah. She came from Libnah. 
JER.52.2	Zedekiah did not obey the 
JER.52.3	The 
JER.52.4	So Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army marched against Jerusalem. That was when Zedekiah had been king for almost 9 years, on the 10th day of the 10th month. The army stayed outside the city. They built hills round it so that they could attack it from those hills. 
JER.52.5	The army stayed there until the 11th year of King Zedekiah.
JER.52.6	By the 9th day of the 4th month there was no food in the city. The people had nothing to eat. 
JER.52.7	The soldiers from Babylon broke down part of the city's wall. The whole army of Judah ran away at night. They went out between the two walls near the king's garden. The soldiers from Babylon were still round the city. The 
JER.52.8	But the soldiers from Babylon ran after King Zedekiah. They caught him near Jericho. All his soldiers ran different ways 
JER.52.9	and the enemy caught Zedekiah.
JER.52.9	They took him to the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar the king was at Riblah in the country called Hamath. There Nebuchadnezzar decided what to do to him. 
JER.52.10	At Riblah, he killed all Zedekiah's sons in front of their father's eyes. He also killed all the officers of Judah. 
JER.52.11	Then he took out Zedekiah's eyes and he tied him with metal 
JER.52.12	Nebuzaradan, the leader of the king's special soldiers, came to Jerusalem. It was the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule. He came on the 10th day of the 5th month. 
JER.52.13	He burned the 
JER.52.14	He told the whole army to break down the walls round Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	Nebuzaradan took away some of the very poor people and those who remained in the city. And he also took those who had clever hands. 
JER.52.16	But he let the poorest people stay to work with the 
JER.52.17	The soldiers from Babylon broke up all the big things of 
JER.52.18	And they took away all the small 
JER.52.19	The leader of the king's soldiers took all the bowls. And he took all the things that people had made from gold or from 
JER.52.20	They had a lot of 
JER.52.21	The metal parts of the doors were more than 6 metres high and 4 metres round. Each was as thick as 4 fingers and they were empty inside. 
JER.52.22	Over each of these two parts there were two very beautiful metal tops nearly two metres high. 
JER.52.23	They had 96 
JER.52.24	Nebuchadnezzar's captain took Seraiah the leader of the 
JER.52.25	He also took the most important officer of the soldiers who remained in the city. Seven men had helped Judah's king to decide what he should do. Nebuchadnezzar's captain took them also. He took away the most important man who chose men to become soldiers and 60 of his helpers.
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan, Nebuchadnezzar's most important officer, took all those men to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	There, at Riblah in the country called Hamath, the king's soldiers killed all those men.
JER.52.27	So he took the people from Judah to live as 
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people that Nebuchadnezzar took away:
JER.52.28	He took 3023 
JER.52.29	He took 832 people from Jerusalem in his 18th year.
JER.52.30	And he took 745 
JER.52.30	So Nebuzaradan, Nebuchadnezzar's captain, took 4600 people away.
JER.52.31	Jehoiachin had been in prison for 37 years when Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon. Evil-Merodach let Jehoiachin king of Judah go free. He let him go out from the prison on the 25th day of the 12th month. 
JER.52.32	He spoke kind words to him. He gave to him a more important place than the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin took off the clothes that he had worn in the prison. And he ate his food at the king's table until the day that he died. 
JER.52.34	The king of Babylon gave something to Jehoiachin every day until he died.
LAM.1.1	The city that was full of people is lonely now.
LAM.1.1	The city is like the wife of a dead husband.
LAM.1.1	Once she was great.
LAM.1.1	She was like a queen among the other places in the country.
LAM.1.1	Now she is a slave. 
LAM.1.2	She weeps in the night
LAM.1.2	and there are 
LAM.1.2	Not one of her lovers will help her to feel better.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have left her.
LAM.1.2	They have gone against her and they are now her enemies. 
LAM.1.3	The enemies have taken 
LAM.1.3	The slaves have only trouble and difficult work.
LAM.1.3	They now live among strangers.
LAM.1.3	They have no rest, and they live far away from home.
LAM.1.3	They cannot go away from those who do cruel things to them. 
LAM.1.4	Nobody comes to 
LAM.1.4	There is nothing to hear at the city gates.
LAM.1.4	The 
LAM.1.4	Strangers are cruel to the young women.
LAM.1.4	The people in 
LAM.1.5	The people's enemies rule them now.
LAM.1.5	Those who 
LAM.1.5	The 
LAM.1.5	because they did so many wrong things.
LAM.1.5	The enemies took the children away to work as slaves.
LAM.1.6	Her leaders are like animals without food.
LAM.1.6	They are too weak to run from their enemies.
LAM.1.7	So, they remember the good things
LAM.1.7	that they had a long time ago.
LAM.1.7	When their enemies came, nobody was there with them.
LAM.1.7	Nobody helped them.
LAM.1.7	Their enemies laughed when they destroyed Jerusalem.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem's people have 
LAM.1.8	That is why this city is not clean any longer.
LAM.1.8	People thought that this city was the best.
LAM.1.8	Now they think that it is not important.
LAM.1.8	They see it as it is.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem's people make sad noises and they want to hide themselves away.
LAM.1.9	Jerusalem seemed dirty because the people were so bad.
LAM.1.9	They never thought that the end would be like this.
LAM.1.9	But their enemies destroyed the city.
LAM.1.9	They do not have anyone who can help them to feel better.
LAM.1.9	God did not listen any longer when they asked for his help.
LAM.1.9	‘
LAM.1.9	See how happy our enemies are’, the people pray.
LAM.1.10	The enemies have taken away all Jerusalem's valuable things.
LAM.1.10	Foreign people have walked into God's 
LAM.1.10	But God had said that people like that must not go in there.
LAM.1.10	They are not his people.
LAM.1.11	Jerusalem's people are making sad noises.
LAM.1.11	They are sad as they look for food.
LAM.1.11	They sell things that they love.
LAM.1.11	They use them to buy food.
LAM.1.11	That way, they can keep themselves alive. 
LAM.1.11	‘
LAM.1.11	Think about me,
LAM.1.11	because nobody else does’, the people pray.
LAM.1.12	‘Come and really look at me!
LAM.1.12	All you people who pass me do not show any interest in me.
LAM.1.12	But you have never seen anything as sad as I am.
LAM.1.12	The 
LAM.1.12	So it was the 
LAM.1.13	‘It is like God has sent fire down into our bones to hurt us.
LAM.1.13	He wants us to turn towards him again.
LAM.1.13	So he has caused things to be very difficult for us.
LAM.1.13	All day he causes us to feel lonely and weak.
LAM.1.14	He has caused our 
LAM.1.14	It makes us weak.
LAM.1.14	He has let the enemy be very strong.
LAM.1.14	He let them win against us.
LAM.1.14	So we cannot beat them.
LAM.1.15	The 
LAM.1.15	He brought a big army to fight our young men.
LAM.1.15	And the enemy won that fight.
LAM.1.15	People walk on 
LAM.1.15	Like that, the 
LAM.1.16	‘We weep because of these things.
LAM.1.16	Nobody will help us.
LAM.1.16	We are the children of this city
LAM.1.16	and we have nothing now.
LAM.1.16	The enemy has won.’ 
LAM.1.17	but nobody is their friend.
LAM.1.17	They are 
LAM.1.17	But the 
LAM.1.17	to come from every country near them.
LAM.1.17	Those other people think about 
LAM.1.18	‘The 
LAM.1.18	We have not obeyed him.
LAM.1.18	Listen, all people everywhere, and look at us.
LAM.1.18	We are in very bad trouble.
LAM.1.18	The enemy has taken away our young women
LAM.1.18	and our young men to be slaves.’ 
LAM.1.19	‘We shouted to our friends.
LAM.1.19	They had said that they would help us.
LAM.1.19	But they did not help us.
LAM.1.19	Our 
LAM.1.19	They were looking for food to keep them alive.
LAM.1.20	Look, 
LAM.1.20	We are very sad.
LAM.1.20	We are weak deep inside ourselves
LAM.1.20	because we have done so many bad things.
LAM.1.20	They are killing our people in the streets.
LAM.1.20	People are dying in the houses.’ 
LAM.1.21	‘Everybody knows that we are very sad.
LAM.1.21	Nobody wants to help us.
LAM.1.21	All our enemies know about our trouble.
LAM.1.21	They are happy, God, that you caused that trouble.
LAM.1.21	Please cause trouble for those enemies too, as you promised.
LAM.1.22	You know that they have done many bad things.
LAM.1.22	You 
LAM.1.22	Now we are ashamed and we are very sad.’
LAM.2.1	The 
LAM.2.1	He wanted 
LAM.2.1	But he has put it down to the ground from its high place.
LAM.2.1	Now that he is angry, he has forgotten about that. 
LAM.2.2	The 
LAM.2.2	He decided that he must 
LAM.2.2	Because he is angry,
LAM.2.2	he has destroyed all 
LAM.2.2	Yes, he has destroyed all the buildings.
LAM.2.2	And he has killed the rulers and all the people.
LAM.2.3	Yes, because he is very angry,
LAM.2.3	he has destroyed 
LAM.2.3	He did not help them when they were fighting the enemy.
LAM.2.3	He was like a big hot fire
LAM.2.3	that burned 
LAM.2.4	He has bent his 
LAM.2.4	And, like an enemy,
LAM.2.4	he has killed all those who once gave him pleasure.
LAM.2.4	He has shown how angry he was.
LAM.2.4	He has sent a fire and he burned all 
LAM.2.5	The 
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed 
LAM.2.5	and all the beautiful houses there.
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed all the strong towns that had walls.
LAM.2.5	He has caused 
LAM.2.5	They are very sad.
LAM.2.6	He has knocked down his own 
LAM.2.6	as easily as someone can knock down a hut in a garden.
LAM.2.6	He has destroyed this place where people once met him.
LAM.2.6	The 
LAM.2.6	the special events and the 
LAM.2.6	He was very angry.
LAM.2.6	So he thought that our king and our 
LAM.2.6	He refused to help them. 
LAM.2.7	His 
LAM.2.7	no longer give pleasure to the 
LAM.2.7	He has given 
LAM.2.7	They shout in the 
LAM.2.7	as people shout on a special 
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	He carefully broke away each stone.
LAM.2.8	It causes us to weep when we look at those walls.
LAM.2.8	He destroyed them all.
LAM.2.8	He destroyed the inside walls and he destroyed the strong outside walls.
LAM.2.9	He destroyed them and he has broken them in pieces.
LAM.2.9	The enemies have taken away our king
LAM.2.9	and his sons to a foreign country.
LAM.2.9	The people have nearly forgotten God's rules.
LAM.2.9	And the 
LAM.2.9	His 
LAM.2.10	They have dressed themselves in 
LAM.2.10	and they throw dirt on their own heads.
LAM.2.10	They are showing everyone that they are very sad.
LAM.2.10	And the young women of 
LAM.2.10	because they are very sad too. 
LAM.2.11	I have cried so much that my eyes are red now.
LAM.2.11	Even the parts inside my body hurt,
LAM.2.11	because my people are dying.
LAM.2.11	I feel ill because I am so sad.
LAM.2.11	The children and babies fall in the city's streets
LAM.2.11	because they are so weak.
LAM.2.12	‘Where has all the food and drink gone?’
LAM.2.12	the hungry children ask their mothers.
LAM.2.12	Then they fall down in pain on the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They die in their mothers' arms.
LAM.2.13	I want to help you people of 
LAM.2.13	But there is nothing that I can say to you.
LAM.2.13	I do not know about anything like what has happened to you.
LAM.2.13	God has destroyed 
LAM.2.13	I do not know anyone who can make you people better.
LAM.2.14	Your 
LAM.2.14	Those good things will not happen.
LAM.2.14	They should have told you that you should not do wrong things.
LAM.2.14	If they had told you that, none of these troubles would have happened.
LAM.2.14	The 
LAM.2.14	and their dreams are false. 
LAM.2.15	Everyone who goes by laughs.
LAM.2.15	They are happy because you are sad.
LAM.2.15	They see how the enemy has destroyed everything in 
LAM.2.15	‘Surely this cannot be the city that men called most beautiful,’ they say.
LAM.2.15	‘People have said that this city is the best city on earth.’
LAM.2.16	All your enemies make noises through their teeth
LAM.2.16	because they are very happy.
LAM.2.16	‘We have won!’ they say.
LAM.2.16	‘We have waited for this day.
LAM.2.16	Now we have beaten you!
LAM.2.16	Now we have seen it!’
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	Yes, he has done what he told you about a long time ago.
LAM.2.17	He has destroyed your city and he has not felt sorry about it.
LAM.2.17	He has caused your enemies to be happy.
LAM.2.17	He has made them strong
LAM.2.17	so that they could win against you. 
LAM.2.18	Day and night, cause your 
LAM.2.18	Cry to the 
LAM.2.18	Do not rest.
LAM.2.18	Do not let your eyes stop crying.
LAM.2.19	Stand up and pray for God's help.
LAM.2.19	Talk to God all night.
LAM.2.19	Pour out your words and thoughts to the 
LAM.2.19	as you pour out water from a jar.
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to him when you ask him.
LAM.2.19	And ask him to save the lives of your children.
LAM.2.19	They fall down to die at the end of every street
LAM.2.19	because they are so hungry. 
LAM.2.20	‘Look at us, 
LAM.2.20	‘You have done all this to your people.
LAM.2.20	Women eat their own children now!
LAM.2.20	But they are the children that they 
LAM.2.20	People have killed your own 
LAM.2.20	in your 
LAM.2.21	Young people and old people lie dead in the streets.
LAM.2.21	The enemy has killed the young men and women with long knives.
LAM.2.21	But it was really you who killed them.
LAM.2.21	You were very angry with us.
LAM.2.21	So you killed them and you did not feel sorry.
LAM.2.22	You asked our enemies to come round us
LAM.2.22	as people come to a special party.
LAM.2.22	They killed our people because you were angry.
LAM.2.22	Nobody could hide or run away.
LAM.2.22	They all died.
LAM.2.22	We saw the enemy kill our own children.’
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen trouble.
LAM.3.1	God 
LAM.3.2	He has led me into the dark.
LAM.3.2	There is no light, so I cannot see the right way.
LAM.3.3	He is completely against me;
LAM.3.3	so again and again, he causes me trouble all day long.
LAM.3.4	God has caused my skin and my whole body to become old.
LAM.3.4	He has broken my bones. 
LAM.3.5	He has fought against me from every side.
LAM.3.5	He caused much trouble for me,
LAM.3.5	so that I am very sad.
LAM.3.6	He has brought me to this dark place.
LAM.3.6	So I am like a person who has been dead for a long time.
LAM.3.7	I am like a person inside high walls that God has built.
LAM.3.7	And I cannot go out.
LAM.3.7	My troubles are very bad.
LAM.3.7	They are like heavy metal and they hold me down.
LAM.3.8	I shout and I pray for help,
LAM.3.8	But God does not listen.
LAM.3.9	I am like a person on a path with lots of curves,
LAM.3.9	because he put big rocks in my way.
LAM.3.10	God is like a strong wild animal.
LAM.3.10	He hides and he waits for me by the path.
LAM.3.11	He is like an animal that pulls a person away from the path.
LAM.3.11	Then it tears the person in pieces.
LAM.3.11	He has made me very lonely.
LAM.3.12	God is like a soldier with a 
LAM.3.12	He bent the 
LAM.3.13	It was as if he shot me in the heart.
LAM.3.14	All the people see me and laugh.
LAM.3.14	They even sing silly songs about me all day long.
LAM.3.15	God has caused my life to become a thing of pain.
LAM.3.15	It is as if he filled a cup with a very 
LAM.3.16	It is as if he caused me to eat small stones.
LAM.3.16	And the stones broke my teeth.
LAM.3.16	Then he put me on the ground,
LAM.3.16	and he covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	He has taken 
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten what good days are like.
LAM.3.17	There were good days when I had plenty.
LAM.3.17	And there were good days when I was happy.
LAM.3.17	But I have forgotten what that was like.
LAM.3.18	‘Everything good has finished for me!
LAM.3.18	The things that I hoped for from the 
LAM.3.19	Remember (
LAM.3.19	Remember that I am very lonely.
LAM.3.19	And my mouth tastes bad as I think about it.
LAM.3.20	I think about all those things,
LAM.3.20	and I feel small and alone.
LAM.3.21	But then I choose to remember God,
LAM.3.21	and then I hope again:
LAM.3.22	The 
LAM.3.22	That is why we are alive at all.
LAM.3.23	Each new day we can remember
LAM.3.23	that God's promises will certainly happen.
LAM.3.24	‘He is my 
LAM.3.24	‘He is the reason why I can hope again.’
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	He is kind to everyone who looks for him.
LAM.3.26	It is good when people go on hoping.
LAM.3.26	It is good when they quietly wait for the 
LAM.3.26	because he will save them. 
LAM.3.27	It is also good for people to obey God when they are young.
LAM.3.27	They should work well for him.
LAM.3.28	Also, they should sit alone quietly,
LAM.3.28	when God causes them to be in trouble.
LAM.3.29	They should lie down on the ground in front of God.
LAM.3.29	Then they can hope again.
LAM.3.30	Cruel people will want to hurt them.
LAM.3.30	And those people will want to say cruel things to them.
LAM.3.30	They should let them do it and they should not fight them. 
LAM.3.31	The 
LAM.3.32	God does cause people to feel sad sometimes,
LAM.3.32	but he is sorry for us.
LAM.3.32	He is also very kind to us,
LAM.3.32	because he loves us very much.
LAM.3.33	He does not enjoy seeing people who are in pain.
LAM.3.33	He does not enjoy causing trouble for them. 
LAM.3.34	Bad people may be cruel to those who are in a prison.
LAM.3.34	But God does not like to see that.
LAM.3.35	Bad people may take other people's things.
LAM.3.35	But God does not like to see that.
LAM.3.35	And God is the greatest of all.
LAM.3.36	People with authority may not be fair to other people.
LAM.3.36	But the 
LAM.3.37	The 
LAM.3.37	Nobody can cause things to happen without him.
LAM.3.38	God is the greatest of all and he causes things to happen.
LAM.3.38	He causes good things and bad things when he speaks.
LAM.3.39	He only 
LAM.3.39	We are still alive, so we should not be angry with God.
LAM.3.40	Instead, we should think a lot about what we do.
LAM.3.40	And we should turn back to the 
LAM.3.41	God is in his home and we should pray to him.
LAM.3.41	We should offer ourselves completely to him. 
LAM.3.42	‘We have done wrong things,
LAM.3.42	and we have gone against you.
LAM.3.42	And you have not 
LAM.3.43	‘You have hidden yourself from us because you are angry.
LAM.3.43	You have followed us so that you could kill us.
LAM.3.43	You were not sorry about it.
LAM.3.44	You have hidden from us in a cloud.
LAM.3.44	So you do not listen to us when we talk to you.
LAM.3.45	You let people from other countries think bad things about us.
LAM.3.45	They think that we have no value.
LAM.3.45	We are like things that nobody can use any longer.
LAM.3.46	All our enemies say bad things to us.
LAM.3.47	And we are very afraid of the people who have beaten us.
LAM.3.47	They have caught us like animals.
LAM.3.47	They have killed us.
LAM.3.47	And they have destroyed all the things that we had.’ 
LAM.3.48	I weep, and my eyes are red with all my 
LAM.3.48	It is because the enemy has killed my people.
LAM.3.49	And they will not stop,
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	He will see us and he will help us.
LAM.3.51	I see our city.
LAM.3.51	I see what has happened to all the people here.
LAM.3.51	And so I am very sad.
LAM.3.52	My enemies had no reason to follow me.
LAM.3.52	But they caught me as they would catch a bird.
LAM.3.53	They put me alive into the well,
LAM.3.53	and they threw stones down on me.
LAM.3.54	The water covered my head.
LAM.3.54	Then I said, ‘I shall die.’
LAM.3.55	I shouted your name, 
LAM.3.55	when I was in the well.
LAM.3.56	‘Please listen to me, 
LAM.3.56	‘Help me! Save me!’ I shouted,
LAM.3.56	and you heard me.
LAM.3.57	You came near to me when I prayed to you.
LAM.3.57	‘Do not be afraid’, you said.
LAM.3.58	You have paid the price to keep me alive.
LAM.3.59	You saw the bad things that they did to me.
LAM.3.59	So please agree with me that they were not fair!
LAM.3.60	You know all the bad things that they did to me.
LAM.3.60	And you know about all the bad things that they want to do to me.
LAM.3.61	You have heard their cruel words against me, 
LAM.3.61	Yes, you know about all the bad things that they want to do to me.
LAM.3.62	These people have been cruel to me.
LAM.3.62	They attack me with cruel words every hour of the day.
LAM.3.63	Look at them as they sing cruel things about me.
LAM.3.63	They sing when they are sitting.
LAM.3.63	And they sing when they are standing.
LAM.3.65	Cause them to think that they cannot hope for anything good.
LAM.3.65	Cause bad things to happen to them.
LAM.3.66	Run after them angrily.
LAM.3.66	Kill them all because you are angry with them.
LAM.3.66	Let nobody on earth remember them any longer.
LAM.4.1	Look! The gold has stopped shining!
LAM.4.1	Look how the best gold has changed!
LAM.4.1	The valuable stones from the 
LAM.4.2	Now they lie in the streets, because God has broken them.
LAM.4.2	They are like common pots that a 
LAM.4.3	Even the wild animals offer the breast to their young animals.
LAM.4.3	But 
LAM.4.3	They are like 
LAM.4.4	The mouths of the babies in Jerusalem are completely dry, because they are so 
LAM.4.4	And the young children ask for food, but nobody gives them anything to eat.
LAM.4.5	There are people here who had been very rich.
LAM.4.5	They ate the best foods, but now they are hungry.
LAM.4.5	Now they lie in the streets with nothing to eat.
LAM.4.5	They wore the best clothes, but now they sit in the ashes.
LAM.4.6	God has 
LAM.4.6	He 
LAM.4.6	God destroyed that city in a moment,
LAM.4.6	and no human person helped him. 
LAM.4.7	The leaders of 
LAM.4.7	They seemed to be more white than milk.
LAM.4.7	Their bodies had very good health,
LAM.4.7	and they seemed to shine like valuable stones.
LAM.4.8	Now their faces are black like wood that somebody has burnt.
LAM.4.8	People see them in the streets, but do not recognise them.
LAM.4.8	Their skin hangs on their bones.
LAM.4.8	Their skin is as dry as wood for a fire. 
LAM.4.9	Our enemies have killed many people with long knives.
LAM.4.9	It is better for those dead people
LAM.4.9	than for the people who have no food.
LAM.4.9	They are very hungry.
LAM.4.9	And they die slowly because they have nothing to eat.
LAM.4.10	Women who once were very kind
LAM.4.10	have boiled their own children.
LAM.4.10	Their children became their food,
LAM.4.10	when the enemies were destroying the city. 
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	So he sent fire to burn 
LAM.4.11	It destroyed the whole city, even the strongest houses.
LAM.4.12	The kings in the other cities on earth could not believe it.
LAM.4.12	None of the people on earth could believe it.
LAM.4.12	They thought that no enemy could go through 
LAM.4.13	God 
LAM.4.13	God did not like the things that their 
LAM.4.13	They had caused good people to die.
LAM.4.14	Those leaders walked in the streets like men who cannot see.
LAM.4.14	There was blood on their clothes and everybody was afraid to touch them.
LAM.4.15	‘Go away!’ people shouted at them.
LAM.4.15	‘Do not touch us!
LAM.4.15	You are too dirty to be among God's people!’
LAM.4.15	So they went away to other countries, but the people there did not want them.
LAM.4.15	‘They cannot stay here with us!’ those people said.
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	He will not be kind to them any longer.
LAM.4.16	Nobody likes bad 
LAM.4.17	Our eyes became red as we watched.
LAM.4.17	We were looking for help, but it did not come.
LAM.4.17	The people from other countries could not save us.
LAM.4.18	Enemies ran after us, so that we could not go into the streets any longer.
LAM.4.18	We knew that we would die soon.
LAM.4.18	We could not live like this any longer.
LAM.4.19	The enemy was quicker than big birds that fly in the air.
LAM.4.19	They followed us so that they could catch us out on the mountains.
LAM.4.19	They hid and they waited for us in the wild places.
LAM.4.20	The 
LAM.4.20	We thought that he would save us.
LAM.4.20	‘Under his shadow we will live among the other countries,’ we had always said.
LAM.4.20	But the enemy caught him. 
LAM.4.21	You, 
LAM.4.21	But at a future time, God will hurt you also.
LAM.4.21	The enemy will take away everything that you have.
LAM.4.21	So you will become like drunks.
LAM.4.22	God has finished 
LAM.4.22	He will let them return to their homes soon.
LAM.4.22	But you, 
LAM.4.22	He will discover everything that you have done wrong. 
LAM.5.1	Look at us, because we are ashamed.
LAM.5.2	Strangers have taken the land that our fathers gave to us.
LAM.5.2	Foreign people live in our homes.
LAM.5.3	We are children whose fathers are dead.
LAM.5.3	Our mothers no longer have husbands.
LAM.5.4	We must pay money for the water that we drink.
LAM.5.4	We must buy wood for our fires.
LAM.5.5	Our enemies cause us to work like animals.
LAM.5.5	But the work is too difficult
LAM.5.5	and they will not let us rest.
LAM.5.6	We gave ourselves to the 
LAM.5.6	so that we could get food to eat.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers 
LAM.5.7	Now we have the troubles that you caused because of them.
LAM.5.7	You 
LAM.5.8	Slaves now rule us.
LAM.5.8	And there is nobody to save us from their power.
LAM.5.9	We meet danger when we work in the fields.
LAM.5.9	Enemies are everywhere and they want to kill us.
LAM.5.10	Our skin feels as if we are burning.
LAM.5.10	We are so hungry that we are ill. 
LAM.5.11	Enemies do what they want with the women in 
LAM.5.11	They are cruel to the young women in 
LAM.5.12	They hang our leaders by their hands.
LAM.5.12	And they are cruel to our old men also.
LAM.5.13	They took the young men to work as slaves.
LAM.5.13	Those young men make flour for them.
LAM.5.13	And our boys carry wood.
LAM.5.13	They fall down under big bags of wood.
LAM.5.14	Our enemies no longer let our old men decide things.
LAM.5.14	The old men cannot say what is right or fair for us.
LAM.5.14	And the young men have stopped their music. 
LAM.5.15	We are not happy any longer.
LAM.5.15	Instead, we are very sad,
LAM.5.15	so we do not dance any longer.
LAM.5.16	And we have no king in 
LAM.5.16	We have 
LAM.5.17	So our bodies feel ill and we feel ill deep inside us.
LAM.5.17	Our eyes are very tired and we cannot hope for good things any longer.
LAM.5.18	We are so sad because they destroyed 
LAM.5.18	Wild animals walk on them now.
LAM.5.19	But you, 
LAM.5.19	You will always rule us.
LAM.5.20	Tell us why you have forgotten us.
LAM.5.20	Tell us why you have left us for so long.
LAM.5.21	Help us to come back to you, 
LAM.5.21	We really want to make a new start with you.
LAM.5.21	We were great before our enemies beat us.
LAM.5.21	We pray that you will make us as great as that again.
LAM.5.22	That could happen unless you have turned away from us completely.
LAM.5.22	That could happen unless you will continue to be very angry with us. 
EZK.1.1	It was the 30th year. God spoke to me on the fifth (5th) day of the fourth (4th) month. I was among the 
EZK.1.2	Nebuchadnezzar had kept King Jehoiachin in Babylon for five (5) years. On the fifth (5th) day of the month, 
EZK.1.3	God spoke to Ezekiel the 
EZK.1.4	I, Ezekiel, looked. And I saw great clouds that were coming from the north. They came with a strong wind and bright lights. Light shone all round the clouds. It was like a fire that had burning metal in the centre. 
EZK.1.5	I could see something like four (4) living things in the fire. Each of them had the shape of a man. 
EZK.1.6	But each of them had four (4) faces and four (4) 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight and their feet were like the feet of a young cow. They shone like bright metal. 
EZK.1.8	They had hands under their 
EZK.1.9	And their 
EZK.1.10	I saw their faces. The face at the front was the face of a man. On the right side each had an 
EZK.1.11	That is how I saw their faces. Each of them held two 
EZK.1.12	Each living thing covered its body with two 
EZK.1.13	They looked like hot fires or burning sticks of wood. Fire moved between the living things. It shone brightly, and it sent out light like sharp knives. 
EZK.1.14	The living things moved very quickly. They went one way and then they went another way.
EZK.1.15	I continued to look at them. And I saw four (4) 
EZK.1.16	The 
EZK.1.17	They moved any way that the living things moved. 
EZK.1.18	The 
EZK.1.19	When the living things moved, the 
EZK.1.20	They went where the 
EZK.1.21	The 
EZK.1.22	A roof that looked like shining ice was over the heads of the living things. 
EZK.1.23	The living things stood under the roof. Each stood with their 
EZK.1.24	I heard a noise like a fast river or like a great army when they flew. It was like the voice of the great, powerful God. They put their 
EZK.1.25	A voice spoke while they stood still with their 
EZK.1.26	Over the roof like ice I saw a kind of 
EZK.1.27	He shone like bright metal in the centre of a fire. The light of many colours was all round him. 
EZK.1.28	It was like the ring of light over the earth on a wet day. This light showed that the 
EZK.2.1	‘Son of man, you must stand up on your feet’, the 
EZK.2.2	His 
EZK.2.3	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘I am sending you to Israel's people. They are people who have not obeyed me. Their 
EZK.2.4	I am sending you to a people who do not listen to me. They think that their ideas are better than mine. This is what you must say to them. “This is what the great, powerful 
EZK.2.5	They may listen or they may not listen. But they will know that you are a 
EZK.2.6	You, son of man, must not be afraid of them or their words. You may feel like you have sharp branches all round you. You may think that they can bite you like animals. But they cannot hurt you. Do not be afraid of what they say. They are all against me. 
EZK.2.7	You must speak my words to them, whether they will listen or not. They are a people that do not obey me. 
EZK.2.8	But you, son of man, must listen to what I say to you. Do not turn against me, like those bad people. Open your mouth. And eat what I give you.’
EZK.2.9	Then I looked and I saw a hand. It held a very long piece of skin. Someone had written words on the skin. The hand offered it to me. 
EZK.2.10	When the hand opened the skin, I saw words on both sides of the skin. I read them. They were not happy words, but were very sad. 
EZK.3.1	‘Son of man, eat what is in front of you’, he said to me. ‘Eat this skin with words on it. Then go and speak to the 
EZK.3.2	Then I opened my mouth and he gave me the skin to eat.
EZK.3.3	‘Son of man, eat this and fill your stomach with it’, he said. So I ate it, and it was very sweet in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	Then he said to me, ‘Now go, son of man. Speak my words to Israel's people. 
EZK.3.5	I am sending you to them. I do not send you to a people whose words you cannot understand. 
EZK.3.6	And I do not send you to people who speak a foreign language. I could have sent you to those people. And I am sure that they would have listened to you. 
EZK.3.7	But Israel's people will not listen to you. That is because they will not listen to me. They have all decided not to obey me, and they will not change. 
EZK.3.8	But I will make you as strong as they are. You will not stop obeying me. 
EZK.3.9	You will be strong and you will not change. They may refuse to do as I say. But you must not be afraid of them, even when they do.’
EZK.3.10	And he said to me, ‘Son of man, listen carefully to all that I say. Remember the words that I speak to you. 
EZK.3.11	Now you must go to Babylon. Speak to Israel's people who are there. Say this, “This is what the 
EZK.3.12	Then the 
EZK.3.13	I heard the sound of the living things' 
EZK.3.14	Then the 
EZK.3.15	I came to Tel Abib near the river Kedar. The people who had come from Israel lived there. I stayed there with them for seven (7) days. I was very tired and confused.
EZK.3.16	When the seven (7) days were finished, the 
EZK.3.17	‘Son of man, I have made you a 
EZK.3.18	I may say to a bad man, “I am going to make you die.” You must tell him this. Or you must say that he must stop doing wrong things. Then he will save his life. If you do not tell him this, he will die. He will die because of the bad things that he has done. But I will 
EZK.3.19	You must tell him what I have promised. But he may not listen. Then he will die because he has not obeyed me. But you will have saved yourself.
EZK.3.20	A very good man may start to do bad things and I can make his life difficult. But he will die if you do not tell him about his 
EZK.3.21	If you give him my message, he may stop 
EZK.3.22	The 
EZK.3.23	So I got up and I went out to the flat land. And I saw the 
EZK.3.24	Then the 
EZK.3.25	‘I will stop you from moving. You will be like a man that men have tied up. You will not be able to go out among the people. 
EZK.3.26	I will stop your 
EZK.3.27	I will speak to you again. Then you will be able to give them my message. “This is what the 
EZK.4.1	‘Now, son of man, make a square flat plate out of soft earth. Draw a picture on this plate. Draw a picture of the city, Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Then build hills round it for soldiers to attack the city. Put your 
EZK.4.3	Then you must turn your face towards it. Take an iron plate and put it between your face and the city. This will be a wall between you and the city.’ 
EZK.4.3	‘The army is round the city. But you will attack it. This is to show Israel's people what I will do.
EZK.4.4	Then lie on your left side. I will put on you the 
EZK.4.5	This means that I will 
EZK.4.6	After you have finished this, lie down on your right side. You will stay there for 40 days. You will 
EZK.4.7	Turn your face towards the picture of the soldiers who are attacking Jerusalem. Point to it and 
EZK.4.8	I will tie you up so that you cannot turn from one side to another. You will stay on one side until the day when the soldiers round the city go away.’ 
EZK.4.9	‘You must take different kinds of food 
EZK.4.10	Weigh out 20 shekels (about 8 ounces or 220 grams) of food for each day. This is all the food that I will let you eat in one day. 
EZK.4.11	You can have a sixth (1/6) of a hin (two cups) of water a day to drink. 
EZK.4.12	Bake the food like a cake. Bake it in front of the people on a fire that you have made with human dirt.’
EZK.4.13	The 
EZK.4.14	‘No, 
EZK.4.15	So God spoke to me. ‘It is good’, he said. ‘You can use dirt from cows instead. You can cook your bread on that.’
EZK.4.16	Then God said, ‘I am going to take away the bread from the people in Jerusalem. They will have to measure the food that they eat. And they will measure the water that they drink. I will give them great trouble. 
EZK.4.17	They will have no more bread or water. They will be very sad and their bodies will become thin. This is because they have done so many bad things.’ 
EZK.5.1	‘Now, son of man, take a sharp 
EZK.5.2	‘Keep this hair until the end of the days that you lie still. Then you will not watch the soldiers round your picture of Jerusalem any longer. Take one part of the hair and burn it inside the city. Take another part and hit it all round the city with a 
EZK.5.3	But take a few hairs and keep them in your clothes. 
EZK.5.4	Then take out some of these hairs and burn them in the fire. This fire will grow and go out to all Israel.’
EZK.5.5	The 
EZK.5.6	But the people who live there have not obeyed my rules. They have been very 
EZK.5.7	So this is what the 
EZK.5.8	So this is what the 
EZK.5.9	I will 
EZK.5.10	You will have among you fathers who will eat their children. And children will eat their fathers. I will 
EZK.5.11	‘You can be sure that I am alive,’ says the 
EZK.5.12	A third (1/3) of the people will die. They will die inside your city because they are ill. Or they will die there because they have no food. Soldiers will kill a third (1/3) of the people outside your walls. And I will send a third (1/3) away. Their enemies will run after them with a 
EZK.5.13	When I have done this I will not be angry any longer. I will not 
EZK.5.14	I will break down your walls and your buildings. People from other 
EZK.5.15	They will look at you. They will see what I did to you. I did it because I was angry. They will think that you have no value. They will know what I told you. You should not do bad things. And they will say that I 
EZK.5.16	‘I will take away your food in order to kill you. You will have pain because you will be very hungry. I will make it more and more difficult for those in the city to get food. 
EZK.5.17	You will have nothing to eat and wild animals will attack you. They will kill your children. I will send illness, armies and 
EZK.6.1	The 
EZK.6.2	‘Son of man, you must turn to speak against the mountains of Israel. Give my 
EZK.6.3	“You mountains of Israel”, you must say. “This is what the 
EZK.6.4	I will break down your 
EZK.6.5	Their dead bodies will lie in front of their false gods. And soldiers will throw their bones round the 
EZK.6.6	In every place that they live, they will destroy their towns. 
EZK.6.6	They will break the 
EZK.6.7	You will see your dead people. And then you will know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	But some of you will not die. These people will run to other countries and 
EZK.6.9	When they are there, far away, they will remember me. They will remember how they made me very sad. They turned away from me and they did wrong things. They 
EZK.6.10	And they will know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	This is what the 
EZK.6.12	People who are far away will become ill. And they will die. Soldiers will kill those who are near to the city. The people in the city will die because they do not have any food. That is how I will 
EZK.6.13	They will see their dead bodies. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	I will make the land from Diblah to the 
EZK.7.1	The 
EZK.7.2	‘Son of man, the 
EZK.7.3	Now I will show you how angry I am. I will 
EZK.7.4	I will not be sorry for you or save you. I will 
EZK.7.5	This is what the 
EZK.7.6	No time is left. It is finished. 
EZK.7.7	I will destroy the lives of the people who live in this country. They will not have parties where they 
EZK.7.8	I will soon cause you to know how angry I am. I am going to be your 
EZK.7.9	I will not make your 
EZK.7.10	It is time now. The people have done enough wrong things. The time to 
EZK.7.11	I have become very angry. I will 
EZK.7.12	The day when I 
EZK.7.13	Any man who sells his land will not get it back. I will 
EZK.7.14	They may prepare for war, but nobody will go out to fight. The whole 
EZK.7.15	The enemy is outside the city. Inside the city, people are ill and they have no food. Soldiers will kill the people in the country. The people in the city will die from illness, or because they do not have any food. 
EZK.7.16	Some people will stay alive. They will leave the city and they will run to the mountains. They will be like birds that are flying from the hunters. They will all cry because of their 
EZK.7.17	Their hands will be weak and their knees will knock together. 
EZK.7.18	They will want to show that they are sorry. So they will wear clothes that are not comfortable. They will be very afraid. They will be ashamed and they will cut all the hair from their heads. 
EZK.7.19	They will throw their 
EZK.7.20	They were happy because they had beautiful things. But they used them to make 
EZK.7.21	He will give their 
EZK.7.22	I will turn away from my people. Bad men will go into my special house (
EZK.7.23	Nothing is safe. The country is full of men who kill. People are fighting in the city. 
EZK.7.24	I will bring the most 
EZK.7.25	When people are afraid, they will look for 
EZK.7.26	Many bad things will come, one after another. Men will bring bad news all the time. They will ask the 
EZK.7.27	The king will be very sad and his son will not be able to hope for anything. The people will be very afraid. And their bodies will move about like leaves in the wind. I will 
EZK.8.1	I was sitting in my house. The leaders of Judah sat in front of me. It was the sixth (6th) year and the fifth (5th) day of the sixth (6th) month. While I sat there, the 
EZK.8.2	I saw something that looked like a man. The top half of his body looked as bright as burning metal. The half of his body that was below looked like fire. 
EZK.8.3	He put out something like a hand. Then he held me by my hair. The 
EZK.8.4	And in front of me I saw the bright light of the God of Israel. It was like the light that I had seen by the River Kebar. 
EZK.8.5	Then the 
EZK.8.5	When I looked, I saw the 
EZK.8.6	‘Son of man, you see what they are doing’, he said to me. ‘Israel's people are doing very bad things here. They are keeping me a long way away from my 
EZK.8.7	Then he took me to the gate of the inside yard. There he showed me a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	‘Son of man, make a hole in the wall here’, he said. So I dug into the wall and I found a door. 
EZK.8.9	‘Go in. And see the very bad things that they are doing there’, he said. 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and I saw pictures on the walls. They were pictures of snakes and other animals. They were all animals that God did not let us touch or eat. And there were other pictures there. Israel's people were 
EZK.8.11	Seventy (70) leaders were there. Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, was among them. Each man held a pot with burning sweet-smelling oil in it. 
EZK.8.12	‘Son of man’, said the 
EZK.8.13	‘You will see even worse things than that’, the 
EZK.8.14	Then he took me to the north gate of the 
EZK.8.15	‘You saw that’, he said. ‘But I will show you more things that are even worse.’ 
EZK.8.16	He took me to the inside yard, between the 
EZK.8.17	‘Son of man, you saw that’, the 
EZK.8.18	So I will show them how angry I am. I will not be kind to them or save them. They may shout to me, but I will not listen to them.’
EZK.9.1	I heard God's Spirit speak in a loud voice. ‘Bring here the men who keep the city safe. Tell them that they must bring their arms with them.’ 
EZK.9.2	And I saw (6) six men. They came out of the higher gate. People can look towards the north from that gate. Each man carried his powerful arms. A man who was wearing white clothes came with them. He was carrying tools with which to write. They came in and they stood next to the 
EZK.9.3	The bright light that was the 
EZK.9.4	‘Go through all the city (Jerusalem)’, he said. ‘Some people are very sad. They are sad because of the 
EZK.9.5	While I listened, the 
EZK.9.6	Kill the old men, young men and women. Kill the women and the children. Do not be kind or save any of them. But do not touch anyone that has the mark on their face.’ So they started to kill. The leaders were in front of the 
EZK.9.7	‘Fill the yard of the 
EZK.9.8	They left me alone while they were doing this. I fell down on my face. ‘
EZK.9.9	This was his answer. ‘Both Israel and Judah are very, very bad. They have hurt and killed each other. And they have not been fair to each other. They say, “The 
EZK.9.10	So I will not be sorry for them. I will 
EZK.9.11	Then the man with the writing tools came back ‘I have done what you asked me to do’, he said.
EZK.10.1	I looked and I saw something like a 
EZK.10.2	The 
EZK.10.3	The living things stood at the south side of the 
EZK.10.4	Then the 
EZK.10.5	I could hear the noise of the living things' 
EZK.10.6	The man in white clothes went and he stood next to a 
EZK.10.7	Then one of the living things put his hand into the fire. He took some fire. He put it into the man's hands. Then the man in white clothes went out. 
EZK.10.8	(The living things had hands under their 
EZK.10.9	I looked and I saw four (4) 
EZK.10.10	All the four (4) 
EZK.10.11	When the living things moved, they could go in any direction. They all moved together to go where they wanted. They did not have to turn round to change their direction. 
EZK.10.12	All their bodies were covered with eyes. This included their backs, hands and 
EZK.10.13	A voice gave the 
EZK.10.14	Each of the living things had four (4) faces. One face was the face of a male cow. And the second (2nd) was the face of a man. The third (3rd) face was a 
EZK.10.15	I had seen the same living things by the River Kebar. 
EZK.10.16	When they rose in the air, the 
EZK.10.17	When the living things stood still, the 
EZK.10.18	Then the 
EZK.10.19	They put out their 
EZK.10.20	They were the same living things that I had seen before. They were under the God of Israel. And I knew that they were called cherubs. 
EZK.10.21	Each of them had four (4) faces and four (4) 
EZK.10.22	Their faces were the same as those that I had seen by the river Kebar. Each of them moved along a straight path.
EZK.11.1	Then the 
EZK.11.2	The 
EZK.11.3	They are saying, “It will soon be time to build houses. This city is like a pot to cook meat. And we are that good meat.”
EZK.11.4	Son of man, you must 
EZK.11.5	Then the 
EZK.11.6	You have killed so many people that the streets are full of dead bodies.’
EZK.11.7	So this is what the 
EZK.11.8	You are afraid of 
EZK.11.9	‘I will make you run from the city. I will send foreign men to 
EZK.11.10	Their 
EZK.11.11	This city will not be like a pot that holds the meat inside it. And you will not be the meat in the pot. I will 
EZK.11.12	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	While I was speaking the words from the 
EZK.11.14	The 
EZK.11.15	‘Son of man, this is what the people in Jerusalem say. They say that your family and all Israel's people are far away from me. They say that I gave them this country to keep.’
EZK.11.16	‘So say this to them. “This is what the 
EZK.11.17	Then say, ‘This is what the 
EZK.11.18	‘The people will return and burn their 
EZK.11.19	They will want to 
EZK.11.20	Then they will know my rules. They will be careful to obey them. They will be my people and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But I will 
EZK.11.22	Then the living things put out their 
EZK.11.23	The 
EZK.11.24	In my dream, the 
EZK.11.25	I told the people everything that the 
EZK.12.1	The 
EZK.12.2	‘Son of man, you live among a people who refuse to obey me. They have eyes to see, but they do not see. They have ears to hear, but they do not hear. Then they refuse to obey me.
EZK.12.3	So you must prepare your things for a journey. Enemies will take you as a 
EZK.12.4	Bring out the things that you have prepared. Bring them out during the day while the people are watching you. Then go out in the evening while they watch you. Go like someone who is leaving the country. 
EZK.12.5	While they watch, dig a hole in the wall. Go through it and take your things with you. 
EZK.12.6	Put your things on your shoulder while they watch you. Carry them out while the light starts to go away. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land. This is how I have made you a picture for Israel's people.’
EZK.12.7	So I did what the 
EZK.12.8	In the morning, the 
EZK.12.9	‘Son of man, you know about those people who refuse to obey me. They did not even ask you what you were doing’, he said to me.
EZK.12.10	‘You must speak to them. Say, “This what the 
EZK.12.11	You must say to them, “I am a picture of what the 
EZK.12.12	Their king will leave when it starts to become dark. He will carry his things on his shoulders. They will dig a hole in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land. 
EZK.12.13	I will catch him and take him to Babylon. That is the country where the people called Chaldeans live. But he will not see the land, and he will die there. 
EZK.12.14	I will make all his officers and soldiers run away. I will make their enemies run after them with 
EZK.12.15	I will send the people away from their city. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will save a few of them. I will not make them all die. In those far countries they will be sad. Then they will be sorry because of the many bad things that they have done. And they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	The 
EZK.12.18	‘Son of man, let your body 
EZK.12.19	Speak to the people in this country. Say, “This is what the 
EZK.12.20	Enemies will knock down the towns where people live. The country will be empty. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	The 
EZK.12.22	‘Son of man, there is a thing that people say in Israel. They say, “People see pictures in the mind. But what they see never happens. Time passes and people forget about it.” 
EZK.12.23	But you must say to them. “This is what the 
EZK.12.24	Nobody in Israel will again dream things that are false. Nobody will say that bad things will not happen. 
EZK.12.25	But I, the 
EZK.12.26	The 
EZK.12.27	‘Son of man, Israel's people are saying wrong things. “Your message will not become true for many years. That day will not be soon.” That is what they say. 
EZK.12.28	So you must speak to them. “This is what the 
EZK.13.1	The 
EZK.13.2	‘Son of man, 
EZK.13.3	This is what the 
EZK.13.4	Israel's 
EZK.13.5	They have not built up the broken walls for Israel's people. So they will not be strong when I send enemies to attack them. 
EZK.13.6	These 
EZK.13.7	Their dreams are false. And they have said things that are not true. You know that they said, “The 
EZK.13.8	So this is what the 
EZK.13.9	‘I will 
EZK.13.10	They are leading my people away from me. They say that there will be 
EZK.13.11	You must speak to the men who painted the wall. Say that it will fall. I will send much rain and hail (rain like stones) and strong winds. 
EZK.13.12	The wall will fall. And people will ask why the paint did not hold it up.
EZK.13.13	This, then, is what the 
EZK.13.14	I will break down the wall that you painted. The wall will fall flat. Then you will see the ground on which it was. When the wall falls it will kill you. And you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	By this, I will show you that I am very angry. I will destroy the wall and those who painted it white. I will say to you, “The wall is gone. And so are those who painted it.”
EZK.13.16	I am speaking about the 
EZK.13.17	‘Now, son of man, you must turn against the women 
EZK.13.18	Say, “This is what the 
EZK.13.19	You have taken away my 
EZK.13.20	Now this is what the 
EZK.13.21	I will tear the cloths from your heads. And you will have no power over people. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	The false things that you said made the good people sad. But I did nothing to make them sad. And you did not try to make the bad people stop doing wrong things. You did not try to save their lives. 
EZK.13.23	So you women will not see false dreams or have power over people. I will save my people from the things that you do. And then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Some of the leaders of Israel came. They sat down in front of me. 
EZK.14.2	Then the 
EZK.14.3	‘Son of man’, he said, ‘These men 
EZK.14.4	You must speak to them. Say, “This is what the 
EZK.14.5	I will do this so that Israel's people will turn back to me. Those who 
EZK.14.6	So you must speak to Israel's people. Say, ‘This is what the 
EZK.14.7	An 
EZK.14.8	I will be against that man. I will make bad things happen to him. People will see what I have done. I will make him an example to them and they will push him away. He will no longer belong to my people. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	I can make a 
EZK.14.10	I will 
EZK.14.11	Then Israel's people will stay close to me. They will no longer be like a bad smell to me because they do so many bad things. They will be my people and I will be their God,’ says the 
EZK.14.12	The 
EZK.14.13	‘Son of man, a country's people may not obey me. Then this is what I will do. I will not give its people any food if they turn away from me. The men and animals that live there will die because they do not have anything to eat. 
EZK.14.14	I would only save men like Noah, Daniel and Job, if they lived there. They would save themselves because they did good things,’ says the 
EZK.14.15	‘Or I might send wild animals to kill the people in that country. Nobody would be able to travel through it because of the animals. 
EZK.14.16	I am surely alive’, the 
EZK.14.17	Or I might bring men with 
EZK.14.18	I am surely alive’, says the 
EZK.14.19	Or I might be angry and send illness into that country. It would kill the men and animals that lived there. 
EZK.14.20	I am surely alive’, says the 
EZK.14.21	This is what the 
EZK.14.22	But they will not all die. Some sons and daughters will remain alive. They will come to you. You will see that they stay alive. And then you will be happy. You will be happy that I sent all these things to 
EZK.14.23	Then you will know that I had a good reason to do these things’, says the 
EZK.15.1	Again the 
EZK.15.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘The wood of the 
EZK.15.3	Nobody takes its wood to make into a thing that they can use. They cannot even make from it a little thing on which to hang clothes! 
EZK.15.4	They can burn it in the fire. Then only the black, burnt centre remains. But they still cannot use it. 
EZK.15.5	They could not use it while it was green. So they surely cannot use it after they have burnt it black. 
EZK.15.6	So this is what the 
EZK.15.7	I will not save them. If the fire has not burnt them yet, it will still burn them. I will do this. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	I will cause the land to be empty. I will do this because they have not continued to 
EZK.16.1	The 
EZK.16.2	‘Son of man, make Jerusalem's people see what bad things they have done. 
EZK.16.3	Say to them, “This is what the 
EZK.16.4	They did not wash you on the day that you were born. They did not cut you from your mother's body. They did not make you clean or tie you in cloths. 
EZK.16.5	Nobody was sorry or wanted to do these things for you. 
EZK.16.5	No, they threw you out on the day that you were born. They threw you into a field. They thought that you had no value.
EZK.16.6	Then I came. I was walking by and I saw you. You were lying there. You were kicking and blood covered you. Then I said to you, ‘Stay alive.’ 
EZK.16.7	I made you grow like the plants in a field. You became beautiful, like a valuable shining stone. Your breasts and your hair grew. You had no value before, but I had made you beautiful.
EZK.16.8	I walked by again. Then I saw that you were old enough for me to love you. I covered you with my coat. I gave you clothes. I made a promise to you that was true. We agreed that you would belong to me” ’, said the 
EZK.16.9	‘I washed you with water. I washed away the blood and I put oil on your body. 
EZK.16.10	I put a beautiful dress on you and leather shoes on your feet. The clothes that I gave you were very good. They were the best and most expensive that I could find. 
EZK.16.11	I made rings out of pretty stones. Then I put them round your neck and your arms. 
EZK.16.12	I put valuable rings in your nose and ears. And I put a beautiful ring round your head. I dressed you like a queen. 
EZK.16.13	I made you beautiful with gold and 
EZK.16.14	The people in all countries heard how beautiful you were. I was the person who had made you so beautiful. I had given you all your good things’, says the 
EZK.16.15	‘But you used your 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your good clothes. You used them to make beautiful the places where they 
EZK.16.17	You took the things of gold and 
EZK.16.18	You put your beautiful clothes on them and you gave them my oil and 
EZK.16.19	You offered to 
EZK.16.20	‘And you took the sons and daughters that I had given to you. 
EZK.16.21	You offered them to those 
EZK.16.22	When I found you, then you had no clothes. And blood covered you. You did not remember this when you had sex with 
EZK.16.23	‘Be very sad. I will bring great trouble to you!’ says the 
EZK.16.23	‘You have done even more 
EZK.16.24	In the centre of every town, you have built hills. On each hill you have built a place to 
EZK.16.25	You have put these places at the end of every street. There you offered yourself to anyone who went past. You have made yourself of no value. 
EZK.16.26	You had sex with the 
EZK.16.27	So I took away some of your land. I gave your enemies, the people who live in Philistia, power over you. They were ashamed because you were not 
EZK.16.28	You gave your body to the people who live in Assyria, too. You could not get enough sex! 
EZK.16.29	You had sex with the people from Babylon, who sell things. But even then you had not had enough sex.
EZK.16.30	Your mind is so weak’, says the 
EZK.16.31	But you are not like one of those women. You built places to 
EZK.16.32	You are like a wife that is not 
EZK.16.33	Men pay bad women who let them have sex with them. But you give gifts to the men who have sex with you. You pay them to come and have sex with you. 
EZK.16.34	So you are very different from those other women. You pay your men, and they do not pay you.’
EZK.16.35	So listen to what the 
EZK.16.36	You gave your good things to those who were not your husband. And you showed them your body without any clothes. You offered them your children's blood. 
EZK.16.37	So I will bring all those with whom you had sex round you. I will bring those that you liked. And I will bring those that you did not like. Then I will remove your clothes in front of them all. They will see you without clothes. 
EZK.16.38	They 
EZK.16.39	I will make those men who loved you 
EZK.16.40	They will bring a crowd of men with 
EZK.16.41	They will burn down your houses. Women will watch while they 
EZK.16.42	After this, I will no longer be angry with you. I will be quiet, and not angry. 
EZK.16.43	I will surely 
EZK.16.44	You say that a daughter will be like her mother. 
EZK.16.45	Yes, you are a true daughter of your mother! She thought that her husband and her children were not valuable. And you are like your sisters. They thought that their husbands and their children had no value. Your mother was a 
EZK.16.46	Your older sister was Samaria. She and her daughters lived north of you. Your younger sister was Sodom. She and her daughters lived south of you. 
EZK.16.47	You did all the bad things that they did. But you did even worse things, too. 
EZK.16.48	Your sister Sodom and her daughters never did such bad things as you and your daughters have done’, says the 
EZK.16.49	‘This is the 
EZK.16.50	They thought that they could do what they liked. And I saw them do all kinds of bad things. So I took them away, as you have seen. 
EZK.16.51	Samaria's people did only half as many bad things as you have done. You have done much worse things than your sisters. The things that you have done make your bad sisters seem good! 
EZK.16.52	Now I must 
EZK.16.53	But I will give things back to Sodom and her daughters (people). I will give to Samaria and her daughters the things that I took from them. And I will give you back the things that I took away from you. 
EZK.16.54	You will be sorry that you did such bad things. And your sisters will be happy that I 
EZK.16.55	I will make your sisters, Sodom and Samaria with their daughters, the same as they were before. And you and your daughters will become what they were before. 
EZK.16.56	Before I 
EZK.16.57	But then I showed everyone how bad you were. Now the people in Edom and the people near to that country think that you have no value. The people in Philistia and all the people round you think that you have no value. 
EZK.16.58	This is because you were not a 
EZK.16.59	‘You have not 
EZK.16.60	But I will remember my promise. I agreed it with you when you were young. And I will make a promise with you that will always remain. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember the bad things that you did. You will be ashamed when you meet your sisters. I will make them like daughters to you. That was not part of my promise but I will do it. 
EZK.16.62	I will 
EZK.16.63	When I pay the price of your 
EZK.17.1	The 
EZK.17.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘I want you to tell a story. This story is a picture of Israel's people.
EZK.17.3	Say this to Israel's people. “A big bird had great powerful 
EZK.17.4	There he broke the top from a big tree. He took this top branch to a city. In that city, men buy and sell many things. There he planted his branch.
EZK.17.5	The bird took seed from your land. And he planted it in good ground. He planted it near to much water where trees grow. 
EZK.17.6	The branch grew along the ground and it became a 
EZK.17.7	Another big bird came, with great 
EZK.17.8	But the 
EZK.17.9	‘Ask the people a question’, said the 
EZK.17.10	It would die even if they put it into good new ground. The east wind would kill it where it grew.’
EZK.17.11	The 
EZK.17.12	‘This people do not obey me. Perhaps they do not know what these things mean’, he said.
EZK.17.12	‘Speak to them. Say: “The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem. He took away the king and his officers. He took them back with him to Babylon. 
EZK.17.13	Then he agreed to let one of the king's family rule Jerusalem as its king.
EZK.17.13	This king made a promise to the king of Babylon. He said that he would obey Babylon's king. 
EZK.17.14	The king of Babylon wanted to make Israel weak. So he took Jerusalem's important men away to Babylon. He did not want them make Israel strong enough to fight him. 
EZK.17.15	But the king of Jerusalem did not 
EZK.17.16	I am surely alive,” ’ says the 
EZK.17.16	‘The king of Israel will die in Babylon. The king of Babylon gave him authority to rule Israel. Israel's king will die in his country. This is because he did not remember his promise to the king of Babylon. He thought that the promise was not important. 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) will not be able to help him with his big army and many soldiers. An enemy will build hills round the city. Then they will attack it. And soldiers will attack Jerusalem and they will kill many people. 
EZK.17.18	Your king did not remember his promise. He did not 
EZK.17.18	Because he did all these things, I will 
EZK.17.19	So this is what the 
EZK.17.20	I will catch him like a hunter that catches an animal. I will take him to Babylon and I will 
EZK.17.21	His soldiers will run away and enemies will kill them. A few of them will run to countries that are far away. Then you will know that my words are true.’
EZK.17.22	The 
EZK.17.23	I will plant it on a high mountain in Israel. It will grow more branches and make fruit. It will become a great tree. Many kinds of birds will live in the tree. They will make their homes in it. Its branches will keep them safe from the sun. 
EZK.17.24	Then all the trees in the field will know that I am the 
EZK.17.24	This is what I, the 
EZK.18.1	The 
EZK.18.2	‘Your people say this about the country called Israel. “Fathers have eaten fruit that makes their mouths dry. But their children have the dry mouths.” 
EZK.18.3	Now I am sure that you will no longer say this. 
EZK.18.4	Everything that is alive is mine, says the 
EZK.18.5	Think about a good man. He does only what is good.’ 
EZK.18.6	‘He does not eat with people who 
EZK.18.7	He does not hurt other people. He may take something from a man and lend him money. He will keep the thing until the man has paid him back. But he will always give the man's thing back.
EZK.18.7	He does not take things from other people. But he gives food to hungry people.
EZK.18.7	And he gives clothes to people who have no clothes.
EZK.18.8	He does not lend money and then ask the man to give back a lot more money.
EZK.18.8	He will not do anything that is wrong.
EZK.18.8	Sometimes men do not agree. He decides what is right.
EZK.18.9	He obeys all my rules.
EZK.18.9	Surely he is a good man. And I will let him stay alive’, says the 
EZK.18.10	‘Now think about that man's son. He might be angry. And he might hurt or kill people.
EZK.18.10	He might do other bad things. 
EZK.18.11	(But the father has not done any of these things.)
EZK.18.11	The son might eat with people who 
EZK.18.11	He might have sex with another man's wife.
EZK.18.12	He might hurt people who are poor or sick.
EZK.18.12	He might take things that are not his.
EZK.18.12	He might not give back things that he took from other men.
EZK.18.12	He might 
EZK.18.13	He might lend money and take back much more money.
EZK.18.13	I will not let any man that does these things stay alive. I will kill him because he has not obeyed me. I am a fair 
EZK.18.14	But this bad man might have a son. The son would see all the wrong things that his father had done. But he would not do them himself.
EZK.18.15	He would not eat with people who 
EZK.18.15	He would not 
EZK.18.15	He would not have sex with another man's wife.
EZK.18.16	He would not hurt anyone.
EZK.18.16	He would not take anything when he lent money to someone.
EZK.18.16	He would not take things that belonged to other people. But he would give food to hungry people.
EZK.18.16	He would give clothes to people who had none.
EZK.18.17	He would not do any wrong thing. He would not take back too much money from people to whom he had lent it.
EZK.18.17	He would obey my rules. And he would do the things that give me pleasure.
EZK.18.17	This son will not die because his father did bad things. He will stay alive. 
EZK.18.18	But his father did things that were wrong. So he will die. He took too much money from people to whom he had lent it. He took things from his brother.
EZK.18.19	You do not understand why I do not 
EZK.18.20	But I will 
EZK.18.21	A bad man might not do the wrong things that he did any longer. And he might start to do good things. He would begin to obey me. Then he would stay alive. I would not kill him. 
EZK.18.22	I would not remember any of the bad things that he did. 
EZK.18.23	I do not want to kill anyone. That does not give me pleasure’, says the 
EZK.18.24	A good man might not do things that are good and true any longer. He might start to do the same wrong things as bad men. Then I will not remember any of the good things that he did. I will 
EZK.18.25	You say that I am not fair. But listen to me, Israel's people. The things that you do are not fair. 
EZK.18.26	A good man might stop doing good things. If then he does bad things he will die. He will die because he has done wrong things. 
EZK.18.27	A bad man might not do bad things any longer. Then if he does good things he will stay alive. 
EZK.18.28	He has seen that he had done wrong things. And so he has started to do good things. I will not kill him and he will stay alive. 
EZK.18.29	But you, Israel's people, say that I am not fair. You must see that you are not fair to me. The things that you do are wrong.
EZK.18.30	So I will be a 
EZK.18.30	‘You must be sad if you have done bad things. You must be sorry and you must start to do good things. Stop doing bad things and I will not 
EZK.18.31	You must live in a different way. You need new thoughts. You must want to do good things. I am sure that you, Israel's people, do not want to die. 
EZK.18.32	I do not want anyone to die. That gives me no pleasure’, says the 
EZK.18.32	‘Be sad. Turn back to me and stop doing wrong things. Then you will stay alive.’
EZK.19.1	‘Say this to the leaders of Israel. It is a sad song and it is about them.
EZK.19.2	“Your mother was a strong female among the great wild animals.
EZK.19.2	She lay among her young animals. She kept them safe among the males.
EZK.19.3	One of her young animals became a great strong male.
EZK.19.3	He caught animals for food and he tore them into pieces.
EZK.19.3	He also ate men.
EZK.19.4	Men in other countries heard what he did.
EZK.19.4	So they dug a hole and they caught him in it.
EZK.19.4	They pulled him out and they took him to Egypt.
EZK.19.5	The mother saw that her strong son was taken away.
EZK.19.5	So she took another of her sons and she made him big and strong.
EZK.19.6	Now he was big. And he learned to kill and tear his food.
EZK.19.6	And he killed and ate men.
EZK.19.7	He attacked their towns and he broke down their strong buildings.
EZK.19.7	All the people in the country were afraid. The noise that he made frightened them.
EZK.19.8	Men from countries round them came to attack him.
EZK.19.8	They dug a hole and they made him run into it.
EZK.19.8	They caught him and they put him in a box.
EZK.19.9	They took him to the king of Babylon.
EZK.19.9	There they put him in prison.
EZK.19.9	The people on the hills of Israel could not hear his voice any longer.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like a 
EZK.19.10	Her 
EZK.19.11	The branches were strong enough to use as a stick to show a king's power.
EZK.19.11	The 
EZK.19.11	It was very tall and it had many branches.
EZK.19.12	But I was angry with it. So I threw it to the ground.
EZK.19.12	The east wind dried it up and its leaves died.
EZK.19.12	They took its fruit.
EZK.19.12	Its strong branches dried and they burnt them in a fire.
EZK.19.13	Now the 
EZK.19.14	Fire from one of its big branches burnt up its fruit.
EZK.19.14	Now it has no big branches that men can make into a special stick.
EZK.19.14	That stick is for the king.
EZK.19.14	This is a sad story for people to sing.” ’
EZK.20.1	In the tenth (10th) day of the fifth (5th) month some of Israel's leaders came to me. That was in the seventh (7th) year in Babylon. They sat in front of me. They wanted me to ask the 
EZK.20.2	Then the 
EZK.20.3	‘Son of man, say this to the leaders of Israel. “This is what the 
EZK.20.4	You must be a 
EZK.20.5	Say to them: ‘On the day that I chose Israel's people, I the 
EZK.20.6	I said that I would take them out of Egypt.
EZK.20.6	And I promised to take them to a country that I had chosen for them. It was a most beautiful country and it would give them milk and sweet food. 
EZK.20.7	I said to them: You must each destroy the 
EZK.20.8	But your fathers would not obey me. They would not listen to me, and they did not destroy their 
EZK.20.9	But the people who lived near to Egypt knew about me. They had seen that I had taken the 
EZK.20.10	So I took the people out of Egypt. Then I led them into the 
EZK.20.11	I gave them my rules. I told them how I wanted them to live. The man that obeys my rules will live a good life. 
EZK.20.12	And I gave them the 
EZK.20.13	But when Israel's people were in the 
EZK.20.14	I wanted the 
EZK.20.15	But I spoke to my people in the 
EZK.20.16	I would not do this because they had not obeyed my rules. And they had done so many wrong things. They wanted to 
EZK.20.17	But I was kind to them. I did not kill them in the 
EZK.20.18	I spoke to their children in the 
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	Make the 
EZK.20.21	But the children did not obey my rules. They did not do the things that give me pleasure. (But people who obey my rules will stay alive.) And they did not make the 
EZK.20.22	But I did not kill them. All the 
EZK.20.23	There in the 
EZK.20.24	This was because they had not obeyed my rules. Nor had they made the 
EZK.20.25	So I let them obey their own rules. They were bad rules and they could not give life. 
EZK.20.26	I let them kill their first-born children to offer to 
EZK.20.27	Son of man, you must speak to Israel's people and say, ‘This is what the 
EZK.20.28	They came to the country that I had promised to give them. They looked at the mountains and high hills When I took them there they offered gifts to 
EZK.20.29	They did this on the high places that they all turn to.”’
EZK.20.30	Say this to Israel's people. ‘This is what the 
EZK.20.31	You offer your sons to them in the fire as gifts. This shows how bad you are. You must see that. But you still do it even to this day. I cannot let you ask me for help. I am surely alive and I will not let you do this.
EZK.20.32	You say: “We want to be like people in other countries. They 
EZK.20.33	I am alive’, says the

EZK.20.39	Israel's people, this is what the 
EZK.20.40	The high mountain of Israel is my 
EZK.20.41	You will be like a sweet smell to me when I bring you home. I will bring you back from all the 
EZK.20.42	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	Then you will remember all the wrong things that you did. You will be sorry. You will be ashamed of the

EZK.21.5	Then all the people will know that I am the 
EZK.21.6	So cry with a loud voice, son of man. Let them see how sad and sorry you are. 
EZK.21.7	They will ask you why you are so sad. Then you will say, ‘Because of the bad news that is coming to you. Every one of you will be afraid and will become weak. Your hands will hang down and your knees will bend. You will be very afraid. You can be sure that I am coming to 
EZK.21.8	The 
EZK.21.9	‘Son of man, 
EZK.21.9	I have a

EZK.21.10	This 
EZK.21.11	I have made it ready to hold in the hand.
EZK.21.11	It is sharp and it shines. My

EZK.21.23	The people in Jerusalem may think that the king of Babylon is their friend. He should be their friend because of the promises that they made to each other. They think that he will not attack them. But he will attack because the people in Jerusalem have done many wrong things. That is what I say. He will make them his 
EZK.21.24	This then is what the 
EZK.21.25	King of Israel, you are 
EZK.21.26	This is what the 
EZK.21.27	I will break down your city. This will not happen until my chosen man comes. I will give the city to him. It belongs to him.”
EZK.21.28	You, son of man, must 
EZK.21.28	“A 
EZK.21.28	It shines like the light that moves quickly from the sky.
EZK.21.29	Your 
EZK.21.29	They have told you about pictures that I have not given them.
EZK.21.29	They say that things will happen. But I did not tell them that they should say those things.
EZK.21.29	The 
EZK.21.29	The time has come when I will 
EZK.21.30	Put your 
EZK.21.30	I will be your 
EZK.21.30	In the country that I gave to your fathers, I will 
EZK.21.31	You will see that I am angry with you.
EZK.21.31	I will give you to men who are not kind.
EZK.21.31	They are men who like to kill.
EZK.21.32	You will be like wood in the fire.
EZK.21.32	They will pour your blood on the land.
EZK.21.32	Nobody will remember you.
EZK.21.32	I, the 
EZK.22.1	The 
EZK.22.2	‘Son of man, you must tell the people in this city that I am going to be their 
EZK.22.3	Say to them, “This is what the 
EZK.22.4	I will 
EZK.22.5	Those who live near and those far away will laugh. You are a city full of 
EZK.22.6	In you, each leader of Israel used his power to kill men. 
EZK.22.7	In you they have not given any 
EZK.22.8	You gave no 
EZK.22.9+EZK.22.10	In you, are men who say wrong things. They say what is not true. They say it in order to kill other people. In you, there are men who have sex with other men's wives. They do the bad things that they did in Egypt. The people there give food to 
EZK.22.11	There are men who have sex with other men's wives. There are those who have sex with their daughters or their son's wives. Some have sex with their sisters, the daughters of their own fathers. 
EZK.22.12	In you, men pay money for one man to kill another. They lend money to people. But they make those men give them a lot more money back. In you, men make people give them money in ways that are not fair. And you have forgotten me’, says the 
EZK.22.13	‘I am very angry because you have killed people. You have not been fair. You have taken more money than was right. 
EZK.22.14	I will 
EZK.22.15	I will send you to many different countries. I will make you 
EZK.22.16	All 
EZK.22.17	The 
EZK.22.18	‘Son of man, Israel's people are like dirt to me. Men burn metals in a fire so that they can take out the 
EZK.22.19	So this is what the 
EZK.22.20	Men bring metals into a hot fire to make them soft. I will do the same thing to you. I will bring you into the city and I will make you soft. I will do this because I am so angry. 
EZK.22.21	I will bring you into Jerusalem. And I will burn you with my 
EZK.22.22	They make 
EZK.22.23	The 
EZK.22.24	‘Son of man, speak to the land. Say, “I am angry and I will not send you any rain.” 
EZK.22.25	Your leaders agree to hurt people. They take valuable things from the people and they kill many women's husbands. They are like wild animals that tear up their meat. 
EZK.22.26	The 
EZK.22.27	Their officers are like wild animals that tear their meat. They do not 
EZK.22.28	Their 
EZK.22.29	The people in this country make people afraid and take their money. They are not kind to poor people or to those people who are weak. They hurt 
EZK.22.30	I tried to find a man who would help me to save the land. Then I would not have to destroy it. But I could not find a man to help me. 
EZK.22.31	So I will burn the people up with my great 
EZK.23.1	The 
EZK.23.2	‘Son of man, a woman had two daughters. They were sisters. 
EZK.23.3	Men in Egypt paid to have sex with them. They sold themselves to men from the time that they were young. Men touched their young breasts and made love to them. 
EZK.23.4	The older sister was called Oholah. The younger one was Oholibah. They belonged to me, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
EZK.23.5	Oholah sold herself to other men while she was still mine. She wanted to have sex with the people who live in Assyria, her 
EZK.23.6	Their soldiers wore red and blue clothes. They were officers and rulers and they were all very beautiful. They rode on horses. 
EZK.23.7	Oholah had sex with all the important people who live in Assyria. And she 
EZK.23.8	She continued to sell her body as she had done in Egypt. She had sex with men. She was quite as bad as when she was young.
EZK.23.9	I gave her to her 
EZK.23.10	They took off all her clothes and they took all her sons and daughters. Then they killed her. Her story made women afraid because I 
EZK.23.11	Oholibah, her sister saw this, but did even worse things than her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She, too, wanted to have sex with the people who live in Assyria. She wanted the beautiful young officers and the rulers on horses to love her. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she, like her sister, was not 
EZK.23.14	But she did more bad things than her sister. She saw pictures on the walls. They were pictures of men from Babylon They wore red clothes. 
EZK.23.15	They had belts round their bodies and cloths round their heads. They looked like officers who drove 
EZK.23.16	As soon as she saw the officers, she wanted them. She sent 
EZK.23.17	Then they came to her from Babylon. And they had sex with her. They made her not 
EZK.23.18	I turned away from her when she had sex with other men. She was quite like her sister. 
EZK.23.19	But she wanted more and more men to love her. She had had sex when she was young. She remembered about that. At that time she had sex with men in Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	They had loved her more like animals than men. 
EZK.23.21	She very much wanted to have sex like that again.
EZK.23.22	So this is what the 
EZK.23.23	Men from Babylon and Chaldea will come. And men from Pekod, Shoa and Koa will come. All the people who live in Assyria will come with them. They will be beautiful young men, officers, rulers and important men. They will all ride on horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will fight you with arms and 
EZK.23.25	I am very angry with you. And they are angry with you. They will cut off your noses and ears. They will kill any men that remain. They will take away your sons and daughters. And they will burn the rest of your people with fire. 
EZK.23.26	They will take away your clothes and all your valuable things. 
EZK.23.27	You will no longer do the wrong things that you began to do in Egypt. I will stop you. You will never want to think about them or remember Egypt any longer.”
EZK.23.28	So this is what the 
EZK.23.29	They will show you how much they 
EZK.23.30	I am 
EZK.23.31	You have done the same bad things that your sister did. So I will 
EZK.23.32	This is what the 
EZK.23.32	“I will give you the same 
EZK.23.32	It will be a strong 
EZK.23.32	It will make people laugh. And they will think that you have no value.
EZK.23.33	You will all be sad and you will get drunk.
EZK.23.33	They will break down your cities and your country will be empty.
EZK.23.33	It will be like your sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	Your 
EZK.23.34	That is what I have said”, says the 
EZK.23.35	“So this is what I say to you”, says the 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	They have not been 
EZK.23.38	At the same time, they did not keep 
EZK.23.39	The same day that they gave their children to 
EZK.23.40	The sisters sent messages to men in a far country. When the men came to visit them they made themselves beautiful with paint and pretty stones. 
EZK.23.41	They sat on a soft seat and they put a table in front of it. On the table they put oils with sweet smells. But those oils belonged to me.
EZK.23.42	Men from the 
EZK.23.43	I said: “Let them have sex with the woman. She has had so much sex that she is tired. That is now the only way that anyone can use her.” 
EZK.23.44	So the men used her for sex. They paid Oholah and Oholibah to have sex with them. 
EZK.23.45	But men who do good things will 
EZK.23.46	This is what the 
EZK.23.47	The crowd will throw stones at them and cut them with 
EZK.23.48	So I will stop people from using their bodies in a wrong way. I will make women want to do what is good and right. 
EZK.23.49	I will 
EZK.24.1	The 
EZK.24.2	‘Remember this day, son of man. On this day, the king of Babylon is starting to attack Jerusalem. 
EZK.24.3	Tell a story to this people who do not obey me. Say, “This is what the 
EZK.24.3	Put the pot on the fire. Fill it with water.
EZK.24.4	Put into it the best pieces of meat, the leg and the shoulder.
EZK.24.4	Fill it with all the best bones. 
EZK.24.5	Take them from sheep that are the best to eat.
EZK.24.5	Put wood under the pot and boil it to cook the meat and the bones.
EZK.24.6	This is what the 
EZK.24.6	I will make sorry the city where they killed men.
EZK.24.6	This city is like a pot that nobody has cleaned. They have taken out every piece of meat. They have not left one piece. 
EZK.24.7	Men can see the blood that poured out on the streets. No dirt covers it. 
EZK.24.8	I am very angry. So I let all men see the blood that you poured out.
EZK.24.9	So this is what the 
EZK.24.9	I will make the city that poured out this blood very sad.
EZK.24.9	And I will put wood on the fire.
EZK.24.10	So make the fire burn and cook the meat well.
EZK.24.10	Put in more things that will make it taste good. Let the bones burn.
EZK.24.11	Put the empty pot on the fire so that it becomes red and hot.
EZK.24.11	The fire should burn away all its dirt.
EZK.24.12	But the dirt will not burn away. Even fire cannot do this.
EZK.24.13	The bad things that you do are like your dirt. I tried to make you 
EZK.24.14	I, the 
EZK.24.14	I will not stop. I will not be kind or make the 
EZK.24.15	The 
EZK.24.16	‘Son of man I will take away the one person who gives you great pleasure. I will do it quickly. But you must not look sad or cry. 
EZK.24.17	You must not make a lot of noise. You must not show people how sad you are. Keep your head covered and your feet. Do not cover part of your face. People eat special food when someone dies. But you must not do this.’
EZK.24.18	That morning I spoke to the people. In the evening my wife died. The next morning I did what the 
EZK.24.19	Then the people asked me what this meant for them. 
EZK.24.20	So I said to them, ‘The 
EZK.24.21	“Say this to Israel's people: This is what the 
EZK.24.22	Then you will do the same things that I have done. You will not cover part of your face. You will not eat special food. People eat special food when someone dies. But you will not do that. 
EZK.24.23	You will not cry or look sad. You will wear your hats and shoes. You will be sorry. You will become thin because of the bad things that you have done. 
EZK.24.24	I have made Ezekiel show you what I will do to you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.24.25	On that day, son of man, I will destroy all the things that they love. I will destroy their beautiful buildings and I will take away their sons and daughters. 
EZK.24.26	A man will run away from Jerusalem. He will bring you the bad news on the day that I cause these things to happen. 
EZK.24.27	At that time you will become able to speak. You will talk with him. You will no longer be quiet. This will show the people that I am the 
EZK.25.1	The 
EZK.25.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Turn your face towards the people in Ammon. You must 
EZK.25.3	Say to them, “Listen to the message from the 
EZK.25.4	So I will give you to the people in the East as a gift. Their armies will come and they will put 
EZK.25.5	I will make Rabbah a place where 
EZK.25.6	So this is what the 
EZK.25.7	Because of this I will attack you. 
EZK.25.8	The 
EZK.25.9	Because of this, I will make the towns at the edge of Moab weak. These are Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim. They are the best towns in the country. 
EZK.25.10	I will give Moab with the 
EZK.25.11	And I will 
EZK.25.12	“This is what the 
EZK.25.13	‘Because they did this’, the 
EZK.25.14	I will use Israel's people to 
EZK.25.15	“This is what the 
EZK.25.16	So this is what the 
EZK.25.17	I am very angry with them and I will 
EZK.26.1	The 
EZK.26.2	‘Tyre's people have said: “Good! Now we have broken down the walls of Jerusalem. Its doors are open to us. Tyre will become a rich city because we have destroyed Jerusalem.” 
EZK.26.3	So this is what the 
EZK.26.4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and they will pull down its strong buildings. I will pull away all the stones that they used to build it. 
EZK.26.5	There, men will dry the things that they use to catch fish. They will dry them on the rock where Tyre was before. That is what I say”, says the 
EZK.26.6	“Armies with 
EZK.26.7	Now this is what the 
EZK.26.8	He will attack and destroy all your towns and villages on the land near the sea. He will build hills to attack your walls. 
EZK.26.9	He will hit your walls with very heavy long sticks. And he will destroy your high buildings. 
EZK.26.10	He will have many horses. Their feet will cause dirt to cover you. He will break through your walls and he will bring in his horses and 
EZK.26.11	While his horses go along your streets, his soldiers will kill people. They will kill them with their 
EZK.26.12	They will take away all your food and the things that you sell. They will break down your beautiful buildings. They will throw into the sea all the wood and stone that made them. 
EZK.26.13	Nobody will sing your songs any longer. Nobody will hear your music any longer. 
EZK.26.14	I will cause you to become just a rock in the sea. Men will dry there the things that they use to catch fish. They will never build you again. That is what I say’, says the 
EZK.26.15	This is what the 
EZK.26.16	Then the 
EZK.26.17	Then they will make a sad song about you:
EZK.26.17	“Great city of men of the sea, I have completely destroyed you.
EZK.26.17	You and your people were the strong men of the sea.
EZK.26.17	You made everyone else afraid of you. 
EZK.26.18	Now people on the land are afraid on the day that you fall.
EZK.26.18	The islands in the sea are afraid because I have made you fall.” ’
EZK.26.19	This is what the 
EZK.26.20	Then I will make you fall into the earth. You will go to be with men who have died. You will not return. Nobody will ever live in you again. 
EZK.26.21	I will completely destroy you. People will look for you but they will never find you, says the 
EZK.27.1	The 
EZK.27.2	‘Son of man, you must sing this sad song for Tyre. Tyre is like a gate to the sea. From there, men go to sell things to many peoples. 
EZK.27.3	Say to Tyre's people: This is what the 
EZK.27.3	You say that the 
EZK.27.4	You ruled the great seas. Men made you a beautiful city like a boat on the sea.
EZK.27.5	They used wood from the 
EZK.27.5	They took the 
EZK.27.6	They made flat sticks (oars) from 
EZK.27.6	They made your deck with 
EZK.27.7	They made your 
EZK.27.7	The beautiful 
EZK.27.7	Over your deck they put 
EZK.27.7	It came from Elishah's country by the sea.
EZK.27.8	Men from Sidon and Arvad pushed you through the water.
EZK.27.8	Your men from Tyre told them how to do this. And they told them where to go.
EZK.27.9	Men from Gebal went with you. They had made boats for many years.
EZK.27.9	Sailors from many ships bought and sold things in your shops.
EZK.27.10	You had men from Persia, Lydia and Put (Libya) in your army.
EZK.27.10	They hung their arms in the houses where your soldiers lived.
EZK.27.10	They fought and won your fights for you.
EZK.27.10	They brought you 
EZK.27.11	Men from Arvad and Helech stood on your walls.
EZK.27.11	And men from Gammad kept your tall buildings safe.
EZK.27.11	They hung their arms on your walls. They made you beautiful.
EZK.27.12	You had many different things to sell. So men from Tarshish came to buy from you. They brought 
EZK.27.13	Men from Greece, Tubal and Meshech came. They paid you with slaves and metals.
EZK.27.14	Men from Beth Togarmah came. They sold you horses to use for war or for work.
EZK.27.15	Men from Rhodes and other countries by the sea came to you. They paid you with 
EZK.27.16	People from Aram came because you had so many things to sell. They brought you coloured stones of great value. And they brought the best cloth with pretty colours on it.
EZK.27.17	People from Judah and Israel came to buy things from you. They paid you with food 
EZK.27.18	Men from Damascus came to buy your things. They came because you had many different things to sell. They sold you 
EZK.27.19	Men from Dan and 
EZK.27.20	People from Dedan sold you blankets for your horses.
EZK.27.21	Men from Arabia and the leaders of Kedar all came to buy your things. They bought and sold young sheep, male sheep and goats.
EZK.27.22	Men from Sheba and Raamah came to buy and to sell many valuable things. These were pretty stones, gold and things to make food taste good (spices).
EZK.27.23	Men from many towns came to you to buy and sell things. They came from Haran, Canneh and Eden. Other men came from Sheba, Asshur and Kilmad. 
EZK.27.24	They came to the centre of your town. There they bought and sold beautiful clothes, good blue cotton cloth and strong carpets.
EZK.27.25	You were like a ship from Tarshish.
EZK.27.25	You carried the things that you wanted to buy and sell.
EZK.27.25	You sailed on the sea. You were full of heavy things.
EZK.27.26	Men took sticks that they had made from wood (oars). With them they pushed your boats. The boats went over the deep sea.
EZK.27.26	But the east wind there will break you into small pieces.
EZK.27.27	All your valuable things and all the people in the boat
EZK.27.27	will fall into the deep sea.
EZK.27.27	The men who buy and sell will fall.
EZK.27.27	The soldiers and the sailors in the ship will all fall.
EZK.27.27	They will fall into the sea when the boat breaks.
EZK.27.28	The land by the sea will 
EZK.27.28	It will move when people hear your sailors cry out.
EZK.27.29	The men who push the boat will jump out of the ship. They push the boat with sticks that they made from wood (oars).
EZK.27.29	Sailors and people by the sea 
EZK.27.30	will stand there and cry. They will make a loud noise.
EZK.27.30	They will put dirt on their heads and on their clothes.
EZK.27.31	They will cut the hair from their heads and they will wear old clothes.
EZK.27.31	They will do this because God is 
EZK.27.31	They will be very sorry and they will cry about you.
EZK.27.32	They will sing a sad song about you while they walk up and down.
EZK.27.32	“Nobody ever destroyed a city as God has destroyed Tyre.
EZK.27.32	Tyre was a city with sea all round it.”
EZK.27.33	You gave good things to many 
EZK.27.33	You had valuable things and you sold them to kings.
EZK.27.33	You made all the kings in the world become rich men.
EZK.27.34	Now the sea has broken you up.
EZK.27.34	You are under its waters.
EZK.27.34	All your things and your people are under the sea.
EZK.27.35	The people who live by the sea are afraid.
EZK.27.35	They are afraid because they have seen you fall.
EZK.27.35	Their kings 
EZK.27.35	Their faces have become long and sad.
EZK.27.36	Men from other 
EZK.27.36	They are afraid that they too will fall.
EZK.27.36	God has destroyed your city. You will never return.’
EZK.28.1	The 
EZK.28.2	‘Son of man, say this to the ruler of Tyre. “This is what the 
EZK.28.2	You thought that you were very great.
EZK.28.2	You said to yourself, ‘I am a god.
EZK.28.2	I am sitting on a 
EZK.28.2	But you are a man and not a god.
EZK.28.2	You think that you are as 
EZK.28.3	But you are not as 
EZK.28.3	You do not know all secrets.
EZK.28.4	You have been clever enough to get many valuable things.
EZK.28.4	You have stored much gold and 
EZK.28.5	You buy and sell in a clever way, so you have many valuable things.
EZK.28.5	You think that you are great. You think that because you are so rich.
EZK.28.5	So this is what the 
EZK.28.6	You think that you are as 
EZK.28.7	So I am bringing foreign soldiers to fight you.
EZK.28.7	They will be less kind than people from any 
EZK.28.7	Their 
EZK.28.7	It will no longer be beautiful.
EZK.28.8	They will kill you and they will send your bodies into the sea.
EZK.28.9	Your enemies will come to kill you.
EZK.28.9	Then you will no longer say that you are a god.
EZK.28.10	They will kill you in the same way as they kill other people. They will kill you like people who do not belong to God.
EZK.28.10	That is what I say,” says the 
EZK.28.11	The 
EZK.28.12	‘Son of man, you must make a sad song about the king of Tyre. Speak to him. Say, “This is what the 
EZK.28.12	‘I did not see anything bad in you.
EZK.28.12	You were completely beautiful. You were 
EZK.28.13	You lived in the garden of God (Eden).
EZK.28.13	I had covered your body with beautiful stones of every kind.
EZK.28.13	They were of different colours, red, blue, green, yellow and other colours too.
EZK.28.13	Gold held the stones together.
EZK.28.13	I made them for you on the day that I made you.
EZK.28.14	I chose you to keep my garden safe.
EZK.28.14	I gave you that work to do for me.
EZK.28.14	You lived on my 
EZK.28.14	You walked among the burning fires.
EZK.28.15	You were not bad in any way.
EZK.28.15	You were completely 
EZK.28.15	But later, I saw that you had become bad.
EZK.28.16	You bought and sold things. You fought for the things that you wanted.
EZK.28.16	That was your 
EZK.28.16	So I sent you out of my mountain to make you ashamed.
EZK.28.16	You no longer walked among the fires.
EZK.28.17	But you still thought that you were very great.
EZK.28.17	You liked to think that you were very beautiful.
EZK.28.17	You used your 
EZK.28.17	Because of this, I threw you down to the earth.
EZK.28.17	Their kings saw how you had fallen.
EZK.28.18	You bought and sold things. But you did it in a way that was not fair.
EZK.28.18	That is how your 
EZK.28.18	So I made a fire come out of you to burn you up.
EZK.28.18	Everyone saw you become ashes on the ground.
EZK.28.19	The 
EZK.28.19	They saw that your life had such a bad end. So they were not happy.
EZK.28.19	You will not be alive again.’ ” ’
EZK.28.20	The 
EZK.28.21	‘Son of man, you must turn against Sidon. 
EZK.28.22	“This is what the 
EZK.28.22	‘I am against you, Sidon.
EZK.28.22	But the people in you will give me 
EZK.28.22	I will 
EZK.28.22	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.28.22	Then they will know that I am 
EZK.28.23	I will cause them to become ill.
EZK.28.23	I will make blood run through its streets.
EZK.28.23	They will kill the men in the city.
EZK.28.23	Enemies will attack Sidon from every side.
EZK.28.23	Then its people will know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	I will kill the people in the countries round Israel.
EZK.28.24	They will no longer be like sharp points on plants that cause Israel's people pain.
EZK.28.24	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.28.25	This is what the 
EZK.28.26	I will make them safe while they live there. They will build houses and they will plant 
EZK.29.1	The 
EZK.29.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Turn against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. You must 
EZK.29.3	Speak to him and say: The 
EZK.29.3	I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
EZK.29.3	You are like the great wild animal that lies in your streams.
EZK.29.3	You say, “The River Nile is mine; I made it for myself.”
EZK.29.4	But I will catch you like a fish.
EZK.29.4	I will catch your mouth with a piece of bent metal.
EZK.29.4	I will pull you out of your streams.
EZK.29.4	Little fish will hang on the points of your skin.
EZK.29.5	I will leave you and your little fish in the 
EZK.29.5	You will lie on the ground.
EZK.29.5	And nobody will pick you up.
EZK.29.5	I will give you as food to the wild animals and birds.
EZK.29.6	Then all the people in Egypt will know that I am the 
EZK.29.6	Israel's people thought that you would help them. 
EZK.29.7	But your help was like a thin stick. It broke. And it tore their shoulders when they held it. And it hurt their backs when they put weight on it.’
EZK.29.8	So this is what the 
EZK.29.9	I will make Egypt become a 
EZK.29.9	I am against you because you said, “The River Nile is mine. I made it.”
EZK.29.10	I am against you and your streams. I will destroy the country called Egypt. I will destroy it from Migdol to Aswan, as far as Cush. I will make it a 
EZK.29.11	No men or animals will walk there and nobody will live there for forty (40) years. 
EZK.29.12	It will become a 
EZK.29.13	But this is what the 
EZK.29.14	I will bring them back from their prisons. I will bring them to Pathros, the country of their fathers. There they will not be important. 
EZK.29.15	Their king will be the least important of all kings. People will never again think that Egypt is important. I will make it so weak that it can never rule over other 
EZK.29.16	Egypt's people will no longer be able to help Israel. But they will make Israel's people remember their 
EZK.29.17	The 
EZK.29.18	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon fought to win the city called Tyre. His soldiers carried such great weights that their skin broke. And it bled. But they did not find there any things of value to pay for their work.’
EZK.29.19	So this is what the 
EZK.29.20	I will do this to pay him. He and his army did what I wanted. So I will pay him’, says the 
EZK.29.21	‘When that happens, I will make Israel's people strong. Then I will open your mouth to speak to them. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.1	The 
EZK.30.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘
EZK.30.2	“A day is coming that will frighten you all!”
EZK.30.3	That day will be very soon. It is the day when the 
EZK.30.3	He will bring clouds and trouble to the 
EZK.30.4	Enemies will come to fight with Egypt.
EZK.30.4	The people in Cush will be sad.
EZK.30.4	Many men in Egypt will die
EZK.30.4	and enemies will carry away their valuable things.
EZK.30.4	They will break its cities into pieces.
EZK.30.5	Soldiers who fight for Egypt will die, too. They came from Cush, Lydia, Libya, Put and the 
EZK.30.6	The 
EZK.30.7	‘Egypt will have more 
EZK.30.8	I will cause them to burn Egypt and those who fight for Egypt. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	On the day that I destroy Egypt, I will send 
EZK.30.10	I will use King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to kill all the people in Egypt. He and his army will take away all Egypt's good things. 
EZK.30.11	They will come to destroy the country. They will attack Egypt's people with 
EZK.30.12	I will cause the river Nile to become dry. 
EZK.30.13	The 
EZK.30.14	I will make Pathros a 
EZK.30.14	I will 
EZK.30.15	Pelusium is the strongest city in Egypt.
EZK.30.15	I will show it that I am very angry.
EZK.30.15	Enemies will take away all the valuable things from Thebes.
EZK.30.16	I will make fire burn the country of Egypt.
EZK.30.16	The pain of Pelusium will be very great.
EZK.30.16	Enemies will come like a storm and they will take Thebes.
EZK.30.16	The people in Memphis will always have trouble.
EZK.30.17	Soldiers will kill the young men in Heliopolis and Bubastis.
EZK.30.17	They will make all the other people their 
EZK.30.18	I will take away Egypt's power.
EZK.30.18	Then the people in Tahpanhes will feel that they are in a dark place.
EZK.30.18	A cloud will cover Egypt.
EZK.30.18	Enemies will take away the people from the villages.
EZK.30.19	This is how I will 
EZK.30.19	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	The 
EZK.30.21	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. He will never again have great power. He will always be weak. 
EZK.30.22	So this is what the 
EZK.30.23	I will send his people away to many other countries. 
EZK.30.24	I will make the king of Babylon strong. I will give him power over Pharaoh. The king of Egypt will cry out like a man who is dying. 
EZK.30.25	I will make the king of Babylon strong. But the king of Egypt will have no power. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	I will send the people in Egypt to many different countries. They will live among the 
EZK.31.1	The 
EZK.31.2	‘Son of man’, he said, ‘Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his soldiers:
EZK.31.2	Nobody is as great or powerful as you are.
EZK.31.3	Think about Assyria. It was like a great 
EZK.31.3	It had beautiful branches that covered other trees.
EZK.31.3	It was very tall and it had many leaves.
EZK.31.4	Waters fed the tree and streams made it grow tall.
EZK.31.4	The streams went round it. And they sent some water to all the other trees.
EZK.31.5	So it became taller than any of the trees in the field.
EZK.31.5	Many long branches grew from it.
EZK.31.5	They grew because it had so much water.
EZK.31.6	All kinds of birds lived in its branches.
EZK.31.6	Under its branches, the wild animals gave birth to their young animals.
EZK.31.6	It kept safe all the great 
EZK.31.7	It was as beautiful as a king in his best clothes.
EZK.31.7	It drank the deep waters.
EZK.31.8	It was more beautiful than the 
EZK.31.8	The 
EZK.31.8	Other trees had fewer branches.
EZK.31.8	No other tree in God's garden was nearly as beautiful.
EZK.31.9	I made the tree beautiful and I gave it its branches.
EZK.31.9	All the trees in Eden (God's garden) wanted to be as beautiful as the 
EZK.31.10	So this is what the 
EZK.31.10	‘Assyria was like that tree. It knew that it was very tall. And it thought that it was more important than any other tree. These thoughts were bad thoughts. 
EZK.31.11	So I made the ruler of the 
EZK.31.12	Cruel 
EZK.31.13	The birds sat on the tree that had fallen. And the wild animals walked over its branches. 
EZK.31.14	I will never again let a tree become so tall. No tree that grows by the waters will grow as big. It grew taller than other trees. Its top was in the clouds. So it thought that it was more important than the other trees. All the trees will die, like men. They will die even when they have much water. They will never grow so high again. They will die like men. And other men will bury them in the ground.’
EZK.31.15	This is what the 
EZK.31.16	The 
EZK.31.17	Some trees are already in the earth. Men will bury the 
EZK.31.18	The king of Egypt and all his people are also like a tree. You are great and powerful. But I will cut you down like the trees of Eden (God's garden). Men will bury you with your dead soldiers. You will lie with those that men have killed with 
EZK.31.18	This is what I will do to Pharaoh and all his armies,’ says the 
EZK.32.1	The 
EZK.32.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Make this sad song about Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And say to him,
EZK.32.2	“You are the strongest among the 
EZK.32.2	You are like the greatest of animals in the seas.
EZK.32.2	You move about in the rivers
EZK.32.2	and you hit the water with your feet.
EZK.32.2	You mix dirt with the clean water.” ’
EZK.32.3	This is what the 
EZK.32.3	‘I will send a great crowd of people
EZK.32.3	and they will catch you in their 
EZK.32.4	I will pull you out of the water
EZK.32.4	and I will throw you on dry ground.
EZK.32.4	I will let the birds land on you in the field.
EZK.32.4	I will give your meat to the wild animals. I will fill their stomachs.
EZK.32.5	I will cause parts of your body to lie on all the mountains
EZK.32.5	and they will fill the valleys.
EZK.32.6	I will cover the ground with your blood. It will run up to the mountains.
EZK.32.6	And your meat will fill the deep valleys.
EZK.32.7	I will hide the stars and I will make the sky dark.
EZK.32.7	I will do this when I make you nothing.
EZK.32.7	I will cover the sun with a cloud
EZK.32.7	and you will not see the moon.
EZK.32.8	I will make the lights in the sky become dark.
EZK.32.8	Your whole country will become dark.
EZK.32.8	I will make it dark’, says the 
EZK.32.9	‘I will destroy your 
EZK.32.9	Then many 
EZK.32.10	They will think that I will give them trouble.
EZK.32.10	And their kings will be afraid because I destroyed you.
EZK.32.10	They will see me 
EZK.32.10	They will think that I will kill them.
EZK.32.10	So each of them will be afraid and they will 
EZK.32.11	So, this is what the 
EZK.32.11	‘The king of Babylon will attack you.
EZK.32.12	His great army will fight against you.
EZK.32.12	I will give his strong men power to kill your soldiers.
EZK.32.12	His people are the most cruel of all 
EZK.32.12	They will change Egypt into a poor weak 
EZK.32.12	They will destroy all its armies.
EZK.32.13	Egypt's people have many cows near its great rivers,
EZK.32.13	but I will destroy them.
EZK.32.13	No men's feet will mix dirt with the water any longer.
EZK.32.13	No animal's feet will remain to make the water dirty.
EZK.32.14	Then I will make the waters quiet.
EZK.32.14	They will move like oil’, says the 
EZK.32.15	‘I will destroy Egypt.
EZK.32.15	I will take away all that you have.
EZK.32.15	I will kill all the people who live there.
EZK.32.15	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	They will sing this sad song for Egypt. Women in all 
EZK.32.17	In the fifteenth (15th) month of the twelfth (12th) year, the 
EZK.32.18	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Be sad and make a loud noise for the many people in Egypt. Send them down to the place of dead people. Send them there with the dead bodies of all the strong 
EZK.32.19	Tell them that they are no better than any other people. They will all go to that place. They will be with those who are not 
EZK.32.20	The people in Egypt will die with the other soldiers who die. A 
EZK.32.21	Great leaders lie in the home of dead people. They will speak about Egypt and its friends. They will say: “Many men died in the fight. They have come down to lie with all of them. They are with those who are not 
EZK.32.22	Assyria is there with its whole army. All its men who died in the fight lie there. They lie round it in the home of dead people. 
EZK.32.23	Their dead bodies are in the deepest parts of that place. Its dead soldiers are all round it. Many armies made people afraid. All their men are now in the country of dead people. Their enemies have killed them.
EZK.32.24	Elam is there with all its dead soldiers round it. Its enemy's 
EZK.32.25	Elam lies on a bed with all its soldiers round it. Not one of them is 
EZK.32.26	Meshech and Tubal are there in the home of dead people. The dead bodies of their soldiers are round them. They are all in the home of dead people. Not one of them is 
EZK.32.27	Now they lie with other dead soldiers who were not 
EZK.32.28	I will kill you too, Pharaoh. And your dead body will lie with those men. You will lie with men who are not 
EZK.32.29	Edom is there. Its kings and leaders are there. Soldiers killed many of their men with 
EZK.32.30	The kings of the north and from Sidon are there. They had great power but they are ashamed. They made men very afraid. But now they lie in the home of dead people.
EZK.32.30	They are with those that men killed with 
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh felt sad because men had killed all his soldiers. When he and his army see those other dead men, they will feel better’, says the 
EZK.32.32	‘Pharaoh and his armies will lie among men who are not 
EZK.32.32	But their dead bodies will lie with other men's bodies. They will lie with men that enemies' 
EZK.33.1	The 
EZK.33.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Speak to the people in your 
EZK.33.3	The man must blow a 
EZK.33.4	The people will hear the 
EZK.33.5	A man may hear the 
EZK.33.6	But the man who is watching may see the enemy. He may see them when they come with 
EZK.33.7	Son of man, I have made you like the man with the 
EZK.33.8	I may say to a bad man, “You are doing something that is wrong. You will die.” Then you must tell him that I am angry. Tell him that I will kill him. If you do not tell him this, he will surely die because of his 
EZK.33.9	That man is doing something that is wrong. You must tell him that. He may not listen to your words. He may not stop doing those things. Then he will die because of his 
EZK.33.10	Son of man, speak to Israel's people. “You say: We have done many wrong things and we are dying. We want to stay alive!”’
EZK.33.11	Tell them, ‘It does not give me pleasure to kill men that do bad things. I want them to stop doing those wrong things and to stay alive. Stop doing things that are wrong, Israel's people. I do not want you to die!’
EZK.33.12	So you must speak to the people in your country, son of man. Say, ‘If a good man starts to do bad things, I will 
EZK.33.12	A good man may stop doing good things. He may start to do bad things. Then he will die. The good things that he had done will not save him.
EZK.33.13	He may think about the good things that he has done. He may think that they will save him. But I will not remember those good things if he then does bad things. I will cause him to die because of the wrong things that he has done.
EZK.33.14	I may say to a bad man: “You must die.” But then he may stop doing wrong things and do good things. 
EZK.33.15	He might give back to a man something that he had taken (something that would make sure that the man would return his money). Or he might return things that were not his. He might start to obey me. If he then does only good things he will stay alive. 
EZK.33.16	I will not remember any of the wrong things that he has done.
EZK.33.16	He has done what is good and right. So he will surely stay alive.
EZK.33.17	Israel's people are saying: “The 
EZK.33.18	A good man may stop doing good things. If he then starts to do bad things he will die. 
EZK.33.19	And a bad man may stop doing bad things. Then he might start to do things that are good and right. Because he has done these good things, he will stay alive. 
EZK.33.20	But Israel's people say: “The 
EZK.33.21	A man ran away from Jerusalem. He came to me when we had been in Babylon for twelve (12) years. He came on the fifth (5th) day of the tenth (10th) month. He said, ‘Enemies have taken the city.’ 
EZK.33.22	The 
EZK.33.23	Then the 
EZK.33.24	‘Son of man’, he said, ‘People live in the broken cities of Israel. This is what they are saying. They say, “Abraham was only one man, but God gave him the country called Israel. But we are many men. Now God has given the country called Israel to us.” 
EZK.33.25	So speak to them. Say: This is what the 
EZK.33.26	You fight to get the things that you want. You do bad things. You have sex with each other's wives. I cannot give the country to you.”’
EZK.33.27	Say this to them. ‘This is what the 
EZK.33.28	I will make the country empty, like a 
EZK.33.29	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	Son of man, your people are talking about you in the streets. They are saying, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the 
EZK.33.31	‘My people will come and sit in front of you. They often do that. They will listen to your words. But they will not obey them. They say that they love me. But they really want to become rich people. They take things from other people. They are not fair. 
EZK.33.32	They do not believe your words. You are like a man who sings beautiful love songs. They listen to your words but they do not obey them.
EZK.33.33	All these things will happen. Then they will know that a 
EZK.34.1	The 
EZK.34.2	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘You must 
EZK.34.3	You eat their milk and you make warm clothes from their 
EZK.34.4	You have not helped the weak sheep to grow strong. You have not made the sick ones well. Nor have you tied up those who were hurting. You have not found the lost sheep and brought them back. You have not ruled them in a kind way. You have been cruel to them. 
EZK.34.5	So my sheep went away to many places because they did not have a 
EZK.34.6	My sheep went over the mountains and the high hills. They were all over the land. Nobody went to find them.’ ” ’ 
EZK.34.7	So I say this to you, my 
EZK.34.8	‘My sheep do not have any 
EZK.34.9	So listen to what I say, you 
EZK.34.10	The 
EZK.34.11	So this is what the 
EZK.34.12	I will be like a 
EZK.34.13	I will bring them back from other countries to their own land. They will eat grass on the mountains of Israel. They will eat it in its valleys and villages. 
EZK.34.14	I will keep them on good land. And they will eat grass on Israel's high places. They will lie down in the good land. They will eat good food on Israel's mountains. 
EZK.34.15	I will keep them safe myself. I will make them lie down and rest’, says the 
EZK.34.16	‘I will find the lost sheep and I will bring them back. I will tie up the ones that are hurting. I will help the weak ones to become strong. But I will kill the fat sheep in a way that is fair.
EZK.34.17	This is what the 
EZK.34.18	You have much good food, so you must not destroy other grass. You have clean water to drink. So you must not make dirty that which remains. 
EZK.34.19	I do not want my sheep to eat grass that you have made too dirty to eat. I do not want them to drink water that you have made dirty with your feet.” ’
EZK.34.20	So this is what the 
EZK.34.21	You attack them with the sharp points (horns) on your heads. Then you push them away with your shoulders. Because you do this, 
EZK.34.22	I will save my sheep. No longer will anyone take them away. I will 
EZK.34.23	I will make my servant David one 
EZK.34.24	I, the 
EZK.34.25	I will make a promise to them. I will give them 
EZK.34.26	I will 
EZK.34.27	The trees will give them their fruit. Seeds that they plant in the ground will give plenty of food to eat. The people will be safe in their country. I will make them free from the men who made them their servants. They will no longer be slaves. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	Other 
EZK.34.29	I will give them a country that gives much good food. So then they will always have enough to eat. They will never be hungry. Other 
EZK.34.30	Then they will know that I, the 
EZK.34.31	‘And you are like my sheep, the sheep of my grass-lands. You are men and I am your God’, says the 
EZK.35.1	The 
EZK.35.2	‘Son of man, look towards

EZK.35.4	I will destroy your towns and nobody will live there. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	‘You continued to 
EZK.35.6	So I make this promise to you. I will surely do this. Your blood will fall to the ground. You will run away from your enemies but you will still die. You were not afraid to kill people, so I will not be afraid to kill you. 
EZK.35.7	I will make 
EZK.35.8	Dead bodies will cover your mountains. Men that enemies' 
EZK.35.9	I will make you into a

EZK.35.11	So I will surely 
EZK.35.11	‘You hurt them because you were angry. You hated them. I will hurt you in the same way that you hurt them. My people will know me when I 
EZK.35.12	Then you will know this. I, the 
EZK.35.13	You said bad things about me. You said that I had only a little power. And you said that I could not help my people. And I heard you say it.’
EZK.35.14	So this is what the 
EZK.35.15	You were happy when you saw me 
EZK.36.1	Son of man, 
EZK.36.2	This is what an enemy has said to you: Your old mountains now belong to us.’
EZK.36.3	So 
EZK.36.4	I am speaking to you, mountains of Israel, because they did this. This is what I say to the mountains and hills and to the valleys. This is what I say to the empty, broken towns. Enemies took away all their good things and they laughed at their people.
EZK.36.5	‘I am very angry’, says the 
EZK.36.6	So 
EZK.36.7	So this is what I say: I promise that people will laugh at the 
EZK.36.8	But you mountains of Israel will give much food for Israel's people. I promise that my people will soon come home. 
EZK.36.9	I love you and I want to give you good things. Men will dig your ground and they will plant seeds in it. 
EZK.36.10	The number of people who live there will grow. They will live in the towns and they will repair the broken buildings. 
EZK.36.11	I will make more men and animals live on you, and they will have many children. People will live on you as they did many years ago. I will give them many good things. They had food before I sent them away. But they will have more. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	I will cause my people, Israel's people, to walk upon you. You will be their land, and you will belong to them and to their children. You will never again lose them.’
EZK.36.13	This is what the 
EZK.36.14	You will no longer destroy or kill the 
EZK.36.15	‘People from other 
EZK.36.16	The 
EZK.36.17	‘Son of man, Israel's people made their own country not 
EZK.36.18	So I became angry and I 
EZK.36.19	I sent them to many different 
EZK.36.20	But they still did the things that took away my 
EZK.36.21	I wanted them to give 
EZK.36.22	So you must speak to Israel's people. Say, “This is what the 
EZK.36.23	I will show them that my name is great and 
EZK.36.24	So I will take you out from the 
EZK.36.25	You will become 
EZK.36.26	I will make you new inside. I will give you a new 
EZK.36.27	And I will put my 
EZK.36.28	You will live in the country that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I save you from the bad things that made you not 
EZK.36.30	I will make the trees give much fruit. And plants will grow well in the fields. Then you will not feel ashamed because you have no food. Other 
EZK.36.31	Then you will remember the 
EZK.36.32	I want you to know that I am not doing this for your 
EZK.36.33	This is what the 
EZK.36.34	You will again make food grow on the empty land. No longer will people who pass it think that it is a 
EZK.36.35	They will say, “This land was like a

EZK.36.37+EZK.36.38	This is what the 
EZK.37.1	The 
EZK.37.2	He made me walk up and down among them. There, on the ground in the valley, I saw many very dry bones.
EZK.37.3	‘Son of man’, he asked me. ‘Can these dry bones become alive?’ ‘
EZK.37.4	‘
EZK.37.5	This is what the 
EZK.37.6	I will make your bones join together and I will put meat on your bones. I will cover you with skin. I will blow air into your bodies. You will become alive. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I 
EZK.37.8	Then I looked. And I saw meat and skin cover the bones. But the bodies were not alive. They did not move or take in air.
EZK.37.9	Then the 
EZK.37.10	So I 
EZK.37.11	Then the 
EZK.37.12	So 
EZK.37.13	I will open the places where they buried you. I will bring you out. Then you, my people, will know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	I will put my 
EZK.37.15	The 
EZK.37.16	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Take a 
EZK.37.17	Make the two sticks join together to become one stick in your hand. 
EZK.37.18	Your people, Israel's people, will ask you why you did this. They will ask, “Please tell us what this means.” 
EZK.37.19	Say to them, “This is what the 
EZK.37.20	Hold the sticks with words on them in front of their eyes.
EZK.37.21	Say to them “This is what the 
EZK.37.22	I will make them become one 
EZK.37.23	They will no longer 
EZK.37.24	My servant David will be their king and he will be their 
EZK.37.25	They will live in the country that I gave to my servant Jacob and his sons. It is the country where your fathers lived. My people and their children and grandchildren will live there. They will live there until the end of time. And David my servant will always be their king. 
EZK.37.26	I will make a promise with them to give them 
EZK.37.27	I will put my 
EZK.37.28	I have put my 
EZK.38.1	The 
EZK.38.2	‘Gog rules the country of Magog. Son of man, turn your face against him’, he said. ‘Gog is the most important 
EZK.38.3	and say: This is what the 
EZK.38.4	And I will turn you round. I will catch your mouth with a sharp piece of metal like a fish. I will catch you and your great army with its men on horses. I will take you and all your soldiers. They have small 
EZK.38.5	Persia, Cush (Sudan) and Put (Libya) will be there with their metal hats and their 
EZK.38.6	Gomer will be there with its armies. And Beth Togarmah and its armies from the north will be with them. I will catch all these many 
EZK.38.7	Prepare to fight. Make all the armies round you ready. You must tell them what they should do. 
EZK.38.8	After many days you will fight. In a future year, you will attack a country. That country's people will not have fought for a long time. The people there came back to Israel's mountains from many 
EZK.38.9	You, your armies and all the 
EZK.38.10	This is what the 
EZK.38.11	You will say: “We will attack a country whose villages have no walls. The people have 
EZK.38.12	I will turn against the people who have returned to build up their broken cities. I will take their good things and their many animals. Now they are in the middle of the land.” 
EZK.38.13	The men in Sheba and Dedan will ask you questions. So will those from Tarshish and its villages. Their people buy and sell things. They will say, “Have you come to take away their good things? Have you and your armies come to carry away their

EZK.38.15	So you will come from your country far in the north. You will come with your great armies. All the soldiers will ride on horses. They will be very many men. 
EZK.38.16	Your armies will be like a cloud that covers the land. I will make you, Gog, attack my country on a future day. I will use you to show the 
EZK.38.17	This is what the 
EZK.38.18	When that day comes, I will become very angry. Gog will attack Israel’, says the 
EZK.38.19	‘Then I will make the whole country of Israel 
EZK.38.20	The fish in the sea, and the birds in the air will be very afraid. And all the animals on the land will be afraid. Everything that moves and all the people on the earth will be afraid. They will all

EZK.39.3	Then I will knock your arms out of your hands. 
EZK.39.4	You will fall on Israel's mountains. You and your soldiers and the 
EZK.39.5	I have decided that you will fall in the fields.’ That is what the 
EZK.39.6	‘I will send fire to burn Magog and the people who live in safe towns by the sea. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	My people, Israel will know that my name is 
EZK.39.8	I promise that I will cause this to happen. You can be sure that this day will come’, says the 
EZK.39.8	‘I told you that this day would come.
EZK.39.9	Then those who live in Israel's towns will go out. They will pick up the arms and they will burn them. They will burn the small and large 
EZK.39.10	They will not have to go into the fields or forests to find wood. They will take away the things from those who took their things’, says the 
EZK.39.11	‘They will bury Gog in the valley east of the sea. They will bury Gog and all his armies there. So men will not be able to walk through this valley. They will call it the valley of Hamon Gog (Gog's army).
EZK.39.12	Israel's people will need seven (7) months to bury all the dead bodies. Then the land will be 
EZK.39.13	All the people in the country will bury the dead bodies. They will always remember that day, the day that I won the fight. They will give me 
EZK.39.14	‘They will choose some men to clean the land. They will travel through all the country. Other men will bury the dead bodies that remain on the ground. They will begin to do this at the end of the seven (7) months. 
EZK.39.15	The men who walk through the country will find dead men's bones. They will put a sign by each one. Then the men who bury the bodies will bury them in the valley of Hamon Gog. 
EZK.39.16	(A town called Hamonah is also there.) That is how they will make the land clean.’
EZK.39.17	Son of man, this is what the 
EZK.39.18	You will eat the meat of great men and you will drink the blood of kings. You will eat them like the fat sheep, cows and animals from Bashan that you eat. 
EZK.39.19	At this 
EZK.39.20	I will give you horses and their riders to eat. I will give you great men and many kinds of soldiers to eat”’, says the 
EZK.39.21	‘I will show my 
EZK.39.22	From that time and for all the time after that, Israel's people will know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the

EZK.39.25	So this is what the 
EZK.39.26	They will forget that they were ashamed. They will forget that they failed to

EZK.40.2	He showed me a picture of the country of Israel. I was standing on a very high mountain. Some buildings that looked like a city were there on its south side. 
EZK.40.3	The 
EZK.40.4	The man spoke to me. ‘Son of man’, he said, ‘Look and listen carefully to me. Remember everything that I show to you. That is why God has brought you here. Tell Israel's people everything that you see.’
EZK.40.5	I saw a wall all the way round the place where the 
EZK.40.6	Then he went to the gate on the east side. He climbed its steps and he measured the size of the 
EZK.40.7	Beyond this was a 
EZK.40.8+EZK.40.9	This room was four (4) metres wide. It was the nearest part of the gate to the 
EZK.40.10	The rooms on each side of the 
EZK.40.11	Then the man measured across the 
EZK.40.12	A wall half a metre high and half a metre wide was in front of each of the rooms. (The rooms were three (3) metres square.) 
EZK.40.13	He measured the space between the back wall of one room and the back wall of the room opposite. It was twelve and a half (12½) metres long. 
EZK.40.14	The room at the other end opened into a yard. That room measured ten (10) metres wide. 
EZK.40.15	The gate measured twenty-five (25) metres from the outside wall to the other room's end. 
EZK.40.16	All the rooms had windows in their outside walls. And they had windows on the walls between the rooms. Men had cut shapes of 
EZK.40.17	The man took me through the gate into the yard. They had built thirty (30) rooms against the outside wall. Flat stones covered the space in front of them. 
EZK.40.18	This space went all round the yard. The outside yard was lower down than the inside yard.
EZK.40.19	There was a gate to the inside yard. The man measured fifty (50) metres between the two gates.
EZK.40.20	Then the man measured the gate on the north side of the outside yard. 
EZK.40.21	He measured the 
EZK.40.22	The 
EZK.40.23	From this gate across the yard was the gate to the inside yard. It was the same as on the east side. The man measured fifty (50) metres between the two gates.
EZK.40.24	Next, the man took me to the south side, and we saw another gate there. The man measured its walls and the 
EZK.40.25	The rooms in this gate had windows that were the same as those in the other gates. The whole gate was twenty-five (25) metres long and twelve and a half (12½) metres wide. 
EZK.40.26	Seven (7) steps went up to it. The way in was also at the end by the yard. They had cut the shapes of 
EZK.40.27	Here too, was a gate into the inside yard. The man measured fifty (50) metres between the two gates.
EZK.40.28	The man took me through the south gate into the inside yard. He measured the gate. It was the same size as the gates in the outside wall. 
EZK.40.29+EZK.40.30	The 
EZK.40.31	Its 
EZK.40.32	The man took me through the east gate into the inside yard. He measured the gate. He found that it was the same size as the other gates. 
EZK.40.33	The 
EZK.40.34	The 
EZK.40.35	The man took me to the north gate. He measured it. He found that it was the same size as the other gates. 
EZK.40.36	Like them, it had rooms for the 
EZK.40.37	The 
EZK.40.38	They had put a small building in the outside yard. It was next to the north side of the inside gate. Its door opened from the 
EZK.40.39	In the 
EZK.40.40	They had put four (4) more tables outside the room by the north gate's 
EZK.40.41	I counted eight (8) tables on which they killed animals for 
EZK.40.42	Someone had made the tables in the room out of stone. They put the animals on them. There they would kill the animals that they burnt whole. These tables were fifty (50) centimetres high and their tops were seventy-five (75) centimetres square. They kept all the things that they used to kill the animals on these tables. 
EZK.40.43	They had raised the edges all round each table by seven and a half (7½) centimetres. They put all the meat that they would 
EZK.40.44	Then the man brought me into the inside yard. Two rooms had doors to the inside yard. One was by the north gate and its door opened towards the south. The other room was by the south gate and its door opened towards the north. 
EZK.40.45	The man told me that one room was for the 
EZK.40.46	The other room's door opened to the north. The 
EZK.40.47	The man measured the inside yard. It was square, fifty (50) metres long and fifty (50) metres wide. The 
EZK.40.48	Then he took me into the 
EZK.40.49	Steps went up to the 
EZK.41.1	Then the man took me into the room in the centre, the 
EZK.41.2	and five (5) metres wide. The walls on either side were two and a half (2½) metres thick. The room itself measured twenty (20) metres long and ten (10) metres wide. 
EZK.41.3	Then he measured the 
EZK.41.4	The room measured ten (10) metres square. It was behind the 
EZK.41.5	Then the man measured the wall of the 
EZK.41.6	Three (3) rooms were on top of each other. They were all round the 
EZK.41.7	The walls at the top of the 
EZK.41.7	Against the 
EZK.41.8+EZK.41.9+EZK.41.10+EZK.41.11	The outside wall of these rooms was two and a half (2½) metres thick. One door opened into the north side rooms of the 
EZK.41.12	A building was at the west side of the 
EZK.41.13	Then the man measured the outside of the 
EZK.41.14	He measured the space across the front of the 
EZK.41.15	The building at the west, with its 
EZK.41.16	They had covered the inside walls of the 
EZK.41.17+EZK.41.18	Men had cut shapes above the doors and all over the walls. They were shapes of 
EZK.41.19	On one side, a human face looked at the 
EZK.41.20	These pictures went from the floor to above the doors. 
EZK.41.21	The 
EZK.41.22	There was an 
EZK.41.23	A door opened into the 
EZK.41.24	Both of these doors opened down the middle. 
EZK.41.25	Men had made pictures on the doors. They were pictures of 
EZK.41.26	This room had thin windows in its sides. Men had cut shapes of 
EZK.42.1	Then the man took me into the outside yard. We went to a building near the 
EZK.42.2	This building was fifty (50) metres long and twenty-five (25) metres wide. There was a ten (10) metre space between it and the 
EZK.42.3	It had three (3) sets of rooms. They were on top of each other. Each was a little way behind the one below it. 
EZK.42.4	A path went along inside its north side. It was fifty (50) metres long and five (5) metres wide. The 
EZK.42.5	The rooms at the top were not as wide as the rooms below them. And they were not as wide as the rooms below them. 
EZK.42.6	Each of the two groups of rooms at the top was on a wide wall. They were not on 
EZK.42.7	The wall in front of the lowest rooms had no doors for twenty-five (25) metres. Rooms filled the other 25 metres. 
EZK.42.8	At the top, there were rooms from one end to the other. 
EZK.42.9	They had made an 
EZK.42.10	A building like this one was at the south side of the 
EZK.42.11	A path went along its side. The sizes and 
EZK.42.12	They had made a door at its east end. The door went to the set of rooms that was below the other sets of rooms. The door was on the building's south side, where the wall began.
EZK.42.13	The man spoke to me. ‘The north and south rooms towards the yard are for the 
EZK.42.14	The 
EZK.42.15	Then he had finished measuring everything inside the place where the 
EZK.42.16	He measured the wall of the east side with his stick. It was two hundred and fifty (250) metres. 
EZK.42.17+EZK.42.18+EZK.42.19	Then he measured the north side and the south side and the west side. Each one measured the same as the east side, two hundred and fifty (250) metres. 
EZK.42.20	So the walls made a square round the 
EZK.43.1	Then the man brought me to the east gate. 
EZK.43.2	And I saw the shining 
EZK.43.3	I had seen a dream picture like this by the River Kebar. That was when God had come to destroy the city. I fell down on my face. 
EZK.43.4	The shining light went through the east gate into the 
EZK.43.5	Then the 
EZK.43.6	The man stood there by my side. I heard the 
EZK.43.7	‘Son of man’, he said. ‘Here is my 
EZK.43.8	They built the 
EZK.43.9	Now they must stop doing those 
EZK.43.10	Son of man, tell Israel's people about the 
EZK.43.11	Then they will become ashamed of what they have done. You must tell them all about the way to build the 
EZK.43.12	All the top of the mountain round the 
EZK.43.13	The man measured the 
EZK.43.14	The lowest part of the 
EZK.43.15	This top part was two metres high. They burnt the 
EZK.43.16	The top of the 
EZK.43.17	The middle part was also square, with sides seven (7) metres long. It had a wall twenty-five (25) centimetres high round its edge. (They had left a space fifty (50) centimetres wide between the top two parts of the 
EZK.43.18	‘Son of man’, the 
EZK.43.19	The sons of Zadok are the only

EZK.43.24	and bring them to me. The 
EZK.43.25	Each day for a week you must offer 
EZK.43.26	The 
EZK.43.27	The

EZK.44.2	‘This gate must stay shut’, the 
EZK.44.3	Only the king himself can sit inside the gate to eat a 
EZK.44.4	Then the man took me through the north gate. We went to the front of the 
EZK.44.5	‘Son of man, look and listen carefully’, the 
EZK.44.6	Speak to those 
EZK.44.7	You even brought 
EZK.44.8	You did not do the work yourselves. But you made people that I had not chosen work in my

EZK.44.10	Some men from Levi's

DAN.1.1	Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. He came to Jerusalem with his army. Then he caused his soldiers to live round the city. This happened when Jehoiakim had been king of Judah for longer than two years. 
DAN.1.2	God caused Nebuchadnezzar to take Jehoiakim, king of Judah. God helped Nebuchadnezzar to take some things that God's servants used in God's house in Jerusalem also. Nebuchadnezzar took those things back to Babylon. He put them among the valuable things in the house of his own god.
DAN.1.3	Nebuchadnezzar said to Ashpenaz, his most important officer, ‘Bring some of the 
DAN.1.4+DAN.1.5	Nebuchadnezzar wanted young men who were strong and handsome. The young men must be clever. And they must be able to learn and to understand quickly. These young men would be able to become King Nebuchadnezzar's servants. They must learn the language of Babylon and they must learn from the country's books. King Nebuchadnezzar also sent to them each day some of the same food and 
DAN.1.6	Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, who were from Judah, were among these young men. 
DAN.1.7	The important officer gave new names to them. He gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel and he called Hananiah, Shadrach. He gave the name Meshach to Mishael and he called Azariah, Abednego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel thought that God did not want him to eat the king's food and 
DAN.1.9	God had caused that officer to like Daniel. And so the officer was kind to Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	But he spoke to Daniel. ‘I am afraid of the king, who is giving your food and drink to you’, he said. ‘He might see that you are not as strong as the other young men. And then he will kill me.’
DAN.1.11	The officer had chosen a man to rule over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. So Daniel spoke to this man. 
DAN.1.12	‘We are your servants. Please watch us for 10 days. Give to us only vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then look at our faces. Look at us. And also look at the young men who eat the king's food. Then decide what to do with us, your servants.’ 
DAN.1.14	So the man agreed and he watched them for 10 days. 
DAN.1.15	And after 10 days, their faces seemed more handsome than the young men who ate the king's food. And their bodies were fatter. 
DAN.1.16	So the man took away the king's food and 
DAN.1.17	God gave clever minds to these 4 young men. While they studied, he helped them to learn from books. And he helped them to understand the books. And Daniel could understand all kinds of dreams too. 
DAN.1.18	The king had said that they must wait for a certain time. That time finished. Then the important officer brought the young men to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with all the young men. He discovered that there was nobody else like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. So they became the king's servants. 
DAN.1.20	The king continued to ask them to help him. They helped him to understand everything. And they helped him to do good things. The king's other

DAN.2.4	Then the

DAN.2.8	And the king answered them. ‘You know what I have decided. I certainly know that you are trying to get more time for that reason. 
DAN.2.9	If you do not tell me the dream, you will all certainly receive the same 
DAN.2.10	The 
DAN.2.11	You are asking a very difficult thing. Nobody can do it, except the gods. And they do not live among men.’
DAN.2.12	This made the king very, very angry. So he said to his soldiers, ‘Kill all the

DAN.2.15	He said to Arioch, the king's captain, ‘Why is the king's message so cruel?’ Then Arioch explained everything to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went to see the king. He asked the king for more time. Then he would be able to tell the king what the dream meant.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his home and he explained the problem to his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
DAN.2.18	He told them that they should pray to God in 
DAN.2.19	During the night, Daniel had a dream. God showed him in the dream what it meant. Then Daniel gave

DAN.2.20	‘Give

DAN.2.23	You have made me

DAN.2.24	So Daniel went to Arioch. He was the officer to whom the king had said, ‘You must kill Babylon's 
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king. He said, ‘I have found a man. He can tell the king what his dream means. He is one of the people that you brought from Judah.’
DAN.2.26	The king spoke to Daniel (whose other name was Belteshazzar). He said, ‘Can you tell me my dream? And can you tell me what it means?’
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king. ‘No 
DAN.2.28	‘But there is a God in 
DAN.2.29	While you lay on your bed, you dreamed about future years. God showed you what will happen in future years. He explains hidden things. 
DAN.2.30	I am not more clever than anyone else. But God explained the dream to me. He wants you to know what it means. And he wants you to understand the thoughts in your mind.’
DAN.2.31	‘You looked, and you saw a large 
DAN.2.32	Someone had made its head from clean gold. The top of its body and its arms were

DAN.2.36	‘This was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means. 
DAN.2.37	You are a great king who rules other kings. The God of

DAN.2.47	The king said to Daniel, ‘It is true that your God is greater than all other gods. He rules over kings and he explains hidden things. I know this because you were able to explain this dream to me.’
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Daniel an important man and the king gave many great gifts to him. He made Daniel ruler over the whole of Babylon. He made Daniel the most important officer among the officers called deputies over all the 
DAN.2.49	Then Daniel asked the king to give important work to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So the king told them that they should rule over the whole of Babylon. But Daniel remained with the king.

DAN.3.3	So the officers called rulers, deputies, governors, advisers and sheriffs came to the meeting in front of the 
DAN.3.4	Then an officer shouted aloud. ‘You, people from every country who speak every language, listen. This is what the king says to you. 
DAN.3.5	Listen for the sound of music from things called horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps or any other kind of music. When you hear it, you must go down on the ground. You must

DAN.3.7	So, when the people heard the different kinds of music, they obeyed. All the people from all nations, with people who spoke every language, went down on the ground. They were 
DAN.3.8	Then some 
DAN.3.9	They said to the king, ‘We want the king to live for all time. 
DAN.3.10	You, the king, made a rule. You said that everyone must listen for the sound from all kinds of music. Then they must go down on their knees and 
DAN.3.11	You said that everyone must obey you. You would throw them into a very hot fire if they did not obey you. 
DAN.3.12	There are some 
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar was very, very angry. So he told his servants that they must bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to him. And they brought these men to the king. 
DAN.3.14	Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke to them. He said, ‘Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not give 
DAN.3.15	You will hear again the sound of all kinds of music. You must be ready, when you hear the music. You must go down on your knees. Then you will show 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered the king. ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, we know that we did the right thing’, they said. 
DAN.3.17	‘You may throw us into the very hot fire. But the God that we obey can save us. He can save us from your power. 
DAN.3.18	But if he does not save us, it does not make any difference. We want you to know that we will not obey your gods. And we will not 
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. His face became red. He said to his servants, ‘Make the hot fire 7 times (7 ×) hotter than usual.’ 
DAN.3.20	He told the strongest men in his army that they must tie Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And then he said to them, ‘Throw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the very hot fire.’ 
DAN.3.21	So the king's servants tied Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who were still wearing their clothes. They were wearing their coats, hats and other clothes when the men threw them into the fire. 
DAN.3.22	The king told the men that they must do it immediately. And the fire was very hot. So the fire killed the men who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into it. 
DAN.3.23	And Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, whom the king's men had tied up, fell into the very hot fire.
DAN.3.24	What King Nebuchadnezzar saw next surprised him very much. And it made him feel afraid. So he jumped up and he asked his officers, ‘Did we not tie up 3 men and throw them into the fire?’ ‘You are right, our king’, they answered. 
DAN.3.25	The king said, ‘But I see 4 men walking about in the fire! They are free and the fire has not hurt them. The fourth (4th) man seems like a son of the gods.’
DAN.3.26	King Nebuchadnezzar went to the door where the very hot fire was. He shouted aloud to the men inside, ‘Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who obey the true God, you come out here.’ So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	The king's family and his officers called rulers, deputies, governors and advisers came close. And they looked at them. They saw that the fire had not hurt Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego. The fire had not touched their hair or their clothes. There was not even the smell from the smoke.
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar spoke. ‘Give 
DAN.3.29	No other god can save like this. So I make a rule for the people in every country who speak every language. They must not say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. My servants will cut into pieces anyone who does not obey. I will also destroy those people's houses.’
DAN.3.30	Then the king gave more important jobs in Babylon to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.
DAN.4.1	I, King Nebuchadnezzar, am sending this message to everyone in the world. I am writing to the people in every country who speak every language. I pray that you all have good and happy lives.
DAN.4.2	It makes me happy to tell you what the very, very great God has done.
DAN.4.2	He has done great and very special things for me.
DAN.4.3	The things that he does are very great. And they are very surprising.
DAN.4.3	God's 
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my king's house. I was comfortable and happy. Everything was very good for me. 
DAN.4.5	Then I had a dream that made me very, very afraid. I lay on my bed and the thoughts in my head made me very afraid.
DAN.4.6	So I told all the 
DAN.4.7	When the 
DAN.4.8	Last of all, Daniel came to me. I call him Belteshazzar like my god's name. The spirit of the 
DAN.4.9	‘Belteshazzar’, I said, ‘you are the leader of my 
DAN.4.10	‘This is what I saw in my mind. I saw it while I was asleep. I saw a tree in the middle of the earth and it was very tall. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew taller and stronger. Its top touched the sky, so everyone in the world could see it. 
DAN.4.12	It had beautiful leaves and lots of fruit. There was enough food on it for everyone. It was a home for the animals. And birds lived in it. Every living thing ate its food.’
DAN.4.13	‘While I was still sleeping, I saw an 
DAN.4.14	He shouted aloud. “Cause the animals that are under the tree go away”, he shouted. “Cause the birds that are in its branches to fly away. Cut down the tree. Cut off its branches. Tear off its leaves. Let its fruit fall on the ground. 
DAN.4.15	But leave the part of the tree that is in the ground. Tie it up with iron and 
DAN.4.15	Make him wet with 
DAN.4.16	Take his own mind away from him. And give the mind of an animal to him for 7 years.
DAN.4.17	The 
DAN.4.18	I said to Belteshazzar, “This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, you tell me what it means. None of the 
DAN.4.19	Daniel, whose other name was Belteshazzar, was not happy for a time. He did not know what to do. And his thoughts caused him a lot of trouble. The king said, ‘Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or what it means cause you trouble.’ Then Belteshazzar answered the king. ‘Sir, I wish that the dream was about your enemies and not about you. 
DAN.4.20	You saw a tree that grew. And it grew taller and stronger until its top touched the sky. Everyone in the world could see it. 
DAN.4.21	It had beautiful leaves and lots of fruit. There was enough food on it for everyone. It was a home for the animals. And the birds built their houses in it. 
DAN.4.22	You, the king, are like that tree. You have become stronger and more powerful. You have become very great. Everyone has heard about your power in 
DAN.4.23	Then you saw an 
DAN.4.23	Make him wet with 
DAN.4.24	This is what the dream means. The very, very great God has decided what he will do to my 
DAN.4.25	People will push you out, so that you will have to live with the animals. And you will eat grass as cows do. 
DAN.4.26	The 
DAN.4.27	So my king, please do as I suggest. Stop doing bad things. Start doing what is right. Do not do bad things. But be kind to the poor people. Then, perhaps, you will continue to be comfortable and happy.’
DAN.4.28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	One year later, he was walking on the flat roof of the king's house in Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	Then the king spoke aloud and he said, ‘Look how great Babylon is. My power has built this city to be the king's home. It shows that I am great and powerful.’
DAN.4.31	While he was still speaking about his power, he heard a voice from 
DAN.4.32	People will push you away. You will live with the animals. And you will eat grass as cows do. I will cause you to live like that for 7 years. Then you will be sure that the very, very great God rules the 
DAN.4.33	Then it all happened to Nebuchadnezzar as he had dreamed. People sent him away. And he ate grass as cows do. 
DAN.4.34	At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up towards 
DAN.4.34	His 
DAN.4.34	because he rules always and for all time.
DAN.4.35	All the people on the earth are worth nothing.
DAN.4.35	He does what he wants with the 
DAN.4.35	And he does what he wants with the people on the earth.
DAN.4.35	Nobody can stop him.
DAN.4.35	Nobody can say to him, ‘You should not be doing that.’
DAN.4.36	When I got my proper mind back, I also got my power back. People gave 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give 
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar had a big party. He asked 1000 important people to come, and he drank 
DAN.5.2	When Belshazzar drank 
DAN.5.3	So his servants brought the gold cups that had come from God's house in Jerusalem. Then the king, his wives, his other women and all the important people drank 
DAN.5.4	And when they drank the 
DAN.5.5	Immediately, the fingers of a man's hand appeared and the fingers wrote on the wall of the king's house. They wrote near the light that stood in the room. So the king saw the hand while it wrote. 
DAN.5.6	The king's face became white and he was afraid. His knees started to knock together and his legs became weak.
DAN.5.7	The king shouted for his 
DAN.5.8	Then all the king's 
DAN.5.9	So King Belshazzar became very afraid and his face became very white. His officers did not know what to do.
DAN.5.10	The queen heard the words of the king and his officers. So she came into the room where they were having the party. Then she spoke to the king. ‘I want the king to live for all time’, she said. ‘Do not be afraid. Do not let your face be so white. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your 
DAN.5.12	His mind was clever and he knew many things. He could tell what dreams mean. He could explain hidden things and answer problems. His name was Daniel, but the king called him Belteshazzar. Send a man to fetch Daniel. He will tell you what the words mean.’ 
DAN.5.13	Then people brought Daniel to the king. The king said to Daniel, ‘Are you Daniel? Are you one of the men that my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you. You are 
DAN.5.15	I told my servants that they must bring the 
DAN.5.16	I have heard that you can understand dreams. And I have heard that you can answer problems. So, can you read these words? And can you tell me what they mean? If you can do that, then I will put 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered the king. ‘You can keep your gifts for yourself. And you can make someone else important. But I will read the words for the king. And I will tell him what they mean. 
DAN.5.18	The God who is very, very great made your father Nebuchadnezzar king. God made him very great and very famous and God gave great 
DAN.5.19	Because God made him so great, the people in every country were very afraid of him. The people who spoke every language were very afraid of him. If he wanted to kill someone, he killed that person. And if he wanted someone to live, he let that person live. If he wanted to make someone important, he made that person important. And if he wanted to make someone less important, he made that person less important. 
DAN.5.20	He thought that he was the most important person. He thought that he could do anything. Then God took away his 
DAN.5.21	People pushed him out and he had an animal's mind. So he lived with the wild horses. And his food was the grass that cows eat. 
DAN.5.22	You, Belshazzar, are Nebuchadnezzar's son and you knew all that. But you did not keep 
DAN.5.23	You thought that you were more important than the 
DAN.5.24	So he sent the hand that wrote these words. 
DAN.5.25	And these are the words:
DAN.5.25	Mene, Mene, Tekel and Peres.’
DAN.5.26	‘This is what the words mean:
DAN.5.26	Mene means that God has counted the days of your 
DAN.5.27	Tekel means that God has weighed you. But you were too light when he weighed you. You were not right (as you should be). That is what it means.
DAN.5.28	Peres means that God has cut your 
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar caused his servants to put 
DAN.5.30	That same night someone killed Belshazzar, king of Babylon. 
DAN.5.31	And Darius from Media became king. He was 62 years old.
DAN.6.1	Darius decided to make 120 men rulers. Together, they would rule the whole 
DAN.6.2	He also made 3 other men officers. He made them more important than the rulers. The 3 men would watch over the work of the rulers. Then the king would know that they were working well. Daniel was one of these 3 officers. 
DAN.6.3	Then Daniel did his work much better than the other officers and rulers. He was very good at his job. So the king wanted to make him ruler over the whole 
DAN.6.4	The other officers and rulers watched how Daniel worked for the king. They wanted to show that he was doing something wrong. But they could not find that he did any wrong thing. That was because Daniel was good and honest. He always did everything properly. 
DAN.6.5	Then these men said to each other, ‘We cannot find anything that Daniel does wrong. We can beat him only with something from the 
DAN.6.6	So these officers and rulers went together to the king. ‘King Darius, we want you to live for all time’, they said.
DAN.6.7	‘All the officers in the 
DAN.6.8	Now, you, the king, should make the 
DAN.6.9	So King Darius wrote the 
DAN.6.10	Daniel heard that the king had signed the 
DAN.6.11	Then those officers and rulers met together to see what Daniel would do. They saw that Daniel was praying to God. And he was asking God for help. 
DAN.6.12	So they went to the king. They spoke to him about the 
DAN.6.13	Then those officers and rulers said to the king, ‘That Daniel, whom Nebuchadnezzar brought from Judah, does not obey you. He does not obey the 
DAN.6.14	When the king heard this, he was very sad. He tried to think of a way to save Daniel. Until evening, the king tried every way to save Daniel. 
DAN.6.15	Then those officers and rulers came back to the king.
DAN.6.15	‘Remember that nobody can change a 
DAN.6.16	Then the king sent his servants to get Daniel. So they threw him into the deep hole where the 
DAN.6.17	Then they brought a stone. And they put it over the top of the 
DAN.6.18	Then the king returned to his own house. He ate no food. And nobody brought to him anything that he could enjoy. And he was unable to sleep.
DAN.6.19	The king got up very early in the morning. He hurried to the deep hole where the 
DAN.6.20	When he got near to it, he shouted aloud. His voice showed that he was afraid. ‘Daniel, you are a good servant of the living God. Was your God able to save you from the 
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel said to the king, ‘I want you, the king, to live for all time. 
DAN.6.22	My God sent his 
DAN.6.23	The king was very happy when he heard Daniel's voice. He told his servants that they must lift Daniel out of the 
DAN.6.24	Then the king spoke to his servants. So the servants brought the men who had said very bad things about Daniel. They threw those men and their wives and children into the deep hole where the 
DAN.6.25	After that, King Darius wrote to all the people that he ruled. He wrote to every country that he ruled. They spoke many other languages. ‘I pray that you all will have good and happy lives.
DAN.6.26	I have made a 
DAN.6.26	He is the living God
DAN.6.26	and he will live always.
DAN.6.26	Nobody will ever destroy his 
DAN.6.26	It will never end.
DAN.6.27	He saves people. He keeps them safe.
DAN.6.27	He does great things in 
DAN.6.27	He has saved Daniel from the 
DAN.6.28	So Daniel was a powerful ruler while Darius was king. And he continued to be a powerful officer, when Cyrus from Persia became king. 
DAN.7.1	It was the first year that King Belshazzar ruled Babylon. Daniel had a dream. He saw pictures in his head while he lay on his bed. And he wrote down what he saw in the dream. 
DAN.7.2	Daniel wrote, ‘I had a dream at night. I saw the 4 winds of 
DAN.7.3	Then 4 large animals came out of the sea. They were all different. 
DAN.7.4	The first one seemed like a 
DAN.7.5	Then I saw a second animal. It seemed like a 
DAN.7.6	Then I saw another animal. It seemed like a 
DAN.7.7	Then I saw a fourth (4th) animal in my dream. It frightened me more than the other animals. It was very strong and it had large iron teeth. It broke things and people into pieces and it ate them. It destroyed everything else with its feet. It was different from the other animals and it had 10 
DAN.7.8	I was thinking about the 
DAN.7.9	Daniel continued to write.
DAN.7.9	‘While I looked, servants put ready some seats for rulers.
DAN.7.9	Then God, who is always God, sat down on his king's seat.
DAN.7.9	His clothes were as white as snow.
DAN.7.9	His hair was white like clean 
DAN.7.9	His seat had 
DAN.7.10	A river of fire came out in front of him.
DAN.7.10	He had thousands of thousands of servants.
DAN.7.10	Many more people than that stood in front of him.
DAN.7.10	The meeting of the 
DAN.7.11	The 
DAN.7.12	The other animals lost their power too, but they continued to live for a certain time.’
DAN.7.13	‘In my dream at night’, Daniel wrote, ‘I continued to watch.
DAN.7.13	Then I saw someone who seemed like a son of man. He came with the clouds of 
DAN.7.13	He came near to God, who is always God.
DAN.7.13	God's servants brought him close to God.
DAN.7.14	Then God gave authority, 
DAN.7.14	So the people in every country who spoke every language 
DAN.7.14	His 
DAN.7.14	And nobody will ever cause it to become nothing.
DAN.7.14	Nobody can destroy it.
DAN.7.15	I, Daniel, had much trouble in my mind. The thoughts in my head frightened me. 
DAN.7.16	So I spoke to someone who was standing near me in my dream. And I asked him what all this meant. Then he explained it to me. 
DAN.7.17	“The 4 great animals are 4 kings. They will rule with power on the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the true God will give the 
DAN.7.19	Then I wanted to know about the fourth (4th) animal’, Daniel wrote. ‘It was different from the other animals. It made me very, very afraid because it was so bad and so strong. It had large iron teeth and 
DAN.7.20	I wanted to know about the 10 
DAN.7.21	I continued to watch. And this 
DAN.7.22	But I continued to look. And then God, who is always God, came. He was the 
DAN.7.23	Then the person who was near me explained it to me. “The fourth (4th) animal means that there will be a fourth (4th) 
DAN.7.24	The 10 
DAN.7.25	He will speak against God. And he will stand against God's 
DAN.7.26	Then God will 
DAN.7.27	Then the very, very great God will give all the 
DAN.7.28	‘This is the end of my dream’, wrote Daniel. ‘And I, Daniel, had much trouble because my thoughts made me afraid. My face became white, but I did not tell anyone about these things.’
DAN.8.1	In the third (3rd) year that King Belshazzar ruled Babylon, I, Daniel, had another dream. 
DAN.8.2	In my dream, I saw myself in the king's strong house in the city called Susa. Susa is in the part of the country called Elam. I was standing by the stream called Ulai. 
DAN.8.3	I looked up and I saw a male sheep by the stream. He had two long 
DAN.8.4	I watched the male sheep while he was running to the west, and to the north, and to the south. He was more powerful than all other animals. Nobody could save any of them from him. He did whatever he wanted to do. And he became great. 
DAN.8.5	While I was thinking about this, immediately a male goat came from the west. He went across the whole earth so quickly that his feet did not even touch the ground. The goat had a very big 
DAN.8.6	He came towards the sheep that I had seen. The sheep had two 
DAN.8.7	I saw him attack the sheep because he was so angry with the sheep. He hit the sheep and he broke the sheep's two 
DAN.8.8	The male goat became very great. But when he was greatest, his big 
DAN.8.9	Out of one of these 
DAN.8.10	It became so great that it attacked the stars in the sky. They are the army of 
DAN.8.11	It thought that it was as great as God, the leader of 
DAN.8.12	Because of the bad things that the people had done, the 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard two 
DAN.8.14	The other 
DAN.8.15	When I, Daniel, had seen the dream, I tried to understand it. Then someone who seemed like a man appeared in front of me. 
DAN.8.16	I heard a man's voice. It was coming from the stream Ulai. ‘Gabriel, tell this man what the dream means’, the voice said. 
DAN.8.17	So Gabriel came near to me. I was very afraid, so I fell down in front of him. But he spoke to me. ‘You are only a man, but you must understand the dream. It is about the end of time.’ 
DAN.8.18	While he was speaking to me I was really asleep. So he touched me and he caused me to stand up. 
DAN.8.19	Then he spoke to me again. ‘I will tell you what will happen at the end of time. It will happen because God is angry. The end will be at the time that God has decided.’
DAN.8.20	The 
DAN.8.21	The male goat means the 
DAN.8.22	Four 
DAN.8.23	The 
DAN.8.24	He will become very powerful, but this will not be his own power. He will destroy many things. And he will be clever. So he will be able to do anything that he wants to do. He will kill strong leaders and he will even kill God's people. 
DAN.8.25	He will kill people for no good reason. People will think that they are safe. But then he will kill them. He will think that he is very important. He will fight against the greatest of all kings. Then he will fail, but no human hand will do this to him.’
DAN.8.26	The 
DAN.8.27	After this dream, I, Daniel, was weak. I was sick for many days. Then I got up and I returned to my work for the king. The dream caused great trouble in my mind and I could not understand it.
DAN.9.1	This is what happened in the first year that Darius ruled the country. He was the son of Xerxes and he came from the country called Media. He became king of Babylon. 
DAN.9.2	Before he had been king for one year, I, Daniel, was studying the words in God's book. I read what the 
DAN.9.3	So I started to pray very much to the 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.5	‘We have been very bad’, I prayed. ‘We have done wrong and 
DAN.9.6	We did not listen to the 
DAN.9.7	, you always do what is right. We are people from Judah, from Jerusalem and from all Israel. We have done bad things and we are ashamed. We have not been 
DAN.9.8	, we are ashamed because we have not obeyed you. Our kings, their sons and our fathers are ashamed. 
DAN.9.9	 our God, we have not been 
DAN.9.10	We have not obeyed you, the 
DAN.9.11	None of the people from Israel have obeyed your 
DAN.9.12	You did what you promised to do to our rulers and to us. So you 
DAN.9.13	You have 
DAN.9.14	So you remembered the 
DAN.9.15	‘
DAN.9.16	, you have always done what is right. Please stop being angry with the people from Jerusalem. It is your special city. All the people that live round us laugh about Jerusalem in a bad way. And they laugh about your people. That is happening because our fathers were so bad. And we have been 
DAN.9.17	So now, our God, I am praying to you. Please listen to me because I am your servant. Listen to me while I pray! So then people will know that you are God. 
DAN.9.18	Listen to us, 
DAN.9.19	, listen. 
DAN.9.20	I continued to pray. I was saying that all the people of Israel had done wrong things. I was praying to the 
DAN.9.21	And while I was praying, Gabriel came to me. He was the same man that I had seen in the first dream. He flew quickly to me. It was about the time of the evening 
DAN.9.22	He came and he spoke to me. ‘Daniel, I have come so that you can understand’, he said. 
DAN.9.23	‘As soon as you started to pray, God sent the answer. I have come to tell you the answer because God really loves you. Now listen to me. I will explain what you have seen.’
DAN.9.24	‘God has chosen 490 years (in other words, 70 × 7 years)’, Gabriel said. ‘This is about your people and the 
DAN.9.25	‘I want you to know and understand. Someone will tell men that they must build Jerusalem again. After 49 years (in other words, 7 × 7), people will build Jerusalem city again. They will build streets and a wall. But God's people will have much trouble during this time. Then there will be 434 years (in other words, 62 × 7) more. Then, the special ruler that God has chosen will come. 
DAN.9.26	After the 434 years, people will kill the special ruler that God has sent. He will have nothing. Then a foreign ruler will come with his army and he will destroy the city and the 
DAN.9.27	The ruler will agree with many people for 7 years. In the middle of the 7 years he will stop all the 
DAN.10.1	In the third (3rd) year that King Cyrus ruled Persia, God gave a message to Daniel. (Daniel's other name was Belteshazzar.) The message was true, and it was about a great war. Daniel had a dream. This showed him what the message meant. 
DAN.10.2	He wrote down this message:
DAN.10.2	At that time I, Daniel, was sad for three weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I did not eat any good food. I had no meat or 
DAN.10.4	On the 24th day of the first month, I was standing by the great river Tigris. 
DAN.10.5	I looked and I saw a man. He was wearing good white clothes. He wore a gold belt. 
DAN.10.6	His body was bright like a beautiful stone. His face was like a bright light. His eyes seemed like 
DAN.10.7	Only I, Daniel, saw this picture. The people who were with me did not see anything. But they were very afraid, so they ran away. And they hid themselves. 
DAN.10.8	Then I was alone while I looked at this great person. My face became very white and I became weak. 
DAN.10.9	When I heard his voice, I fell down. I lay with my face on the ground and I started to sleep.
DAN.10.10	Then a hand touched me and it helped me to get up. I was on my hands and knees. But my body moved because I was afraid. 
DAN.10.11	He spoke to me. ‘Daniel, God loves you very much’, he said. ‘Listen carefully to what I say to you. Stand up, because God has sent me to you.’ When he said this, I stood up. But I was afraid still.
DAN.10.12	Then he said, ‘Daniel, do not be afraid. You wanted to understand God. You became ready to do what he had decided. As soon as you did this, God heard your words. So I have come to bring the answer to your 
DAN.10.13	The ruler of the 
DAN.10.14	Now I am here to explain this dream about future years. The dream tells what will happen to your people then.’
DAN.10.15	While he was saying these words to me, I looked down at the ground. I could not speak. 
DAN.10.16	Then someone who seemed like a man touched my lips. I opened my mouth and I was able to speak again. So I spoke to the person who stood in front of me. ‘My 
DAN.10.17	My 
DAN.10.18	He who seemed like a man touched me again. He made me strong. 
DAN.10.19	‘Do not be afraid, man’, he said to me, ‘because God loves you very much. I want your mind to rest. I want you to be strong, very strong.’ When he said this, I felt stronger. So I spoke again. ‘My 
DAN.10.20	Then he spoke to me again. ‘I will tell you why I have come to you. Soon I will return to fight against the ruler of Persia. When I have won that fight, the king from Greece will come. 
DAN.10.21	But now I will explain to you what the words in the True Book mean. (Only Michael, your people's ruler, will help me against God's enemies.)’
DAN.11.1	‘Since the first year that Darius from Media ruled, I helped him. And I saved him from his enemies.’ 
DAN.11.2	‘Now I will explain to you the things that will happen’, the 
DAN.11.3	‘Then a very strong king will come’, he told me. ‘He will rule with great power. And he will do whatever he wants to do. 
DAN.11.4	After he comes, his 
DAN.11.5	‘Then the king in the south will become strong, but one of his officers will become even stronger. He will rule his own 
DAN.11.6	After some years, the king in the south and the king in the north will agree not to fight each other. The daughter of the king in the south will marry the king in the north. This should cause the two 
DAN.11.7	Later, someone from her family will become king in the south. He will attack the army of the king in the north and he will go into the strong city. He will fight against the army and he will win the fight. 
DAN.11.8	He will take away their gods that they have made out of wood or stone. And he will take away their valuable gold and 
DAN.11.9	After that, the king in the north will attack the country where the king in the south lives. But they will cause him to return to his own country. 
DAN.11.10	Then his sons will prepare for war. They will bring together a large army, which will go to the south like a powerful river. The army will attack the strong city of the king in the south. 
DAN.11.11	Then the king in the south will be angry. He will bring out his army to fight the king from the north. The king from the north might have a large army, but the king in the south will win the fight. 
DAN.11.12	The king in the south will destroy this large army. So then he will think that he is great. He will kill many thousands of people, but his power will not continue.
DAN.11.13	The king from the north will again bring together a large army. It will be even bigger than the first army. After a few years, he will come back with his larger army. And this army will have all the arms that it needs to attack other countries. 
DAN.11.14	At that time, many people will stand against the king in the south. And the angry men from your own people will also rise up. They will fight against him. This is what the dream tells us. But they will fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king from the north will come. He will build up earth round a strong city. He will take the city because the army in the south will not be able to stand against him. Even their best soldiers will not be strong enough to win the fight. 
DAN.11.16	The king from the north will do whatever he wants to do. Nobody will be able to stand against him. He will stay in the Beautiful Country and he will have the power to destroy it.
DAN.11.17	Then the king from the north will decide to go south with all his power. He will agree not to fight with the king in the south. He will give a daughter to marry the king in the south. He will want very much to stop that king ruling. But his plan will fail. She will not help him.
DAN.11.18	After this, he will turn and attack the countries by the sea. He will take many of those countries, but one officer will stop him. He will even cause the king from the north to stop fighting. Then he will not be able to take power over other countries. 
DAN.11.19	So the king from the north will return. He will return to the strong cities in his own country. But he will lose another fight. And he will fall so that nobody will see him again.
DAN.11.20	Then the next king in the north will try to make himself even more rich. He will send out someone to take money from his people, but soon God will cause him to die. This will not happen in an attack or a fight.
DAN.11.21	The person who comes after him will be a very bad man. He will not become a king but he will come to take power. The people will think that they are safe. That is when he will come. He will tell lies and he will do wrong things to become king. 
DAN.11.22	He will fight a great army and he will destroy it. He will even kill the ruler of the promise. 
DAN.11.23	He will try to agree with people from other countries. But he will tell them things that are not true. Only a few people will help him but he will become powerful. 
DAN.11.24	He will attack the richest places. They will think that they are safe. That is when he will attack them. He will do things that his father and grandfathers did not do. He will take valuable things in war and he will give some to his servants. And he will try to discover how he might attack strong cities. But this will only happen for a short time.
DAN.11.25	He will feel strong and brave against the king in the south because he has a large army. And the king in the south will fight back with a large and powerful army. But the king in the south will not win, because people will make a way to stop him. 
DAN.11.26	Even those who eat the king's food will try to kill him. They will push his army away and many soldiers will die. 
DAN.11.27	These two kings will want to do many bad things. They will sit together at the same table. But they will tell each other things that are not true. God has decided the time of the end already. So he will not let them do those bad things.
DAN.11.28	The king from the north will return to his own country. He will be very rich. He will hate those who 
DAN.11.29	At the time that God has decided, the king will go to the south again. This time the result will be different. 
DAN.11.30	People from the west will come in ships and they will stand against him. He will be afraid and he will turn back. He will be angry with people who 
DAN.11.31	He will send some of his soldiers into God's strong and 
DAN.11.32	The king will say that some people are good. Those are the people who do not obey God. But those who know their God will be strong. And they will work. 
DAN.11.33	The 
DAN.11.34	When God's people are dying, they will receive a little help. Many people who do not really know God will join them. 
DAN.11.35	Some of the 
DAN.11.36	And this king will do whatever he wants to do. He will say that he is greater than any god. He will even say very bad things against the God of gods. This will happen until God is not angry with his people any longer. God must do what he has decided to do. 
DAN.11.37	This king will not have any interest in the gods that his father and grandfathers 
DAN.11.38	Instead, he will give 
DAN.11.39	He will give 
DAN.11.40	‘In the end, the king from the south will attack him. The king in the north will fight back like a storm. He will have soldiers on horses and many ships. He will attack many countries and he will go through them like a great powerful river. 
DAN.11.41	He will also attack the Beautiful Country and he will kill many thousands of the people there. But he will not take the people in the countries called Edom and Moab or the leaders from Ammon. 
DAN.11.42	He will have power over many countries, including the country called Egypt. 
DAN.11.43	He will take all the gold, 
DAN.11.44	But he will hear news from the north and the east that will cause trouble in his mind. So he will be very angry. And then he will go to destroy things and to kill many people. 
DAN.11.45	He will stay with his soldiers between the sea and the 
DAN.12.1	‘At that time Michael will come’, the same man said. ‘He is the great 
DAN.12.2	Many of those who have died will come back to life again. God will give life that will never end to some of them. But some will be ashamed and have no 
DAN.12.3	And those who are 
DAN.12.4	Now you, Daniel, do not change this message. Close the book and keep it secret until the end. Many will try to learn more about this.’
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked up and I saw two other people. One of them was on this side of the river with me. The other one was on the other side of the river. 
DAN.12.6	One of them spoke to the man who was wearing white clothes. He was beyond them over the water. He asked him, ‘How long will it be before these surprising things end?’ 
DAN.12.7	The man who was wearing white clothes lifted up both his hands towards the sky. I heard him make a promise by God, who lives always. ‘It will end after three and a half years. Then the enemies who fight against the power of the 
DAN.12.8	I heard his words, but I did not understand. So I said, ‘My 
DAN.12.9	‘You go now, Daniel’, he said. ‘This message will remain secret until the end comes. 
DAN.12.10	God will make many people 
DAN.12.11	From the time that there is no 
DAN.12.12	The people who wait in a patient way for 1335 days will be happy. 
DAN.12.13	You yourself must be patient and you must continue until the end. You will die. But then you will live again. And then you will receive the good things that God has promised at the end of time.’
HOS.1.1	This is the message that the 
HOS.1.2	The 
HOS.1.3	So Hosea married a woman called Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. After this, a child began to grow in her and she gave birth to their first child, a son. 
HOS.1.4	The 
HOS.1.5	And, in the Valley of Jezreel, I will at that time completely destroy the armies of Israel.’
HOS.1.6	Gomer had a second child. This time it was a daughter. The 
HOS.1.7	But I will show love to the people in Judah. I, the 
HOS.1.8	After Gomer gave her own milk to Lo-Ruhamah, another child began to grow in Gomer. A son was born to her. 
HOS.1.9	Then the 
HOS.1.10	At a future time, the number of Israel's people will be like the sand by the sea. You cannot measure the sand or count it. Now God says to them, ‘You are not my people.’ But there will be a future day when he will say to them, ‘You are the children of the living God!’ 
HOS.1.11	The people from Judah and the people from Israel will come together again. They will choose for themselves a single leader. And they will go out of a foreign country. The day of Jezreel will be an important day.
HOS.2.1	Then you will tell your brothers, ‘You are my people.’ And you will tell your sisters, ‘He has shown great love to you.’
HOS.2.2	My children, argue with your mother. Tell her that she is wrong. Tell that to her because she is not my wife. And I am not her husband. Tell her that she must stop living like a 
HOS.2.3	If she does not do that, I will take away all her clothes. It will be like the day when she was born. I will leave her to die. She will die because she will have no water. I will let her stay in a dry 
HOS.2.4	I will not show great love to her children. They are the children of a 
HOS.2.5	This 
HOS.2.6	So I (the 
HOS.2.7	She will run after the men that she loves. But she will not catch them. She will look for them, but she will not catch them. Then she will say, ‘I will return to my first husband (God). Life was better for me when I was with him. Life was better then than it is now.’ 
HOS.2.8	‘She (Israel) did not believe that I (the 
HOS.2.9	So I will take back my 
HOS.2.10	Now I will take away her clothes. So all the men who loved her will see her. They will see her as she is. Nobody will be able to take her from my power. 
HOS.2.11	I (the 
HOS.2.12	I will destroy her 
HOS.2.13	I will 
HOS.2.14	So I (the 
HOS.2.15	There, I will give back to her the 
HOS.2.16	Then, at a future time, she will call me her husband. She will not call me her god, Baal again. 
HOS.2.17	I will never let her speak the name of the god, Baal again. Then people will not use Baal's names again. 
HOS.2.18	At that time, I will promise to do things for Israel's people. I will cause the animals in the fields and the birds in the sky to be their friends. I will cause the animals that move along the ground to be their friends too. I also will break the things that Israel's people used in war. I will remove the things that men use to fight in wars. None of these things will remain in the land. My people will live in a time when people do not attack them. They will be safe.
HOS.2.19	I (the 
HOS.2.19	I will be good and fair. I will always love you and I will always show 
HOS.2.19	I will make you mine for always.
HOS.2.20	I will make you a wife that follows me.
HOS.2.20	Then you will know the 
HOS.2.21	At that time, I will answer the sky.
HOS.2.21	I will speak to the sky and then rain will fall on the earth.
HOS.2.22	The ground will give back 
HOS.2.22	They will have an answer for Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	I will plant many seeds on Israel's land.
HOS.2.23	To Lo-Ruhamah, I will show great love.
HOS.2.23	To Lo-Ammi, I will say, ‘You are my people.’
HOS.2.23	And they will say to me,
HOS.2.23	‘You are my God.’ 
HOS.3.1	Then the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought the woman with 15 pieces of 
HOS.3.3	Then I told her, ‘You must stay at home with me for a long time. You must not be like a 
HOS.3.4	In the same way, Israel's people will continue to live for a long time without a king or a leader. They will not have 
HOS.3.5	At a future time, Israel's people will return. Then they will look for the 
HOS.4.1	People in Israel, listen to the 
HOS.4.2	They hope that bad things will happen to people. They tell people things that are not true. They kill people and they rob people. They do the 
HOS.4.3	So the people cry. And everything that lives is slowly dying. All the animals and birds, and even the fish, are dying. 
HOS.4.4	Nobody among you should argue. And nobody among you should say that another person is wrong. You people are like people who argue with a 
HOS.4.5	You fall over during the day and during the night. And the 
HOS.4.6	You are destroying my people because they do not know me. You have refused to learn. So I will refuse to let you be a 
HOS.4.7	‘The more 
HOS.4.8	The 
HOS.4.9	The 
HOS.4.10	You people will eat your part of the 
HOS.4.11	‘My people cannot understand anything because they drink too much old 
HOS.4.12	My people are asking a piece of wood for help. They want those sticks to tell them what they want to know! They think that those sticks can do that. That is because they have followed those false gods like

HOS.4.16	Israel's people are like a young cow. This young cow does not let you lead it. It is not possible to feed my people. A farmer takes young sheep to a field where there is much grass. I want to be kind to my people as the farmer is kind to those young sheep. 
HOS.4.17	The people in Israel have become friends with 
HOS.4.18	After they have drunk 
HOS.4.19	A wind will take them away. Now they cannot think any longer. Their 
HOS.5.1	‘Listen to this, you 
HOS.5.2	The people who will not obey me have killed very many people. So I will tell them all that they should not have done it. And I will 
HOS.5.3	I know what the people from 
HOS.5.4	Israel's people have done bad things. This makes it impossible for them to return to their God. They are like 
HOS.5.5	Israel's people think that they are too good. This is something that has made me angry with them. Their 
HOS.5.6	They take their sheep and cows to offer as

HOS.5.9	None of 
HOS.5.9	People in Israel, you can be sure that this will happen.
HOS.5.10	The leaders of Judah are like people who rob. They have robbed land. So I (God) will

HOS.5.12	I will destroy Judah,
HOS.5.12	as water destroys a piece of wood.
HOS.5.13	Judah's people saw that they were like a man with

HOS.5.13	They told their problems to King Jareb,
HOS.5.13	but that king cannot bring you health.
HOS.5.13	He cannot stop you hurting.
HOS.5.14	I will attack 
HOS.5.14	I will attack Judah's people like a young 
HOS.5.14	I, the 
HOS.5.14	I will carry them away.
HOS.5.14	And no person will be able to save them.
HOS.5.15	At a future time, the people will see that they have done something wrong.
HOS.5.15	I will return to my place until then.
HOS.5.15	Then they will come to look for me.
HOS.5.15	They will try to find me when their troubles are very bad.’ 
HOS.6.1	‘Come. We should return to the

HOS.6.4	‘Israel's people, I do not know what I should do with you.
HOS.6.4	Judah's people, I do not know what I should do with you.
HOS.6.4	You soon stop loving me. You are like the morning cloud.
HOS.6.4	Your love is like the low cloud that goes away early in the morning.
HOS.6.5	That is why I have sent my

HOS.6.9	There are people who rob. They hide and they wait to attack someone.
HOS.6.9	In the same way, 
HOS.6.9	They attack people who pass by.
HOS.6.9	They have done very bad things.
HOS.6.10	Yes, I have seen many bad things in Israel.
HOS.6.10	This 
HOS.6.11	People in Judah, I have made a special time for you.

HOS.7.3	The very bad things that they do make their king happy.
HOS.7.3	The very bad things that they do make their leaders happy too.
HOS.7.4	They are all bad and they do not obey me.
HOS.7.4	A baker takes flour to make bread.
HOS.7.4	He starts to cook the bread.
HOS.7.4	The bread rises. But the baker does not make the fire hotter.
HOS.7.4	Israel's people are like a baker who is always making his fire hotter.
HOS.7.5	On holidays for the king, the leaders drink too much 
HOS.7.5	The 
HOS.7.5	The king has become a friend of bad people. Those people think that good things are silly.
HOS.7.6	The people decide to do secret things.
HOS.7.6	They are very angry. So they feel that their hearts are like an

HOS.7.6	During the night, they became angrier.
HOS.7.6	And in the morning, there was a fire.
HOS.7.7	They were so angry that they killed their leaders.
HOS.7.7	They killed their kings.
HOS.7.7	All of their kings fell.

HOS.8.7	But they will only get troubles.
HOS.8.7	They will get back something that is like a very strong wind.
HOS.8.7	The plants in the field will grow, but they will not give any food.

HOS.11.5	So they must return to Egypt.
HOS.11.5	Assyria will rule over them.
HOS.11.6	Their cities will have war.
HOS.11.6	People will break down the city gates.
HOS.11.6	Their strong places will not help them.
HOS.11.7	My people are trying very much not to obey me.
HOS.11.7	They will shout to God above.
HOS.11.7	But I will not listen to them.’

HOS.11.12	Those things are all round me.

HOS.11.12	But Judah's people have not obeyed God.
HOS.11.12	I, the 
HOS.11.12	But Judah's people do not obey me.
HOS.12.1	There is much that the people in Israel do from morning to night.
HOS.12.1	But it has no value and it destroys things.
HOS.12.1	The people also do not say true things.
HOS.12.1	Israel's rulers and Assyria's rulers come together to agree about things.
HOS.12.1	They carry their

HOS.12.6	You must be patient. And you must wait for your God to do what he wants.
HOS.12.7	There are people in business who are not fair.

HOS.13.9	There will be nobody to help you.
HOS.13.10	Nobody can find your king. He cannot help you.
HOS.13.10	Nobody can find your leaders.
HOS.13.10	In past times, you asked for a king and leaders.
HOS.13.11	I was angry, so I gave you a king.
HOS.13.11	And when I became very angry, I took him away.

AMO.2.7	They are not kind to poor people and they do not help them. A father and his son have sex with the same woman. I told them not to do that, but they do not listen to me. 
AMO.2.8	Those men take clothes from poor people, because those poor people have a debt to them. Then they sleep on those poor people's clothes. And they do that in the special places where they pray. The rich people in 
AMO.2.9	‘Remember the 
AMO.2.10	I brought you out of the country called 
AMO.2.11	I chose some men among you to be 
AMO.2.12	‘But you told this to the people that should not drink alcohol (the Nazirites). You told them, “Be like everyone else. Drink alcohol.” And you said to the people that speak my message (the 
AMO.2.13	‘I will hurt you. A 
AMO.2.14	You might try to run away. But nobody will get free. The fastest runner will not get free. The strong people will not be strong enough to stop me. The soldiers will not be able to save themselves. 
AMO.2.15	Men that shoot 
AMO.2.16	At that time, strong and brave soldiers will run away without clothes on.’ That is what the 
AMO.3.1	You 
AMO.3.2	He says, ‘There are many groups of people on Earth. But I chose you for myself. You have done wrong things, so I have not been very happy with you. Now I will send trouble to you because of that.’
AMO.3.3	If two people travel together, they have first agreed to travel. 
AMO.3.4	If a 
AMO.3.5	If there is no food in a 
AMO.3.6	If the people in a city hear a 
AMO.3.7	Before the 
AMO.3.8	We are afraid now, because the 
AMO.3.9	Go to 
AMO.3.10	The 
AMO.3.11	So the 
AMO.3.12	The 
AMO.3.13	The 
AMO.3.14	‘I will 
AMO.3.15	I will destroy all the big houses. Rich people live in special houses when it is cold. And they live in special houses when it is hot. I will destroy all those houses. There are houses with beautiful things that people have made from 
AMO.4.1	Listen to this message, you women who live on the hill in 
AMO.4.2	The 
AMO.4.3	There are places in your city's walls where people have broken the walls. Your enemies will pull you through those places and they will throw you out. They will take you to that bad place called 
AMO.4.4	The 
AMO.4.5	‘You bring bread to say “thank you”. You even bring lots of it and you tell everyone, “Look at how much I have brought.” You really like to do that. So continue to do it but it does not make me happy’, says the 
AMO.4.6	‘Earlier I made you hungry in all your cities. There was no food anywhere. But you did not start to pray to me again’, says the 
AMO.4.7	‘Three months before your food was ready to pick, I did not send rain. So all the food became too dry. Sometimes I sent rain to one city, but I did not send it to other cities. I sent rain to one person's land, but I did not send it to another person's land. So that other person's land became too dry. 
AMO.4.8	People became weak. They went from city to city to look for water. As they went, they could hardly walk. There was not enough water. But still you did not start to pray to me again’, says the 
AMO.4.9	‘I sent hot winds from the east. They burned the small plants, so those plants died. Worms (small, narrow, soft animals with no legs) made the other plants sick. So the other plants died. 
AMO.4.10	‘I caused many people among you to become very sick. It was like what happened many years ago in 
AMO.4.11	‘I killed many people among you, as I destroyed the cities called 
AMO.4.12	‘So I will send trouble to you 
AMO.4.13	I made the mountains and I made the wind. I tell people what I am thinking. I change dawn into night. I walk on the high places of the Earth. My name is the 
AMO.5.1	‘Listen, you people in 
AMO.5.2	You are like a young woman that died early without children. No more good things will happen to you. You will not be important again. There are no people on your land to help you. They have all left.’ 
AMO.5.3	This is what the 
AMO.5.4	To the people in 
AMO.5.5	Do not go to 
AMO.5.6	Look for the 
AMO.5.7	You people do not speak true words. You are not fair to other people and you are not honest with them.’
AMO.5.8	The 
AMO.5.9	He kills strong people. And he destroys their strong buildings and walls.
AMO.5.10	Some men are not afraid to speak against people. They are not afraid to say that people have done wrong things. You hate those men very much. And some men speak true words. You think that those men are not important. 
AMO.5.11	You cause poor people to give you too much food from their fields. And you make them give too much money to you. You do not keep them safe. You have built big houses, but you will not live in them. You have planted many plants that give 
AMO.5.12	‘I, the 
AMO.5.13	This is such a bad time. Some people will think about how bad it is. And so, they will keep quiet. They will keep themselves safe.
AMO.5.14	You say that the 
AMO.5.15	Stop doing what is wrong. And choose what is good and right. Some of you decide whether a person has done right or wrong things. You people, be fair and speak true words. There are a few people that are still alive in 
AMO.5.16	But the 
AMO.5.17	And in all the places where fruit grows, people will cry. They will cry because I am sending trouble to you. I, the 
AMO.5.18	You are hoping for the special Day of the 
AMO.5.19	It will be like a man that runs from a 
AMO.5.20	The special Day of the 
AMO.5.21	The 
AMO.5.22	When you bring fat animals to burn for me, I will not happily accept them. You might give food to me, but I will not take it.
AMO.5.23	I will not listen when you sing songs to me. I will not listen as you play music on 
AMO.5.24	A river never stops moving. So, like the river, never stop being fair to people. Never stop doing right things.
AMO.5.25	You people in 
AMO.5.26	You made things for yourselves to pray to. You made the thing called Sakkuth. You say that it is your king. And you made that other thing, which is like a star. You call it Kaiwan. You continue to pray to them and you do not pray to me. 
AMO.5.27	So I will send your enemies to take you away past 
AMO.6.1	You people in 
AMO.6.2	Go and look at the city called 
AMO.6.3	But you are not thinking that God might send trouble to you soon. Instead, you never stop doing wrong things. And so you cause trouble to come to you sooner. 
AMO.6.4	You lie on beautiful, expensive beds and you do not work. You are resting all the time. You eat lots of young sheep and fat young cows. 
AMO.6.5	Like King David, you play music on your 
AMO.6.6	You happily drink lots of alcohol. You put the best smelling oils on your bodies. But you are not sad that 
AMO.6.7	You will be the first people that your enemies will take away from there. You will be slaves for them. You will stop having parties and you will stop resting.
AMO.6.8	The 
AMO.6.9	At that time, ten people might still be in one house. But they will all die. 
AMO.6.10	Then someone from a person's family will come to the house. And he will carry the person's dead body outside to burn it. Then he will ask anyone who is still inside, ‘Is there anyone with you?’ The person will answer, ‘No.’ Then the person from the family will say, ‘Be quiet now. We must not speak the name of the 
AMO.6.11	When the 
AMO.6.12	Horses cannot run on rocks. People do not try to plough the sea. But you have changed what is good to something bad. Some people are fair and honest. But you have made that seem like poison. 
AMO.6.13	You are so happy. You think to yourselves, ‘We are very strong. We fought against the people in 
AMO.6.14	But the 
AMO.7.1	The 
AMO.7.2	The 
AMO.7.3	Then the 
AMO.7.4	After that, the 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, ‘
AMO.7.6	Then the 
AMO.7.7	Then the 
AMO.7.8	And he asked me, ‘Amos, what do you see?’ I said, ‘You are measuring the wall. Maybe it is straight or maybe it is not.’ The 
AMO.7.9	I will send enemies to destroy the 
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah, the 
AMO.7.11	Amos is saying, “Our enemies will fight against us and they will kill you, Jeroboam. They will take all the people to the enemies' country, so that the people can be slaves for them.” ’
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah spoke to me. He said, ‘Go, you 
AMO.7.13	Do not speak words from God here in 
AMO.7.14	Then I answered Amaziah and I said, ‘I am not a 
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	Now you are telling me, “Do not speak against 
AMO.7.17	The 
AMO.8.1	Then the 
AMO.8.2	He asked me, ‘Amos, what do you see?’ I answered him, ‘I see a basket of summer fruit.’ Then the 
AMO.8.3	On that day, people will not sing in the 
AMO.8.4	So listen to me, you people that are not fair to poor people. You try to kill them. 
AMO.8.5	You say to yourselves, ‘We want this special party to finish. We are having a party because the moon is new (it is still very narrow). But we do not want to have a party. We want to sell food again. We want our day for rest to finish. We do not want to rest. We want to continue to sell food.’ But you rob other people. You lie. You say, ‘This is the right amount of food.’ But it is not the right amount. You say, ‘This is good food.’ But it is not good. It has dirt in it. And it has other bits in it that are not good. And you make the price too high. 
AMO.8.6	Sometimes a poor person cannot pay money back to another person, because he does not have enough money. It is a small amount of money. It is the amount of money that a person pays for shoes. But you buy that poor person for that small amount of money. So then he will be a slave for you. And you sell the bad bits of food plants. It is wrong that you do those things. 
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	The whole country will start to move because they did wrong things. It will shake (move quickly up and down). It will go up and it will go down, like the 
AMO.8.9	The 
AMO.8.10	Your parties and happy songs will finish. Instead, you will be very sad and you will cry. You will cut your hair. And you will wear special clothes. Those clothes will show that you are very sad. It will be as if your only son died. It will all be very sad.
AMO.8.11	I, the 
AMO.8.12	You will go all over your country, because you will want to hear a message from me, the 
AMO.8.13	At that time, your beautiful young women and young men will feel that they need to drink. So they will become very weak and tired. 
AMO.8.14	People did not want me to help them. They made 
AMO.9.1	Then Amos said, ‘I saw the 
AMO.9.2	They might try to dig very deep into the Earth to save themselves. But my strong hand will take them out of the deep place. They might climb up to the sky. But I will bring them down from there. 
AMO.9.3	They might run away to the top of the mountain called 
AMO.9.4	Their enemies might take them away to be their slaves in the enemies' country. I will tell people there that they must kill them with long knives. And they will certainly kill them. I will not help them.” ’
AMO.9.5	When the 
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.7	The 
AMO.9.8	‘I, the 
AMO.9.9	‘I will tell the enemies that they must separate you. And they will separate the good people from the bad people. A person shakes a 
AMO.9.10	The people that do wrong things say, “God will not send trouble to us.” But their enemies will kill those people in war.’
AMO.9.11	‘The time will come when you will be powerful and important again. It will be like the time when David was your king. Now you are like a house that someone has destroyed. But I will repair you and I will make you good and strong again. 
AMO.9.12	You 
AMO.9.13	‘The time will come’, says the 
AMO.9.14	I will bring my people back to their country. They will again build their cities, the ones that their enemies destroyed. And they will live there. In some fields, my people will put plants that give 
AMO.9.15	And I will put you back again on the land that I gave to you. And your enemies will never take you away again from the land that I have given to you.’ That is what the 
OBA.1.1	God, who is the 
OBA.1.1	This is the message from the 
OBA.1.1	We have heard what God said.
OBA.1.1	And someone has taken a message to the countries.
OBA.1.1	‘Stand up and fight against 
OBA.1.2	God said to 
OBA.1.2	‘I will make you small among other people.
OBA.1.2	They will think that you are not worth anything.
OBA.1.3	You think that you are better than other people. And so you believe something that is not true.
OBA.1.3	You live in a place that is difficult to reach.
OBA.1.3	Your home is high up in a place among rocks.
OBA.1.3	You say to yourself,
OBA.1.3	“Nobody can reach us up here.”
OBA.1.4	You may like a strong bird that flies high.
OBA.1.4	And you may make your home in the highest places among the stars.
OBA.1.4	But I will bring you down from there,’ says the 
OBA.1.5	God says,
OBA.1.5	‘Men might come in the night
OBA.1.5	to take away what is yours.
OBA.1.5	(Oh, what a very bad thing will happen to you!)
OBA.1.5	But they would not take everything.
OBA.1.5	If people came to take fruit from your trees,
OBA.1.5	they would leave some fruit on the tree.
OBA.1.6	But people will take everything from Esau's people (also called 
OBA.1.6	They will even take the valuable things that you hide.
OBA.1.7	People who have helped you to fight
OBA.1.7	will push you out from your country.
OBA.1.7	They will tell you what is not true. You will believe them.
OBA.1.7	They will be stronger than you
OBA.1.7	because you will believe their words.
OBA.1.7	They will make a 
OBA.1.8	The 
OBA.1.8	‘Some men in 
OBA.1.8	Some men in the mountains know what is good. (These are the mountains where Esau's people live.) But I will kill those men.
OBA.1.9	There are men from Teman city that fight. But I will make them afraid.
OBA.1.9	Esau's people live in the mountains. And everyone there will die.
OBA.1.10	This will happen because you were cruel to your brother Jacob (the people in Israel).
OBA.1.10	God will make you ashamed because of this and you will die. 
OBA.1.11	Men from other countries came into Jerusalem. They took away all the good things from Jerusalem. They played a game for the best things. You were as bad as they were. You did not help the 
OBA.1.12	Your brothers in Judah were in great trouble.
OBA.1.12	You thought that you were better than they. But you were wrong to think that.
OBA.1.12	You should not have been happy when the people in Judah were dying.
OBA.1.12	You should not have been happy when they were in trouble.
OBA.1.13	You should not have walked like soldiers through my people's gates.
OBA.1.13	You did that at the time when they were in trouble.
OBA.1.13	You should not have thought that you were better than they.
OBA.1.13	You thought it at the time when they were in trouble.
OBA.1.13	You should not have taken what was theirs.
OBA.1.14	You waited at the place where the roads joined each other.
OBA.1.14	You wanted to kill those that ran away from the enemy.
OBA.1.14	That is why you waited there.
OBA.1.14	You should not have done that.
OBA.1.14	Some 
OBA.1.14	You should not have taken them to the enemy.
OBA.1.15	The Day of the 
OBA.1.15	God will do to you what you did to other people.
OBA.1.15	God will be angry with you because you did those things to them. 
OBA.1.16	You drank on my special hill.
OBA.1.16	In the same way, people from all countries will drink and they will not stop.
OBA.1.16	They will drink until God has killed them.
OBA.1.17	But on the mountain called 
OBA.1.17	It will be special to me.
OBA.1.17	Jacob's family will have the country that is theirs.
OBA.1.17	I will give it to them.
OBA.1.18	The people in Jacob's and Joseph's family will kill all the people that belong to Esau's family.’
OBA.1.18	This is what the 
OBA.1.19	People will come from the Negev. They will come to live in the mountains where Esau's people (the people in 
OBA.1.19	People will come from the small hills near the mountain. And they will get the 
OBA.1.19	They will live in the fields in Ephraim and Samaria.
OBA.1.19	Benjamin's people will get Gilead.
OBA.1.20	Some people lived in Israel,
OBA.1.20	but they now have to live with the 
OBA.1.20	They will get the country as far as Zarephath.
OBA.1.20	Some people lived in Jerusalem, but now they have to be in Sepharad.
OBA.1.20	They will get the towns in the Negev.
OBA.1.21	Men will come to make Jerusalem free
OBA.1.21	and they will rule over

JON.1.1	The 
JON.1.2	He said ‘Go to the large, important city called Nineveh. Tell the people in the city that they do wrong things. I have seen what the cruel people there are doing. Lots of really bad things happen there.’ 
JON.1.3	But Jonah ran away from the 
JON.1.4	Then the 
JON.1.5	All the sailors were afraid. Each of them shouted in a loud voice to his own god. They threw the things that the ship carried into the sea. They made the ship's weight as light as they could. But Jonah had gone below deck. He lay down and he slept. He slept in a way that it would be difficult for anyone to wake him up.
JON.1.6	The ship's captain went to Jonah. He said, ‘You should not be sleeping! Get up and speak in a loud voice to your god! Maybe he will listen to us and we will not die.’ 
JON.1.7	Then the sailors said to each other, ‘We will throw 
JON.1.8	So they asked Jonah, ‘Who has caused all this trouble for us? What is your job? Where do you come from? What country do you live in? Where were you born?’
JON.1.9	Jonah explained. He said, ‘I am a 
JON.1.10	This made the sailors really afraid. They asked Jonah, ‘What have you done?’ They knew that he was running from the 
JON.1.11	The water in the sea was moving up and down. It was so high now that water sometimes came into the ship. So the sailors asked Jonah, ‘What should we do to you? The water is coming into the ship. How can we stop that?’ 
JON.1.12	Jonah replied, ‘Lift me up and throw me into the sea. The sea will not move up and down any longer. It will become flat again. I have done something wrong. So you are in a storm.’
JON.1.13	But the men did not throw Jonah into the sea. They 
JON.1.14	Then the men spoke in a loud voice to the 
JON.1.15	Then the sailors took Jonah and they threw him over the side of the ship. The water in the sea did not continue to move up and down. It became flat. 
JON.1.16	When they saw this, the men were afraid of the 
JON.1.17	But the 
JON.2.1	From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	He said,
JON.2.2	‘I was really afraid.
JON.2.2	So I spoke to the 
JON.2.2	And he answered me.
JON.2.2	From the deep hole, I shouted for help.
JON.2.2	And you listened when I cried.
JON.2.3	You threw me into the deep water.
JON.2.3	I fell into the middle of the sea.
JON.2.3	The water moved all round me.
JON.2.3	It carried me along.
JON.2.3	The high water came down over me.
JON.2.3	The white water covered my head.
JON.2.4	I said,
JON.2.4	“You have sent me away so that you can no longer see me.
JON.2.4	But I will look again towards the place where I can

JON.2.5	The deep water caused me to think that my life was in danger.
JON.2.5	Plants in the sea covered very near round my head.
JON.2.6	I went far down in the water.
JON.2.6	I went down to the ground.
JON.2.6	I could not go any deeper.
JON.2.6	I did not know how I would ever come up again.
JON.2.6	But you brought me up from the deep hole.
JON.2.6	You are my

JON.2.7	I prayed. And you heard me in the place where I can

JON.2.8	They 
JON.2.8	So they do not receive God's love that could be for them.
JON.2.9	But I will give

JON.2.9	I will do what I have promised to do.
JON.2.9	The 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	The 
JON.3.2	He said, ‘Go to the large, important city called Nineveh. Tell all the people there the message that I will give to you.’ 
JON.3.3	Jonah obeyed the 
JON.3.3	Nineveh was a very large city. A person would need three days to travel all through it.
JON.3.4	Jonah started to travel into the city. When he had travelled for a day, he shouted out to the people. He said, ‘40 more days and God will destroy Nineveh.’ 
JON.3.5	The people who lived in Nineveh believed God. They were ashamed about how they had lived. So they told everyone that they must not eat anything for several days. All the people put 
JON.3.6	When the king of Nineveh heard about this, he got up from his 
JON.3.7	Then the king spoke to all the people in Nineveh. He said, ‘I and the important people who work for me have made a rule. No man or animal or any group of animals must taste anything. They must not eat or drink. 
JON.3.8	Men and women must cover themselves with 
JON.3.9	Nobody knows what will happen. Even now, God may change his mind. He may not be angry any longer. He may be kind to us and so we may not die.’ 
JON.3.10	God saw what the people in Nineveh did. He saw that they did good things now. They no longer did wrong things. So he was kind to them. He did not destroy their city as he had said.
JON.4.1	But Jonah did not like that. He was certainly not happy. He became angry. 
JON.4.2	He prayed to the 
JON.4.3	Now, 
JON.4.4	But the 
JON.4.5	Jonah went outside and he sat down at a place to the east of the city. There he made a small hut for himself. He sat under it so that the sun would not burn him. He waited. He wanted to see what would happen to the city. 
JON.4.6	But God made a plant. The 
JON.4.7	But God had also made a 
JON.4.8	When the sun rose, God caused the wind to blow from the east. The wind was very hot. The sun made Jonah's head very hot. He became weak and ill. He wanted to die. He said, ‘It would be better for me to die than to live.’
JON.4.9	But God said to Jonah, ‘Should you be angry about the plant?’
JON.4.9	‘I should’, he said. ‘I feel so angry that I want to die.’ 
JON.4.10	But the 
JON.4.11	But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people. They cannot understand the difference between right ways and wrong ways. Also, they have many cows. That large city is important to me.’ 
MIC.1.1	These are the messages that the 
MIC.1.2	Listen, all of you people everywhere!
MIC.1.2	Hear this, everyone who lives on the earth!
MIC.1.2	The 
MIC.1.2	You have done what is wrong. That is why he will speak against you.
MIC.1.2	He will speak from his special house.
MIC.1.3	Look! The 
MIC.1.3	He will come to the high places (where you 
MIC.1.3	He will destroy those places when he comes.
MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt when he comes,
MIC.1.4	like wax melts near a fire.
MIC.1.4	The valleys will break too.
MIC.1.4	They will move like water when it rushes down a hill. 
MIC.1.5	All these bad things will happen because 
MIC.1.5	These things will happen because Israel's people have done wrong things.
MIC.1.5	You may ask who has caused this.
MIC.1.5	It is the leaders in your capital cities,
MIC.1.5	Samaria city and Jerusalem city.
MIC.1.5	They have kept the high places there for people to offer gifts to false gods.
MIC.1.6	So God says to you:
MIC.1.6	‘I will destroy Samaria so that just a few stones are lying in the fields there.
MIC.1.6	Then people will plant vines in that place.
MIC.1.6	I will throw the stones from the city down into the valley,
MIC.1.6	when I completely destroy all the buildings.
MIC.1.7	I will break all the false gods into pieces and I will destroy them.
MIC.1.7	I will burn all the gifts that the people brought for those false gods.
MIC.1.7	The people have paid so that they could have sex with bad women in those places.
MIC.1.7	Your enemies will come and they will take away this money.
MIC.1.7	They will give it to their gods in the same way.’ 
MIC.1.8	Because of what God has said, I will cry aloud. And I will weep.
MIC.1.8	I will walk about without shoes or clothes.
MIC.1.8	I will scream like a wild dog,
MIC.1.8	and I will cry like a bird in the night.
MIC.1.9	Because Samaria has such bad wounds it can never get well.
MIC.1.9	And the same will happen also to 
MIC.1.9	The enemies have already reached the gates of my people, that is, Jerusalem itself. 
MIC.1.10	Do not talk about this in the city called Gath.
MIC.1.10	Do not even weep there.
MIC.1.10	But you people at Beth Leaphrah,
MIC.1.10	roll on the ground to show how sad you are.
MIC.1.11	You people who live in Shaphir, go on your way.
MIC.1.11	Your enemies will not let you wear any clothes while they take you away.
MIC.1.11	So you will be ashamed.
MIC.1.11	The people who live in Zaanan will be afraid to leave their city.
MIC.1.11	The people at Bethezel will cry because nobody comes to help them.
MIC.1.12	The people at Maroth are in pain while they wait.
MIC.1.12	They were waiting and hoping for something good.
MIC.1.12	But the 
MIC.1.12	He brought trouble even to the gates of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	You people who live in Lachish, get your 
MIC.1.13	You were the first people in 
MIC.1.13	You are exactly like Israel's people, because, like them, you refused to obey God.
MIC.1.14	You will need to give gifts to the people in Moresheth Gath,
MIC.1.14	because they must go away.
MIC.1.14	The houses in Achzib town will disappoint the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	People in Mareshah, I (God) will bring an army against you,
MIC.1.15	to fight your town. And it will win.
MIC.1.15	And Israel's leaders will need to hide at Adullam.
MIC.1.16	People in 
MIC.1.16	Make yourselves bald like vultures,
MIC.1.16	because you will be very sad.
MIC.1.16	Your enemies will take your children away.
MIC.1.16	They will take your children, whom you love so much, away to another country! 
MIC.2.1	Micah continues:
MIC.2.1	People who prepare to do bad things should be afraid.
MIC.2.1	God will do bad things to them!
MIC.2.1	While they lie in bed, they think about bad things to do.
MIC.2.1	Then, when the morning comes, they do those bad things.
MIC.2.1	They have the authority to do whatever they want to do.
MIC.2.2	When they want fields, they take them from other people.
MIC.2.2	When they want houses, they take them.
MIC.2.2	These cruel people take other people's homes and fields;
MIC.2.2	then those people's families have nothing.
MIC.2.3	So the 
MIC.2.3	‘I am against you.
MIC.2.3	You cannot save yourselves.
MIC.2.3	I will prepare trouble for you.
MIC.2.3	Then you will stop thinking that you are so very clever and important.
MIC.2.3	It will be a time of much trouble for you.
MIC.2.4	At that time, people will say that you are fools.
MIC.2.4	They will sing this sad song on your behalf:
MIC.2.4	God has completely destroyed us!
MIC.2.4	We no longer have any fields, because God has taken them away from us.
MIC.2.4	He has given them to our enemies, who have turned away from what is right.
MIC.2.5	So, when the 
MIC.2.5	you will get none.
MIC.2.5	You will have nobody to speak on your behalf.’ 
MIC.2.6	The bad people say to Micah: ‘Do not prophesy like this to us!
MIC.2.6	Do not say that we will have trouble.
MIC.2.6	God will not make us ashamed!’ 
MIC.2.7	Micah replies: It is wrong for you to say that the 
MIC.2.7	God does not do bad things.
MIC.2.7	My (God's) words do good things.
MIC.2.7	He is kind to people who do the right things.
MIC.2.8	‘Even in days that have only just passed,
MIC.2.8	you have become enemies among my people’, God says.
MIC.2.8	‘You rob people of their coats when they pass by.
MIC.2.8	Even men who thought that they were safe now.
MIC.2.8	You even rob men who are returning home from war.
MIC.2.9	You rob the women among my people too.
MIC.2.9	You take away their happy homes.
MIC.2.9	So, you take away what I want their children to enjoy.
MIC.2.10	Get up and go away!
MIC.2.10	You cannot remain in this place because you have made it bad.
MIC.2.10	It is so bad that it will completely destroy you.
MIC.2.11	When a person speaks false messages to you, then you believe them.
MIC.2.11	They might say that you would have plenty of 
MIC.2.11	That is the message that you would like!’ 
MIC.2.12	‘You people of Israel, I promise to bring all of you together.
MIC.2.12	I will bring back together all Israel's people who remain.
MIC.2.12	I will put all of you together like sheep in a field with a wall round it.
MIC.2.12	You will be like a field full of sheep.
MIC.2.12	There will be a loud noise because there will be so many of you.
MIC.2.13	The person who breaks open the way will go in front of you.
MIC.2.13	Then you will go out through the gate.
MIC.2.13	I am the 
MIC.3.1	Then I spoke to the leaders:
MIC.3.1	Listen to me, I said.
MIC.3.1	You are the leaders of 
MIC.3.1	you are the rulers of Israel.
MIC.3.1	You ought to know what is right or wrong.
MIC.3.2	But you 
MIC.3.2	And you love what is bad.
MIC.3.2	You would like to tear the skin off my people,
MIC.3.2	and pull the meat from their bones.
MIC.3.3	You look at my people and you are like butchers.
MIC.3.3	They strip the skin off an animal and they break its bones.
MIC.3.3	Then they cut the meat into pieces and they cook it in a pot.
MIC.3.3	They are happy when they eat the meat.
MIC.3.4	One day you will shout to the 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer you.
MIC.3.4	Instead, God will turn away from you at that time,
MIC.3.4	because you have done those bad things.
MIC.3.5	The 
MIC.3.6	God says to you: ‘It will be like night for you because it will be dark.
MIC.3.6	You will not see anything.
MIC.3.6	You will no longer be able to see what will happen in future times.
MIC.3.6	The sun will go down over you 
MIC.3.6	and the day will become dark for you.
MIC.3.7	You saw what would happen in future times. That is what you said.
MIC.3.7	But you will be ashamed.
MIC.3.7	And you try to tell what will happen in future times.
MIC.3.7	But I will confuse you.
MIC.3.7	All of you will hide your faces because I will not answer you.’
MIC.3.8	‘But the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	He helps me to know what is right and fair.
MIC.3.8	He makes me brave so that I can speak to you, 
MIC.3.8	I can tell you what you have done wrong.
MIC.3.8	You are Israel's people,
MIC.3.8	but you have not obeyed God. 
MIC.3.9	So listen to this, you leaders of 
MIC.3.9	You are Israel's rulers.
MIC.3.9	But you never do what is right and fair.
MIC.3.9	You take what is good.
MIC.3.9	And you make it seem bad.
MIC.3.10	You rule 
MIC.3.10	But you are cruel, and you kill honest people. 
MIC.3.11	You are the city's rulers, but you accept money from people.
MIC.3.11	Then you decide what is right or wrong.
MIC.3.11	You listen to the people who give the money to you.
MIC.3.11	Then they tell you what to decide.
MIC.3.11	You priests teach only if the people pay you to teach.
MIC.3.11	You 
MIC.3.11	But you only speak if you receive money.
MIC.3.11	But all of you, the leaders, still say that you believe the 
MIC.3.11	‘The 
MIC.3.12	So God says: ‘Because of you,
MIC.3.12	I will make 
MIC.3.12	I will destroy Jerusalem so that only stones are lying there.
MIC.3.12	Weeds and bushes will grow all over the hill where they built my house.’ 
MIC.4.1	In the last days,
MIC.4.1	the mountain where the 
MIC.4.1	It will be the most important of all the mountains.
MIC.4.1	It will be higher than the hills,
MIC.4.1	and people from many countries will go to it.
MIC.4.2	Many people will speak about it.
MIC.4.2	‘Come! We will go up to the 
MIC.4.2	‘We will go to the 
MIC.4.2	He will teach us what he wants us to do.
MIC.4.2	He will show us the right way; so then we will be able to obey him.
MIC.4.2	The 
MIC.4.2	He will send out his message from Jerusalem.’
MIC.4.3	He will decide what is right or wrong between many countries.
MIC.4.3	He will cause strong countries everywhere to stop fighting each other.
MIC.4.3	They fight with 
MIC.4.3	But then, they will use hammers to make their 
MIC.4.3	They will make their spears into tools to cut plants.
MIC.4.3	One country will not fight another country any longer.
MIC.4.3	They will never prepare for war again.
MIC.4.4	Everyone will sit under his own vine and his own fig tree.
MIC.4.4	Nobody will make them afraid any longer.
MIC.4.4	The 
MIC.4.5	People from other countries may be the servants of other gods.
MIC.4.5	But we will be servants of the 
MIC.4.5	We will obey him always. 
MIC.4.6	The 
MIC.4.6	‘At that time I will bring together the people who cannot walk well.
MIC.4.6	I will bring back the people that I sent away.
MIC.4.6	I caused trouble for those people,
MIC.4.6	but I will bring them back together.
MIC.4.7	I will make a new beginning with those people who cannot walk well.
MIC.4.7	Together with some of those people that I sent far away,
MIC.4.7	I will make them my own special people.
MIC.4.7	They will be strong,
MIC.4.7	and I will rule over them from 
MIC.4.7	I will be their king from that time and always.
MIC.4.8	And as for Jerusalem city,
MIC.4.8	it was a strong, safe place for 
MIC.4.8	It was like a tall building,
MIC.4.8	from which a man can watch over his sheep.
MIC.4.8	Then it will again be a place where a king rules with great authority.’
MIC.4.9	You people in Jerusalem,
MIC.4.9	you are crying aloud like people who have no king.
MIC.4.9	You cry like people who have nobody to advise them.
MIC.4.9	You have bad pains like a woman who is giving birth to a baby. 
MIC.4.10	People in 
MIC.4.10	like a woman who is giving birth to a baby.
MIC.4.10	She rolls about and she screams with pain.
MIC.4.10	Soon you will have to leave your city and you will have to live in the fields.
MIC.4.10	You will have to go to Babylon,
MIC.4.10	but there the 
MIC.4.10	He will make you free again from the authority of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	But now, at this time, many countries have come together to attack your city.
MIC.4.11	They say: ‘We will destroy Jerusalem and we will enjoy ourselves.
MIC.4.11	We want to see 
MIC.4.12	But they do not know the 
MIC.4.12	They do not understand how he will 
MIC.4.12	He will bring them together,
MIC.4.12	as people bring bundles of wheat together at 
MIC.4.12	He will 
MIC.4.12	as people thresh wheat to get the seeds out.
MIC.4.13	‘People in 
MIC.4.13	‘Hit them like people thresh the wheat.
MIC.4.13	I will make you very strong.
MIC.4.13	Then you will be like dangerous animals with iron horns and metal feet.
MIC.4.13	You will beat enemies from many countries,
MIC.4.13	as men 
MIC.4.13	The people from those countries became rich,
MIC.4.13	because they did bad things.
MIC.4.13	But you will bring their riches to me,
MIC.4.13	because I am the 
MIC.5.1	Soldiers in Jerusalem, come together!
MIC.5.1	Get ready, because your enemies are attacking you.
MIC.5.1	They are all round the city, ready to fight.
MIC.5.1	They will hit Israel's ruler on his face with a stick. 
MIC.5.2	But God tells us this:
MIC.5.2	‘Bethlehem Ephrathah is only a little town,
MIC.5.2	among all the many towns in 
MIC.5.2	‘But I will choose someone who is born there.
MIC.5.2	He will rule Israel for me.
MIC.5.2	Long, long ago, I prepared for him to come.’ 
MIC.5.3	So God will turn away from his people,
MIC.5.3	until the time that the woman gives birth to this baby in Bethlehem.
MIC.5.3	Then this ruler's own people who are still alive will return to Israel.
MIC.5.4	And this ruler will stay strong because the 
MIC.5.4	He will supply what his people need.
MIC.5.4	He will be like a man who supplies everything for his sheep.
MIC.5.4	He will rule with authority from the 
MIC.5.4	and his people will be safe.
MIC.5.4	So then, all over the world, people will know that he is great.
MIC.5.5	And he will cause the people to rest,
MIC.5.5	so that they have no trouble.
MIC.5.5	Assyria's soldiers will come to attack our country.
MIC.5.5	They will march through our large, strong buildings.
MIC.5.5	Then we will choose seven or eight leaders to fight against them.
MIC.5.6	These leaders will use their 
MIC.5.6	They will beat the people in the country called Nimrod with 
MIC.5.6	Assyria's soldiers will come into our country.
MIC.5.6	They will march across our borders,
MIC.5.6	but our ruler will save us from them. 
MIC.5.7	And later, 
MIC.5.7	They will be everywhere,
MIC.5.7	like water on the ground in the early morning,
MIC.5.7	or rain on the grass.
MIC.5.7	The 
MIC.5.7	but no human person can make it stay.
MIC.5.8	They will become like a dangerous lion among the other animals in the forest.
MIC.5.8	They will become like a young lion among people's sheep.
MIC.5.8	The lion attacks other animals.
MIC.5.8	It knocks them down and it tears them in pieces.
MIC.5.8	Nobody can save them.
MIC.5.9	You will be strong like that and so you will beat your enemies.
MIC.5.9	You will kill all of them. 
MIC.5.10	‘At that time’, the 
MIC.5.10	I will destroy your 
MIC.5.11	I will destroy the cities in your country.
MIC.5.11	I will knock down all your strong buildings.
MIC.5.12	You make bad spirits help you.
MIC.5.12	But I will destroy the things that you use to talk to them.
MIC.5.12	You will have nobody to tell you about future times.
MIC.5.13	You bend down to 
MIC.5.13	But I will destroy all of them.
MIC.5.13	You will stop 
MIC.5.14	You 
MIC.5.14	but I will pull her poles from the ground.
MIC.5.14	I will even destroy your cities.
MIC.5.15	Also I will 
MIC.5.15	I will show them that I am very angry with them.’ 
MIC.6.1	Now listen to what the 
MIC.6.1	‘Stand up! Explain in front of the mountains what I want to say.
MIC.6.1	Speak loud so that the hills can hear your voice.
MIC.6.2	Listen, you mountains.
MIC.6.2	Hear this, you strong places that have always been there deep in the earth.
MIC.6.2	The 
MIC.6.2	Hear the reasons why the 
MIC.6.3	‘My people, what bad thing have I done to you?’ God asks.
MIC.6.3	‘How have I made you tired of me?
MIC.6.3	Answer me.
MIC.6.4	I brought you out of Egypt.
MIC.6.4	You were slaves in that country,
MIC.6.4	but I made you free people.
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses to lead you,
MIC.6.4	and Aaron and Miriam with him.
MIC.6.5	My people, please remember the bad things that King Balak of Moab tried to do.
MIC.6.5	And remember what Balaam, Beor's son, answered him.
MIC.6.5	Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal.
MIC.6.5	Then you will remember that I, the 
MIC.6.6	‘I come to meet with the 
MIC.6.6	‘I must know what to bring when I come.
MIC.6.6	I bend down to 
MIC.6.6	I must know what to offer when I bend down.
MIC.6.6	He is God and he is greater than everything.
MIC.6.6	Perhaps he would like it if I burn young cows one year old for him.
MIC.6.7	He might be happy with thousands of male sheep,
MIC.6.7	or ten thousand rivers of olive oil.
MIC.6.7	I have not obeyed God.
MIC.6.7	I might even kill and burn my oldest son, because of that.
MIC.6.7	I have done wrong things and I must pay God for that.
MIC.6.7	Perhaps, if I give my own child to him, that will be enough to pay.’ 
MIC.6.8	But God has told us what is good. This is what the 
MIC.6.8	‘You must be fair to other people’, God says.
MIC.6.8	‘You must want to be kind.
MIC.6.8	And you must be careful to do what I show you.’ 
MIC.6.9	The 
MIC.6.9	So, it is good for us to listen carefully to what he says.
MIC.6.9	‘Listen to me, because I have the authority to 
MIC.6.10	‘You bad people still hide valuable things that you have taken from other people.
MIC.6.10	I will not forget this.
MIC.6.10	You bad people use false weights to measure the food that you sell.
MIC.6.10	I 
MIC.6.11	I will not excuse you people who use false weights.
MIC.6.11	You are not being honest if you weigh things like that.
MIC.6.12	You rich people in the city are very cruel.
MIC.6.12	Everyone there says things that are not true.
MIC.6.12	All of them speak false words.
MIC.6.13	So, I will make you so sick that you will never get well.
MIC.6.13	I have begun to destroy you because you have done bad things.
MIC.6.14	You will eat, but you will still feel hungry.
MIC.6.14	You will store things and you will try to keep them safe.
MIC.6.14	But you will fail to save them.
MIC.6.14	I will cause enemies to destroy all your things in the war.
MIC.6.15	You will plant seeds,
MIC.6.15	but you will not bring in the 
MIC.6.15	You will 
MIC.6.15	but you will not use the olive oil for yourselves.
MIC.6.15	You will 
MIC.6.15	but you will not drink the 
MIC.6.16	You have obeyed the rules of King Omri.
MIC.6.16	You have done what King Ahab and all his people did.
MIC.6.16	You have copied their bad example.
MIC.6.16	So, I must destroy you and all your things completely.
MIC.6.16	Then people from other countries will not be kind or polite to you.
MIC.6.16	Instead, they will make you ashamed.’ 
MIC.7.1	I am very sad!
MIC.7.1	I am like someone who comes to trees with no fruit on them.
MIC.7.1	Other people have picked the fruit already.
MIC.7.1	So, I am like those people who can only pick the last 
MIC.7.1	Those are the 
MIC.7.1	Really, there are no 
MIC.7.1	There are none of the first figs that I like so much.
MIC.7.2	There are no longer any people here who obey God.
MIC.7.2	There are no good, honest people.
MIC.7.2	Everyone is waiting to kill someone else.
MIC.7.2	They are all like hunters, who try to catch each other.
MIC.7.3	They know very well how to work together to do bad things.
MIC.7.3	Rulers demand gifts and judges ask for money.
MIC.7.3	Powerful bad people always get what they want.
MIC.7.3	All these people work together to do what is bad.
MIC.7.4	The best of them are dangerous like wild plants with thorns.
MIC.7.4	The most honest of them are worse than thorn bushes.
MIC.7.4	The bad time that your 
MIC.7.4	Soon God will 
MIC.7.4	and you will be confused. 
MIC.7.5	Do not believe anyone, even somebody that you know well.
MIC.7.5	You cannot be sure that your friend will always be honest with you.
MIC.7.5	Be careful what you say to your wife.
MIC.7.5	Be careful even when you are hugging her.
MIC.7.6	Sons think that their fathers are fools.
MIC.7.6	And daughters refuse to obey their mothers.
MIC.7.6	Wives quarrel with their husbands' mothers.
MIC.7.6	A man's enemies are the people who live in his own house now.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will watch for what the 
MIC.7.7	I will wait for God, who saves me.
MIC.7.7	I know that he hears me.
MIC.7.8	My enemy, do not be happy because I am in trouble.
MIC.7.8	I have fallen down, but I will get up.
MIC.7.8	I am in the dark, but the 
MIC.7.9	I have not obeyed the 
MIC.7.9	so he is angry with me.
MIC.7.9	He will continue to 
MIC.7.9	until the time when he speaks for me.
MIC.7.9	Then he will make things right for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out into the light.
MIC.7.9	He always does what is really right.
MIC.7.9	And I will see that then.
MIC.7.10	‘Why does the 
MIC.7.10	They will see what God does for me.
MIC.7.10	Then they will be very ashamed.
MIC.7.10	And I will see the bad things that happen to them.
MIC.7.10	Soon other people will 
MIC.7.10	Then they will be like wet ground in the streets under people's feet. 
MIC.7.11	But the time will come for you to build the walls of your cities again.
MIC.7.11	You will make the borders of your country much wider then.
MIC.7.12	At that time many of Assyria's people and Egypt's people will come to you.
MIC.7.12	People will come to you from the countries between Egypt and the River Euphrates.
MIC.7.12	They will come to you from all over the earth,
MIC.7.12	from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	The other parts of the earth will become sad places where nobody lives.
MIC.7.13	God will destroy them because of the people who live there.
MIC.7.13	Those people have done what is bad.
MIC.7.14	Rule us and lead us, 
MIC.7.14	You are like a man who leads his sheep.
MIC.7.14	He uses a strong stick to lead them.
MIC.7.14	We are your own special people.
MIC.7.14	We are like a group of sheep that lives by itself in a forest.
MIC.7.14	There is good grass all round them.
MIC.7.14	Let your sheep eat grass in Bashan and Gilead,
MIC.7.14	as they did a long time ago. 
MIC.7.15	when you brought us out of the country called Egypt.
MIC.7.15	Do great things like that again.
MIC.7.16	The people in other countries will see what you do.
MIC.7.16	They will understand that they are not really powerful.
MIC.7.16	So then they will be ashamed.
MIC.7.16	They will be like deaf and dumb people (people who cannot speak or hear).
MIC.7.17	They will be like snakes that move along the ground.
MIC.7.17	They will eat the ground like snakes because they will be very afraid.
MIC.7.17	They will come out of their safe places,
MIC.7.17	because they will be afraid of you, the 
MIC.7.18	No other god is like you.
MIC.7.18	You chose us to be your people.
MIC.7.18	And you decide not to remember what we have done wrong.
MIC.7.18	Not many of your people remain and we have done bad things.
MIC.7.18	But you choose to forget those bad things.
MIC.7.18	You will not always be angry,
MIC.7.18	because you want very much to be kind.
MIC.7.19	You like to be kind because you love us.
MIC.7.19	So, again you will remove everything that we have done wrong.
MIC.7.19	You will 
MIC.7.19	You will throw all of them into the deep sea.
MIC.7.20	You will continue to be kind to us,
MIC.7.20	because we are 
MIC.7.20	That is what you promised to our grandfathers a long time ago. 
NAM.1.1	Nahum lives in Elkosh and this is his 
NAM.1.2	God is angry with the people in Nineveh. The 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.3	He is very powerful. You can see his power in the 
NAM.1.4	He can cause the sea and the rivers to become dry by one word. The 
NAM.1.5	He causes the mountains to 
NAM.1.6	Nobody can fight God when he is very angry. The 
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But the people in Nineveh are his enemies and he will kill them. 
NAM.1.9	The 
NAM.1.10	He will kill them. And then it will be like when 
NAM.1.11	The 
NAM.1.12	The 
NAM.1.13	Now I will make you free from the people from Nineveh. And I will break the things that are holding you like iron.’
NAM.1.14	Nineveh, the 
NAM.1.15	People in Judah, look at the mountains. You will see the feet of the person who will bring good news. He causes 
NAM.2.1	An enemy is going to attack you, people in Nineveh. Watch the 
NAM.2.2	Armies have destroyed the countries called Israel and Jacob. They have destroyed their 
NAM.2.3	The soldiers have red 
NAM.2.4	When the soldiers are ready for war they move fast through the streets. Their 
NAM.2.5	The king of Nineveh chooses his best soldiers but they fall on the way. They hurry to their city wall to prepare their 
NAM.2.6	But their enemies open the river gates. Then the water goes into the city and it destroys the 
NAM.2.7	The enemy tells its soldiers that they must take the 
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pool. Its people run like water that is going away. ‘Stop, stop!’ they shout, but nobody comes back.
NAM.2.9	Take the 
NAM.2.10	They take the valuable things from the city. They take everything that they can. And they destroy everything else. The people are very sad. Their knees and their bodies 
NAM.2.11	The home of the 
NAM.2.12	The 
NAM.2.13	The 
NAM.3.1	You will have many troubles Nineveh, city of blood, full of lies and 
NAM.3.2	Listen to the loud noises of the 
NAM.3.3	See the bright 
NAM.3.4	This is because Nineveh has sold herself to the enemies of God. She is like a beautiful 
NAM.3.5	This is why I am against you, says the 
NAM.3.6	I will throw 
NAM.3.7	When people see you, they will run away. And they will say, ‘They have destroyed Nineveh. Nobody will be sad.’ There will be nobody to help you.
NAM.3.8	Remember the city called Thebes that was near the River Nile. It had water on all sides and it had the river like a wall. Nineveh is not better than Thebes was. 
NAM.3.9	The countries called Cush and Egypt were strong friends. And Put and Libya were strong friends too.
NAM.3.10	But the enemies of Thebes took its people away and they made them slaves. They cut their babies to pieces in every street. They played games with the great men from Thebes and they put them in iron 
NAM.3.11	You will be like a man who has drunk too much alcohol. And you will try to hide. You will try to get help from your enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All your 
NAM.3.13	Look at your soldiers, they are all like women! Your enemies have burned your gates and they have pushed them wide open.
NAM.3.14	Take as much water as you can for the attack. Make your 
NAM.3.15	The fire will burn you. The 
NAM.3.16	You welcomed sellers into your city until there were more than all the stars in the sky. But they are like 
NAM.3.17	Your army and 
NAM.3.18	King of Assyria, the people who keep your people safe are asleep. Also, your powerful men are lying down to rest. Your people have run away to the mountains with nobody to get them together.
NAM.3.19	Your 
HAB.1.1	These are the important words that Habakkuk the 
HAB.1.3	Why do you cause me to see things that are not right? Why do you let people do what is wrong? People destroy things and there is 
HAB.1.4	So the 
HAB.1.5	‘Look at other countries and watch. You will become very, very surprised because of the things that I will do during your 
HAB.1.6	I will make the 
HAB.1.7	People will be afraid of them. They will really frighten people. The 
HAB.1.8	Their horses will run faster than 
HAB.1.9	They will all come for 
HAB.1.10	They will say things that are not kind about kings. And they will say that the leaders of the people are silly. They will know that city walls will not keep them out. They will build earth as high as the walls and they will get into each city.
HAB.1.11	Then they will rush past like the wind and they will go on to somewhere else. They will think that their own god has made them strong.’
HAB.1.13	But your eyes are too 
HAB.1.14	And you have made people like fishes in the sea. You have made them like animals that move with no rulers.
HAB.1.15	The 
HAB.1.16	So they give 
HAB.1.17	So will they pour fish out of their 
HAB.2.1	I will stand and I will watch. I will stay on the walls (of the city). I will look to see what God will say to me. And I will see what answer I will have for my problem.
HAB.2.2	Then the 
HAB.2.3	What I will show to you must wait for the proper time. But at that time, it will happen. It will happen as I have said. It may not happen for a long time but wait for it. It will certainly happen and it will not be late.
HAB.2.4	Look, the 
HAB.2.5	And also, 
HAB.2.6	The people in all those countries will write a song that is against Babylon. They will say that its people are silly. And they will say other bad things about it. They will say, “Some people rob other people. And they keep what they take. A sad time will come to those people. Some people get a lot of money by the very bad things that they do. A sad time will come to those people. They will not always be able to do those things.”
HAB.2.7	The people that you people in Babylon have taken things from will wake up. It will happen when you are not thinking about it! They will get up and they will make you afraid. Then you will be the people that they will rob!
HAB.2.8	You have robbed many countries. So the people who remain will rob you. That is because you have killed people. And you have destroyed their towns and their lands. You have killed everyone who lived there.
HAB.2.9	Some people get things for themselves by ways that are not fair. A sad time will come to those people. You build your homes high up so that nobody can take you to do bad things to you.
HAB.2.10	You decided to kill the people from many countries. Because of that, you will be ashamed. And you will pay with your own life.
HAB.2.11	Even the stones in the walls will cry. The beams that you made from wood will do it as well.
HAB.2.12	A man might build a city because he kills people. A man might make a town great because he has been very bad. A sad time will come to that man.
HAB.2.13	The work that people do will go into the fire. The 
HAB.2.14	But the earth will become filled with people who know about the 
HAB.2.15	A sad time will come to him who gives strong drink to his 
HAB.2.16	You will be really ashamed. Nobody will think that you are great. Then you will drink and people will see you with no clothes on! The cup in the 
HAB.2.17	The 
HAB.2.18	An 
HAB.2.19	It will be very bad for someone who says to a piece of wood, “Wake up!” He says to a stone that cannot speak, “Get up and be my guide!” Look at it! It has gold and 
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	These are the words that the 
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman. The 
HAB.3.3	His 
HAB.3.4	He was as bright as the sunrise. Light fell from his hands, where he hid his great power.
HAB.3.6	(God) stood and he caused the earth to 
HAB.3.7	I saw the places where Cushan lived. The people there were not happy. The people who live in the houses of Midian were afraid.
HAB.3.8	I do not think that you were angry with the streams and rivers, 
HAB.3.9	You showed people your bow and you asked for many 
HAB.3.9	You cut the earth into pieces with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw you and they 
HAB.3.11	The sun and the moon stopped moving in the skies. The light from your 
HAB.3.12	You marched through the country because you were angry. Because you were so angry, you hit the people in many countries with your stick.
HAB.3.13	You went out to make your people safe. You went out to save the person whom you have 
HAB.3.14	You, 
HAB.3.15	You marched through the sea with your horses. You 
HAB.3.16	I listened and my heart was afraid. My lips 
HAB.3.17	There may be:
HAB.3.17	· no flowers on the 
HAB.3.17	· no fruit on the 
HAB.3.17	· nothing on the trees that have fruits called olives
HAB.3.17	· no food in the fields
HAB.3.17	· no sheep in the hills

ZEP.1.3	I will remove all the bad people.
ZEP.1.3	Bad people cause trouble for other people.
ZEP.1.3	Yes, I will remove all the people from the ground.

ZEP.1.11	Shout out, you who live in Maktesh! Weep!
ZEP.1.11	The 
ZEP.1.11	Some people have lots of money there. But all those people will be dead then.’ 
ZEP.1.12	‘At that time,

ZEP.1.15	On that day, he will destroy everything bad.
ZEP.1.15	It will be very dark. At that time, there will be thick dark clouds.
ZEP.1.16	At that time, people will make a noise with

ZEP.1.16	And they will try to destroy the strong high parts of the walls.
ZEP.1.17	I will cause trouble for people.
ZEP.1.17	So they will walk like people who cannot see.
ZEP.1.17	This is because they have not obeyed the 
ZEP.1.17	Their blood will fall to the ground.
ZEP.1.17	Yes, they will fall to the ground and they will die. After that, they will be nothing.
ZEP.1.18	Their money will not save them
ZEP.1.18	on the day when the 
ZEP.1.18	He watches.
ZEP.1.18	And he is angry when his people love other gods.
ZEP.1.18	So, he will send fire on the earth.
ZEP.1.18	Yes, he will quickly kill all the people who live in 
ZEP.2.1	Come together!
ZEP.2.1	Yes, you people, come together and think.
ZEP.2.1	You do not know how to be ashamed!
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	The wind takes away the dry parts of a plant that covered the seed.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	It will be like that when I 
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Before it is the time for me to punish you, look for me.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Before this time is past, look for me.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Look for me, before I become very, very angry with you.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	There will be a day when the 
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Yes, look for the 
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	You have done what the 
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Continue to do what is good.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	But do not think that you are great.
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	Perhaps you will find a safe place
ZEP.2.2+ZEP.2.3	on the day when the 
ZEP.2.4	Then, the people who have lived in Gaza city and Ashkelon city will not be there.
ZEP.2.4	Enemies will also send away the people in Ashdod city at midday. And those enemies will destroy Ekron city.
ZEP.2.5	It will be very bad for you people called Cherethites, who live by the sea!
ZEP.2.5	The 
ZEP.2.5	I will also kill all you people called Philistines, who live in the country called Canaan!
ZEP.2.5	You will all die. So nobody will live there.
ZEP.2.6	By the sea, there will be houses for people who feed sheep.
ZEP.2.6	There will be safe places for their sheep.
ZEP.2.7	Those people in 
ZEP.2.7	They will have food there.
ZEP.2.7	They will lie down to sleep in Ashkelon city's houses.

ZEP.2.7	He will stop their troubles.
ZEP.2.8	The 
ZEP.2.8	They laugh about you and they say cruel things about you, my people.
ZEP.2.8	They have thought that they were greater than you.
ZEP.2.8	They have come against you.’
ZEP.2.9	The 
ZEP.2.9	the God of Israel, says,
ZEP.2.9	‘You can be sure that I live.
ZEP.2.9	In the same way, you can also be sure that my people will take everything.
ZEP.2.9	It will be theirs to keep.
ZEP.2.9	God will destroy Moab as he destroyed 
ZEP.2.9	He will destroy Ammon as he destroyed 
ZEP.2.9	After this, the ground will have lots of salt on it. Weeds will grow there.
ZEP.2.9	Nobody will build anything there again.
ZEP.2.9	The small number of my people that enemies have not killed will have Ammon's peoples' things and Moab's peoples' things.’
ZEP.2.10	That will happen to all 
ZEP.2.10	The 
ZEP.2.10	The cruel people thought that they were greater than the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.11	He will destroy all the 
ZEP.2.11	People will 
ZEP.2.11	They will also 
ZEP.2.12	‘I will also 
ZEP.2.12	Other people will kill you with a big knife’, the 
ZEP.2.13	The 
ZEP.2.13	There, he will destroy the country called Assyria.
ZEP.2.13	He will also destroy Nineveh city. That place will become only dry sand.
ZEP.2.14	Sheep will lie down there.
ZEP.2.14	All the wild animals of that place will live together there.
ZEP.2.14	They will sing in the windows.
ZEP.2.14	Bits of doors will lie on the ground.
ZEP.2.14	The 
ZEP.2.15	All this will happen to that city, the 
ZEP.2.15	That city's people said in their minds,
ZEP.2.15	‘Here we are. We are greater than all the other people.’
ZEP.2.15	But then, other people will destroy their city! Only bits of it will still be there.
ZEP.2.15	Then wild animals will come and they will lie down in it. People will see this.
ZEP.2.15	So, any people who pass by the city will make noises with their lips.
ZEP.2.15	And they will hold their fists up. In this way, they will show that they think bad things about the city.
ZEP.3.1	It will be very bad for the city!
ZEP.3.1	It is like something that is dirty.
ZEP.3.1	Its people will not obey me. They like to fight weak people. They also like to do bad things.
ZEP.3.2	They do not listen to anyone's voice.
ZEP.3.2	They accept no 
ZEP.3.2	They do not 
ZEP.3.2	They do not come near to their God.
ZEP.3.3	The rulers of the city make a very loud noise with their voices like big wild animals.
ZEP.3.3	Its 
ZEP.3.3	They are like wolves that have even eaten all an animal's bones before morning.
ZEP.3.4	Its 
ZEP.3.4	People cannot 
ZEP.3.4	Its 
ZEP.3.4	even in God's 
ZEP.3.4	They have also made changes to God's rules.
ZEP.3.4	They have made changes that they want.
ZEP.3.5	But the 
ZEP.3.5	He will do what is right.
ZEP.3.5	He is always the honest 
ZEP.3.5	He never fails.
ZEP.3.5	But the bad people do not know how to be ashamed. 
ZEP.3.6	‘I have destroyed 
ZEP.3.6	‘There is nobody in their strong 
ZEP.3.6	I have made their streets empty, so no people are there.
ZEP.3.6	I have destroyed their cities.
ZEP.3.6	So, nobody lives in them now.
ZEP.3.7	I said, “I hope that the people in the city will obey me.
ZEP.3.7	Accept 
ZEP.3.7	The people would have been safe if they had accepted it.
ZEP.3.7	Then I would not have to destroy them.
ZEP.3.7	But it did not happen. I had to 
ZEP.3.7	Still, the people got up early to do bad things.’
ZEP.3.8	‘So wait for me’, says the 
ZEP.3.8	‘I will stand up and I will 
ZEP.3.8	I have decided to bring together the 
ZEP.3.8	Then I will 
ZEP.3.8	They will see how angry I am.
ZEP.3.8	They will see it because, on that day, I will burn all the earth.
ZEP.3.9	Then I will give to people lips that I have made 
ZEP.3.9	With those lips, they will call me 
ZEP.3.9	And then, all the people will agree to work together for me.’ 
ZEP.3.10	‘Some people live a long way beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.
ZEP.3.10	Yes, my people who pray went away to many other countries.
ZEP.3.10	They will return and they will carry their gifts to me.
ZEP.3.11	At that time, you will not have to be ashamed
ZEP.3.11	of the wrong things that you have done against me.
ZEP.3.11	But I will take away those who do not see anything wrong in themselves.
ZEP.3.11	Those people will not call each other
ZEP.3.11	“the people who live on God's 
ZEP.3.12	But I will let the poor people remain there.
ZEP.3.12	These are the people who have had bad times.
ZEP.3.12	These are the people who will 
ZEP.3.13	I will let those people stay there.
ZEP.3.13	They will not do any bad things.
ZEP.3.13	They will only say things that are true.
ZEP.3.13	They will say honest things.
ZEP.3.13	They will eat well and they will sleep well.
ZEP.3.13	Nobody will make them afraid.’
ZEP.3.14	Sing, you people in 
ZEP.3.14	Shout, you people in Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Be very, very happy, my people in Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	He has sent your enemy away.
ZEP.3.15	I, the King of Israel, am with you!
ZEP.3.15	The bad times have gone.
ZEP.3.15	They will not happen again!
ZEP.3.16	On that special day, this will be my message for Jerusalem.
ZEP.3.16	‘Do not be afraid now! Do not be weak now!
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	He is strong. He will save you.
ZEP.3.17	He will be very happy about you!
ZEP.3.17	He will quietly love you.
ZEP.3.17	He will sing, because he is so happy about you!
ZEP.3.18	I will bring together those people among you who want to meet together again.
ZEP.3.18	You want to meet again to pray. And you want to meet again to 
ZEP.3.18	You have had enough cruel words from your enemies.
ZEP.3.19	Look! At that time, I will 
ZEP.3.19	all those people who hurt you.
ZEP.3.19	I will save those who cannot walk well.
ZEP.3.19	I will bring back the people that the enemy has sent away.
ZEP.3.19	I will cause people in every country to know about you. I will cause them to 
ZEP.3.20	At that time, I will bring you back to your home.
ZEP.3.20	I will bring you back together.
ZEP.3.20	I will give you a good name among all the people on the earth.
ZEP.3.20	That is what I will do. I will stop your troubles. And you will see it happen.’
ZEP.3.20	That is what the 
HAG.1.1+HAG.1.2	Darius was a king. He was the king of a country called Persia. He had been king for 1 year and 5 months. On the first day of the next month, the 
HAG.1.3	So Haggai, the 
HAG.1.4	This was the 
HAG.1.5	But think about what has happened to you. 
HAG.1.6	You plant seeds but not many plants grow. You never have enough food to eat. You drink but you are still 
HAG.1.7	Think about what has happened to you!
HAG.1.8	And now, get wood from the hills to build my 
HAG.1.9	You thought that many food plants would grow in your fields. But only a few plants grew and that disappointed you. And when you brought your food to your home, I destroyed it. You may ask why I have done this. I did it because your first thought was to build your own houses. But your first thought should have been to build my 
HAG.1.10	That is why your fields are dry. That is why your plants do not grow. 
HAG.1.11	I have stopped the rains so that nothing will grow. Your plants will not grow. Your cows will not have enough grass to eat. Your 
HAG.1.12	Some years before this, the people had returned to live in their own country. Zerubbabel and Joshua had returned with them. (Zerubbabel was Shealtiel's son. Joshua was the 
HAG.1.13	Haggai was the 
HAG.1.14	So the 
HAG.1.15	And so the work began on the 24th day of that same month. Darius had been king for more than 1 year and 5 months. 
HAG.2.1	On the 21st day of the next month, the 
HAG.2.2	The 
HAG.2.3	‘Some of the people will remember that my 
HAG.2.4	But now, be strong and brave, Zerubbabel! And be strong and brave, Joshua, 
HAG.2.5	‘A long time ago, my people returned to their own country from Egypt. I promised them then that I would be with them. And I was with them. I will be with you, too. So, do not be afraid. And do not think that the work will be too difficult for you. My Spirit will stay here among you.
HAG.2.6	Soon, people will see that I am a powerful God. Soon, I will cause the skies and the earth to move. I will cause the sea and the land to move. 
HAG.2.7	I will cause people in many countries to be afraid. They will come to your country and they will bring with them valuable gifts. And I will make my

HAG.2.18	Today, the 24th day of the 9th month, you have started to build my 
HAG.2.19	You have not yet picked any seeds or

ZEC.4.10	Everyone should know that the day of small things is important.
ZEC.4.10	Men will see Zerubbabel. Then they will sing and they will be happy. They will see him with a line in his hand to measure the walls.
ZEC.4.10	The 
ZEC.4.11	Then I said to the 
ZEC.4.12	A second time I spoke to the 
ZEC.4.13	The 
ZEC.4.13	‘No, my 
ZEC.4.14	So the 
ZEC.5.1	Again, I looked and I saw a large paper. It was moving through the air. There were many words on the paper.
ZEC.5.2	The 
ZEC.5.3	Then the 
ZEC.5.4	The 
ZEC.5.5	Then the 
ZEC.5.6	I said, ‘What is it?’
ZEC.5.6	He said, ‘It is a basket that people measure with.’ Then he said, ‘It is the

ZEC.5.8	The 
ZEC.5.9	Then I looked up and I saw two women. They flew towards me with strong

ZEC.5.11	The 
ZEC.6.1	Again I looked up and I saw 4 
ZEC.6.2	The first 
ZEC.6.3	The third 
ZEC.6.4	Then I spoke to the 
ZEC.6.5	The 
ZEC.6.6	The 
ZEC.6.7	When the strong horses came out, they were in a hurry to leave. The 
ZEC.6.8	Then the 
ZEC.6.9	The 
ZEC.6.10	‘Three men have arrived from 
ZEC.6.11	Take the gold and other valuable metal and make a

ZEC.6.14	They will put the 
ZEC.6.15	People will come a long way and they will help to build the house of the 
ZEC.7.1	The 
ZEC.7.2	Then the people in Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech and their men to 
ZEC.7.3	They came to the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	The 
ZEC.7.5	He said, ‘Say this to all the people in this country and to the 
ZEC.7.6	You ate and you drank. But you ate and you drank for yourselves. 
ZEC.7.7	These are the words that I, the 
ZEC.7.8	The 
ZEC.7.9	‘The 
ZEC.7.10	Be kind to a woman after the death of her husband. Be kind to a child after the death of his father. Be kind to strangers and to poor people. Do not think bad thoughts against your brother.”
ZEC.7.11	But the people would not listen and they turned away. They put their hands over their ears, because they did not want to hear. 
ZEC.7.12	They decided that they would not listen to God's rules or to the messages from the 
ZEC.7.13	When I spoke to them, they did not listen. So when they prayed to me, I did not listen to them’, says the 
ZEC.7.14	‘As a storm takes things away, I took my people away to strange countries. The country that they left became an empty country. Nobody lived in it. That is how they made the good country an empty country.’
ZEC.8.1	The 
ZEC.8.2	‘I have wanted to help 
ZEC.8.3	‘
ZEC.8.4	The 
ZEC.8.5	Many boys and girls will play in the streets of the city again.’
ZEC.8.6	‘This may seem impossible to the few people that remain’, says the 
ZEC.8.7	‘I will bring my people back from the east country and from the west country’, says the 
ZEC.8.8	‘I will bring them back to live in 
ZEC.8.9	The 
ZEC.8.10	Before that time, there was not enough money to pay for work that men or animals did. No man was safe from the enemy because I made all men angry with each other.’
ZEC.8.11	‘But now it is different. I will not be angry with the few people that have returned’, says the 
ZEC.8.12	‘The seeds and the plants will grow well. The trees will give fruit. There will be water from the skies. I will 
ZEC.8.13	In past years, people from other countries have said bad things against you,

ZEC.8.15	‘Do not be afraid. I have now decided to do good things to 
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that you should do. Speak true words to each other. Leaders, be fair to all people. 
ZEC.8.17	Do not think to do bad things against other people. Do not use my name to promise things and then not do those things. All these things make me very angry.’
ZEC.8.18	Again Zechariah the 
ZEC.8.19	‘On special days in the year you eat no food. Those days are in the 4th, 5th, 7th and 10th months. But I want you to enjoy those days’, says the 
ZEC.8.20	‘People that live in many countries will come to 
ZEC.8.21	‘The people from one city will go the people in another city. They will say, “Come with us to

ZEC.9.1	The 
ZEC.9.1	The 
ZEC.9.2	The 
ZEC.9.3	Tyre's people have built strong walls to keep enemies out.
ZEC.9.3	They have swept up rich metals like dirt.
ZEC.9.3	They have swept up gold like dirt in the streets.
ZEC.9.4	The 
ZEC.9.4	And he will remove their ships from the sea.
ZEC.9.4	Fire will burn every part of the city.
ZEC.9.5	The people in Ashkelon city will see it and they will be afraid.
ZEC.9.5	The people in Gaza city will see it and they will be afraid.
ZEC.9.5	The things that the people in Ekron city hope for will not happen.
ZEC.9.5	The king of Gaza will die
ZEC.9.5	and there will be no people in Ashkelon any longer.
ZEC.9.6	Foreign people will live in Ashdod city.
ZEC.9.6	I will show the 
ZEC.9.7	I will take the blood from their mouths.
ZEC.9.7	I will take the food from their teeth, because it is bad food.
ZEC.9.7	Those that remain will still be my people.
ZEC.9.7	They will become leaders in 
ZEC.9.7	Ekron will be like a part of 
ZEC.9.8	Then I will keep my house safe against my enemies.
ZEC.9.8	No army will ever again beat my people,
ZEC.9.8	because I am watching them.
ZEC.9.9	Sing loudly, people in 
ZEC.9.9	Shout, people in 
ZEC.9.9	Look! Your king comes to you.
ZEC.9.9	He will save you because he does everything well.
ZEC.9.9	But he is quiet and he is riding on a 
ZEC.9.9	He will ride on a young animal. Its mother is a 
ZEC.9.10	I will take away the 
ZEC.9.10	and the horses of war from 
ZEC.9.10	The bows of war will be broken.
ZEC.9.10	He will speak to all the countries and wars will finish.
ZEC.9.10	He will rule from sea to sea. He will rule from the river Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	But I made a promise to you. I made that promise true with blood. I will free your people that are in a prison, in deep dark holes without water.
ZEC.9.12	All you people who hoped to see your own country again, return to 
ZEC.9.12	I tell you this now: I will give back to you twice as much as you have lost.
ZEC.9.13	I will use 
ZEC.9.13	I will use you, men from 
ZEC.9.13	I will make you like the long metal knife of a soldier.
ZEC.9.14	Then the 
ZEC.9.14	His 
ZEC.9.14	The 
ZEC.9.14	He will march in the storms from the south.
ZEC.9.15	And the 
ZEC.9.15	They will beat the stones that their enemies throw at them.
ZEC.9.15	When they go to war, they will shout.
ZEC.9.15	They will shout like men
ZEC.9.15	who have drunk too much 
ZEC.9.15	They will be as full of 
ZEC.9.15	This is the dish filled with the blood of animals in the house of God. The 
ZEC.9.16	On that day, the 
ZEC.9.16	They are his people.
ZEC.9.16	They will shine in his country
ZEC.9.16	like beautiful stones that shine in a 
ZEC.9.17	The people will be beautiful and good.
ZEC.9.17	The young people will become strong
ZEC.9.17	when they eat good bread.
ZEC.9.17	The young women will become strong
ZEC.9.17	when they drink new

ZEC.10.1	It is the 
ZEC.10.1	He gives the rain to men.
ZEC.10.1	He gives the plants of the field to everyone.
ZEC.10.2	People ask 
ZEC.10.2	but the 
ZEC.10.2	Some people explain what a dream means.
ZEC.10.2	But they do not speak true words.
ZEC.10.2	The help that they give is not good.
ZEC.10.2	So the people move from place to place like sheep.
ZEC.10.2	They are not safe. They have no leaders.
ZEC.10.3	‘I am angry with the leaders.
ZEC.10.3	I will cause them to be sorry.
ZEC.10.3	I will make them as strong as horses that are ready for war.
ZEC.10.4	From 
ZEC.10.4	A strong leader will come from 
ZEC.10.4	A strong soldier will come from 
ZEC.10.4	Every ruler will come from 
ZEC.10.5	Together they will be like strong soldiers

ZEC.10.6	I will make 
ZEC.10.6	and I will make 
ZEC.10.6	I will bring them back to me,
ZEC.10.6	because I am sorry for them.
ZEC.10.6	I am their God
ZEC.10.6	and I will answer them.
ZEC.10.6	It will be as if I had never turned away from them.
ZEC.10.7	They will be as happy as men that drink 
ZEC.10.7	Their children will see their happy fathers
ZEC.10.7	and so the children will be happy.
ZEC.10.7	They will sing to the 
ZEC.10.8	I will cause my people to come to me and I will bring them all together.
ZEC.10.8	I will buy them and I will make them free people.
ZEC.10.8	And there will be as many people as there were before.
ZEC.10.9	I will send them to foreign countries among foreign people.
ZEC.10.9	But, in these far countries, they will remember me.
ZEC.10.9	They and their children will not die.
ZEC.10.9	They will return to 
ZEC.10.10	I will bring my people back from Egypt
ZEC.10.10	and I will bring them here together from Assyria.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them to Gilead and to Lebanon.
ZEC.10.10	There will not be enough room for them all.
ZEC.10.11	And he will come to the difficult sea.
ZEC.10.11	But it will be no trouble to him.
ZEC.10.11	He will stop the 
ZEC.10.11	He will make the river Nile dry.
ZEC.10.11	the power of Egypt's people will finish.’ 
ZEC.10.12	‘I will make my people strong.
ZEC.10.12	They will obey me because they love my name.’
ZEC.11.1	Open your gates, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	so that the fires can burn down your 
ZEC.11.2	Cry aloud, 
ZEC.11.2	Enemies have cut down the tall and beautiful trees.
ZEC.11.2	Cry aloud, 
ZEC.11.2	because they have cut down the thick forest.
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the 
ZEC.11.3	because enemies have destroyed their fields.
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the noise of the 
ZEC.11.3	because the wood along the river Jordan
ZEC.11.3	is no longer there. 
ZEC.11.4	This is what the 
ZEC.11.5	Those men who buy the sheep will kill them. Nobody will 
ZEC.11.6	The 
ZEC.11.7	So I was a good 
ZEC.11.8	In one month, I sent away three 
ZEC.11.9	I said to the sheep, ‘I will not be your 
ZEC.11.10	I took ‘
ZEC.11.11	On the day that the 
ZEC.11.12	I said to them, ‘You may think that I should have some money for my work. If you do think that, pay me my money. If you do not want to pay me, keep it.’ So they paid me 30 
ZEC.11.13	The 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke the second stick called ‘Together’. I made the country called 
ZEC.11.15	Then the 
ZEC.11.16	I have chosen a man to watch the sheep. He will not help the sheep that are dying. He will not look for the sheep that have gone away. He will not help the sick sheep or feed the strong sheep. He will eat the meat of the fat sheep. He will tear off their feet to get all the meat.
ZEC.11.17	Bad things will happen to the bad 
ZEC.11.17	His enemy's knife will cut his arm and his right eye.
ZEC.11.17	His arm will become like a dry stick. And his right eye will no longer be able to see anything.’
ZEC.12.1	This is the 
ZEC.12.2	‘I will frighten the enemies that live round 
ZEC.12.3	There will be a time when all the countries of the earth will be ready to attack 
ZEC.12.4	On that day’, says the 
ZEC.12.5	Then the leaders of

ZEC.12.11	On that day, people will weep loudly in 
ZEC.12.12	All the people will weep. Each

ZEC.12.14	And all the families that have not died will weep by themselves. And their wives will weep by themselves.’
ZEC.13.1	‘On that day, something will be like water that comes up from the ground. And it will clean away the 
ZEC.13.2	On that day, I will remove the names of false gods from the country’, says the 
ZEC.13.3	And if anyone appears as a

ZEC.13.7	says the 
ZEC.13.7	‘Kill the

ZEC.13.8	In the whole country’, says the 
ZEC.13.8	‘two thirds of the people will die.
ZEC.13.8	But one third will still be living there.
ZEC.13.9	I will bring these people through fire.
ZEC.13.9	As men clean 
ZEC.13.9	As men 
ZEC.13.9	They will speak my name and I will answer them.
ZEC.13.9	I will say, “They are my people.”

MAT.2.6	“People who live in Bethlehem,
MAT.2.6	your town is a very important town in Judea.
MAT.2.6	A person born in your town will become a leader of my people 
MAT.2.6	He will lead my people like a

MAT.2.8	Then Herod sent the men to Bethlehem. He said to them, ‘Go and look everywhere for this child. When you find him, come back here and tell me where he is. Then I can also go and 
MAT.2.9+MAT.2.10	After the men had heard the king, they left to go to Bethlehem. They could see the same star that they had seen before. They were very happy when they saw the star. It moved along in front of them. Then it stopped above the place where the child was staying. 
MAT.2.11	The men went into the house and they saw the child. He was with Mary, his mother. They went down on their knees in front of the child and they 
MAT.2.12	After that, God said to them in a dream, ‘Do not go back to see Herod again.’ So the men followed a different road to return to their own country. 
MAT.2.13	After the men had gone away, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, he saw one of the 
MAT.2.14	So Joseph got up and he took the child and his mother with him. They started on the journey to Egypt that night. 
MAT.2.15	They all remained in Egypt until Herod died. This happened so that the words of the 
MAT.2.16	When the 
MAT.2.17	In this way, these words that God's 
MAT.2.18	‘People heard a noise in Ramah.
MAT.2.18	They heard someone weeping with a loud voice.
MAT.2.18	It is Rachel and she is crying for her children.
MAT.2.18	Her children are dead.
MAT.2.18	Nobody can help her to feel better.’
MAT.2.19	After Herod died, Joseph had a dream in Egypt. In the dream he saw one of the 
MAT.2.20	The 
MAT.2.21	So Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother and they travelled to 
MAT.2.22	But then Joseph heard that Herod's son, Archelaus, was now king of Judea instead of his father. So Joseph was afraid to go to Judea. In another dream God showed Joseph that he should go to Galilee instead. 
MAT.2.23	Joseph went there and made his home in a town called Nazareth. Long ago God's 
MAT.3.1	While Jesus still lived in Nazareth, a man called John the 
MAT.3.2	He told people, ‘You have done many wrong things. You must turn away from them and change how you live. Do this now, because the 
MAT.3.3	God's 
MAT.3.3	‘Somebody's voice is shouting in the 
MAT.3.3	“The 
MAT.3.3	Make the paths straight for him.” ’ 
MAT.3.4	John wore clothes made from the hair of a 
MAT.3.5	Many people went to listen to John. They lived in Jerusalem and all over the country called Judea and many other places near the river Jordan. 
MAT.3.6	The people told God about all the wrong things that they had done. Then John 
MAT.3.7	Many 
MAT.3.8	You have to show that you are sorry. Change how you live. Stop doing things that God does not like. 
MAT.3.9	Do not say to yourselves, “We are in the family of Abraham. God will surely not 
MAT.3.10	You are like trees that have bad fruit. God has an axe ready to use. He will cut down every tree that does not make good fruit. He will throw those trees into the fire.’ 
MAT.3.11	‘I

MAT.3.13	Then Jesus went from Galilee to the river Jordan. He wanted John to 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to change Jesus' mind. He said to Jesus, ‘I should ask you to 
MAT.3.15	Jesus replied, ‘This time, do what I ask you to do. We must do everything correctly, as God wants it.’ So John did what Jesus asked him to do.
MAT.3.16	When John 
MAT.3.17	Then a voice spoke from 
MAT.4.1	Then the 
MAT.4.2	Jesus did not eat anything for 40 days and 40 nights. At the end of this time, he was very hungry.
MAT.4.3	Then the 
MAT.4.4	But Jesus replied, ‘No! The Bible says that food alone cannot cause people to live. They need to hear every word that God speaks. Then they can really live.’ 
MAT.4.5	Then the 
MAT.4.6	He said to Jesus, ‘If you are the 
MAT.4.6	“God will tell his 
MAT.4.6	They will hold you safely in their hands.
MAT.4.6	They will not let you hurt your foot on a stone”.’ 
MAT.4.7	Jesus replied, ‘No! The Bible also says, “Do not do a foolish thing to see if your

MAT.4.9	The 
MAT.4.10	Jesus then said to him, ‘Satan, go away from me! The Bible says, “Only 
MAT.4.11	Then the 
MAT.4.12	Then Jesus heard that Herod had put John the 
MAT.4.13	But he did not stay in Nazareth. He went to live in Capernaum, which is a town on the shore of Lake Galilee. It was in the part of 
MAT.4.14	This caused God's message to become true. Long ago God had said through his 
MAT.4.15	‘I am speaking to you people who live in Zebulun and Naphtali.
MAT.4.15	Your part of this country is on the way to Lake Galilee.
MAT.4.15	It is across the River Jordan in the part of the country called Galilee.
MAT.4.15	Some people who are not 
MAT.4.16	They are like people who are living in the dark.
MAT.4.16	They live in the shadow which death brings.
MAT.4.16	God will send a light to shine on them.’ 
MAT.4.17	Then Jesus began to speak God's message to people. He said, ‘You have done many wrong things. You must turn away from them and change how you live. Do this now, because the 
MAT.4.18	One day, Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. He saw two men who were brothers. One man was called Simon, and he was also called Peter. His brother's name was Andrew. Their job was to catch fish. They were throwing their 
MAT.4.19	Jesus said to them, ‘Come with me and be my 
MAT.4.20	Simon and Andrew immediately put their 
MAT.4.21	They continued to walk along the shore. Soon Jesus saw two more men who were brothers. They were called James and John. They were in their boat with their father, Zebedee. They were mending their 
MAT.4.22	The brothers immediately left the boat and their father behind. They went with Jesus to be his 
MAT.4.23	Jesus travelled everywhere in Galilee. He taught the people in the 
MAT.4.24	People in all parts of Syria began to hear about Jesus more and more. So they brought all the sick people to see him. These people had many different illnesses, and some of them had strong pains. Bad 
MAT.4.25	Because of this, large crowds of people followed him. They came from Galilee and from the towns called 'The 10 cities'. Some of them came from Jerusalem, and other parts of Judea. And some came from the other side of the River Jordan. 
MAT.5.1	Jesus saw that crowds of people were following him. So he went up a hill and he sat down there to teach them. His 
MAT.5.2	He began to teach them. This is what he said:
MAT.5.3	‘Happy are the people who know that they need God very much. The 
MAT.5.4	Happy are the people who are sad now. God will come close to help them. 
MAT.5.5	Happy are the people who are kind. The whole earth will belong to them.
MAT.5.6	Happy are the people who want to obey God, as much as they want to eat food. God will give to them everything that they need.
MAT.5.7	Happy are the people who help other people and who 
MAT.5.8	Happy are the people who have only good thoughts. They will come near to God and see him.
MAT.5.9	Happy are the people who bring people together to be friends. God will call them his children.
MAT.5.10	Happy are the people who obey God and then other people hurt them because of it. The 
MAT.5.11	Yes, happy are you when people say bad things against you because you believe in me. Or they may hurt you. Or they may say things about you that are not true. 
MAT.5.12	God is preparing many good things for you in 
MAT.5.13	Jesus said, ‘You are like salt for all people to taste and use. Salt is good. But if it is not salty any more, you cannot make it salty again. It is not good for people to use for anything. They just throw it away and they walk on it.
MAT.5.14	You are like a light for everybody in this world. If people build a city on a hill, then other people can see it easily. 
MAT.5.15	Nobody lights a 
MAT.5.16	You must be sure that your light shines well. Then you will give light to other people. They will see all the good things that you do. Then they will 
MAT.5.17	Jesus said, ‘You should not think that I have come to destroy God's 
MAT.5.18	I tell you this. One day, even the earth and the sky will finish. But while they remain, God's 
MAT.5.19	A person may choose not to obey a rule in God's 
MAT.5.20	I tell you this. You must always do what is right. You must live in a way that is better than the teachers of God's 
MAT.5.21	Jesus went on to say, ‘You know the rule that God gave to your 
MAT.5.22	But what I now say to you is this: Anybody who is angry with his brother will have to stand in front of a 
MAT.5.23	Maybe you go to 
MAT.5.24	You must leave your gift there in front of God's 
MAT.5.25	Also, somebody may say that you have done something wrong against him. He may take you to stand in front of the 
MAT.5.26	It is true. You will remain in prison until you have paid all the money, even the last small coin.’ 
MAT.5.27	Jesus went on to say, ‘You know what God's rule says: “You must not have sex with anyone who is not your husband or your wife.” 
MAT.5.28	But what I tell you is this. A man may look at a woman who is not his wife. And he may want to have sex with her. I tell you that this man has also done a wrong thing. It is the same as if has really had sex with her in his thoughts. 
MAT.5.29	If your right eye leads you to do wrong things, then you should take it out. You should throw it away. Yes, you will lose one eye. But it will be much worse if you keep your whole body and God throws you into 
MAT.5.30	Also, if your right hand leads you to do wrong things, then you should cut it off. You should throw it away. You will lose one hand. But it will be much worse if you keep your body in one piece and go to 
MAT.5.31	‘God's 
MAT.5.32	But what I tell you is this. If a man's wife has had sex with another man, he may send her away. But if he sends her away for any other reason, he has done a wrong thing. It is like he is making her have sex with another man. Also, if a woman has left her husband, another man must not marry her. That is the same as if he had sex with another man's wife.’
MAT.5.33	‘You also know the rule that God gave to your 
MAT.5.34	But what I tell you is this. Do not use any name to make a promise stronger. Do not use the words “by 
MAT.5.35	Do not use the words “by Jerusalem” to make a promise stronger. Jerusalem is God's city. He is the great King who rules from there. 
MAT.5.36	Do not use the words “by my head” to make a promise. You cannot make the colour of even one of your hairs black or white. 
MAT.5.37	Instead, when you make a promise, you should say only “Yes, I will do it.” Or you should say only “No, I will not do it.” If you say anything more than this, what you say is bad. It comes from 
MAT.5.38	Jesus went on to say, ‘You also know that God's 
MAT.5.39	But what I tell you is this. If somebody does something bad to you, don't do anything against him. Somebody may slap you on one side of your face. Then you should let him slap the other side of your face also. 
MAT.5.40	Maybe somebody wants to take you to the 
MAT.5.41	Or a soldier may tell you, “Carry my luggage for one mile.” You should do that. Even agree to carry it for two miles. 
MAT.5.42	When people ask you for something, you should give it to them. If they ask you to lend them something, then you should not refuse.
MAT.5.43	You have heard people say, “Love the people who are your friends. But 
MAT.5.44	What I tell you is this. You should love the people who want to hurt you. If people want to give you pain, pray for them. Pray that God would help them. 
MAT.5.45	If you live like this, you will show that you really are children of your Father above. God is kind to everyone. He causes the sun to shine on everyone, both good people and bad people. He also causes the rain to fall on everyone, people who obey him and people who do not obey him. 
MAT.5.46	Do you only love people who love you? God will not give you good things just for doing that. Even the men who take 
MAT.5.47	If you are only kind to your friends, then you are not doing anything special. Even people who do not believe in God do that. 
MAT.5.48	So you must be good in every way, as your Father above is good in every way.’
MAT.6.1	Jesus went on to say to them, ‘You should do good things to help people. But be careful that you do not just want other people to see you. If you want other people to 
MAT.6.2	When you give something to a poor person, do not tell anyone about it. The 
MAT.6.3	So, when you give something to a poor person, keep it a secret from other people. Do not tell anyone. Your left hand will not even know what your right hand does! 
MAT.6.4	Nobody else will know about the good thing that you have done. But God sees the things that you do secretly. In return, he will give you good things.’
MAT.6.5	‘Also, you must not pray in the way that the 
MAT.6.6	But this is how you should pray. Go to a place in your house where you can be alone. You can shut the door and you can pray to God your Father. He is in that secret place. He sees what you do there. He will give you good things in return. 
MAT.6.7	When you pray, do not say the same words many times. People who do not believe in God do that. They use many words that mean nothing. They think that when they pray like that, their gods will hear them. 
MAT.6.8	Do not pray like they do. God your Father already knows what you need. He knows this even before you ask him.
MAT.6.9	So, this is how you should pray:
MAT.6.9	“God our Father who is in 
MAT.6.9	You are great. We want people to 
MAT.6.10	We want the day when you rule everyone to come soon.
MAT.6.10	We want everyone to obey you on earth, like everyone in 
MAT.6.11	Please give us the food that we need today.
MAT.6.12	We have 
MAT.6.12	In the same way, please 
MAT.6.13	Do not let us agree to do wrong things.
MAT.6.13	Keep us safe from 
MAT.6.14	Then Jesus said, ‘When other people do wrong things against you, you must 
MAT.6.15	But if you do not 
MAT.6.16	Jesus went on to say, ‘You may decide not to eat for some time. But do not look sad so that people know you are doing a special thing. 
MAT.6.17	But when you stop eating for some time, you should wash your face. Make your hair look nice. 
MAT.6.18	Then other people will not know that you are doing a special thing. But God, your Father, will know. You don't see him but he sees what you do secretly. He will give you good things in return.’ 
MAT.6.19	‘Do not want to have many valuable things here in the world. Insects or water can destroy those kinds of things. Or people may come into your house and they can rob you of those things. 
MAT.6.20	Instead, you should want to have valuable things in 
MAT.6.21	Then you will be thinking a lot about 
MAT.6.22	Your eyes are like 
MAT.6.23	If your eyes are not good, then your whole body will be in the dark. If even the light in you has become dark, you will be living in a very dark place.’ 
MAT.6.24	Jesus said, ‘Nobody can work as a slave for two masters at the same time. Maybe he will 
MAT.6.25	So, I tell you this. Do not be thinking all the time about how to stay alive. Do not have trouble in your mind about the food and drink that you need. Do not always be thinking about the clothes that you need to wear. Your life is more important than the food that you eat. Your body is more important than your clothes. 
MAT.6.26	Think about the wild birds. They do not plant seeds in the ground. They do not cut down plants to eat. They have no buildings to store food. But God, your Father in 
MAT.6.27	Even if you are always thinking about your life, you cannot make it go on any longer, not even by one hour!
MAT.6.28	You should not have trouble in your mind about your clothes. Think about how the wild flowers grow. They do not work or make clothes for themselves. 
MAT.6.29	But I tell you this. Even one wild flower is more beautiful than King Solomon was. And King Solomon wore the most beautiful clothes. 
MAT.6.30	It is God that gives beautiful clothes even to the grass. One day the grass is growing in the field, but the next day people will cut it and burn it. God will certainly take 
MAT.6.31	So, do not have trouble in your mind about these things. Do not always say, “What will we eat?”, or “What will we drink?”, or “What will we wear?” 
MAT.6.32	People who do not know God are always thinking about these things. But as for you, your Father in 
MAT.6.33	Instead, always think about the things that are important in the 
MAT.6.34	So do not have trouble in your mind about what might happen tomorrow. Tomorrow will have its own problems. It is enough for you to be thinking each day about the problems of that day.’
MAT.7.1	Jesus went on to say, ‘Do not say to anybody, “You are a bad person.” If you do that, God will say to you, “You are a bad person.” 
MAT.7.2	God will think about you in the same way that you think about other people. He will use the same rules for you as you use for other people.
MAT.7.3	Perhaps you want to tell your friend about his little mistake. If you want to do that, first remember your own bigger mistakes. 
MAT.7.4	You are like a person who has a big piece of wood in his eye. But then he says to his friend, “Let me take that little piece of dirt out of your eye for you.” 
MAT.7.5	Do not be like that person. You think that you are better than your friend. But you are not. First, you must take the big piece of wood out of your own eye. After that, your eyes will see clearly. Then you can take the small piece of dirt out of your friend's eye. 
MAT.7.6	Do not give special things that are for God to dogs. The dogs will turn round and attack you. Do not throw valuable things to pigs. The pigs will only stand on them and bury them in the dirt.’ 
MAT.7.7	Jesus said, ‘Go on asking God for what you need. Then God will give it to you. Go on looking for what you need. Then you will find it. Go on knocking at the door, and God will open it for you. 
MAT.7.8	Everyone who asks for something will receive it. Everyone who looks for something will find it. God will open the door for everyone who knocks on it.
MAT.7.9	Some of you are fathers. If your son asks you for some bread, you would not give him a stone. 
MAT.7.10	If he asks you for a fish, you would not give him a snake. 
MAT.7.11	You may be bad, but even you know how to give good things to your children. Your Father in 
MAT.7.12	So, do the good things for other people that you would want them to do for you. That is true in everything you do. That is what God's 
MAT.7.13	‘Go in through the narrow gate to get true life. The wide gate is easy to go through. The wide path is easy to travel on. Many people find that wide gate, but it is the way to 
MAT.7.14	It is difficult to go through the small gate. It is difficult to walk on the narrow road. But when you do go that way, you will get true life. Not many people find that narrow gate.’
MAT.7.15	‘Some people say that they are 
MAT.7.16	You will know these people by the way that they live. It is like their fruit. 
MAT.7.17	Good fruit grows on a tree that is good. Bad fruit grows on a tree that is not good. 
MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot make bad fruit. A bad tree cannot make good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	A farmer will cut down any tree that does not make good fruit. He will burn it on a fire. 
MAT.7.20	In the same way, look at the way people live. Then you will know what they are really like.
MAT.7.21	Some people say to me, “Master, Master!” But not all of them will come into the 
MAT.7.22	On the day when God 
MAT.7.23	But I will say to these people, “I really never knew you. You do not obey God. You are bad. So go away from me.” ’
MAT.7.24	Jesus went on to say, ‘Some people listen to my message and they obey it. Those people are like a wise man who built his house on rock. 
MAT.7.25	Then a storm came with a lot of rain and wind. The rivers rose up high. Strong winds blew hard against that house. But the house did not fall down because the man had built it on rock. 
MAT.7.26	Other people listen to my message but they do not obey it. Those people are like a fool who built his house on sand. 
MAT.7.27	Then a storm came with a lot of rain and wind. The rivers rose up high. Strong winds blew hard against the house. That house fell down. The storm destroyed it completely.’ 
MAT.7.28	Jesus finished speaking. The crowds of people were very surprised at the things that he taught them. 
MAT.7.29	When Jesus taught them, he showed his authority. That was not like the way that the teachers of God's 
MAT.8.1	Jesus came down from the hill and a large crowd followed him. 
MAT.8.2	A man with a bad illness of the skin came to meet him. He went down on his knees in front of Jesus and he said, ‘Sir, if you want, you can make me well again. Please do it.’
MAT.8.3	Jesus put out his hand towards him and he touched him. ‘I do want to help you. Be clean again,’ Jesus said. Immediately, the man's skin was clean again. 
MAT.8.4	Jesus said to the man, ‘Listen. You must not tell anyone about this. Instead, go and show yourself to the 
MAT.8.5	Jesus went into Capernaum. An officer in the 
MAT.8.6	‘Sir,’ he said, ‘My servant is lying in bed at home. He cannot move his legs and he has a lot of pain.’
MAT.8.7	Jesus said to the officer, ‘I will go with you to your house and I will make your servant well again.’
MAT.8.8	But the officer answered, ‘Sir, I am not good enough for you to come into my house. Instead, just say that my servant will get better. I know that he will then be well again. 
MAT.8.9	In my work, someone has authority over me. I also have authority over other soldiers. I say to one soldier, “Go!” and he goes. I say to another one, “Come!” and he comes. I say to my servant, “Do this!” and he does it.’
MAT.8.10	Jesus heard what the officer said. He was very surprised. He spoke to the crowd that was following him. ‘I tell you this. I have never found anybody like this man in all of 
MAT.8.11	I tell you, many people will come from all over the world to take their place in the 
MAT.8.12	But other people who think that God's 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said to the officer, ‘Go home. You believed that I would make your servant well again. So I will do it for you.’ At that moment, the servant did become well again.
MAT.8.14	Jesus went into Peter's house. There, he saw the mother of Peter's wife. She was lying in bed. She was ill and her body was very hot. 
MAT.8.15	Jesus touched her hand and immediately she was well again. So, she got up and she prepared food for Jesus.
MAT.8.16	That evening, people brought to Jesus many people who were ill. Many of them had bad 
MAT.8.17	Jesus did this so that the words of the 
MAT.8.17	‘He took away everything that makes us weak.
MAT.8.17	He carried away everything that makes us ill.’
MAT.8.18	One day, Jesus saw a large crowd of people round him. So he told his 
MAT.8.19	A teacher of God's 
MAT.8.20	Jesus replied, ‘Wild animals and birds have their own places to live. But I, the 
MAT.8.21	Another man who was one of Jesus' 
MAT.8.22	Jesus said to him, ‘No! You must come with me now. Let those people who are dead themselves bury their own dead people.’ 
MAT.8.23	Then Jesus got into a boat. His 
MAT.8.24	Immediately a great storm began to blow across the lake. Water began to go into the boat and fill it. Jesus was sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	The 
MAT.8.26	Jesus said to them, ‘You should not be so afraid. You should 
MAT.8.27	The 
MAT.8.28	Jesus arrived at the other side of Lake Galilee. He came to a place where the Gadarene people lived. Two men who had bad 
MAT.8.29	When the two men saw Jesus, they immediately shouted at him, ‘You are the 
MAT.8.30	A large group of pigs was eating there, not very far away. 
MAT.8.31	The bad 
MAT.8.32	Jesus said to the bad 
MAT.8.33	When this happened, the men who took 
MAT.8.34	So everybody came out of the town to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they said, ‘Please go away. Leave our part of the country.’
MAT.9.1	Then Jesus got back into the boat. He sailed across to the other side of the lake again. He went to Capernaum, the town where he was living.
MAT.9.2	Some men came to see Jesus there. They carried with them a man who could not walk or move his legs. He was lying on a 
MAT.9.3	Then some teachers of God's 
MAT.9.4	Jesus knew what the teachers were thinking. So he said to them, ‘You should not think these bad things in your minds. 
MAT.9.5	I said to this man, “I 
MAT.9.6	But I want you to know this. I, the 
MAT.9.7	So then the man stood up and he went home. 
MAT.9.8	The crowds of people saw what had happened. They were very surprised and afraid. They saw that God had given so much authority to men. So they 
MAT.9.9	Jesus went away from that place. While he walked, he saw a man called Matthew. His job was to take 
MAT.9.10	Later, Jesus went to eat a meal in Matthew's house. Many bad people and men who took 
MAT.9.11	Some 
MAT.9.12	Jesus heard what the 
MAT.9.13	Go and study what it says in the Bible. God says there, “I want people to be kind to each other. I do not just want them to offer 
MAT.9.14	Then the 
MAT.9.15	Jesus answered them: ‘When a man marries, his friends cannot be sad. They cannot refuse to eat food while he is with them. But there will be a time when people will take the man away from his friends. At that time his friends will stop eating food.’ 
MAT.9.16	Then Jesus said, ‘Nobody uses a piece of new cloth to mend an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will cause the old cloth to tear again. It will make a bigger hole than before.
MAT.9.17	Nobody pours new 
MAT.9.18	While Jesus was saying these things to the people, a leader at the 
MAT.9.19	So Jesus went with the man. His 
MAT.9.20	There was a sick woman in the crowd. She had lost blood for 12 years. She came close behind Jesus and she touched the edge of his coat. 
MAT.9.21	The woman thought, ‘Even if I only touch his coat, I will become well again.’
MAT.9.22	Jesus turned round and he saw the woman. He said to her, ‘Young woman, do not be afraid. You are now well again because you believed in me.’ And immediately the woman became well again.
MAT.9.23	Then Jesus arrived at the 
MAT.9.24	When Jesus saw this, he said to everybody in the house, ‘Go outside. This girl is not dead. She is only sleeping.’ The people 
MAT.9.25	The family sent all the people out of the house. Jesus went inside and he held the girl's hand. Immediately she stood up. 
MAT.9.26	People in all that part of the country heard about what had happened.
MAT.9.27	Jesus left the house. While he walked along, two 
MAT.9.28	Jesus went into a house and the 
MAT.9.29	So Jesus touched the men's eyes. He said to them, ‘Because you believed in me, you will now see again.’ 
MAT.9.30	Then immediately the men could see again. Jesus said strongly to them, ‘You must not tell anybody about this.’ 
MAT.9.31	So the men went away. But they told everybody in that part of the country all about what Jesus had done for them.
MAT.9.32	While those two men were leaving, some people brought another man to Jesus. This man could not speak because of a bad 
MAT.9.33	Jesus made the bad 
MAT.9.34	But the 
MAT.9.35	Jesus went to visit all the towns and villages round there. He taught the people in the 
MAT.9.36	When Jesus saw the crowds of people, he felt sorry for them. They had trouble in their minds. They had nobody to help them. Jesus thought, ‘These people are like sheep that have nobody to take 
MAT.9.37	Then Jesus said to his 
MAT.9.38	So, you must pray to God to send out workers. The field and the plants belong to him.’ 
MAT.10.1	One day, Jesus asked his 12 
MAT.10.2	These are the names of the 12 
MAT.10.2	The first 
MAT.10.2	Then Simon's brother, who was called Andrew.
MAT.10.2	Also James and his brother John, who were Zebedee's sons.
MAT.10.3	There were Philip and Bartholomew.
MAT.10.3	There were Thomas and Matthew. (Matthew took 
MAT.10.3	And James who was the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
MAT.10.4	There was also Simon the 
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out these 12 
MAT.10.6	Instead, you must go to the people of 
MAT.10.7	While you travel, you must tell people about the 
MAT.10.8	Make sick people well again. Cause dead people to become alive again. If people have a bad illness of the skin, make them well again. Send bad 
MAT.10.9	Do not take any money of any kind in your purse. 
MAT.10.10	Do not take a bag with you, or extra clothes. Do not take extra shoes or a stick. You are working to help people. So, people should give you what you need to live. 
MAT.10.11	When you arrive in a town or a village, look for a good person there. Continue to stay in that person's house until you leave that town. 
MAT.10.12	When you go into that house, say to the people there, “We pray that you will be well.” 
MAT.10.13	If the people of that house accept you, then everyone in the house will be well. But if they do not accept you, then take back your kind words. 
MAT.10.14	Sometimes you will go to some house or town and the people will not accept you there. They will not listen to your message. Then you should leave. Clean the dirt of that place off your feet. 
MAT.10.15	I tell you this. One day God will 
MAT.10.16	Jesus went on to say to his 
MAT.10.17	Be careful! People will be against you. They will take you to stand in front of their leaders. They will 
MAT.10.18	They will take you to stand in front of kings and rulers. All this will happen because you are my 
MAT.10.19	When they take you to stand in front of their leaders, do not be afraid. Do not be troubled about what you should say or how you should say it. At that time, God will give you the right words to speak. 
MAT.10.20	You will not be speaking your own words. The 
MAT.10.21	At that time, a man will let people kill his own brother. A father will let people kill his own child. Children will be against their parents. They will even ask people to kill their parents. 
MAT.10.22	All people will 
MAT.10.23	If people in any town hurt you because of me, you should leave that town immediately. Go to another town. I tell you this. You will not have enough time to speak your message in all the towns of 
MAT.10.24	A student is not more important than his teacher is. A servant is not more important than his master is. 
MAT.10.25	A student should be happy if he becomes like his teacher. A servant should be happy if he becomes like his master. People have called me Beelzebul. I am like the master of the house. You are like those that live in my house. Do not be surprised when people call you even worse names than they call me.
MAT.10.26	So, do not be afraid of these people. They hide the things that they do. But there will be a time when other people will see those things. Everyone will know all their secrets. 
MAT.10.27	I tell you things secretly, like people do in the dark. But you must tell people these things clearly in the light of day. I have said things to you that other people did not hear. But now you must shout all these things loudly from the tops of the houses. 
MAT.10.28	Do not be afraid of those people who can only kill your body. These people cannot kill your 
MAT.10.29	Think about this. People sell two birds for just one small coin. But God takes 
MAT.10.30	God even knows how many hairs there are on your head. 
MAT.10.31	So do not be afraid of those people who are against you. You are more valuable to God than many little birds.
MAT.10.32	You should say clearly to other people, “I believe in Jesus.” If you do that, I will say to my Father in 
MAT.10.33	But if you say to other people, “I do not believe in Jesus,” I will then say to my Father in 
MAT.10.34	I will tell you why I have come into the world. I did not come so that everyone would agree with each other. No, I came to put people against one another, to fight against each other.
MAT.10.35	A man will fight against his father.
MAT.10.35	A daughter will fight against her mother.
MAT.10.35	A woman will fight against her husband's mother.
MAT.10.36	A man's own family will fight against him. 
MAT.10.37	Nobody should love his own father and mother more than he loves me. If he does, he cannot be my 
MAT.10.38	If you really want to be one of my 
MAT.10.39	Whoever wants to keep his life safe will lose it. But whoever gives his life to 
MAT.10.40	Jesus said to his 
MAT.10.41	Somebody may accept a 
MAT.10.42	People may think that my 
MAT.11.1	Jesus taught all these things to his 12 
MAT.11.2	At that time, John the 
MAT.11.3	They said to him, ‘John the 
MAT.11.4	Jesus replied, ‘Go back to John. Tell him what you have been hearing. Also, tell him what you have been seeing. 
MAT.11.5	 people can now see again. People who could not walk can now walk again. People who had a bad illness of the skin are now well again. 
MAT.11.6	If anyone believes in me and does not turn away, he will be really happy.’ 
MAT.11.7	John's 
MAT.11.8	So, did you go to see a man who was wearing expensive clothes? No! People like that don't live in the 
MAT.11.9	So, what did you go to see? Did you go to see a 
MAT.11.10	This is what someone wrote about him a long time ago in the Bible. God said:
MAT.11.10	“Listen! I will send someone to go in front of you.
MAT.11.10	He will speak my message.
MAT.11.10	He will prepare a way for you.” ’ 
MAT.11.11	Jesus went on to say, ‘I tell you this. John the 
MAT.11.12	From the time that John the 
MAT.11.13	All the 
MAT.11.14	The 
MAT.11.15	You have ears, so listen well to what I say!’
MAT.11.16	Jesus said, ‘I will talk to you about the people who are alive today. They are like children who are sitting in the market place. They are playing games and they shout to other children,
MAT.11.17	“We made happy music on a 
MAT.11.17	but you did not dance.
MAT.11.17	We sang a sad song but you did not cry.” 
MAT.11.18	People today are like those children. John the 
MAT.11.19	Then I, the 
MAT.11.20	In some of the cities Jesus had done many powerful things. But some people in those cities did not want to stop doing wrong things. They did not want to change how they lived. So Jesus spoke against those people. 
MAT.11.21	He said to them, ‘You people in Chorazin, things will be bad for you! And things will be bad for you, people in Bethsaida. I have done great and powerful things in your cities. If I had done such great things in Tyre and in Sidon, the people there would have changed how they lived. They would have shown they were sorry for their 
MAT.11.22	Yes, when God 
MAT.11.23	And what will happen to you people in Capernaum? You think that God will lift you up to 
MAT.11.24	I tell you this. When God 
MAT.11.25	At this moment, Jesus said, ‘Father, you rule over everything in 
MAT.11.26	Yes, Father, this is how you wanted it to happen.
MAT.11.27	My Father has given me authority over all things. Only the Father really knows me, his Son. Only I really know my Father, because I am his Son. I also choose to tell some people about him. Then they also know him.
MAT.11.28	Come to me all of you who are tired. You are like people who have worked for a long time. You are like people who have carried heavy things. Come to me. If you do that, you will find a place to rest. 
MAT.11.29	Do what I teach you to do. Listen to my message and learn from me what is true. I am very kind and I do not make myself important. I will help you. Then you will have 
MAT.11.30	I will not tell you to do things that are too difficult. I will not tell you to carry anything that is too heavy for you.’
MAT.12.1	On a 
MAT.12.2	While the 
MAT.12.3	Jesus replied, ‘You have certainly read about what David did one day. He and the men who were with him were hungry. 
MAT.12.4	David went into 
MAT.12.5	Also, you certainly know what God's 
MAT.12.6	But I tell you this. There is someone here now who has greater authority even than 
MAT.12.7	You should understand what the Bible teaches. God says there, “I want people to be kind to each other. I do not just want them to offer 
MAT.12.8	The 
MAT.12.9	Then Jesus left that place. He went into the 
MAT.12.10	A man was there. His hand was very small and weak, so he could not use it. Some 
MAT.12.11	Jesus said to them, ‘Maybe one of you has a sheep that falls into a deep hole on our day for rest. What will you do? You will take hold of it and you will lift it out of the hole. 
MAT.12.12	You know that a man is much more valuable than a sheep. So it is right for us to do good things on our day for rest.’
MAT.12.13	Then Jesus said to the man with the weak hand, ‘Lift up your hand.’ So the man lifted up his hand and it became well again. It was now as strong as his other hand. 
MAT.12.14	Then the 
MAT.12.15	Jesus knew that the 
MAT.12.16	He said to these people, ‘You must not tell anyone about me.’ 
MAT.12.17	This happened so that what the 
MAT.12.18	‘Here is my servant.
MAT.12.18	I have chosen him to work for me.
MAT.12.18	I love him and he makes me very happy.
MAT.12.18	I will give him my Spirit so that he will be powerful.
MAT.12.18	He will tell people everywhere that I will 
MAT.12.19	He will not argue with people. He will not shout at them.
MAT.12.19	People will not hear his loud voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	He will not hurt weak people.
MAT.12.20	He will be kind to people who are not strong.
MAT.12.20	He will do this until there is 
MAT.12.21	All people everywhere will believe that he can save them.’
MAT.12.22	After that, some people brought a man to Jesus. The man had a bad 
MAT.12.23	When Jesus did this, all the people were very surprised. They asked each other, ‘Maybe this man is the 
MAT.12.24	The 
MAT.12.25	Jesus knew what the 
MAT.12.26	So, 
MAT.12.27	Some of your 
MAT.12.28	I do send bad 
MAT.12.29	Nobody can go easily into the house of a strong man to rob him. To do that, he must first tie up the strong man. Then he can take away all that man's valuable things. 
MAT.12.30	If someone does not agree to help me, then he is really against me. You should work to bring people to me for help. If you don't do that, you are really making people run away from me. 
MAT.12.31	God is able to 
MAT.12.32	God will 
MAT.12.33	Then Jesus said, ‘To have good fruit you must have a good tree. If you have a bad tree, then you will get bad fruit from it. You can know all about a tree by the kind of fruit that it makes. 
MAT.12.34	You are like the children of dangerous snakes. You cannot say good things when your thoughts are bad. When you speak, your words show what is in your mind. 
MAT.12.35	It is like things that you bring out of a room where you keep them. The good man says good things because he keeps good thoughts in his mind. The bad man says bad things because he keeps bad thoughts in his mind. 
MAT.12.36	I tell you this. One day, God will 
MAT.12.37	God will think about the words that you have spoken. Then he will decide whether to let you go free or to 
MAT.12.38	Then some teachers of God's 
MAT.12.39	Jesus replied, ‘The people who are alive today are very bad. They do not obey God, but they want God to show them something powerful. But God will not do this for them. They will only see the same powerful thing that God did for his 
MAT.12.40	Jonah stayed inside a big fish for three days and three nights. In the same way, the 
MAT.12.41	When God 
MAT.12.42	Also, the Queen of Sheba travelled a long way to see King Solomon. She wanted to hear his 
MAT.12.43	Jesus went on to say, ‘When a bad 
MAT.12.44	So, it says to itself, “I will return to the place where I lived before.” So, it goes back to that person. It finds that the place is empty. Everything there is now good and clean. 
MAT.12.45	So the bad 
MAT.12.46	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd of people, his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside the house. They wanted to speak to Jesus. 
MAT.12.47	Someone told him, ‘Look! Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you.’
MAT.12.48	Jesus replied, ‘I will tell you who my mother and my brothers really are.’ 
MAT.12.49	Then he pointed to his 
MAT.12.50	My brothers and sisters and my mother are those people who do what my Father in 
MAT.13.1	On that same day, Jesus left the house and he went to Lake Galilee. He sat down near the edge of the lake to teach people. 
MAT.13.2	The crowd that came to listen to him was very large. So, he went and sat in a boat that was on the water. The big crowd of people stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	Jesus used stories to teach them many things. He said to them: ‘Listen to me! A farmer went out to plant seeds in his field. 
MAT.13.4	While he was throwing the seeds, some of them fell on the path. The birds came and they ate those seeds. 
MAT.13.5	Other seeds fell on ground with rocks in it. There was not much 
MAT.13.6	But when the sun rose, it burned the young plants. They soon died because they had not grown down well into the 
MAT.13.7	Some other seeds fell among 
MAT.13.8	But some seeds fell on good 
MAT.13.9	Then Jesus said to the crowd, ‘You have ears, so listen well to what I say!’
MAT.13.10	Then Jesus' 
MAT.13.11	Jesus replied, ‘God has let you know what these stories mean. You understand how God rules in the lives of his people. But these other people do not understand what the stories mean. 
MAT.13.12	A person who has received some things will receive even more. He will have lots of good things. Some other people have nothing. Those people will lose even the little bit that they do have. 
MAT.13.13	The reason I use stories to talk to other people is this:
MAT.13.13	“These people look. But they do not really see clearly.
MAT.13.13	They hear the words. But they do not really understand.” 
MAT.13.14	Long ago, the 
MAT.13.14	“You will listen and listen. But you will not understand.
MAT.13.14	You will look and look. But you will not see anything.
MAT.13.15	These people do not really want to understand.
MAT.13.15	They are like people who have shut their ears.
MAT.13.15	They are like people who have shut their eyes.
MAT.13.15	If they did want to look, then they would really see.
MAT.13.15	If they did want to listen, then they would really hear.
MAT.13.15	They would understand my message.
MAT.13.15	They would turn back to obey me.
MAT.13.15	Then I would 
MAT.13.16	But as for you, be happy because God has helped you to see. He has helped you to hear and understand his message. 
MAT.13.17	I tell you this. Many 
MAT.13.18	Jesus went on to say, ‘Listen to me now. I will tell you what this story about the farmer means. 
MAT.13.19	Some people hear the message about God's 
MAT.13.20	Other seeds fell on 
MAT.13.21	But they are like plants that have not grown down well into the 
MAT.13.22	Some seeds fell among 
MAT.13.23	But some seeds fell on good 
MAT.13.24	Then Jesus told the people another story. He said, ‘This is what the 
MAT.13.25	But one night, when everyone was sleeping, a bad person came to the farmer's field. He did not like the farmer. This bad person planted seeds from weeds among the good 
MAT.13.26	The good seeds grew and the plants began to make new seeds. But when this happened, the weeds also grew.
MAT.13.27	So the farmer's servants came to speak to him. “Master, you planted only good seeds in your field but now many weeds are also growing there. How did this happen?” they asked him.
MAT.13.28	The farmer said to his servants, “A bad person who does not like me has done this.”
MAT.13.28	So, the servants then asked the farmer, “Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?”
MAT.13.29	The farmer replied, “No, I do not want you to do that. If you pull up the weeds, you may also pull up some of the good 
MAT.13.30	Let the good plants and the weeds grow up together. When all the seeds become 
MAT.13.31	Jesus told the people another story. He said, ‘I will tell you again what the 
MAT.13.32	It is the smallest seed that there is. But when it starts to grow, it will become bigger than the largest bush. It will become a tree. The wild birds will come and they will make their homes among the branches of that tree.’
MAT.13.33	Jesus told the people another story. He said, ‘The 
MAT.13.34	Jesus told the crowds of people all these things. But he only used stories to teach them. 
MAT.13.35	So what God's 
MAT.13.35	‘I will use stories when I speak to them.
MAT.13.35	And I will teach them secret things.
MAT.13.35	People have never learned these things before, since the world began.’
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus told the crowds of people to go away. He went into the house where he was staying. His 
MAT.13.37	Jesus replied, ‘The 
MAT.13.38	The field is like the world. The good seeds are like the people who belong to God's 
MAT.13.39	The 
MAT.13.40	In the story, the workers cut down the weeds and they burned them in the fire. When this world comes to an end, it will happen like that. 
MAT.13.41	The 
MAT.13.42	The 
MAT.13.43	The people who obeyed God will shine like the sun. They will be in the 
MAT.13.44	‘I can tell you again what the 
MAT.13.45	‘I will tell you again what the 
MAT.13.46	One day he found a very beautiful and very valuable stone that someone wanted to sell. So he went away. And he sold everything that he had. Then he went and he bought that very beautiful and very valuable stone.
MAT.13.47	I can tell you again what the 
MAT.13.48	When the 
MAT.13.49	This is what will happen at the end of time. God will send his 
MAT.13.50	The 
MAT.13.51	Then Jesus asked his 
MAT.13.52	Jesus said to them, ‘Some teachers of God's 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished telling these stories, he went away from that place.
MAT.13.54	Jesus returned to his own town. He taught the 
MAT.13.55	We know who he is. He is the son of the 
MAT.13.56	All his sisters also live here in the town among us. So then, where did he learn all these things?’ 
MAT.13.57	So the people there did not accept Jesus.
MAT.13.57	Jesus said to them, ‘If a man is a 
MAT.13.58	Jesus did not do many powerful things in that town because the people would not believe in him. 
MAT.14.1	At that time, people told Herod about the things that Jesus was doing. 
MAT.14.2	Herod said to his servants, ‘That man Jesus is really John the 
MAT.14.3	Before that, Herod himself had said to his soldiers, ‘Take hold of John. Tie his hands and feet and put him in prison.’ Herod had done this because of his wife Herodias. Before Herod married her, she was the wife of Herod's brother Philip. 
MAT.14.4	John had said to Herod, ‘Herodias was your brother's wife. So it is not right for you to have her as your wife.’ 
MAT.14.5	Herod wanted to tell his soldiers that they must kill John. But the people thought that John was a 
MAT.14.6	One day, when it was Herod's birthday, he asked people to come to a special meal. The daughter of Herodias danced in front of him and his visitors. Her dance caused Herod to become very happy. 
MAT.14.7	He said to the girl, ‘Ask me for anything that you want. I make a strong promise that I will give it to you.’ 
MAT.14.8	Herodias suggested to her daughter, ‘Ask Herod to give you John's head.’ So the girl said to Herod, ‘Give me the head of John the 
MAT.14.9	Then Herod felt sad. But he had made a special promise to the girl, and his visitors had heard him. So he sent his men to do what she had asked for. 
MAT.14.10	He said to a soldier, ‘Go to the prison and cut off John's head.’ 
MAT.14.11	The soldier did this. Then he brought the head on a plate and he gave it to the girl. The girl took it and gave it to her mother.
MAT.14.12	After this, John's 
MAT.14.13	Jesus heard about what had happened to John. After that, he went away from that place. He sailed in a boat to a quiet place where he could be alone. But the crowd heard where Jesus had gone. So they left their towns and they went on land to the place where he was going. 
MAT.14.14	Jesus got out of the boat. He saw a large crowd there on the shore. He felt sorry for them. There were sick people among them and he made them well again.
MAT.14.15	When it was almost evening, Jesus' 
MAT.14.16	Jesus said to them, ‘The people do not need to go away. You should give them some food to eat.’
MAT.14.17	But the 
MAT.14.18	‘Bring the bread and fish here to me,’ Jesus said. 
MAT.14.19	Then he said to the large crowd, ‘Sit down on the grass.’ He took the 5 loaves of bread and the 2 fishes. He looked up to 
MAT.14.20	Then everybody ate. They all had enough food and they were not hungry any more. Then the 
MAT.14.21	About 5000 men ate the bread and fish. Women and children also ate it with them. 
MAT.14.22	Immediately after this, Jesus said to his 
MAT.14.23	So, Jesus sent the crowd away. After they had gone, he went up on a mountain alone to pray. When it became dark, he was still there alone. 
MAT.14.24	At this time the boat with the 
MAT.14.25	Then, when it was nearly dawn, Jesus walked on the water towards his 
MAT.14.26	The 
MAT.14.27	But immediately Jesus said to them. ‘Be brave! It is I. Do not be afraid.’
MAT.14.28	Peter replied, ‘Lord, is it really you? If it is you, say to me, “Come here! Walk to me on the water.” ’
MAT.14.29	Jesus said to him, ‘Come to me.’
MAT.14.29	So Peter got down out of the boat. He walked on the water and he came towards Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But then Peter saw that the wind was still blowing strongly. He became afraid and he began to go down into the water. He shouted to Jesus, ‘Lord, save me!’
MAT.14.31	Immediately, Jesus put out his hand and he took hold of Peter. He said to Peter, ‘You should 
MAT.14.32	Jesus and Peter climbed up into the boat. Then the strong wind stopped. 
MAT.14.33	The 
MAT.14.34	They sailed across the lake and reached the shore at a place called Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	The people who lived in that place recognised Jesus. So they went to tell everyone who lived in places near there. People brought all their sick friends to him. 
MAT.14.36	The sick people asked Jesus for help. They wanted to touch only the edge of his coat. Every sick person who touched him became well again.
MAT.15.1	After that, a group of 
MAT.15.2	They said, ‘Our leaders in past times taught us the right way to do everything. But your 
MAT.15.3	Jesus replied, ‘God tells us the right way to obey him. But you refuse. Instead, you like to keep your own ideas. 
MAT.15.4	God's 
MAT.15.5	But you teach that a person may say to his father or to his mother, “I would have given these gifts to you, but I cannot. Instead, I have given them to God.” 
MAT.15.6	Then, you let that person give nothing to his parents. He doesn't have to help them. This shows that you have not obeyed what God says is right. Instead, you have obeyed your own ideas. 
MAT.15.7	You are 
MAT.15.8	God says, “These people say good things about me,
MAT.15.8	but they do not really want to obey me.
MAT.15.9	They say that I am great.
MAT.15.9	But what they say has no purpose.
MAT.15.9	They teach their own rules, which I did not give to them.”’
MAT.15.10	Jesus asked the crowd of people to come to him. He said to them, ‘Listen to me, so that you can understand my message. 
MAT.15.11	It is not food that goes into a person's mouth that makes them dirty. Instead, what comes out of a person's mouth is important. This may show that what is inside them is dirty.’
MAT.15.12	Then Jesus' 
MAT.15.13	Jesus replied, ‘Those 
MAT.15.14	Do not listen to what the 
MAT.15.15	Peter said to Jesus, ‘Explain to us what you mean.’
MAT.15.16	Jesus replied, ‘I am surprised that you still do not understand what I am saying. 
MAT.15.17	You should understand that food first goes into a person's mouth. Then it goes into their stomach, and then it passes out of their body. 
MAT.15.18	The words that a person speaks come from their thoughts. It is what comes out of a person's mouth that makes them dirty. 
MAT.15.19	Bad thoughts come from a person's mind. As a result, they do wrong things. They might decide to kill somebody. They might have sex with another man's wife or in other wrong ways. They might rob somebody. They might tell 
MAT.15.20	It is these bad things that make people dirty in front of God. But if people eat food when they have not washed their hands in the right way, that will not make them dirty.’
MAT.15.21	Then, Jesus left that place. He went away to some places near to the cities called Tyre and Sidon.
MAT.15.22	A woman was living in this part of the country. She was one of the Canaanite people. She came to see Jesus. She was shouting with a loud voice, ‘
MAT.15.23	Jesus did not say anything to the woman. So his 
MAT.15.24	Jesus replied to his 
MAT.15.25	Then the woman came to Jesus and she went down on her knees in front of him. ‘Sir, please help me,’ she said.
MAT.15.26	Jesus did answer the woman this time. He said, ‘It is not right to take food from the children and then throw it to the dogs.’
MAT.15.27	The woman replied to Jesus. ‘Yes sir, that is true. But even the dogs eat the small pieces of food that fall from their master's table.’
MAT.15.28	Jesus answered her, ‘Woman, you show clearly that you believe in God. God will do what you have asked.’
MAT.15.28	At that moment the woman's daughter became well again.
MAT.15.29	Jesus travelled on from that place and he walked along the shore of Lake Galilee. He climbed up a hill and he sat down there. 
MAT.15.30	Large crowds of people came to him and they brought sick people with them. Some of these sick people could not walk very well, and some of them were 
MAT.15.31	When the large crowd saw all this, they were very surprised. People who could not speak could now speak again. People who could not use their arms or their legs were now well again. Those people who could not walk very well could now walk again. 
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus told his 
MAT.15.33	The 
MAT.15.34	Jesus asked them, ‘How many loaves of bread do you have?’
MAT.15.34	‘We have 7 loaves and a few small fishes,’ they replied.
MAT.15.35	Jesus told the crowd that they should sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	Then he took the 7 loaves and the fishes in his hands and he thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and the fishes into pieces and he gave the food to his 
MAT.15.37	All the people ate and they all had enough food. After the people had eaten, there were still lots of small pieces of food. Jesus' 
MAT.15.38	There were 4000 men who ate the bread and fish. There were also women and children who ate. 
MAT.15.39	Then Jesus sent the crowd of people away. After that, he got into the boat and sailed to the part of the country near Magadan. 
MAT.16.1	Some 
MAT.16.2	Jesus answered them. ‘Sometimes the sky is red in the evening. Then you say, “Tomorrow the weather will be good.” 
MAT.16.3	Sometimes in the morning the sky is red and there are dark clouds. Then you say, “Today there will be a storm.” So, you look at the sky and you know what the weather will be. But special things are happening now. And you do not understand what they mean. 
MAT.16.4	The people who are alive today are very bad. They do not obey God. They want God to show them something powerful. But God will not do this for them. They will only see the same powerful thing that God did for Jonah.’
MAT.16.4	Then Jesus went away and left them.
MAT.16.5	Jesus and his 
MAT.16.6	Jesus said to them, ‘Be careful! Do not let the 
MAT.16.7	The 
MAT.16.8	Jesus knew what they were talking about. So he said to them, ‘You should not be arguing with each other about the bread. You should 
MAT.16.9	You still do not understand. You should remember that I used 5 loaves of bread to feed 5000 men. Think about how many baskets you filled with pieces of food after the meal. 
MAT.16.10	Also remember that I used 7 loaves of bread to give food to 4000 men. And think about how many baskets you filled with pieces of food that time. 
MAT.16.11	I spoke to you about the 
MAT.16.12	Then the 
MAT.16.13	Jesus went into the part of the country near Caesarea Philippi. While he was there, he asked his 
MAT.16.14	They replied, ‘Some people say that you are John the 
MAT.16.15	‘But what do you think?’ Jesus asked them. ‘Who do you say that I am?’
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered him. ‘You are the 
MAT.16.17	Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of Jonah, God has really helped you! No person on earth taught you that. God, my Father in 
MAT.16.18	I tell you this. You are called Peter, which means a rock. And I will build my 
MAT.16.19	I will give you the keys to the 
MAT.16.20	Then Jesus said strongly to his 
MAT.16.21	After this, Jesus began to explain everything to his 
MAT.16.22	Then Peter took Jesus away from the other 
MAT.16.23	Jesus turned round and said to Peter, ‘
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his 
MAT.16.25	Whoever wants to keep his life safe will lose it. But whoever gives his life to 
MAT.16.26	A person could get everything in the whole world for himself. But if he loses his life, this will not be any good for him. There is nothing that a person can give to get back his life. 
MAT.16.27	I tell you all this because I, the 
MAT.16.28	I tell you this. When I, the 
MAT.17.1	6 days after that, Jesus asked Peter and the 2 brothers, James and John, to go with him. Jesus led them up a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	Peter, James and John saw Jesus change in front of them. He became different to look at. His face was bright like the sun. His clothes became very white and they shone. 
MAT.17.3	Then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of the 3 
MAT.17.4	Peter said to Jesus, ‘
MAT.17.5	While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud appeared. It covered them all. A voice spoke from the cloud and it said, ‘This is my Son and I love him. He makes me very happy. Listen to him.’
MAT.17.6	The 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus came to them and he touched them. ‘Stand up,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid.’ 
MAT.17.8	When they looked up, they could not see anyone else. Only Jesus was there with them.
MAT.17.9	While they were walking down the mountain again, Jesus said to the 3 
MAT.17.10	Then the 3 
MAT.17.11	Jesus replied, ‘Yes, Elijah does come first. He gets everything ready. 
MAT.17.12	But I tell you that Elijah has already come. People did not recognise him. They did to him all the things that they wanted to do. In the same way, they will also give me, the 
MAT.17.13	Then the 
MAT.17.14	Then Jesus, and the 3 
MAT.17.15	He said to Jesus, ‘Please sir, be kind to my son. His mind is sick. Sometimes he does not know what he is doing. Often he falls into the fire, or he falls into water. 
MAT.17.16	I brought the boy to your 
MAT.17.17	Jesus replied, ‘You people today still do not believe in God. You have turned away from him. It is very difficult to be with you all this time. It is difficult for me to be patient with you.’ Then Jesus said to the man, ‘Bring the boy here to me.’ 
MAT.17.18	Jesus said to the bad 
MAT.17.19	When the 
MAT.17.20	Jesus replied, ‘You could not do it because you do not 
MAT.17.21	Jesus went on to say, ‘This kind of 
MAT.17.22	When Jesus and his 
MAT.17.23	They will kill him. But three days after that, he will become alive again.’ When the 
MAT.17.24	After that, Jesus and his 
MAT.17.25	Peter answered them, ‘Yes, my teacher does pay the 
MAT.17.25	Then Peter returned to the house where Jesus was staying. Before Peter could say anything, Jesus spoke to him first. He said, ‘Here is a question for you to answer, Simon. Who are the people who must pay 
MAT.17.26	‘They take the 
MAT.17.26	Jesus said to him, ‘This means that people from the ruler's own country do not need to pay anything. 
MAT.17.27	But we do not want to make these men who take the 
MAT.18.1	Soon after this, the 
MAT.18.2	Jesus called a child to come to him. He made the child stand in the middle of them all. 
MAT.18.3	He said, ‘I tell you this. You must change and become like little children. If not, you will never come into the 
MAT.18.4	This little child does not think that he is very important. You must also think as he does. Whoever does this will be the most important person in the 
MAT.18.5	If anyone accepts a child like this because of me, that person also accepts me.’
MAT.18.6	Jesus said, ‘A person who believes in me may not seem important. But you should never make that person do wrong things. Don't do that! It would be better for you if someone tied a big stone round your neck. Then you would sink deep down into the sea and die. 
MAT.18.7	Some things in this world will cause people to do wrong things. You can be sure that bad things will happen. But God will 
MAT.18.8	If your hand or your foot causes you to do wrong things, you should cut it off. You should throw it away. It is better to have only one hand or one foot and to have God's true life. It will be much worse to keep both your hands and both your feet and still do wrong things. Then God will throw you into 
MAT.18.9	If your eye causes you to do wrong things, then you should take it out. You should throw it away. It is better to have only one of your eyes and to have God's true life. It will be much worse if you keep both your eyes but then God throws you into 
MAT.18.10	Be careful! Do not think that any of these little people are not important. I tell you this. They have 
MAT.18.10	[
MAT.18.11	I, the Son of Man, came to look for those who are far away from God.] 
MAT.18.12	Think about a man who has 100 sheep. He discovers that one of his sheep is not there with the others. What does he do? He leaves all his other sheep on the hills. He goes to look for the one lost sheep. 
MAT.18.13	And I tell you this. If he finds that lost sheep, he will be very happy. All the other sheep are safe together. But they do not make him as happy as this one sheep does. 
MAT.18.14	God, your Father in 
MAT.18.15	Jesus said, ‘If your Christian friend has done something wrong against you, you must go and speak to him. When you are alone with him, tell him what he has done that is wrong. He may agree with what you say. If he does, then you can call him your friend again. 
MAT.18.16	But maybe he does not want to listen to you. Then take one or two other people with you to speak to him. They will then know what wrong things your friend has done. Remember what the Bible says: “There must be 2 or 3 people to say certainly that another person has done something wrong. 2 or 3 people must agree what has happened.” 
MAT.18.17	If your friend still will not agree that he has done something wrong, then go and tell the 
MAT.18.18	I tell you this. You will tell people here on earth what is right for them to do. And you will tell them what is not right for them to do. God in heaven will give you this authority. He will agree with what you say.
MAT.18.19	Two people may agree together to ask God for something. If they agree like that, then my Father in 
MAT.18.20	Two or more people may meet together because they believe in me. If they do that, I will be there with them.’ 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to talk to Jesus. He asked, ‘Lord, if my Christian friend does wrong things against me many times, how many times should I 
MAT.18.22	Jesus replied, ‘I do not say only 7 times. I say you should 
MAT.18.23	Jesus went on to say, ‘I will tell you a story to show what the 
MAT.18.24	So the king began to check. His men led a servant to him who had a big debt. He must pay back 10000 gold coins to the king. 
MAT.18.25	The servant could not pay his big debt to the king. So the king said to his men, “Sell the servant and his wife and his children and all his things. Then I will keep the money to pay his debt.”
MAT.18.26	Then the servant went down on his knees in front of the king. He said to the king, “Please, please give me some more time, then I will pay you everything.” 
MAT.18.27	The king felt sorry for his servant. He 
MAT.18.28	But then that same servant went away and he met another servant of the king. This other servant had to pay back a debt of 100 cheap coins to the first servant. The first servant took hold of the neck of the other servant to hurt him. He said, “Give me the money that is mine.”
MAT.18.29	The other servant went down on his knees in front of the first servant. He said, “Please, please give me some more time, then I will give you the money.”
MAT.18.30	But the first servant would not agree. He put the other servant in prison until he could pay his debt to him. 
MAT.18.31	The other servants of the king saw what had happened. They were very 
MAT.18.32	When the king heard this, he told the first servant to come to him. “You are a very bad person,” the king said to the servant. “I 
MAT.18.33	I was kind to you. You should have been kind to that other servant in the same way.” 
MAT.18.34	The king was very angry with the first servant. He told his men to put him in prison. They 
MAT.18.35	Then Jesus finished the story and he said, ‘You must 
MAT.19.1	When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he went away from Galilee. He went to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the river Jordan. 
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed Jesus there. He made the sick people well again.
MAT.19.3	Some 
MAT.19.4	Jesus replied, ‘You surely have read about this in the Bible. At the start, when God made the world, he made people male and female. 
MAT.19.5	Because of this, a man leaves his father and his mother. God joins him and his wife together. The man and the woman become like one body. 
MAT.19.6	They are not two separate people any longer. They have come together as one person. God has put them together to be husband and wife. So nobody should make them separate.’
MAT.19.7	Then the 
MAT.19.8	Jesus answered them, ‘Moses said this because you people did not want to obey God. All these things were different at the start, when God made the world. 
MAT.19.9	Now I say to you: If a man's wife has had sex with another man, he may send her away. Then he may marry another woman. But if he does this for any other reason, he has done a wrong thing. It is the same as if he had sex with another man's wife.’
MAT.19.10	Jesus' 
MAT.19.11	Jesus replied, ‘Not everyone can agree with this idea. But God has helped some people to agree. 
MAT.19.12	There are several different reasons why a person may not marry. Some men cannot have sex. They were born like that. Some other people cannot have sex because people did something to them. Some people choose not to have sex. They do not marry because then they can work better for God and his 
MAT.19.13	Then some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on each child's head. They wanted him to pray for them. But the 
MAT.19.14	Jesus said to them, ‘Do not stop the children. Let them come to me. People must become like these children so that God can rule their lives. That is what the 
MAT.19.15	So Jesus put his hands on each of the children's heads and he prayed for them. After that, he went away from that place.
MAT.19.16	One day a man came to Jesus. ‘Teacher,’ he asked. ‘What good thing must I do so that I can live with God for ever?’
MAT.19.17	Jesus replied, ‘Why do you ask me about a good thing? Only God is good. Nobody else. If you want to have real life, then you must obey God's 
MAT.19.18	The man asked Jesus, ‘Which 
MAT.19.18	So Jesus replied, ‘Do not kill anyone. Do not have sex with anyone who is not your wife. Do not rob anyone. Do not say things that are not true about people. 
MAT.19.19	Love your father and your mother and obey them. Love other people as much as you love yourself.’
MAT.19.20	‘I have always obeyed these 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said to him, ‘If you want to be completely good, then you must do this. You must sell everything that you have. Then give the money to poor people. If you do that, you will have many valuable things in 
MAT.19.22	When the young man heard this, he went away. He was not happy. He was feeling sad because he was a very rich man.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus said to his 
MAT.19.24	The hole in a 
MAT.19.25	When the 
MAT.19.26	Jesus looked at them and he replied, ‘For people, it really is impossible. But God can do it. God can do everything.’
MAT.19.27	Peter said to Jesus, ‘Look! We have left everything that we had. And now we are your 
MAT.19.28	Jesus said to his 
MAT.19.29	Some people have left their home. Or they may have left their brothers or sisters. Or they may have left their mother or their father. Or they may have left their wife or their children or their fields. They have done that because of me. God will give those people many more things than they have left behind, even 100 times more! And after they die, they will live for ever with God. 
MAT.19.30	But many people who are very important now will become the least important. And many people who are not important now will become very important then.’
MAT.20.1	Jesus said, ‘I will tell you a story to show what the 
MAT.20.2	The master agreed with the workers that he would pay them one 
MAT.20.3	The master went out again about three hours later. He saw some other men standing in the market place. They had no work to do. 
MAT.20.4	So the master said to these men, “You also go and work in my field. I will pay you the right amount of money.” 
MAT.20.5	So the workers went to the master's field and started to work.
MAT.20.5	The master went out again at noon, and he went again three hours after that. Both times he sent men to his field to work. 
MAT.20.6	Two hours later, at 5 o'clock, he went out again. He found more men who were standing there. And they had no work to do. The master asked them, “Why are you standing here all day and you are not working?”
MAT.20.7	The men said to the master, “Nobody has asked us to work for him.”
MAT.20.7	So the master said to them, “You also go now and work in my field.”
MAT.20.8	Then the evening came. The master of the field went and spoke to the man who watched the workers. He said to him, “Tell the workers to come here. Pay them their money. Begin with the workers who started to work at the end of the day. Finish with the workers who started first.”
MAT.20.9	The workers who had come to work at 5 o'clock in the evening received one 
MAT.20.10	The workers who had come first to work thought that they would receive more than the other workers. But each of them also received one 
MAT.20.11	When they received their money, they were not happy. They told the master that he had not been fair to them. 
MAT.20.12	They said to him, “Some of these other workers came last and only worked for one hour. But you have paid them the same money as you paid us. And we have worked all day in the hot sun.”
MAT.20.13	Then the master said to one of the workers, “My friend, I am being fair to you. You agreed to work for one day and to receive one 
MAT.20.14	Take your money and go home. I choose to give this last man the same amount of money as I gave to you. 
MAT.20.15	It is my money. I can choose what to do with it. I want to be kind to people and give them more. Does that make you 
MAT.20.16	Jesus went on to say, ‘So, one day, those people who are not important now will become the most important. Those people who are very important now will become the least important.’
MAT.20.17	Jesus and his 
MAT.20.18	‘Listen!’ he said to them. ‘We are going to Jerusalem. There, someone will deliver the 
MAT.20.19	Then they will take me and they will deliver me to people who are not 
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of James and John took them to see Jesus. (Their father was Zebedee.) She went down on her knees in front of Jesus. She asked him to do something good for her.
MAT.20.21	‘What do you want me to do?’ Jesus asked her.
MAT.20.21	She said, ‘One day, you will be king. Then I want my two sons to rule with you. One may sit at your right side and the other one at your left side. Please will you do this?’
MAT.20.22	Jesus said to them, ‘You do not understand what you are asking for. I will have much pain and trouble. Are you ready to have the same pain?’
MAT.20.22	James and John replied, ‘Yes, we can do that.’
MAT.20.23	Jesus said to them, ‘Yes, that is true. You will have pain and trouble like mine. But I cannot promise that you will sit at my right side or at my left side. My Father God has chosen who will sit there. He has prepared the places for those people.’
MAT.20.24	When the other 10 
MAT.20.25	Then Jesus told all the 12 
MAT.20.26	But you should not be like that. The person who wants to be great among you must become your servant. 
MAT.20.27	The person who wants to be the most important person among you must work hard for everyone else. 
MAT.20.28	Even the 
MAT.20.29	Later, Jesus and his 
MAT.20.30	Two men were sitting at the side of the road. They were 
MAT.20.31	The people who were in the crowd were angry with them. They told them that they should be quiet. But the men shouted even louder, ‘Master! 
MAT.20.32	Jesus stopped there. He asked the two men, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’
MAT.20.33	‘Sir,’ the men replied, ‘we want to see again.’
MAT.20.34	Jesus felt sorry for the two men. He touched their eyes and immediately the men could see again. So they followed Jesus along the road. 
MAT.21.1	Jesus and his 12 
MAT.21.2	He said to them, ‘Go into the village that is in front of you. When you arrive there, you will immediately see a 
MAT.21.3	‘Someone may ask you, “What are you doing?” Then say to him, “The Master needs them. He will send them back to you soon.” ’
MAT.21.4	A 
MAT.21.5	‘Say to the people in Jerusalem,
MAT.21.5	“Look, your king is coming to you.
MAT.21.5	He does not come like someone who thinks that he is important.
MAT.21.5	He is riding on a 
MAT.21.5	Yes, he is riding on a young 
MAT.21.6	So the two 
MAT.21.7	They brought the 
MAT.21.8	Many people in the crowd put their coats down on the road. Other people cut branches down from trees. They put these branches down on the road. 
MAT.21.9	Many crowds of people went in front of Jesus and other people followed him. All of them were shouting,
MAT.21.9	‘We 
MAT.21.9	Great is the king who comes with the authority of the 
MAT.21.9	We 
MAT.21.10	When Jesus went into Jerusalem, everybody in the city had trouble in their minds. They were asking each other, ‘Who is this man?’
MAT.21.11	The people in the crowd replied, ‘This is God's 
MAT.21.12	Jesus then went into the yard of 
MAT.21.13	Jesus spoke to them all. He said, ‘The Bible says, “God's house will be a place where people come together to pray.” But you have changed it into a place where robbers meet.’
MAT.21.15	The leaders of the 
MAT.21.16	They asked Jesus, ‘Can you hear what these children are saying?’
MAT.21.16	‘Yes,’ Jesus replied. ‘I am sure that you have read this in the Bible:
MAT.21.16	“
MAT.21.16	You yourself have made that happen.” ’
MAT.21.17	Then Jesus left everyone and he went out of Jerusalem. He stayed that night in the village that is called Bethany. 
MAT.21.18	On the next day, early in the morning, Jesus left Bethany to return to Jerusalem. On the way, he was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	He saw a 
MAT.21.20	The 
MAT.21.21	Jesus said to them, ‘I tell you this. You must believe in God. You must not have other ideas in your mind. If you believe in God, then you could also do the same thing to this 
MAT.21.22	So, when you pray to ask God for something, believe in him. Then God will give you whatever you ask for.’
MAT.21.23	Then Jesus returned to the yard of 
MAT.21.24	Jesus replied, ‘I also will ask you one question. If you tell me the answer, then I will answer your question. I will tell you what authority I have to do these things. 
MAT.21.25	John 
MAT.21.26	But we do not want to say that only men gave John his authority. All the people think that John was a 
MAT.21.27	So the 
MAT.21.27	Jesus said to them, ‘You will not answer my question. So I will not tell you what authority I have to do these things.’
MAT.21.28	Jesus said to the 
MAT.21.29	The older son replied, “I do not want to go and work there today.” But after he had said that, he did go and work in the field.
MAT.21.30	The man went to his other son and he said the same thing to him. The second son replied, “Yes, father, I will go.” But then he did not go to work in the field.
MAT.21.31	Tell me, which of the man's sons did what his father wanted?’
MAT.21.31	The 
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, ‘I tell you this. The men who take 
MAT.21.32	John the 
MAT.21.33	Then Jesus said again to the 
MAT.21.33	The man then found some farmers to work in the garden for him. Then he went away to another country. 
MAT.21.34	The time to cut the 
MAT.21.35	But the farmers took hold of the servants. They hit one of them with sticks. They killed another one. They threw stones at another servant and killed him. 
MAT.21.36	So the master sent other servants to go to the farmers. He sent more servants than the first time. But the farmers did the same thing to these servants also. 
MAT.21.37	After that, the master sent his own son to the farmers. He thought, “The farmers will surely 
MAT.21.38	The farmers saw the master's son coming. They said to each other, “This is the master's own son. He will receive the garden when our master dies. So, we should kill the son and then the garden will be ours.” 
MAT.21.39	Then the farmers took hold of the son. They threw him out of the garden and they killed him.’
MAT.21.40	Jesus went on to say, ‘One day, the master will return to his garden. What do you think he will do then to those farmers?’
MAT.21.41	The 
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, ‘I am sure that you have read this in the Bible:
MAT.21.42	“The builders refused to use a certain stone.
MAT.21.42	They thought that it had no value.
MAT.21.42	But now that stone has become the most important stone at the corner of the building.
MAT.21.42	The 
MAT.21.42	And we can see that he did something great.”
MAT.21.43	I tell you this. Because you do not believe in me, God will take his 
MAT.21.44	When a person falls on to that stone, it will break his body into pieces. When that stone falls on top of someone, it will destroy him completely.’ 
MAT.21.45	The leaders of the 
MAT.21.46	They wanted to take hold of him and put him in prison. But they did not try to do it because they were afraid of the people. The people thought that Jesus was a 
MAT.22.1	Jesus continued to teach the people with stories. 
MAT.22.2	He said, ‘This is what the 
MAT.22.3	He asked many people to come. When the meal was ready, he sent his servants out to tell those people to come. But they refused to come.
MAT.22.4	So the king then sent out other servants. He said to them, “Tell this message to all those people that I have asked to come. Tell them that the master says, ‘My servants have prepared the meal. They have killed my large 
MAT.22.5	But the people were not interested in the king's message. They went away to do their own work. One man went to his farm and another man went to his business. 
MAT.22.6	Other people took hold of the king's servants. They hurt them and then they killed them. 
MAT.22.7	The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to the city where those people lived. They killed the people who killed the king's servants. They destroyed their city with fire.
MAT.22.8	Then the king said to his other servants, “The meal for my son's marriage is ready. But the people that I had asked to come were not the right people. 
MAT.22.9	So, go out now to the wide streets in the town. Ask all the people that you meet there to come to the marriage party.” 
MAT.22.10	Then those servants went out into the streets. They brought to the king's house all the people that they met. Some were good people and some were bad people. Many people came so that the room for the marriage was full.
MAT.22.11	Then the king came into the room to see all the people. He saw one man who was not wearing the right clothes for a marriage. 
MAT.22.12	The king said to the man, “How did you come in here, my friend? You are not wearing the right clothes for a marriage.” The man could not answer the king.
MAT.22.13	The king said to his servants, “Tie his hands and his feet. Take him and throw him into the dark place outside. There, people will cry and they will bite their teeth together.”
MAT.22.14	God asks many people to come to him. But he only chooses a few people to be there with him.’ 
MAT.22.15	After the 
MAT.22.16	So the 
MAT.22.17	So, tell us your answer to this question: Should we pay our 
MAT.22.18	Jesus knew that these men wanted to do bad things to him. So he said to them, ‘You just ask that question to cause trouble for me. You are not being honest! 
MAT.22.19	Now, show me the coin that you use for the 
MAT.22.20	Then Jesus asked them, ‘Whose picture is on this coin? Whose name is on it?’
MAT.22.21	They replied, ‘It is 
MAT.22.21	Jesus said to them, ‘So you should give to 
MAT.22.22	When they heard Jesus' answer, they were very surprised. So they left him and they went away.
MAT.22.23	On that day, some 
MAT.22.24	‘Teacher,’ they said to him, ‘Moses said in the Bible: A man may die and leave behind a wife but no children. Then that man's brother must marry the woman. Then their children will be called the children of the brother who died. 
MAT.22.25	Once, there were 7 brothers who lived here. The oldest brother married a wife. Then he died before they had any children. So the second brother married the woman. 
MAT.22.26	But then he also died with no children. So a third brother married this woman. And the same thing happened to all the brothers down to the seventh brother. They all died before the woman had any children. 
MAT.22.27	After all this, the woman also died. 
MAT.22.28	You teach that one day dead people will become alive again. On that day, whose wife will that woman be? She had married all 7 of those brothers.’
MAT.22.29	Jesus said to the 
MAT.22.30	One day, God will raise people up after they have died. They will become alive again. But then men and women will not marry. They will not have husbands or wives. Instead, they will be like the 
MAT.22.31	It is true that one day dead people will become alive again. You have read in the Bible about what God said to you: 
MAT.22.32	“I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.” God is not the God of people who are dead. He is the God of people who are alive.’ 
MAT.22.33	The crowd heard this. They were very surprised about what Jesus was teaching.
MAT.22.34	The 
MAT.22.35	One of the 
MAT.22.36	He said, ‘Teacher, which of God's 
MAT.22.37	Jesus replied to him, ‘You should love the 
MAT.22.38	This is the greatest rule and the most important of all God's 
MAT.22.39	The second rule is also important, like the first one. You should love other people as much as you love yourself. 
MAT.22.40	All God's 
MAT.22.41	While the 
MAT.22.42	‘What do you think about the 
MAT.22.42	The 
MAT.22.43	Jesus said to them, ‘Think about this then: God's 
MAT.22.44	“The 
MAT.22.44	Sit at my right side until I beat your enemies completely.
MAT.22.44	You will even be able to put your feet on them.”  
MAT.22.45	So we know that King David calls the 
MAT.22.46	Nobody could answer the question that Jesus asked. After this, everyone was afraid to ask Jesus any more questions.
MAT.23.1	After that, Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his 
MAT.23.2	He said, ‘The teachers of God's 
MAT.23.3	So you must obey everything that they teach you. But you should not do the same things that they do. They tell you what the 
MAT.23.4	The rules that they give you are hard to obey. They are like heavy luggage, which they make you carry. But they themselves will not help you to carry that luggage. They won't use even one finger to help you. 
MAT.23.5	The 
MAT.23.6	They like to sit in the important places at special meals. They also choose to sit in the best seats in the meeting places. 
MAT.23.7	They like people to 
MAT.23.8	You all belong to God's family. You have only one Teacher. So nobody should call another person, “Teacher”.
MAT.23.9	Also, do not call any other person in the world, “Father”. You have only one Father, and he is in 
MAT.23.10	And do not call each other “Leader”. You have only one Leader. He is the 
MAT.23.11	The person among you who is most important will be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	Some people lift themselves up to be important. They say that they are better than other people. But God will bring them down low. Other people know that they are not better than others. God will lift those people up to a good place.’
MAT.23.13	Jesus spoke to the teachers of God's 
MAT.23.13	[
MAT.23.14	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.15	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.16	It will be bad for you, teachers. You cannot see what is true, but you show people which way to go. 
MAT.23.17	This shows that you are fools. You do not see what is true. Think about which of these is more important. Is it the gold things in 
MAT.23.18	You also say to people, “You may make a promise by the 
MAT.23.19	You are people who cannot see what is true. Think about which of these things is more important. Is it the gifts on the 
MAT.23.20	Remember this. Somebody may make a promise by the name of the 
MAT.23.21	Also, somebody may make a promise by the name of 
MAT.23.22	Or somebody may make a promise by 
MAT.23.23	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.24	You are like 
MAT.23.25	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.26	, you do not see what is true! You must first clean the inside of the cup and plate. Then the outside that people can see will also be clean.
MAT.23.27	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.28	You are the same as that. Other people look at you. They think that you are good and you obey God. But on the inside you are 
MAT.23.29	It will be bad for you, teachers of God's 
MAT.23.30	You say, “Our 
MAT.23.31	So you are speaking against yourselves. You show that you are the sons of those people who killed God's 
MAT.23.32	Now you can do the same thing that your 
MAT.23.33	You are like a family of dangerous snakes! You will not be able to run away. God will surely 
MAT.23.34	So listen to this. God says, “I will send 
MAT.23.35	Because of all this, God will 
MAT.23.36	Yes, I tell you this. God will 
MAT.23.37	Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Your people have killed God's 
MAT.23.38	So listen! Your great house will now become like a 
MAT.23.39	And I tell you this. You will not see me again until the day when you say, “Great is the man who comes with the authority of the 
MAT.24.1	Jesus left 
MAT.24.2	So Jesus said to them, ‘Yes, you can see all these beautiful buildings now. But I tell you this. Enemies will completely destroy them. Not even one stone will remain on top of another stone.’ 
MAT.24.3	After that, Jesus was sitting on the hill called the 
MAT.24.4	Jesus said, ‘You must be careful! Some people will tell you things that are not true. Do not believe them. 
MAT.24.5	Many people will say that they have come on my behalf. They will say, “I am the 
MAT.24.6	You will hear about wars. You will hear reports about wars in other places. But you must not be afraid. Those things must happen first, but it is not yet the end of everything. 
MAT.24.7	People in one country will attack the people in another country. Kings and their armies will fight against other kings and their armies. Some people will be hungry, with no food. The ground will move in many different places. 
MAT.24.8	All those things will be like the first pains that a mother has before her baby is born.
MAT.24.9	Then people will take hold of you and they will give you pain. They will even kill some of you. People in every country will 
MAT.24.10	At that time, many people who believe in me will stop believing. They will put some of my 
MAT.24.11	Also at that time, many people will say that they are 
MAT.24.12	More and more people everywhere will be doing very bad things. Because of this many people will no longer love each other in the way that they did before. 
MAT.24.13	But God will save the person who remains strong until the end. 
MAT.24.14	People will tell the good news about God's 
MAT.24.15	Long ago God's 
MAT.24.16	At that time, people in Judea must run away to the hills to hide.
MAT.24.17	A person who is on the roof of his house must not go down into his house. He must not stop to get anything from his home to take with him. 
MAT.24.18	People who are outside in their fields must not go back to their homes. They must not even go to fetch their coats. 
MAT.24.19	That will be a bad time for women who are soon to have a baby! It will also be a bad time for those women who have little babies! 
MAT.24.20	You must pray to God about this time when you have to run away quickly. Pray that this time of trouble will not happen in winter. Pray that it will not happen on your day of rest. 
MAT.24.21	Great troubles will happen to people at that time. Nothing as bad has ever happened before, since the beginning of the world. Nothing as bad will ever happen again. 
MAT.24.22	God will cause those days of great trouble to be not so many. If he did not do that, there would be nobody still alive. But God will cause those days to come to an end. He will do that to help the people that he has chosen. 
MAT.24.23	At that time, someone may say to you, “Look, here is the 
MAT.24.24	Some people will say to you, “I am the 
MAT.24.25	So be careful! I have told you about these things before they happen.
MAT.24.26	Some people may say to you, “Look, the 
MAT.24.27	 shines quickly and it lights up the whole of the sky from one side to the other. It will be like that when the 
MAT.24.28	If the dead body of an animal is lying somewhere, 
MAT.24.29	Then after all these bad things have happened,
MAT.24.29	“The sun will become dark.
MAT.24.29	The moon will not shine any more.
MAT.24.29	Stars will fall out of the sky.
MAT.24.29	And the powerful things in the sky will move from their usual places.”
MAT.24.30	Then people will see something powerful in the sky. This will show them that the 
MAT.24.31	People will hear the sound of a loud 
MAT.24.32	‘Here is a lesson for you to learn about the 
MAT.24.33	In the same way, you will see all these strange things happening. Then you will know that the 
MAT.24.34	I tell you this. The people who are alive now will not all die until all these things happen. 
MAT.24.35	One day, the earth and the sky will have an end. But my words will be there for ever.’
MAT.24.36	‘Nobody knows the day or the hour when all these things will happen. Only God the Father knows when they will happen. The 
MAT.24.37	Remember what happened when Noah was alive. It will be like that when the 
MAT.24.38	In Noah's time, in the days before the rain came, people were eating their meals every day. Men married women and women married men. They continued to do all these things until the day that Noah went into his big boat. 
MAT.24.39	The people did not know what was going to happen. Then rain fell for a long time and all these people died in the deep water. When the 
MAT.24.40	At that time, it will be like this. Two men will be working in a field. God will take one man away, but he will leave the other man behind. 
MAT.24.41	Two women will be preparing food together in the same place. God will take one of them away, but he will leave the other woman behind. 
MAT.24.42	So you must watch carefully! You do not know the day when your Master will come back. 
MAT.24.43	You can be sure about this. The master of a house does not know at what time of night a man would come to rob him. If he knew the time, he would watch his house more carefully. He would not let the robber come into his house and take away his things. 
MAT.24.44	So you must also be ready. The 
MAT.24.45	Jesus then said, ‘You should be like a 
MAT.24.46	That servant will be very happy when his master comes home. His master will see that he has done everything well. 
MAT.24.47	Yes, I tell you this. The master will give that servant authority to rule over everything in his house. 
MAT.24.48	But another servant might be bad. He might say to himself, “My master will not come yet.” 
MAT.24.49	Then he begins to hit the other servants. He eats too much and he drinks too much. He meets with others who get drunk. 
MAT.24.50	Then the master of that servant will come home and he will surprise the servant. He did not think that his master would come home on that day or at that time. 
MAT.24.51	Then the master will 
MAT.25.1	Jesus said, ‘I will tell you another story to show what the 
MAT.25.2	5 of these young women were silly. The other 5 young women were 
MAT.25.3	The silly women took their 
MAT.25.4	The 5 
MAT.25.5	The man who was marrying a wife did not come for a long time. So all the young women became tired, and they went to sleep.
MAT.25.6	In the middle of the night, someone shouted out, “The man is coming! Come out to meet him!”
MAT.25.7	The 10 young women woke up. Then they prepared their 
MAT.25.8	The 5 silly young women said to the other 5 young women, “Give us some of your oil, because our 
MAT.25.9	The 
MAT.25.10	So these 5 women went to buy some oil. While they were away, the man arrived for the marriage party. The 5 
MAT.25.11	Later, the 5 silly women also came to the house. They said, “Sir, Sir, please open the door for us.” 
MAT.25.12	But he replied, “I really do not know you.” ’
MAT.25.13	Then Jesus said to the people, ‘So you must watch carefully. You do not know on what day or at what time I will return.’
MAT.25.14	Jesus said, ‘The 
MAT.25.15	The master gave one servant 5000 gold coins. He gave another servant 2000 gold coins, and to another servant he gave 1000 gold coins. He gave to each servant what he would be able to use well. Then he went away on his journey. 
MAT.25.16	The servant who had received 5000 gold coins went out immediately. He bought and sold things with the money. When he did this, he got 5000 more gold coins. 
MAT.25.17	The servant who had received 2000 gold coins did the same thing. This servant got 2000 more gold coins. 
MAT.25.18	But the servant who had received only 1000 gold coins did something different. He went outside and he dug a hole in the ground. He buried the money that his master had given him.
MAT.25.19	After a long time, the master came home. He asked the servants to come to him. He wanted to know how much money they had now. 
MAT.25.20	The servant who had received 5000 gold coins came to his master. The servant said, “Master, you gave me 5000 gold coins. Now I have an extra 5000 gold coins.”
MAT.25.21	The master said to this servant, “You are a good servant and you have done really well. You were careful with a small amount of money. Now I will give you authority over many more things. I am really happy about this and I want you to be happy with me.”
MAT.25.22	The servant who had received 2000 gold coins also came to his master. The servant said, “Master, you gave me 2000 gold coins. Now I have an extra 2000 gold coins.”
MAT.25.23	The master said to this servant, “You are a good servant and you have done really well. You were careful with a small amount of money. Now I will give you authority over many more things. I am really happy about this and I want you to be happy with me.”
MAT.25.24	The servant who had received 1000 gold coins then came to his master. The servant said, “Master, I know what you are like. You tell people what they should do all the time. You take food from fields where you did not put any seed in the ground. You get fruit from trees that you did not plant. 
MAT.25.25	So, I was afraid of you. I went and I buried your gold coins in the ground. Look! Here it is. You can have your money back again.”
MAT.25.26	The master said to him, “You are a bad and lazy servant. You know what I am like, do you? I get food from fields where I did not put any seeds. I get fruit from trees that I did not plant. You knew all that. 
MAT.25.27	So, you should have put the money into a bank. Then, when I came home, I could have received my money back from the bank again, with extra money also.”
MAT.25.28	Then the master said to his other servants, “Take the 1000 gold coins from this bad servant. Give them to the man who now has 10000 coins. 
MAT.25.29	Some people have received good things. They will all receive even more and have lots of good things. Some other people have nothing. Those people will lose even the little bit that they do have. 
MAT.25.30	This servant cannot work for me any longer. Take him outside and throw him into a dark place. There, people will cry and they will bite their teeth together.” ’ 
MAT.25.31	Jesus said, ‘One day I, the 
MAT.25.32	People from all the countries in the world will come together in front of me. I will put them into two groups. I will do it in the same way that a 
MAT.25.33	He puts the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side. 
MAT.25.34	The king will say to those people who are on his right side, “Come here. My Father has been good to you. He has prepared a place for you in his 
MAT.25.35	I was hungry and you gave me some food to eat. I was 
MAT.25.36	I did not have enough clothes and you gave me some clothes to wear. I was ill and you took 
MAT.25.37	Then the people on the right side will say to the king, “Master, when did we see that you were hungry and give you some food? When did we see that you were 
MAT.25.38	When did we ask you to stay in our home because you were alone? When did we give you some clothes to wear? 
MAT.25.39	When did we take 
MAT.25.40	The king will answer them, “I tell you this. You did all these things to help other people. They were not important people, but they were my friends. When you helped them, then you also helped me.”
MAT.25.41	Then the king will say to those people who are at his left side, “Go away from me. God has decided to 
MAT.25.42	I was hungry but you did not give me any food to eat. I was 
MAT.25.43	I visited your town but you did not ask me to stay in your home. I did not have enough clothes but you did not give me anything to wear. I was ill but you did not take 
MAT.25.44	Then these other people will say, “Master, when did we see you and you were hungry, or you were 
MAT.25.45	Then the king will reply, “Listen to this. You did not help people who are my friends. They were not important people. But when you did not help them, you also did not help me.”
MAT.25.46	Then those people on the king's left side will go away to the place where God will 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus finished saying all these things, he said to his 
MAT.26.2	‘You know that after two days it will be the time of the 
MAT.26.3	Then the leaders of the 
MAT.26.4	They wanted to kill Jesus. But they wanted to take hold of him secretly. So they tried to decide how they could do that. 
MAT.26.5	They said to each other, ‘We do not want to take hold of him during the 
MAT.26.6	Then Jesus went to Bethany and he visited Simon at his house. At one time, Simon had had a bad illness of the skin. 
MAT.26.7	While Jesus was eating a meal there, a woman came into the house. She brought a small stone jar with her. The jar contained expensive 
MAT.26.8	Jesus' 
MAT.26.9	She could have sold it for a lot of money. Then she could have given the money to poor people.’ 
MAT.26.10	Jesus knew what his 
MAT.26.11	You will always have poor people with you. But you will not always have me with you. 
MAT.26.12	She has poured 
MAT.26.13	I tell you this. Everywhere in the world people will speak about this good news. At the same time, they will also tell people about the good thing that this woman has done. And so people will remember her.’
MAT.26.14	Judas Iscariot was one of Jesus' 12 
MAT.26.15	and he asked them, ‘How much money will you give me if I help you to take hold of Jesus?’ The 
MAT.26.16	Judas then waited for the right moment to help them to take hold of Jesus.
MAT.26.17	The first day of the 
MAT.26.18	Jesus replied, ‘Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, “The teacher says: This is the moment that God has prepared for me. I will eat the 
MAT.26.19	So Jesus' 
MAT.26.20	When it was evening, Jesus and the 12 
MAT.26.21	While they were eating, Jesus said, ‘I tell you this. One of you will help the 
MAT.26.22	They were very sad about what Jesus had said. Each one of them said to Jesus, ‘
MAT.26.23	Jesus said to them ‘The man who will give me to the rulers is eating from the same dish as I am. 
MAT.26.24	The 
MAT.26.25	Judas was the one who would give Jesus to the 
MAT.26.26	While Jesus and his 
MAT.26.27	Then Jesus took a cup. He thanked God for the 
MAT.26.28	This is my blood that shows God's promise. When I die, my blood will pour out of my body. In that way God will 
MAT.26.29	I tell you this. I will not drink 
MAT.26.30	Then Jesus and his 
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said to his 
MAT.26.31	God says, “I will kill the 
MAT.26.31	Then all the sheep will run away in different directions.” ’
MAT.26.32	Jesus went on to say, ‘But after that happens, I will become alive again. Then I will go to Galilee, and you will follow.’
MAT.26.33	Peter said to Jesus, ‘Even if everyone else runs away, I will not leave you.’
MAT.26.34	Jesus replied to Peter, ‘I tell you this. Even tonight, you will say three times that you do not know me. This will happen before the 
MAT.26.35	But Peter said to Jesus, ‘I will die with you if I need to. But I will never say that I do not know you.’ All the other 
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus and his 
MAT.26.37	Then Jesus took Peter and Zebedee's two sons, James and John, with him. He became very sad and 
MAT.26.38	He said to them, ‘I am very sad. I feel as if I could die because I feel so sad. Wait here with me and stay awake.’
MAT.26.39	Jesus went a short way beyond them. He went down with his face on the ground. He prayed, ‘Father, if it is possible, please save me from this time of great pain. But Father, I do not ask you to do what I want. Do what you want for me.’
MAT.26.40	Jesus returned to the 3 
MAT.26.41	You must stay awake and pray. God can help you, so that you will not do something wrong. You really want to do the right thing, but your bodies are weak.’
MAT.26.42	Jesus went away a second time and he prayed, ‘My Father, if it is not possible to save me from this time of great pain, then I want to obey you. Do what you want for me.’
MAT.26.43	Then Jesus returned again to Peter, James and John. He saw that they were sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open. 
MAT.26.44	So Jesus went away from them again and he prayed a third time. He said the same words to God.
MAT.26.45	When he returned to the 
MAT.26.46	Stand up, we will go now. Look! The man who will give me to my enemies is here.’
MAT.26.47	While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of Jesus' 12 
MAT.26.48	Judas was ready to help the 
MAT.26.49	Now Judas went immediately to Jesus. He said, ‘Hello, Teacher.’ Then he kissed Jesus in a friendly way. 
MAT.26.50	Jesus said to Judas, ‘My friend, now do what you have come here to do.’
MAT.26.50	Then the crowd of men came up to Jesus. They took hold of him to lead him away. 
MAT.26.51	Then one of Jesus' 
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus said to the 
MAT.26.53	You should know that I could ask my Father God to help me. He would immediately send more than 12 large groups of 
MAT.26.54	They would save me. But then the things that God has said in the Bible about this would not happen. So, it must happen in this way.’
MAT.26.55	At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, ‘You have come out here with long sharp knives and heavy sticks to take hold of me. Do you really believe that I am leading people to fight against our country's rulers? No! I was teaching people every day in the yard of 
MAT.26.56	The 
MAT.26.56	Then all of Jesus' 
MAT.26.57	Then those men who had taken hold of Jesus took him to Caiaphas's house. Caiaphas was the most important 
MAT.26.58	Peter followed Jesus into the yard of Caiaphas' house. But he did not go near Jesus. He sat down in the yard with the police who worked in 
MAT.26.59	The leaders of the 
MAT.26.60	Many people did come. And they said things against Jesus that were not true. But still the 
MAT.26.60	Then two men stood up and they said, 
MAT.26.61	‘We heard this man say, “I can destroy 
MAT.26.62	Then Caiaphas stood up and he said to Jesus, ‘You must reply now to what these men have said against you. Are the things that they say true?’ 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus did not say anything.
MAT.26.63	So Caiaphas said to him, ‘I use the authority of the God who lives. You must promise to tell us what is true. Are you the 
MAT.26.64	‘You have said it,’ Jesus replied. ‘And I tell all of you, soon you will see the 
MAT.26.65	The most important 
MAT.26.66	What do you decide that we must do with him?’
MAT.26.66	‘What Jesus has said shows that he must die,’ they replied. 
MAT.26.67	Then some of them 
MAT.26.68	When they hit him, they said, ‘
MAT.26.69	While all these things were happening, Peter was sitting outside in the yard. One of the girls who worked there went to him and she said, ‘You were also a friend of Jesus, the man from Galilee.’
MAT.26.70	Peter said in front of everyone who was there, ‘That is not true. I do not know what you are talking about.’
MAT.26.71	Peter then went out to the gate, and another servant girl saw him. This girl said to the people who were standing there, ‘This man was a friend of Jesus, the man from Nazareth.’
MAT.26.72	Peter answered again very strongly. He said, ‘I promise you, I really do not know that man!’
MAT.26.73	After a little time, other people who were standing at the gate spoke to Peter. They said, ‘We are sure that you are one of that man's friends. We know this because you also speak like people who live in Galilee.’
MAT.26.74	Peter said to them very strongly, ‘I tell you that I do not know that man. God will surely 
MAT.26.74	Immediately after Peter said this, the 
MAT.26.75	Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him, ‘Tonight you will say three times that you do not know me. You will do it before the 
MAT.27.1	Early the next morning, all the leaders of the 
MAT.27.2	They tied Jesus' hands and feet and then they took him to Pilate's house. They put him under the authority of Pilate, who was the 
MAT.27.3	Judas heard that the 
MAT.27.4	He said to them, ‘I have done the wrong thing. I helped you to take hold of a man who has done nothing wrong.’
MAT.27.4	They said to Judas, ‘That is not important to us. That is your problem.’
MAT.27.5	So, Judas took the money and he threw it down on the floor in 
MAT.27.6	The leaders of the 
MAT.27.7	They decided to use the money to buy a field. They wanted to use the field to bury foreign people who died in the city. The field had been called ‘The Pot-maker's Field’. 
MAT.27.8	After this, it was called ‘The Field of Blood’. It is still called that even today. 
MAT.27.9	So the words that the 
MAT.27.10	They used this money to buy the pot-maker's field. The Lord God had told me to do this.’
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood in front of the 
MAT.27.11	Jesus replied, ‘You have said it.’
MAT.27.12	The leaders of the 
MAT.27.13	So Pilate said to Jesus, ‘You hear what these men are saying against you. You should reply.’ 
MAT.27.14	But Jesus did not reply to what the men were saying against him, not even to one thing. Pilate was very surprised about this.
MAT.27.15	Each year at the time for the 
MAT.27.16	At that time, there was a man called Barabbas in prison. Everyone knew about the bad things that he had done. 
MAT.27.17	When the crowd came together at Pilate's house, Pilate asked them, ‘Who do you want me to let go free? Should Barabbas go free? Or should it be Jesus, who is called the 
MAT.27.18	Pilate knew why the 
MAT.27.19	Pilate was sitting on his special seat as a 
MAT.27.20	But the leaders of the 
MAT.27.21	Pilate asked the people again, ‘Which of these two men should go free?’ The people answered, ‘Barabbas.’
MAT.27.22	Then Pilate asked the people, ‘So, what should I do with Jesus, who is called the 
MAT.27.23	So Pilate said, ‘Why should I kill him? What bad things has he done?’
MAT.27.23	But the people shouted even louder, ‘Kill him on a 
MAT.27.24	Then Pilate knew that he could not do anything to make them quiet. He thought that the people would start to fight his soldiers. So, he took a dish of water and he washed his hands in front of the people. He said, ‘It is not because of me that this man will die. You are the people who have caused it to happen.’
MAT.27.25	All the people answered Pilate, ‘Yes, God should 
MAT.27.26	Then Pilate let Barabbas go free, as the crowd wanted. But he said to his soldiers, ‘Hit Jesus many times with a 
MAT.27.27	Then Pilate's soldiers took Jesus into the yard of the ruler's house. All the other soldiers in their group were there. 
MAT.27.28	They removed Jesus' clothes from him. Instead, they put a dark red coat on him, like a king wears. 
MAT.27.29	They used some sharp branches and they made a 
MAT.27.30	Then the soldiers 
MAT.27.31	After they had finished 
MAT.27.32	As they were going to that place, they met a man called Simon. He came from the city called Cyrene. The 
MAT.27.33	The soldiers took Jesus to the place that is called Golgotha. (Golgotha means the place of a skull.) 
MAT.27.34	They tried to give Jesus some 
MAT.27.35	Then the soldiers fixed Jesus on to the 
MAT.27.36	Then the soldiers sat down and they watched Jesus carefully. 
MAT.27.37	Above his head they fixed a notice. This showed the reason why they were killing him. It said, ‘This man is Jesus, the king of the 
MAT.27.38	Then the soldiers also fixed two robbers to 
MAT.27.39	The people who walked near there said bad things against Jesus. They 
MAT.27.40	and they said, ‘You said that you could destroy 
MAT.27.41	The leaders of the 
MAT.27.42	They said, ‘This man saved other people, did he? But he cannot save his own life! He says that he is the king of 
MAT.27.43	He 
MAT.27.44	Then the two robbers who were on the 
MAT.27.45	It was now midday. The whole country became dark for 3 hours. 
MAT.27.46	At about three o'clock in the afternoon, Jesus shouted loudly, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?’ That means, ‘My God, my God, why have you left me alone?’
MAT.27.47	Some people who were standing there heard him. They said to each other, ‘He is shouting to Elijah.’
MAT.27.48	One of these people ran quickly and he brought a piece of cloth. He poured cheap 
MAT.27.49	The other people said, ‘Wait! Now we will see if Elijah comes to save him.’
MAT.27.50	Then Jesus shouted again with a loud voice, and after that he died.
MAT.27.51	At that moment, the curtain inside 
MAT.27.52	Places in the ground where people had buried dead bodies opened up. Many of God's people who had died now became alive again. 
MAT.27.53	After Jesus became alive again, those people came up out of those places. They went into God's city, Jerusalem. Many people saw them there.
MAT.27.54	The captain and his soldiers had been watching Jesus. They saw the ground moving. They saw everything that had happened. They were very frightened and they said, ‘It must be true! This man really was the 
MAT.27.55	There were also many women there. They were standing a long way away and they were watching these events. They had come with Jesus from Galilee to help prepare food for him. 
MAT.27.56	Mary from Magdala was there. Mary the mother of James and Joses, and Mary the mother of Zebedee's sons, were also there.
MAT.27.57	That evening a rich man who came from a town called Arimathea went to Pilate. The man's name was Joseph, and he had become a 
MAT.27.58	Joseph said to Pilate, ‘I would like to take the dead body of Jesus and bury it.’ Pilate said to his soldiers, ‘Give Jesus' dead body to Joseph.’ 
MAT.27.59	So Joseph took Jesus' body. He put a clean piece of soft white cloth round it. 
MAT.27.60	Then he put the body in a large hole in a rock. He had made the hole to bury his own body when he died. After he put Jesus' body there, he rolled a very big stone across the front of the hole to shut it. Then he went away. 
MAT.27.61	Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of James were there. They were sitting near the hole in the rock where Joseph put Jesus' body.
MAT.27.62	The next day was the 
MAT.27.63	They said to him, ‘Sir, that man told 
MAT.27.64	So you should put soldiers to watch the place where Joseph buried him. They should watch there for the next three days. Then his 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, ‘OK. You may take a group of soldiers to watch the place. Let them fix the rock well, so that nobody can open it.’ 
MAT.27.66	So the 
MAT.28.1	After the day of rest had finished, on the first day of the week, Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of James got up early. They went to the hole in the rock where Joseph had put the dead body of Jesus.
MAT.28.2	At that moment, the ground moved about very strongly. One of the 
MAT.28.3	He shone brightly like 
MAT.28.4	The soldiers who were carefully watching that place were very frightened. They 
MAT.28.5	Then the 
MAT.28.6	But he is not here. He has become alive again. That is what he said would happen. Come here. You can see the place where he was lying. 
MAT.28.7	Then you must go quickly to his 
MAT.28.8	So the women went away quickly from the hole in the rock. They were very frightened, but they were also very happy. They ran to tell the 
MAT.28.9	At that moment, Jesus met the two women. and he said, ‘Hello.’ They went close to him. They held on to his feet and they 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. Go and tell my 
MAT.28.11	The women went to tell the 
MAT.28.12	The leaders of the 
MAT.28.13	They said to the soldiers, ‘When people ask you, you must say this: “Jesus' 
MAT.28.14	If the 
MAT.28.15	The soldiers took the money. They said what the 
MAT.28.16	After this, the 11 
MAT.28.17	When they arrived at the place, they saw Jesus. Then they went down on their knees and they 
MAT.28.18	Jesus went close to them and he said to them, ‘God has given me authority over everyone and everything. I have all authority in 
MAT.28.19	So, you must go to people in every country of the world. Teach them how to become my 
MAT.28.20	Teach them to obey everything that I have taught you. You can be sure that I will be with you always. I will be with you until the end of time.’
MRK.1.1	This is the start of the good news about Jesus Christ. He is the 
MRK.1.2	The 
MRK.1.2	‘Listen! I will send someone to go in front of you.
MRK.1.2	He will speak my message.
MRK.1.2	He will prepare a way for you.
MRK.1.3	Somebody's voice is shouting in the 
MRK.1.3	“The 
MRK.1.3	Make the paths straight for him.” ’ 
MRK.1.4	So John went to a place in the 
MRK.1.5	Many people who lived in Jerusalem city and in the country called Judea went to listen to John. The people told God about all the wrong things that they had done. Then John 
MRK.1.6	John wore clothes made from the hair of a 
MRK.1.7	John said to the people, ‘Another person will come soon. He is much greater than I am. I am not good enough even to undo his shoes for him. 
MRK.1.8	I have 
MRK.1.9	Soon after this, Jesus came from the town called Nazareth in Galilee. John 
MRK.1.10	While Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the skies open. The 
MRK.1.11	A voice came from 
MRK.1.12	Immediately, the 
MRK.1.13	Jesus was in the 
MRK.1.14	When John was in a prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news about God. 
MRK.1.15	Jesus said, ‘Now is the time when the 
MRK.1.16	On one day, Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. He saw two brothers called Simon and Andrew. Their job was to catch fish. They were throwing their 
MRK.1.17	‘Come with me and be my 
MRK.1.18	Simon and Andrew immediately put down their 
MRK.1.19	Then Jesus continued to walk along the shore. Soon he saw two more men who were brothers. They were called James and John. They were the sons of Zebedee. They were in their boat and they were mending their 
MRK.1.20	Immediately, Jesus asked them to come with him. They left their father and his workers in the boat, and they went with Jesus to be his 
MRK.1.21	Then Jesus and those 
MRK.1.22	The people were very surprised at the things that Jesus taught them. When he taught them, he showed his authority. That was not like the way that the teachers of God's 
MRK.1.23	In the meeting place, there was a man who had a bad 
MRK.1.24	He said, ‘Jesus from Nazareth, leave us alone! Do not kill us! I know who you are. You are the 
MRK.1.25	Jesus spoke to the bad 
MRK.1.26	The bad 
MRK.1.27	All the people were very surprised, and they said to each other, ‘This is very strange. This man Jesus is teaching us something new and he speaks with authority. He can tell bad 
MRK.1.28	Immediately, people began to tell the news about Jesus. Everywhere in Galilee, they were telling other people about him.
MRK.1.29	Then Jesus left the meeting place. He took James and John with him to the home of Simon and Andrew. 
MRK.1.30	The mother of Simon's wife was ill in bed. Her body was very hot. Immediately, Simon and Andrew told Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	So he went to her and he held her hand. Then he helped her to sit up and she was well again. Immediately she prepared food for her visitors.
MRK.1.32+MRK.1.33	That evening, when the sun had gone down, people in the town came to Jesus. They brought to him everyone who was ill. And they brought people with bad 
MRK.1.34	Jesus caused many sick people to become well. They had many different kinds of illness. He also caused many bad 
MRK.1.35	Jesus got up very early the next morning, while it was still dark. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed. 
MRK.1.36	Simon and the other 
MRK.1.37	When they found him, they said, ‘Everyone is looking for you.’
MRK.1.38	Jesus replied, ‘We should go to other towns near here, so that I can teach the people there also. I came here for that reason.’ 
MRK.1.39	So Jesus travelled everywhere in Galilee. He taught the people in the 
MRK.1.40	On one day, a man who had an illness of the skin came to Jesus. He went down on his knees in front of Jesus. The man said. ‘If you want, you can make me well again. Please do it.’
MRK.1.41	Jesus felt very sorry for the man. He put out his hand towards the man and he touched him. ‘I do want to help you,’ Jesus said, ‘Be clean again!’ 
MRK.1.42	Immediately, the illness left the man.
MRK.1.43	Jesus sent the man away immediately and he spoke to the man with strong words. 
MRK.1.44	‘Listen. Do not tell anyone about this,’ Jesus said. ‘Instead, go and show yourself to the 
MRK.1.45	But instead, the man went away and he talked to everybody. He told them what had happened to him. Because he did this, it became too difficult for Jesus to go into the towns. Everybody knew him, and so Jesus stayed in places in the 
MRK.2.1	Several days after that, Jesus returned to Capernaum. People reported that he had come back to his home. 
MRK.2.2	Many people came into the house. The house was so full that there was no room, even outside the door. Jesus was teaching people the good news. 
MRK.2.3	Four men came. They were carrying another man on a 
MRK.2.4	They could not reach Jesus because of the crowd. So they made a hole in the roof above the place where Jesus was. They helped the man to go down through the hole. He was still lying on his 
MRK.2.5	Jesus saw the man and his friends. He knew that they believed in him. So he said to the man who could not walk, ‘My friend, I 
MRK.2.6	But some teachers of God's 
MRK.2.7	‘This man Jesus should not have said that,’ they thought. ‘He is speaking as if he is God. Only God can 
MRK.2.8	Immediately, Jesus knew in his 
MRK.2.9	‘I said to this man who cannot walk, “I 
MRK.2.10	But I want you to know this. I, the 
MRK.2.11	‘I am saying to you: Stand up! Pick up your 
MRK.2.12	The man stood up. Immediately, he picked up his 
MRK.2.13	Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee again. A large crowd came to him, and he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	While Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Levi. Levi was the son of Alphaeus. His job was to take 
MRK.2.15	Then Jesus went to eat a meal at Levi's house. Many people followed Jesus and they ate there with him and with his 
MRK.2.16	Some teachers of God's 
MRK.2.17	Jesus heard what these people were saying. He said to them, ‘People who are well do not need a doctor. It is people who are ill that need a doctor. Some people think that they always obey God. I did not come to help people like that. Some people know that they have done wrong things. I am asking those people to come to me for help.’ 
MRK.2.18	At this time, the 
MRK.2.19	Jesus answered them: ‘When a man marries, his friends cannot refuse to eat. They cannot refuse to eat food while he is with them. 
MRK.2.20	But there will be a time when people will take the man away from his friends. At that time his friends will stop eating food.’ 
MRK.2.21	Then Jesus said, ‘Nobody uses a piece of new cloth to mend an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will cause the old cloth to tear again. It will make a bigger hole than before. 
MRK.2.22	And nobody pours new 
MRK.2.23	On one 
MRK.2.24	Some 
MRK.2.25	Jesus replied, ‘You have certainly read about what David did one day. He and the men who were with him were very hungry. They needed food to eat. 
MRK.2.26	David went into 
MRK.2.27	Then Jesus said to the 
MRK.2.28	So you should know that the 
MRK.3.1	Another time, Jesus went into the 
MRK.3.2	Some 
MRK.3.3	Jesus said to the man, ‘Stand here in front of everyone.’
MRK.3.4	Then Jesus said to the 
MRK.3.4	Nobody said anything.
MRK.3.5	Jesus looked round at everybody. He felt angry with them. He also felt sad because they did not want to learn. Then he said to the man, ‘Lift up your hand.’ The man lifted his hand and it became well. He could use it again. 
MRK.3.6	Then the 
MRK.3.7	Jesus left that place and he went away to Lake Galilee with his 
MRK.3.8	Many people also came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, and from a part of Israel called Idumea. They also came from places on the other side of the river Jordan, and from the towns called Tyre and Sidon. Many people had heard about the things that Jesus was doing. That is why all these people came to him. 
MRK.3.9	The crowd was very large. So Jesus asked his 
MRK.3.10	Sick people were pushing to the front, because they were trying to touch him. They knew that he had made many people well. 
MRK.3.11	Often, a person with a bad 
MRK.3.12	Jesus often had to say to the bad 
MRK.3.13	Jesus went up a mountain. He chose some men and he asked them to go there with him. So they met together with him there. 
MRK.3.14	He chose a group of 12 men. He called them his 
MRK.3.15	He gave these men authority to cause bad 
MRK.3.16	These are the names of the 12 
MRK.3.16	Simon, (Jesus called him Peter).
MRK.3.17	James and John who were the sons of Zebedee. Jesus called them ‘Boanerges’. It means ‘men who are like a loud noise in a storm,’
MRK.3.18	Andrew,
MRK.3.18	Philip,
MRK.3.18	Bartholomew,
MRK.3.18	Matthew,
MRK.3.18	Thomas,
MRK.3.18	James, who was the son of Alphaeus,
MRK.3.18	Thaddaeus,
MRK.3.18	Simon the 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot. He later gave Jesus to the people who were against him. 
MRK.3.20	Then Jesus went into a house. And again, a crowd came together there. There were so many people that Jesus and his 
MRK.3.21	People told his 
MRK.3.22	Some teachers of God's 
MRK.3.23	So Jesus spoke to the teachers of God's 
MRK.3.24	If armies in the same country start to fight each other, then they will destroy their own country. 
MRK.3.25	And if the people in one family start to fight against each other, they will destroy their own family. 
MRK.3.26	So 
MRK.3.27	Nobody can easily go into the house of a strong man to rob him. To do that, he must first tie up the strong man. Then he can take away all that man's valuable things. 
MRK.3.28	What I say to you is true. God can 
MRK.3.29	But God will never 
MRK.3.30	Jesus said this to the teachers of God's 
MRK.3.31	Then, Jesus' mother and his brothers arrived and they stood outside the house. They sent someone with a message. They wanted Jesus to come out to speak to them. 
MRK.3.32	A crowd of people was sitting round Jesus. They said to him, ‘Look! Your mother and brothers are outside. They are looking for you.’
MRK.3.33	Jesus replied, ‘I will tell you who my mother and brothers really are.’
MRK.3.34	Then he looked at the people who were sitting round him. He said, ‘Look! Here are my mother and my brothers! 
MRK.3.35	My brothers and sisters and my mother are those people who do what God wants.’ 
MRK.4.1	Again, Jesus began to teach people near the edge of Lake Galilee. A large crowd came together to listen to him. So, he went and sat in a boat that was on the water. The crowd of people stayed on the shore. 
MRK.4.2	Jesus used stories to teach them many things. He said to them: 
MRK.4.3	‘Listen to me! A farmer went out to plant seeds in his field. 
MRK.4.4	While he was throwing the seeds, some of them fell on the path. The birds came and they ate those seeds. 
MRK.4.5	Other seeds fell on ground with rocks in it. There was not much 
MRK.4.6	But when the sun rose, it burned the young plants. They soon died because they had not grown down well into the 
MRK.4.7	Other seeds fell among 
MRK.4.8	But some seeds fell on good 
MRK.4.9	Then Jesus said, ‘You have ears, so listen well to what I say!’ 
MRK.4.10	When Jesus was alone, his friends and the 12 
MRK.4.11	Jesus replied, ‘God has let you understand how he rules in the lives of his people. But these other people only listen to stories. 
MRK.4.12	This is so that:
MRK.4.12	“They are always looking but they do not really see clearly.
MRK.4.12	They are always listening but they do not understand.”
MRK.4.12	If they did understand, they would turn to God. Then God would 
MRK.4.13	Then Jesus answered the people who had asked him about the story. ‘You should understand this story. If you do not understand it, you will not understand any of my stories. 
MRK.4.14	The seeds are like the message from God. The farmer is like a person who tells people about that message. 
MRK.4.15	Some seeds fell on the path. That is like some people who listen to the message. But then 
MRK.4.16	Some of the seeds fell on 
MRK.4.17	But they are like plants that have not grown down well into the 
MRK.4.18	Some seeds fell among 
MRK.4.19	But they have many troubles in their minds. They think that more money and other valuable things will make them happy. So they do not let God's message change them. They are like plants that do not grow well and make new seeds. 
MRK.4.20	But some seeds fell on good 
MRK.4.21	Then Jesus said to his 
MRK.4.22	God hides some things now. But there will be a time when people will see them. God keeps some things secret now. But there will be a time when people will understand those things.’ 
MRK.4.23	Then Jesus said, ‘You have ears, so listen well to what I say.’ 
MRK.4.24	Jesus went on to say, ‘Think carefully about the things that you hear. God will give to you in the same way that you give to other people. And you will receive even more. 
MRK.4.25	A person who has received some things will receive more. Some other people have nothing. They will lose even the little bit that they do have.’ 
MRK.4.26	Then Jesus said, ‘I will tell you a story about the 
MRK.4.27	Then he sleeps each night and he wakes each day. The seeds start to grow into plants. They continue to grow. The man does not know how this happens. 
MRK.4.28	The 
MRK.4.29	When the new seeds have completely grown, the man will cut the plants down immediately. It is time for him to take the seeds to use for food.’
MRK.4.30	Jesus said, ‘I will tell you another story about the 
MRK.4.31	It is like this: A man takes a seed of the plant called mustard. He plants it in the 
MRK.4.32	But when it starts to grow, it becomes bigger than the largest bush. It will have big branches. And the birds will come from the sky and they will live there. They will build their homes in the shade of the branches.’
MRK.4.33	Jesus taught God's message to the people. He used many stories like these. He told the people as much as they could understand. 
MRK.4.34	He always used stories to teach the people. Then he explained everything to his own 
MRK.4.35	On that same day, in the evening, Jesus said to his 
MRK.4.36	So they went and left the crowd behind. Jesus was already in the boat. So the 
MRK.4.37	Then a strong wind began to blow across the lake. Water began to go into the boat and fill it. Soon the boat was almost going under the water. 
MRK.4.38	Jesus was in a comfortable place at the back of the boat. He was sleeping. The 
MRK.4.39	Jesus woke up and he spoke strongly to the wind and to the water. ‘Be quiet!’ he said. ‘Stop!’ Then the wind and the water became quiet again.
MRK.4.40	Jesus said to his 
MRK.4.41	Then the 
MRK.5.1	Jesus and his 
MRK.5.2+MRK.5.3+MRK.5.4	Jesus got out of the boat. Immediately a man with a bad 
MRK.5.5	The man often walked in the place where the dead people were and on the hills. During each day and each night, he screamed and he used stones to cut himself.
MRK.5.6	He saw Jesus a long way away and he ran to meet him. He went down on his knees in front of Jesus. 
MRK.5.7	He screamed loudly, ‘Jesus, you are the Son of the powerful God who is over all! We have nothing in common! Please, promise God that you will not hurt me.’ 
MRK.5.8	He said that because Jesus had already said to the bad 
MRK.5.9	Then Jesus asked the man, ‘What is your name?’
MRK.5.9	The man replied, ‘My name is Army because there are so many bad 
MRK.5.10	He said to Jesus many times, ‘Please do not send these bad 
MRK.5.11	A large group of pigs was eating on the hill. 
MRK.5.12	The bad 
MRK.5.13	Jesus let them do this. So, the bad 
MRK.5.14	The men who were taking 
MRK.5.15	They came to Jesus. They saw the man that the army of bad 
MRK.5.16	The people who had seen these events spoke to the other people. They told them what had happened to the man with the bad 
MRK.5.17	Then the people who lived there said to Jesus, ‘Please go away. Leave our part of the country.’
MRK.5.18	Jesus got back into the boat. The man that the bad 
MRK.5.19	But Jesus did not let him do this. Jesus said to him, ‘Go to your home and to your friends. Tell them what the 
MRK.5.20	So the man went away. He began to speak to many people in the 10 cities there. He told them about the great things that Jesus had done for him. All the people were very surprised.
MRK.5.21	Jesus returned to the other side of the lake in the boat. While he was by the lake, a large crowd came to him there. 
MRK.5.22	A man called Jairus came to Jesus. He was a leader at the 
MRK.5.23	He said, ‘My little daughter is very ill and she will die very soon. Please, please come to my house and put your hands on her. Then she will get better and she will live.’ 
MRK.5.24	So Jesus went with Jairus.
MRK.5.24	A large crowd followed Jesus. The people were pushing against him. 
MRK.5.25	There was a sick woman who had lost blood for 12 years. 
MRK.5.26	She had paid many doctors to help her to become well. But they could not do anything. Now she had spent all her money and she had not become any better. Instead, she became worse. 
MRK.5.27	People had told her about Jesus. So she came in the crowd behind him and she touched his coat. 
MRK.5.28	She said, ‘Even if I can only touch his clothes, I will become well again.’ 
MRK.5.29	As soon as she touched Jesus' coat, the blood stopped. Her body felt better. She knew that she was well again. 
MRK.5.30	Jesus knew immediately that something powerful had gone out from him. So he turned round in the crowd and he asked, ‘Who touched my clothes?’
MRK.5.31	His 
MRK.5.32	But Jesus looked round him. He wanted to see who had touched him. 
MRK.5.33	The woman knew what had happened to her. She felt very afraid. But she came to Jesus, and she went down on her knees in front of him. Then she told him everything that had happened to her. 
MRK.5.34	Jesus said to her, ‘Young woman, you are now well again because you believed in me. Do not have any more troubles in your mind. Go now and have no more pain.’
MRK.5.35	While Jesus was still speaking, some men arrived from Jairus's house. Jairus was the leader at the 
MRK.5.36	Jesus heard what the men said to Jairus. But Jesus said to him, ‘Do not be afraid. Instead, believe.’
MRK.5.37	Jesus took only Peter, James and James's brother, John, with him. He would not let anyone else go with him. 
MRK.5.38	Then they came to Jairus' house. Jesus saw that there were many people there. They were crying and they were making a loud noise. 
MRK.5.39	Jesus went into the house and he said to the people, ‘You should not be crying and making a loud noise. The child is not dead. She is asleep.’ 
MRK.5.40	The people 
MRK.5.40	Then Jesus sent them all out of the house. He went into the place where the child was lying. The child's father and mother went with him. He also took Peter, James and John with him. 
MRK.5.41	Then Jesus held the little girl's hand. He said to her, ‘Talitha koum.’ This means, ‘Little girl, I ask you to stand up.’ 
MRK.5.42	The little girl stood up immediately and she walked about. She was 12 years old. The people there were very surprised. 
MRK.5.43	Jesus said to them, ‘You must not tell anyone what has happened here. Now give the little girl something to eat.’
MRK.6.1	Jesus left that place. He went to his own town. His 
MRK.6.2	When it was the 
MRK.6.3	Really, we know who this man is. He is the 
MRK.6.4	Then Jesus said to them, ‘If a man is a 
MRK.6.5	Jesus could not do any powerful things in that town. But he did put his hands on a few sick people and he made them well. 
MRK.6.6	Jesus was very surprised because the people in that town would not believe in him.
MRK.6.6	Then he went to visit the villages round there. He was teaching the people who lived in those villages.
MRK.6.7	Jesus asked his 12 
MRK.6.8	Jesus told the 
MRK.6.9	Wear shoes but do not take extra clothes. 
MRK.6.10	In each town, stay at the first house that you go into. Continue to stay there until you leave that town. 
MRK.6.11	Perhaps you might go to a town where the people do not accept you. They will not listen to you. So you should leave that town. Clean that town's dirt off your feet. Then it will be clear that they have done something wrong.’
MRK.6.12	So the 12 
MRK.6.13	The 
MRK.6.14	People were talking about Jesus and they told King Herod about these things. Some people were saying that Jesus was really John the 
MRK.6.15	Other people said, ‘This man is Elijah.’ And other people said, ‘He is a 
MRK.6.16	But when someone told Herod, he said, ‘This is John. I sent a soldier to cut off his head. But he has become alive again!’
MRK.6.17	Herod himself had sent his soldiers to take hold of John. He had said to his soldiers, ‘Tie his hands and feet and put him in prison.’ Herod had done that because of his wife, Herodias. She had been the wife of Herod's brother Philip. But Herod had married her. 
MRK.6.18	John had said to him, ‘Herodias is your brother's wife. It is not right for you to have her as your wife.’ 
MRK.6.19	So, Herodias was very much against John. She wanted to kill him. But she could not do that. 
MRK.6.20	That was because Herod was afraid of John. Herod knew that John was a good man and a servant of God. So Herod kept John safe. Herod liked to listen to what John said. But he did not know what to think about the things that John said.
MRK.6.21	Then, on one day, Herodias had her chance. It was Herod's birthday and he asked many people to come to a special meal. Important men and officers came, and the rulers from Galilee were also there. 
MRK.6.22	The daughter of Herodias came in and she danced. Herod and his visitors were very happy when they saw her dance.
MRK.6.22	The king said to the girl, ‘Ask me for anything that you want. I will give it to you.’ 
MRK.6.23	He made a strong promise, ‘I will give you anything that you ask me to give to you. I will even give you half of everything that I rule over.’
MRK.6.24	The girl went out and she said to her mother, ‘What should I ask him for?’ Her mother replied, ‘Ask for the head of John the 
MRK.6.25	The girl went quickly to Herod and she said to him, ‘I want the head of John the 
MRK.6.26	Then Herod felt very sad. But he did not want to refuse her, because he had made a special promise. All his visitors had heard him. 
MRK.6.27	So, immediately, the king sent a soldier to go to John. The king told the soldier that he must bring John's head. So the soldier went to the prison and he cut off John's head there. 
MRK.6.28	Then he brought it back on a plate. He gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	People told John's 
MRK.6.30	The 
MRK.6.31	Many people were coming to Jesus and then going away. Jesus and his 
MRK.6.32	So they left all the people behind. They went away in a boat together to a quiet place. 
MRK.6.33	But many people saw that they were leaving the town. Those people recognised them. So they ran out from all the towns round there. They went on land and reached the place before Jesus and the 
MRK.6.34	Jesus got out of the boat and he saw a large crowd. He felt sorry for them. He thought to himself, ‘These people are like sheep that have nobody to take 
MRK.6.35	When it was almost evening time, Jesus' 
MRK.6.36	The people do not have anything to eat. So send them away now. Tell them to go to the farms and villages that are near here. Then they can buy some food for themselves to eat.’
MRK.6.37	‘You should give them some food to eat,’ Jesus replied.
MRK.6.37	But the 
MRK.6.38	Jesus asked them, ‘How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.’ When they had looked, they told Jesus, ‘We have 5 loaves and 2 fishes.’
MRK.6.39	Then Jesus told all the people to sit down on the green grass. He wanted them to sit in large groups. 
MRK.6.40	So the people sat down in groups. Each group had 50 or 100 people in it. 
MRK.6.41	Then Jesus took the 5 loaves of bread and the 2 fishes. He looked up to 
MRK.6.42	Everyone ate and they all had enough food. They were not hungry any more. 
MRK.6.43	Jesus' 
MRK.6.44	There were 5000 men in the crowd that ate the food there. 
MRK.6.45	Immediately after this, Jesus said to his 
MRK.6.46	So, he said ‘Goodbye’ to the crowd. Then he went up on a mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	That evening, the boat with the 
MRK.6.48	But he could see his 
MRK.6.49	But they saw that he was walking on the water. They thought, ‘It is a 
MRK.6.50	They all saw him and they were very afraid. But immediately Jesus said to them, ‘Be brave. It is I. Do not be afraid.’ 
MRK.6.51	Then Jesus climbed up into the boat to be with them. The strong wind stopped. The 
MRK.6.52	They did not understand what Jesus had done with the loaves of bread. They were not ready to learn.
MRK.6.53	They sailed across the lake. They reached the shore at Gennesaret and they tied the boat there. 
MRK.6.54	When they got out of the boat, the people recognised Jesus immediately. 
MRK.6.55	They went to tell everyone who lived in places near there. They brought sick people to Jesus. They carried those people to him on 
MRK.6.56	Jesus went to villages, towns and farms. Everywhere that he went, they brought sick people to the markets in those places. The sick people asked Jesus for help. They wanted to touch even the edge of his coat. Every sick person who touched him became well.
MRK.7.1	A group of 
MRK.7.2	They had been watching Jesus' 
MRK.7.3	(The 
MRK.7.4	When they come from the market place, they must always wash carefully. Unless they do this, they cannot eat. Their leaders had also taught them about how they should do lots of things. For example, there are rules about how they should wash cups, pots and metal bowls.) 
MRK.7.5	The 
MRK.7.6	Jesus said to them, ‘You are 
MRK.7.6	God says, “These people say good things about me,
MRK.7.6	but they do not really want to obey me.
MRK.7.7	They say that I am great.
MRK.7.7	But what they say has no purpose.
MRK.7.7	They teach their own rules, which I did not give to them.” ’
MRK.7.8	Jesus went on to say, ‘You have stopped obeying God. Instead you obey the ideas that men teach.’
MRK.7.9	He said to them, ‘You are very careful to refuse God's rules, because then you can keep your own ideas! 
MRK.7.10	For example, Moses wrote, “You must love your father and your mother and obey them.” He also said, “A person should die if he says bad things against his father or against his mother.” 
MRK.7.11	But you teach that a person may say to his father or to his mother, “I would have given these gifts to you. But I cannot because I have given them to God instead.” 
MRK.7.12	Then, you let him do nothing for his father or for his mother. 
MRK.7.13	This shows that you have not obeyed what God says is right. Instead, you have obeyed the ideas that you received from your leaders many years ago. And you do many other things like that.’
MRK.7.14	Jesus asked the crowd of people to come to him again. He said to them, ‘Listen to me, all of you, so that you can understand these things. 
MRK.7.15	People do not become dirty because of things that go into their bodies from outside. They become dirty because of the things that come out from their minds. [
MRK.7.16	You have heard my words. So do what I say.’]
MRK.7.17	Jesus left the crowd of people and he went into a house. Then his 
MRK.7.18	Jesus said, ‘I am surprised that you too do not understand what I am saying. You should understand that food will not make a person dirty. Food goes into a person's body from outside. 
MRK.7.19	But food does not go into the mind of a person. It goes into their stomach and then it passes out of their body.’
MRK.7.19	When Jesus said this, he was teaching that all foods are clean.
MRK.7.20	Jesus went on to say, ‘People become dirty because of what comes out from them, not because of what goes in. 
MRK.7.21	So, bad thoughts come from a person's mind, and as a result he does wrong things. He might have sex in wrong ways. He might rob somebody. He might kill somebody. He might have sex with another man's wife. 
MRK.7.22	He may want too much for himself. He may be cruel to other people. He might tell 
MRK.7.23	All these wrong things begin inside people's minds and then come out. That is what makes them dirty in front of God.’
MRK.7.24	Then, Jesus left that place. He went away to a place near the city called Tyre. He went into a house. He did not want anyone to know that he was there. But it was not possible to keep this a secret. 
MRK.7.25	Immediately, a certain woman heard that he was there. This woman had a daughter who had a bad 
MRK.7.26	She was not a 
MRK.7.27	Jesus said to the woman, ‘First, the children must eat all that they want. It is not right to take food from the children and then throw it to the dogs.’
MRK.7.28	The woman replied, ‘Yes, sir. That is true. But small pieces of food drop while the children eat. And the dogs under the table eat those pieces.’
MRK.7.29	‘That is a good answer,’ Jesus replied. ‘Now the bad 
MRK.7.30	The woman went to her home. She saw her child, who was lying on the bed. The bad 
MRK.7.31	Then Jesus went away from Tyre. He travelled through the city called Sidon, and went towards Lake Galilee. He was near the towns called ‘The 10 cities’.
MRK.7.32	Some people brought a man to Jesus. This man could not hear anything and he could not speak clearly. The people asked Jesus to put his hand on the man.
MRK.7.33	Jesus led the man away from the crowd. He put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he 
MRK.7.34	Jesus looked up towards 
MRK.7.35	When he said this, the man started to hear. Also, his 
MRK.7.36	Jesus told the people that they must not tell anyone about this. But every time Jesus asked them not to say anything, they spoke even more about it. 
MRK.7.37	The people were very surprised about everything that Jesus did. They said, ‘Jesus has done everything well. If people cannot hear, Jesus makes them able to hear. If people cannot speak, Jesus makes them able to speak.’
MRK.8.1	At that time, another large crowd had come to hear Jesus. The people had nothing to eat. Jesus asked his 
MRK.8.2	‘I feel sorry for this crowd. They have been here with me now for three days and they do not have any food. 
MRK.8.3	I do not want to send them back to their homes while they are hungry. They might fall down during their journey because they are weak. Some of them have travelled a long way to come here.’
MRK.8.4	The 
MRK.8.5	‘How many loaves of bread do you have?’ Jesus asked. ‘We have 7 loaves,’ they replied.
MRK.8.6	Jesus told the crowd that they should sit down on the ground. Then he took the 7 loaves in his hands and he thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and he gave the pieces to his 
MRK.8.7	The 
MRK.8.8	The people ate, and they all had enough food. After the people had eaten, there were still lots of small pieces of food. Jesus' 
MRK.8.9	About 4000 people were there and ate the food. Then Jesus sent the people away. 
MRK.8.10	Immediately, he got into the boat with his 
MRK.8.11	Some 
MRK.8.12	Jesus cried with a low, sad sound. ‘People who are alive today want God to show them something powerful,’ he said. ‘But God will not do the powerful thing for them that they want. What I say is true.’ 
MRK.8.13	Then Jesus left those 
MRK.8.14	Jesus' 
MRK.8.15	Jesus said to them, ‘Be careful. You must not let the 
MRK.8.16	The 
MRK.8.17	Jesus knew what they were talking about. So he said to them, ‘You should not be arguing about the bread. You still do not understand my teaching. You seem unable to learn. 
MRK.8.18	You are like people who have eyes but cannot see with them. You are like people who have ears but cannot hear with them. 
MRK.8.19	Remember that I used 5 loaves of bread to feed 5000 men. How many baskets did you fill with pieces of food that were left?’
MRK.8.19	‘There were 12 baskets,’ they replied.
MRK.8.20	Jesus asked them, ‘I also used 7 loaves to feed 4000 people. That time, how many baskets did you fill with pieces of food?’
MRK.8.20	‘There were 7 baskets,’ they replied.
MRK.8.21	‘You really should understand about me now,’ he said to them.
MRK.8.22	Jesus and his 
MRK.8.23	Jesus took the 
MRK.8.24	The man looked up. ‘I can see people,’ he replied. ‘But they seem like trees that are walking about.’
MRK.8.25	So Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes again. The man looked carefully and then his eyes were well. Now he could see everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	Jesus told the man that he must go back to his house. Jesus said, ‘Do not even go into the village.’
MRK.8.27	Then Jesus and his 
MRK.8.28	They replied, ‘Some people say that you are John the 
MRK.8.29	‘But what do you think?’ Jesus asked them. ‘Who do you say that I am?’
MRK.8.29	Peter answered him, ‘You are the 
MRK.8.30	Then Jesus said strongly to his 
MRK.8.31	Then Jesus began to teach his 
MRK.8.32	What Jesus said was very clear. Then Peter took Jesus away from the other 
MRK.8.33	Jesus turned round and he looked at his 
MRK.8.34	Then Jesus asked the crowd and his 
MRK.8.35	Whoever wants to keep his own life safe will lose it. But whoever gives his life to 
MRK.8.36	A person could get everything in the whole world for himself. But if he loses his life, this would not be any good for him. 
MRK.8.37	There is nothing that a person can give to get back his life. 
MRK.8.38	People who are living today do not obey God. They are very bad. But you must not be ashamed of me or of my words. If you are, then the 
MRK.9.1	Jesus went on to say to them, ‘What I am saying is true. Some people who are standing here will see God's 
MRK.9.2	6 days after that, Jesus asked Peter, James and John to go with him. Jesus led them up a high mountain, where they were alone together. Peter, James and John saw Jesus change in front of them. 
MRK.9.3	His clothes became very white; they were shining. They were a brighter white than anyone on earth could wash them. 
MRK.9.4	Then Elijah and Moses appeared in front of the 3 
MRK.9.5	So Peter said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, it is good that we are here. Please let us build three huts. One hut will be for you. One hut will be for Moses. And one hut will be for Elijah.’ 
MRK.9.6	Peter did not really know what to say. That was because the 3 
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud appeared and it covered them all. A voice spoke from the cloud and it said, ‘This is my Son, and I love him. Listen to him.’
MRK.9.8	At that moment, the three 
MRK.9.9	While they were walking down the mountain again, Jesus said to the 3 
MRK.9.10	The 3 
MRK.9.11	Then the 3 
MRK.9.12	Jesus said to them, ‘Elijah does come first. He makes everything ready. But they wrote in God's book that people will give the 
MRK.9.13	But I tell you that Elijah has already come. People did to him all the things that they wanted to do. They already wrote in God's book that those things would happen to him.’ 
MRK.9.14	They reached the place where the other 
MRK.9.15	The people in the crowd saw Jesus and immediately they were very surprised. They ran to say ‘hello’ to Jesus.
MRK.9.16	Jesus asked his 
MRK.9.17	A man in the crowd answered. He said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, I brought my son to you. He is not able to speak because he has a bad 
MRK.9.18	When the bad 
MRK.9.19	Jesus replied, ‘You people today still do not believe in God. It is very difficult for me to be with you all this time. It is difficult for me to be patient with you. Bring the boy to me.’
MRK.9.20	So the people brought the boy to Jesus. When the bad 
MRK.9.21	Jesus asked the boy's father, ‘How long has he been like this?’
MRK.9.21	‘He has been like this since he was a small boy,’ the father replied. 
MRK.9.22	‘Often the 
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to the father, ‘You should not say, “If you can do anything.” Everything is possible for those people who believe.’
MRK.9.24	Immediately, the boy's father shouted, ‘Oh! I believe! Help me to believe more!’
MRK.9.25	Jesus saw that the crowd of people was quickly becoming bigger. So he told the bad 
MRK.9.26	The 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus held the boy's hand and he helped the boy to stand up.
MRK.9.28	Jesus went into a house and the 
MRK.9.29	Jesus said to them, ‘You must pray. This kind of 
MRK.9.30	Jesus and his 
MRK.9.31	That was because he was teaching his 
MRK.9.32	The 
MRK.9.33	Jesus and his 
MRK.9.34	But they did not say anything. They did not want to tell Jesus why they were arguing. On the way, they had argued about who was the most important 
MRK.9.35	Jesus sat down. He told the 12 
MRK.9.36	Then he took a child. He made the child stand in the middle of them all. Jesus hugged the child and he said to the 
MRK.9.37	‘If someone accepts a child like this because of me, then that person also accepts me. If he accepts me, then he is not only accepting me. He is also accepting my Father God, who sent me.’ 
MRK.9.38	John said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, we saw a man who is not in our group. He was causing bad 
MRK.9.39	‘Do not tell him to stop,’ Jesus said. ‘That man is using my authority to do powerful things. Someone who does that cannot soon say anything bad about me. 
MRK.9.40	If someone is not against us, he is working with us. 
MRK.9.41	Somebody may give you a cup of water because you are a servant of the 
MRK.9.42	A person who believes in me may not seem important. But you should never make that person do wrong things. Don't do that! It would be better if someone put a big stone round your neck and then he threw you into the sea!
MRK.9.43+MRK.9.44	If your hand causes you to do wrong things, you should cut it off. You will only have one hand, but you can have God's true life. It will be much worse for you if you keep both your hands and go to 
MRK.9.45+MRK.9.46	If your foot causes you to do wrong things, you should cut it off. You will only have one foot, but you can have God's true life. It will be much worse if you keep your two feet and go to 
MRK.9.47	If your eye causes you to do wrong things, then you should remove it. Then you will only have one eye, but you can go into the 
MRK.9.48	“In 
MRK.9.48	and the fire never goes out.” ’ 
MRK.9.49	‘God will put fire on everybody as people put salt on food.’ 
MRK.9.50	‘Salt is good. But if your salt is not salty any more, you cannot make it salty again. You should be like good salt and love each other. Do not cause trouble among yourselves.’
MRK.10.1	Then Jesus left that place and he went to Judea. And he went across the river Jordan to the east side. Crowds of people came to him again. So he taught them, as he usually did.
MRK.10.2	Some 
MRK.10.3	Jesus replied with a question: ‘What did Moses say was right for you?’ 
MRK.10.4	The 
MRK.10.5	Jesus said to them, ‘You did not want to obey God. That is why Moses made this rule for you. 
MRK.10.6	But at the start, when God made the world, he made people male and female. 
MRK.10.7	That is the reason that a man leaves his father and his mother. Then God joins him and his wife together. 
MRK.10.8	The man and the woman become like one body. They are not two separate people any longer. They have come together as one person. 
MRK.10.9	God has put them together to be husband and wife. So nobody should make them separate.’ 
MRK.10.10	When Jesus went into the house, the 
MRK.10.11	So Jesus said to them, ‘A man must not send his wife away and then marry another woman. If he does that, he has done a wrong thing. It is the same as if he had sex with another man's wife. 
MRK.10.12	In the same way, a woman must not leave her husband and then marry another man. She also has done a wrong thing. It is the same as if she had sex with another woman's husband.’
MRK.10.13	People were bringing little children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on each child's head. The 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw this, he was angry. He said to them, ‘Do not stop the children. Let them come to me. People must become like these children so that God can rule their lives. That is what the 
MRK.10.15	What I say is true. A person must become like a little child for God to rule in his life. If he does not become like a child, he will not come into the 
MRK.10.16	Then Jesus hugged the children. He put his hands on each of them. And he prayed that God would help them.
MRK.10.17	While Jesus went on his way, a man ran to him. He went down on his knees in front of Jesus. ‘Good Teacher,’ he said to Jesus, ‘what must I do so that I can live with God for ever?’
MRK.10.18	Jesus said to him, ‘Why do you say that I am good? Only God is good. Nobody else. 
MRK.10.19	You know God's rules:
MRK.10.19	“Do not kill anyone.
MRK.10.19	Do not have sex with anyone who is not your wife.
MRK.10.19	Do not rob anyone.
MRK.10.19	Do not say things that are not true about people.
MRK.10.19	Do not take things that are not yours.
MRK.10.19	Love your father and your mother, and obey them.” ’

MRK.10.21	Jesus looked at the man and Jesus loved him. Jesus said to him, ‘There is still just one thing that you must do. Go now. Sell everything that you have. Then give the money to poor people. If you do that, you will have many valuable things in 
MRK.10.22	When the man heard that, his face became sad. He was a very rich man. Because of that, he went away and he was very sad.
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked round and he said to his 
MRK.10.24	They were very surprised about Jesus' words. Jesus spoke again to them: ‘My friends, it is very difficult for anyone to let God rule in their life. 
MRK.10.25	The hole in a 
MRK.10.26	Then Jesus' 
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and he replied, ‘For people, it really is impossible. But God can do it. God can do everything.’
MRK.10.28	Peter said to Jesus, ‘Look! We have left everything that we had. Now we are your 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, ‘What I say is true. Some people have left their home. Or they may have left their brothers or sisters. Or they may have left their mother or their father. Or they may have left their children or their fields. They have done that because of me. And they have done it because of God's good news. 
MRK.10.30	Now, in this world, God will give those people many more things than they have left behind, even 100 times! Yes, they will receive houses and brothers and sisters. They will receive mothers and children and fields. As well as all this, people will be against them. But in the future world, they will live for ever with God. 
MRK.10.31	But many people who are very important now will not be important then. And people who are not important now will become very important then.’
MRK.10.32	Jesus and his 
MRK.10.33	‘Listen!’ he said to them. ‘We are going to Jerusalem. There, someone will deliver the 
MRK.10.34	Those people will 
MRK.10.35	James and John, who were Zebedee's sons, came to Jesus. ‘Teacher,’ they said, ‘we want to ask you for something. Please do it for us.’
MRK.10.36	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ Jesus asked them.
MRK.10.37	They said to him, ‘When you are king, we want to rule with you. One of us will sit at your right side and the other one at your left side.’
MRK.10.38	Jesus said to them, ‘You do not understand what you are asking for. I will have much pain and trouble. Are you ready to have the same pain? Are you ready to die in the way that I will die?’
MRK.10.39	James and John replied, ‘Yes, we can do all that.’
MRK.10.39	Jesus said to them, ‘Yes, that is true. You will have pain like mine. And people will want to kill you like me. 
MRK.10.40	But I cannot promise that you will sit at my right side or at my left side. God has chosen who will sit there. He has prepared the places for those people.’
MRK.10.41	When the other 10 
MRK.10.42	But Jesus told the 
MRK.10.43	But you should not be like that. Instead, the person who wants to be great among you must become like your servant. 
MRK.10.44	Anyone who wants to be the most important person among you must work hard for you all. 
MRK.10.45	Even the 
MRK.10.46	Then Jesus and his 
MRK.10.47	Somebody told Bartimaeus that Jesus from Nazareth was walking past him. So he began to shout. He said, ‘Jesus, 
MRK.10.48	Many people were angry with Bartimaeus. They told him that he should be quiet. But he shouted even louder than before, ‘
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped. He said to the people, ‘Tell the man to come here.’ So the people said to the 
MRK.10.50	So Bartimaeus threw away his coat. He jumped up and he came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	Then Jesus said to Bartimaeus, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’
MRK.10.51	The 
MRK.10.52	‘Go,’ Jesus said to him. ‘You are well now, because you believed in me.’ Immediately, Bartimaeus could see again. He followed Jesus along the road.
MRK.11.1	Jesus and his 
MRK.11.2	He said to them, ‘Go into the village that is in front of you. When you arrive there, you will immediately see a young 
MRK.11.3	Someone may ask you, “Why are you doing this?” Then say to him, “The Master needs the

MRK.11.5	Some people were standing there. They asked the two 
MRK.11.6	The 
MRK.11.7	The two 
MRK.11.8	Many people then put their coats down on the road. Other people cut branches down from trees in the fields. They put the branches down on the road as well. 
MRK.11.9	Many people went in front of Jesus, and other people followed him. All of them were shouting,
MRK.11.9	‘We 
MRK.11.9	Great is the king who comes with the authority of the 
MRK.11.10	Great will be the 
MRK.11.10	We 
MRK.11.11	Jesus went into Jerusalem and went to 
MRK.11.12	On the next day, they left Bethany, and Jesus was hungry. 
MRK.11.13	He saw a 
MRK.11.14	So Jesus said to the tree, ‘Nobody will ever eat your fruit again.’ And his 
MRK.11.15	When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus went into the yard of 
MRK.11.16	Jesus would not let anyone carry things through that place. 
MRK.11.17	While he was teaching the people, Jesus said, ‘The Bible says, “God's house will be a place where people from all countries pray.” But you have changed it into a place where robbers meet.’
MRK.11.18	The leaders of the 
MRK.11.19	When it was evening, Jesus and his 
MRK.11.20	The next morning, Jesus and his 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered what Jesus had said. So he said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, look at that 
MRK.11.22	So Jesus said to them, ‘You must believe in God. 
MRK.11.23	What I say is true. A person could say to this mountain, “Move and throw yourself into the sea.” Then it will happen like he says. But he must not let other ideas come into his mind. He must really believe that those things will happen. If he does believe it, God will do those things for him. 
MRK.11.24	So I tell you this. When you pray to ask God for anything, believe in him. Believe that you have received that thing. Then you will have whatever you have asked for. 
MRK.11.25	But when you stand up to pray, first you must 
MRK.11.27	Jesus and his 
MRK.11.28	They asked him, ‘What authority do you have to do these things? Who gave you the authority to do them?’
MRK.11.29	Jesus replied, ‘I will ask you one question, and you should answer me. If you do that, then I will answer your question. I will tell you what authority I have to do these things. 
MRK.11.30	John 
MRK.11.31	Then the 
MRK.11.32	But we do not want to say that only men gave John his authority.’ The 
MRK.11.33	So the 
MRK.11.33	So, Jesus said to them, ‘You will not answer my question. So I will not tell you what authority I have to do these things.’
MRK.12.1	Then Jesus began to speak again to the important 
MRK.12.2	The time to cut the 
MRK.12.3	But the farmers took hold of the servant and they hit him with sticks. They sent him away with nothing. 
MRK.12.4	So the man sent another servant to the farmers. They also hit this servant on the head, and they did other bad things to him. 
MRK.12.5	The man then sent another servant, but the farmers killed this servant. He sent many other servants to them. The farmers hit some of these servants with sticks, and they killed other servants.
MRK.12.6	The man had only one person that he could still send. This was his own son, and the man loved him very much. So, last of all, he sent his son to the farmers. He thought, “The farmers will surely 
MRK.12.7	But those farmers said to each other, “This is the son of our master. He will receive the garden when his father dies. We should kill the son and then the garden will be ours.” 
MRK.12.8	So, the farmers took the son and they killed him. Then they threw his dead body out of the garden.’
MRK.12.9	Jesus went on to ask, ‘What will the master of the garden do then? I tell you, he will come and he will kill those farmers. Then he will give the garden to other people to work in. 
MRK.12.10	I am sure that you have read these words in the Bible:
MRK.12.10	“The builders refused to use a certain stone.
MRK.12.10	They thought that it had no value.
MRK.12.10	But now that stone has become the most important stone at the corner of the building.
MRK.12.11	The 
MRK.12.11	And we can see that he did something great.” ’ 
MRK.12.12	The 
MRK.12.13	Then the leaders sent some 
MRK.12.14	These men came to Jesus and they said, ‘Teacher, we know that you only say true things. It does not matter to you what other people think. If someone is important, you do not change your answers to make them happy. You really do teach us what God wants us to do. Tell us, should we pay our 
MRK.12.15	Jesus knew that those men were not honest. So he said, ‘You just ask that question to cause trouble for me. Now, bring me a coin. I want to see it.’ 
MRK.12.16	So they brought a coin to him. Jesus asked them, ‘Whose picture is on this coin? Whose name is on it?’
MRK.12.16	They replied, ‘It is 
MRK.12.17	Jesus then said to them, ‘So you should give to 
MRK.12.17	They were very surprised at his answer.
MRK.12.18	Also, some 
MRK.12.19	‘Teacher,’ they said to him, ‘Moses wrote these things for us in the Bible: If a man dies without children, his brother must marry the man's wife. Then their children will be called the children of the brother who died. 
MRK.12.20	But once there were 7 brothers. The oldest brother married a wife. But he died before they had any children. 
MRK.12.21	So the second brother married her. He also died without children. Then the third brother married this woman. 
MRK.12.22	And the same thing happened to all 7 brothers. They all died but they had no children. After all this, the woman also died. 
MRK.12.23	You teach that at some time dead people will become alive again. On that day, whose wife will that woman be? She had married all 7 of those brothers.’
MRK.12.24	Jesus said to the 
MRK.12.25	All people who have died will become alive again one day. But then men and women will not marry. They will not have husbands or wives. Instead, they will be like the 
MRK.12.26	But God does really make dead people alive again. You have read what Moses wrote about the bush in the 
MRK.12.27	God is not the God of people who are dead. He is the God of people who are alive. So you see, you are very wrong.’
MRK.12.28	One of the teachers of God's 
MRK.12.29	Jesus replied, ‘This rule is the most important rule: “Listen, everyone from 
MRK.12.30	You should love the 
MRK.12.31	The second most important rule is this: “You should love other people as much as you love yourself.” No other rules are as important as these two.’
MRK.12.32	The teacher of God's 
MRK.12.33	We must love him with all our mind. We must love him in all that we think and in all that we do. We must also love other people as much as we love ourselves. This is more important than all the gifts or animals that we could offer to God.’
MRK.12.34	Jesus heard that the man had answered well. So Jesus said to him, ‘You are almost ready for God to rule in your life.’ After that, everybody was afraid to ask Jesus any more questions.
MRK.12.35	Jesus was teaching people in the yard at 
MRK.12.36	The 
MRK.12.36	“The 
MRK.12.36	Sit at my right side until I beat your enemies completely.
MRK.12.36	You will even be able to put your feet on them.”
MRK.12.37	In these words, David himself calls the 
MRK.12.37	The large crowd liked to listen to the things that Jesus was saying. It made them happy.
MRK.12.38	While Jesus was teaching the people, he said, ‘Be careful not to do the same as the teachers of God's 
MRK.12.39	They want to sit in the best seats in the meeting places. They choose the most important places at special meals. 
MRK.12.40	But these men take things away from women after their husbands have died, even their houses. Then they pray for a long time so that other people will 
MRK.12.41	The crowd were giving their gifts for 
MRK.12.42	But then a woman came there. Her husband had died and she was very poor. She put two small coins that had only a little value into the box.
MRK.12.43	Jesus asked his 
MRK.12.44	All those rich people have plenty of money. They only put a small part of that into the box. But this woman has almost nothing. She put in all the money that she had. That was all the money that she needed to live.’
MRK.13.1	Then Jesus left 
MRK.13.2	Jesus said to him, ‘Yes, look at all these large buildings! But I tell you, enemies will completely destroy them. Not even one stone will remain on top of another stone.’
MRK.13.3	After that, Jesus was sitting on the hill called the 
MRK.13.4	They said to Jesus, ‘Please tell us when all these things will happen. What will show us that they are soon going to happen?’
MRK.13.5	Jesus began to say to them, ‘Be careful! Some people will tell you things that are not true. Do not believe those people. 
MRK.13.6	Many people will say that they have come on my behalf. They will say, “I am the 
MRK.13.7	You will hear about wars. And there will be reports about wars in other places. Do not be afraid. Those things must happen, but that is not yet the end of everything. 
MRK.13.8	People in one country will attack the people in another country. Kings and their armies will fight against other kings and their armies. The ground will move in many different places. Some people will be hungry, with no food. Those things are like the first pains that a mother has before her baby is born.
MRK.13.9	So, be careful! People will be against you. They will take you to stand in front of their leaders. They will 
MRK.13.10	Yes, you must first tell the good news about me to people in every country. 
MRK.13.11	When people take you to their leaders to show that you have done bad things, do not be afraid. Do not be troubled about what you should say. You should say the words that God gives you at that time. You will not be speaking your own words. Those words will come from the 
MRK.13.12	At that time, a man will let people kill his own brother. A father will let people kill his own child. Children will be against their parents. They will even ask people to kill their parents. 
MRK.13.13	All people will 
MRK.13.14	There will be a time when you will see a very bad thing. It is the very bad thing that destroys good things. You will see it in a place where it should not be. (When you read this, you must understand what it means.) At that time, people in Judea must run away to the hills to hide. 
MRK.13.15	A person who is on the roof of his house must not go down into the house. He must not stop to get anything from his home. 
MRK.13.16	A person who is outside in his field must not go back to his home. He must not return even to fetch his coat.
MRK.13.17	That will be a bad time for women who are soon to have a baby. It will also be a bad time for those women who have little babies. 
MRK.13.18	You must pray to God that this time of trouble will not happen in winter. 
MRK.13.19	Very bad troubles will happen to people at that time and cause them a lot of pain. Nothing as bad has ever happened before, since God made the world. Nothing as bad will ever happen again. 
MRK.13.20	The 
MRK.13.21	At that time, someone may say to you, “Look, here is the 
MRK.13.22	Some people will even say, “I am the 
MRK.13.23	So watch out! I have told you about all these things before they happen.
MRK.13.24	Then, after all these bad things have happened, the sun will become dark. The moon will not shine any more. 
MRK.13.25	Stars will fall out of the sky. And the powerful things in the sky will move from their usual places.
MRK.13.26	Then people will see the 
MRK.13.27	Then he will send his 
MRK.13.28	Here is a lesson for you to learn about the 
MRK.13.29	In the same way, you will see these strange things happening. Then you will know that the 
MRK.13.30	What I say to you is true. The people who are alive now will not all die until all these things happen. 
MRK.13.31	One day, the earth and the sky will have an end. But my words will be there for ever.
MRK.13.32	Nobody knows the day or the hour when all these things will happen. Only God the Father knows when they will happen. The 
MRK.13.33	Watch carefully! Keep awake! You do not know the time when all these things will happen. 
MRK.13.34	It is like when a man begins a journey. Before the master leaves his house, he gives authority to his servants. He tells each servant about the work that he should do. Then he tells the servant at the door to watch for his master's return.
MRK.13.35	So, you must watch carefully. You do not know when the master of the house will come back. He might arrive in the evening, or in the middle of the night. Or he might arrive early in the morning, or just before the sun rises. 
MRK.13.36	When he arrives, he may surprise you. He may even find you asleep! 
MRK.13.37	I am saying this to you. I am also saying this to everyone else. Always be ready!’
MRK.14.1	It was now two days before the 
MRK.14.2	They said to each other, ‘We do not want to do it during the 
MRK.14.3	Then Jesus went to Bethany, and he visited Simon at his house. At one time, Simon had had a bad illness of the skin. While Jesus was eating a meal there, a woman came into the house. She brought a small stone jar that contained expensive 
MRK.14.4	But some people became angry. They said to each other, ‘This woman should not have wasted the 
MRK.14.5	She could have sold it and she could have given the money to poor people. She could have sold it for more than 300 coins. A man would have to work for a year to get that much money.’ So, they spoke angrily to the woman.
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, ‘Do not speak to her like that! Do not cause trouble for her. She has done a good thing to me. 
MRK.14.7	You will always have poor people with you. You can help them at any time that you want. But you will not always have me with you. 
MRK.14.8	This woman did what she was able to do. She poured 
MRK.14.9	What I say to you is true. Everywhere in the world, people will speak about God's good news. At the same time, they will also tell people about the good thing that this woman has done. And so they will remember her.’
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot went to the leaders of the 
MRK.14.11	The leaders of the 
MRK.14.12	The first day of the 
MRK.14.13	So Jesus sent two 
MRK.14.14	He will go to a house. You must say to the master of that house, “The Teacher sends this message to you: ‘Where is the room for visitors? I will eat the 
MRK.14.15	Then the man will show you a large room upstairs. The room will have in it all the things that you will need. You should prepare the 
MRK.14.16	Then the two 
MRK.14.17	When it was evening, Jesus arrived with the 12 
MRK.14.18	While they were eating the meal, Jesus said, ‘What I say to you is true. One of you will help the 
MRK.14.19	The 
MRK.14.20	Jesus said to them, ‘It is one of you 12 
MRK.14.21	The 
MRK.14.22	While Jesus and his 
MRK.14.23	Then Jesus took a cup. He thanked God for the 
MRK.14.24	Jesus said to them, ‘This is my blood that shows God's promise. When I die, my blood will pour out of my body. In that way God will save many people. That is the promise that God makes because of my death. 
MRK.14.25	I tell you this. I will not drink 
MRK.14.26	Then Jesus and his 
MRK.14.27	Then Jesus said to the 
MRK.14.27	God says, “I will kill the 
MRK.14.27	Then the sheep will run away in different directions.” ’ 
MRK.14.28	Jesus went on to say, ‘But after that happens, I will become alive again. Then I will go to Galilee and you will follow.’
MRK.14.29	Peter said to Jesus, ‘Even if everyone else runs away, I will not leave you.’
MRK.14.30	‘What I say to you is true,’ Jesus replied to Peter. ‘Even tonight, you will say that you do not know me. You will say that three times before the 
MRK.14.31	But Peter said very strongly, ‘I will die with you if I need to. But I will never say that I do not know you.’ All the other 
MRK.14.32	Then they arrived at a garden called Gethsemane. Jesus said to his 
MRK.14.33	Jesus took Peter, James and John with him. He started to feel very sad and 
MRK.14.34	He said to them, ‘I am very sad. I feel as if I could die because I feel so sad. Wait here and stay awake.’
MRK.14.35	Jesus went a short way beyond them. He went down on the ground. He prayed that, if possible, God would save him from this time of trouble. 
MRK.14.36	He said, ‘Abba, my Father, you can do all things. Please take this great pain away from me. But I do not ask you to do what I want. Do what you want for me.’
MRK.14.37	Jesus returned to his 3 
MRK.14.38	You must keep awake and you must pray. Then you will not want to do something wrong. You really want to do the right thing, but your body is weak.’
MRK.14.39	Jesus went away again and he prayed in the same words. 
MRK.14.40	Then Jesus returned again to Peter, James and John. He saw that they were sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to him.
MRK.14.41	Then Jesus returned a third time to the 
MRK.14.42	Stand up, we will go now. Look! The man who will give me to my enemies is here.’
MRK.14.43	Jesus was still speaking when, immediately, Judas arrived. He was one of Jesus' 12 
MRK.14.44	Before this, Judas had told these men, ‘I will kiss one of the men. You must take hold of that man. Lead him away and do not let him go.’ 
MRK.14.45	When they arrived, Judas went immediately to Jesus. ‘Teacher,’ he said to Jesus. Then he kissed Jesus in a friendly way. 
MRK.14.46	So the men took hold of Jesus to lead him away. 
MRK.14.47	But a certain man who was standing there took hold of his 
MRK.14.48	Then Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, ‘You have come out here with long sharp knives and heavy sticks to take hold of me. Do you really think that I am leading people to fight against our country's rulers? 
MRK.14.49	No! I was with you every day when I was teaching people in the yard of 
MRK.14.50	Then all Jesus' 
MRK.14.51	A certain young man was following Jesus. He was wearing only one piece of cloth to cover himself. The men tried to take hold of this young man. 
MRK.14.52	But the young man left the piece of cloth behind, and he ran away. So when he ran away, he was not wearing anything. 
MRK.14.53	The men took Jesus to the most important 
MRK.14.54	Peter followed Jesus into the yard of Caiaphas' house. But he did not go near Jesus. He sat down in the yard with the 
MRK.14.55	The leaders of the 
MRK.14.56	Many people said things against Jesus that were not true. But they did not agree with each other in what they said. 
MRK.14.57	Then some men stood up and they said something else against Jesus that was not true. 
MRK.14.58	They said, ‘We heard Jesus say, “I will destroy 
MRK.14.59	Even then, these people who were speaking against Jesus did not say the same thing.
MRK.14.60	Then Caiaphas stood up in front of everyone. He said to Jesus, ‘You must reply now to what these men have said against you. Are the things that they are saying true?’ 
MRK.14.61	But Jesus did not reply. He did not say anything.
MRK.14.61	So again, Caiaphas asked Jesus, ‘Are you the 
MRK.14.62	‘I am,’ Jesus replied. ‘And you will all see the 
MRK.14.63	Then the most important 
MRK.14.64	‘You have heard the bad words that he has spoken against God. What do you decide that we must do with him?’
MRK.14.64	Everyone agreed that Jesus must die because of his bad words. 
MRK.14.65	Then some of the men began to 
MRK.14.66	Peter was still sitting outside in the yard. One of the young women who was a servant of the most important 
MRK.14.67	She saw Peter, who was making himself warm by the fire.
MRK.14.67	She looked at him and she said, ‘You also were a friend of Jesus, the man from Nazareth.’
MRK.14.68	Peter replied, ‘That is not true! I do not even know what you are talking about!’ Then Peter went out to the gate of the yard. Just then a 
MRK.14.69	The young woman watched him, and again she said to the other people there, ‘He is one of the men who were friends of Jesus.’ 
MRK.14.70	But Peter again said that it was not true.
MRK.14.70	After a little time, the other people who were standing there said to Peter, ‘We know you are from Galilee. So we are sure that you are one of those men.’ 
MRK.14.71	Then Peter began to speak very strongly to them. He said, ‘I do not know this man that you are talking about. God will surely punish me if this is not true!’ 
MRK.14.72	Immediately a 
MRK.14.72	When Peter thought about this, he cried very much.
MRK.15.1	Very early the next morning, all the 
MRK.15.2	Pilate asked Jesus, ‘Are you the king of the 
MRK.15.2	Jesus replied, ‘You have said it.’
MRK.15.3	Then the leaders of the 
MRK.15.4	So Pilate asked him again, ‘What is your answer? You should say something! Listen! They are saying that you have done many bad things.’
MRK.15.5	But Jesus still did not reply to what the men were saying against him. Pilate was very surprised about that.
MRK.15.6	Each year during the 
MRK.15.7	A man called Barabbas was in the prison at that time. He and some other men had fought against the 
MRK.15.8	The crowd came to Pilate. They asked him to do what he usually did at this time.
MRK.15.9	Pilate asked the people, ‘Do you want me to let the king of the 
MRK.15.10	Pilate knew why the leaders of the 
MRK.15.11	But the leaders of the 
MRK.15.12	Pilate asked the crowd again, ‘So what should I do to Jesus? He is the man that you call “the king of the

MRK.15.21	As the soldiers were taking Jesus out to that place, a man called Simon was there. He was coming in from outside the city. He was from the city called Cyrene, and he was the father of Alexander and Rufus. The soldiers told Simon that he must carry Jesus'

MRK.15.34	At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Jesus shouted loudly, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?’ That means, ‘My God, my God, why have you left me alone?’
MRK.15.35	Some people who were standing near there heard him. They said to each other, ‘Look! He is shouting to Elijah.’
MRK.15.36	One man ran to get a piece of cloth. He poured cheap

MRK.15.39	The captain of the soldiers was standing there in front of Jesus. He saw how Jesus died. ‘It must be true!’ he said. ‘This man really was the 
MRK.15.40	Some women were also there. They were watching these events from a long way away. Mary from Magdala was one of the women. Mary the mother of the younger James and Joses was also there. Salome was there too. 
MRK.15.41	These women had travelled with Jesus when he was in Galilee and they had helped him. Many other women were also there near the 
MRK.15.42	It was Friday and the 
MRK.15.43	That evening, a man called Joseph went to see Pilate. Joseph was from a town called Arimathea. He was a good man and he was one of the group of important 
MRK.15.44	Pilate was surprised that Jesus had already died. He asked the captain of the soldiers to come to him. He asked him if Jesus had already died. 
MRK.15.45	The captain told Pilate that Jesus was already dead. So then Pilate let Joseph go and take Jesus' dead body. 
MRK.15.46	Joseph bought a new piece of soft white cloth. He took Jesus' body down from the 
MRK.15.47	Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were watching. They saw where Joseph had put Jesus' dead body. 
MRK.16.1	After the day for rest had finished, the women bought some 
MRK.16.2	They went out very early in the morning on the first day of the week, Sunday. The sun was just rising. They went to the hole in the rock where Joseph had put Jesus' dead body. 
MRK.16.3	The women asked each other, ‘Who will roll away the heavy stone for us? It closes the hole in the rock where they buried Jesus.’
MRK.16.4	Then they looked and they saw the stone. It was a very big stone. But someone had already rolled it away from the hole. 
MRK.16.5	When the women went into the hole in the rock, they saw a young man there. He was sitting in there on the right side and he wore bright white clothes. The women were very afraid. 
MRK.16.6	The young man said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth. The soldiers killed him on a

MRK.16.9	Jesus became alive again early on the first day of the week. He appeared first to Mary from Magdala. Jesus had caused 7 bad 
MRK.16.10	She went to the people who had been with Jesus. They were all very sad and they were crying. Mary spoke to them. 
MRK.16.11	She told them that Jesus was alive. And she told them that she had seen him. But they did not believe it.
MRK.16.12	After these things had happened, Jesus appeared to two other 
MRK.16.13	Those two 
MRK.16.14	After that, Jesus appeared to the 11 
MRK.16.15	Then Jesus said to them, ‘Go to all people everywhere in the world. Tell God's good news to everyone. 
MRK.16.16	If a person believes in me, then you should

MRK.16.19	So, after the 
MRK.16.20	The 
LUK.1.1	Many people have written about the things that have happened in our country. 
LUK.1.2	Some people were present when these things started to happen. They saw everything that happened and they told us about it. They are the people who wrote down the 
LUK.1.3	I have checked the facts about what really happened. So now, I know about all the things that happened from the beginning. I am writing to make the facts clear to you, my important friend Theophilus. 
LUK.1.4	People have already taught you about these things. Now you can be sure that they are true.
LUK.1.5	There was a man whose name was Zechariah. He lived when Herod was king of Judea. Zechariah was a 
LUK.1.6	Zechariah and Elizabeth obeyed God all the time. They obeyed God's rules and did not do wrong things. God liked how they lived. 
LUK.1.7	But they had no children. Elizabeth could not have a baby and they were both getting old. 
LUK.1.8	One day, Zechariah's group was working at 
LUK.1.9	The 
LUK.1.10	While Zechariah was burning 
LUK.1.11	The 
LUK.1.12	When Zechariah saw the 
LUK.1.13	The 
LUK.1.14+LUK.1.15	He will be very important to the 
LUK.1.16	He will teach many people in 
LUK.1.17	John will prepare the people for the 
LUK.1.18	Zechariah asked the 
LUK.1.19	The 
LUK.1.20	Now listen to me. Because you did not believe my message, you will not be able to speak. You will not speak again until the time that your son is born. My message will really become true at the right time.’
LUK.1.21	While this was happening, the people outside were waiting for Zechariah. They were thinking, ‘Why has Zechariah stayed for such a long time in the special room? Why has he not come out yet?’ 
LUK.1.22	When he did come out, he tried to talk to them. But he could not speak. So they knew that God had showed him something special in the room. He was moving his head and his hands about, to tell them what had happened. But still he could not speak.
LUK.1.23	When Zechariah had finished his work in 
LUK.1.24	Soon, a baby was growing inside his wife Elizabeth. She stayed in her house for 5 months. 
LUK.1.25	‘The 
LUK.1.26	When Elizabeth's baby had grown inside her for nearly 6 months, God sent the 
LUK.1.27	Gabriel went there to visit a young woman. Her name was Mary. She had never had sex with anyone. She had promised to marry a man called Joseph. He belonged to the 
LUK.1.28	Gabriel went to Mary and said, ‘Hello, Mary. The Lord God loves you very much. He is very near to you.’
LUK.1.29	Mary had a lot of problems in her mind about what Gabriel said. She did not understand why he said it. 
LUK.1.30	‘Do not be afraid, Mary,’ Gabriel went on to say. ‘God has been kind to you. 
LUK.1.31	Listen! A baby boy will grow inside you. When he is born, you will call him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be great. People will call him the Son of the powerful God who is over all. The 
LUK.1.33	He will rule over the 
LUK.1.34	Mary asked, ‘How can this happen? I have never had sex with anyone.’ 
LUK.1.35	Gabriel answered, ‘The 
LUK.1.36	Another thing! Your cousin, Elizabeth, is very old. People said that she could not have a baby. Listen! She also will have a son. The baby has grown inside her now for nearly 6 months. 
LUK.1.37	There is nothing that God cannot do.’
LUK.1.38	Mary answered, ‘I am the servant of the 
LUK.1.39	After that, Mary prepared herself to travel. She hurried to a town in the hills of Judea. 
LUK.1.40	When she arrived at the home of Zechariah, she said, ‘Hello’ to Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary speak, she felt her baby move quickly inside her. The 
LUK.1.42	She spoke to Mary in a loud voice, ‘God has made you very happy. He has been good and kind to you more than to other women. He has also been good and kind to your baby. 
LUK.1.43	You are the mother of my 
LUK.1.44	Listen! When I heard you say, “Hello” to me, my baby moved quickly inside me. He was very happy. 
LUK.1.45	The 
LUK.1.46	Then Mary said,
LUK.1.46	‘All of me wants to 
LUK.1.46	“
LUK.1.47	I thank God because he is the one who saves me.
LUK.1.48	I know that I am not an important person.
LUK.1.48	God knows this, and he has been kind to me.
LUK.1.48	Listen! From now on, all people will say that God has made me happy.
LUK.1.49	Yes, God has done great things for me.
LUK.1.49	He is very powerful and strong. He is good in every way.
LUK.1.50	He is kind to people who 
LUK.1.50	He will always be kind to people like that.
LUK.1.51	He has shown how strong he is to do great things.
LUK.1.51	Some people think that they are very important.
LUK.1.51	But he has sent them away in different directions.
LUK.1.52	Some people were ruling countries.
LUK.1.52	But he has taken their power away from them.
LUK.1.52	He has given power to people who do not feel important.
LUK.1.53	He has fed hungry people with good things to eat.
LUK.1.53	But he has sent rich people away with nothing.
LUK.1.54	He promised that he would be kind to his people, 
LUK.1.54	Now he has come and helped them.
LUK.1.55	He made a promise to Abraham and to our other 
LUK.1.55	Now he has done what he promised.’ 
LUK.1.56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months. Then she returned to her home.
LUK.1.57	The time arrived for Elizabeth to have her baby. She had a son. 
LUK.1.58	Her family and the people who lived near her heard about her baby. They knew that the 
LUK.1.59	When the child was 8 days old, people came to 
LUK.1.60	Elizabeth said, ‘No. His name will be John.’
LUK.1.61	They replied, ‘But you do not have anybody in your family called John. That cannot be right.’ 
LUK.1.62	So they used 
LUK.1.63	Zechariah asked for something to write on. He wrote, ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was very surprised at what he wrote. 
LUK.1.64	Immediately, Zechariah could speak again. He could speak without difficulty. He began to thank God loudly. 
LUK.1.65	The people who lived near Zechariah and Elizabeth were very surprised. They saw how great God was. Many people who lived in the hills of Judea also talked about all these things. 
LUK.1.66	Everyone who heard about these things thought about them. They asked each other, ‘When this child becomes a man, what will he be?’ They could see that God really was with him.
LUK.1.67	The 
LUK.1.68	‘The 
LUK.1.68	He has come to save his people. He has come to make them free.
LUK.1.69	He has sent a very strong person who will save us.
LUK.1.69	This person comes from the 
LUK.1.70	Long ago, God promised that he would do this.
LUK.1.70	He gave his own 
LUK.1.71	God will save us from our enemies.
LUK.1.71	He will save us from everyone that 
LUK.1.72	He has promised to be kind to our 
LUK.1.72	He will remember to do the things that he promised.
LUK.1.73	Yes, he will remember the strong promises that he spoke to Abraham. 
LUK.1.74	God said, “I will keep you safe from your enemies.
LUK.1.74	Then you can 
LUK.1.75	You can live in a way that is good and right.
LUK.1.75	You can do this all your lives.” ’
LUK.1.76	Zechariah then spoke to John:
LUK.1.76	‘You, my child, will be called a 
LUK.1.76	You will go in front of the 
LUK.1.77	You will tell God's people how God can save them.
LUK.1.77	They have done wrong things but God will 
LUK.1.78	Our God will 
LUK.1.78	He will send someone from the highest place.
LUK.1.78	When this person comes, it will be like the sunrise for us.
LUK.1.79	He will bring light to people who are living without God.
LUK.1.79	It is like those people are living in the dark. They are afraid to die.
LUK.1.79	But he will shine on them.
LUK.1.79	He will show us how to live so that we will not be afraid.’ 
LUK.1.80	Zechariah's child grew. God made him strong in his mind. He went into the 
LUK.2.1	At that time, Caesar Augustus was ruling the whole 
LUK.2.2	This was the first time that the 
LUK.2.3	Everyone went to his own home town for the 
LUK.2.4	So Joseph went to his home town, Bethlehem. He was living in the town called Nazareth, in Galilee. Bethlehem was in Judea. King David had been born there, so Bethlehem was called the town of David. Joseph belonged to the 
LUK.2.5	Joseph took Mary with him so that the 
LUK.2.6	While they were in Bethlehem, after some time, her baby was born. 
LUK.2.7	This was her first baby, and it was a boy. She put cloths round him. Then she put him in an animal's feeding box. She did this because the rooms for visitors were full of people. 
LUK.2.8	That night some 
LUK.2.9	Then an 
LUK.2.10	The 
LUK.2.11	Something happened today in the town of David. Someone special was born. He is the one who will save you. He is the 
LUK.2.12	I will tell you how you will know this baby. You will find him with cloths round him. He is lying in an animal's feeding box.’
LUK.2.13	Just then many more 
LUK.2.14	‘God is great! He lives in the highest place.
LUK.2.14	He will be good to the people on earth that make him happy.
LUK.2.14	They will have 
LUK.2.15	After that, the 
LUK.2.16	So they went in a hurry to Bethlehem. When they got there, they found Mary and Joseph with the baby. The baby really was lying in a feeding box. 
LUK.2.17	After they had seen the baby, they told everybody about him. They told them what the 
LUK.2.18	Many people heard what the 
LUK.2.19	Mary remembered everything that the 
LUK.2.20	The 
LUK.2.21	When the baby was 8 days old, it was time for the 
LUK.2.22	Long ago, God gave Moses rules for his people to obey. One rule told people how to become 
LUK.2.23	This is the rule which 
LUK.2.24	When you do this, also bring two special birds for the 
LUK.2.25	At this time, a man called Simeon was living in Jerusalem. He was a good man and he obeyed God. He had waited a long time to see the special person who would save 
LUK.2.26	The 
LUK.2.27	Now the day had come. The 
LUK.2.28	Simeon went to them. He took Jesus and he held him in his arms. Then he thanked God. He said:
LUK.2.29	‘Master, I am your servant.
LUK.2.29	You have done what you promised to me.
LUK.2.29	Now I can die with no trouble in my mind.
LUK.2.30	I really have seen the person that you have sent to save your people.
LUK.2.31	You have sent him to the world and people everywhere will know about him.
LUK.2.32	He will bring light to people so that they can know you.
LUK.2.32	He will show you to those people who are not 
LUK.2.32	He will also show that your people of 
LUK.2.33	That is what Simeon said about Jesus. His message surprised Mary and Joseph very much.
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon asked God to be good and kind to Mary and to Joseph. After that, he spoke to Mary, the mother of Jesus. He said to her, ‘God has chosen this baby. Many people in 
LUK.2.35	This will show their secret thoughts about God. This will make you very sad, too. It will seem like a sharp knife is cutting into you. That is how sad you will be’.
LUK.2.36	A very old lady called Anna was also there in 
LUK.2.37	After that, she had lived alone until she was 84 years old. Now she never left 
LUK.2.38	At that moment, Anna came to where Mary and Joseph were standing in the
LUK.2.39	When Mary and Joseph had finished everything that God's rules said, they returned home. That was in the town called Nazareth in Galilee. 
LUK.2.40	There the child grew up. God was good and kind to him and he became strong. He learned many things and he could understand them well.
LUK.2.41	Every year, Mary and Joseph went to Jerusalem for the 
LUK.2.42	When Jesus was 12 years old, his parents took him with them to Jerusalem. They went as usual for the 
LUK.2.43	When the week finished, Mary and Joseph left Jerusalem to return home. But Jesus stayed behind and his parents did not know this. 
LUK.2.44	They thought that he was with their group on the way home. They travelled for a whole day. Then they began to look for him among their family and friends.
LUK.2.45	They could not find him, so they went back to Jerusalem. They looked for him there. 
LUK.2.46	After three days, they found him in 
LUK.2.47	Everyone who heard Jesus was very surprised. He understood so many things and he could answer difficult questions. 
LUK.2.48	When his parents saw him there, they were also very surprised. His mother said to him, ‘My son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have looked everywhere for you. We have had a lot of troubles in our mind.’
LUK.2.49	Jesus answered them, ‘You should not really have had to look for me. I must be doing what my Father wants me to do. Really, you should have known that.’ 
LUK.2.50	But they did not really understand what he was saying to them.
LUK.2.51	Then Jesus returned to Nazareth with them. He did what they wanted. His mother, Mary, was careful to remember all the special things that had happened. She thought about them a lot. 
LUK.2.52	Jesus grew up into a man. He became strong and he could understand more and more things. People thought he was a good man. God also thought well of him.
LUK.3.1	This report is about John, the son of Zechariah. It happened when Tiberius Caesar was ruling the 
LUK.3.2	At this time, the leaders of the 
LUK.3.3	John went to many places near the river Jordan and spoke a message from God. ‘You have done many wrong things,’ he taught everybody. ‘You must turn away from them and change how you live. Then God will 
LUK.3.4	The 
LUK.3.4	‘Somebody's voice is shouting in the 
LUK.3.4	“The 
LUK.3.4	Make the paths straight for him.
LUK.3.5	Fill in every valley and make every mountain and hill flat.
LUK.3.5	Take away every curve so that the road is straight.
LUK.3.5	Take away all the rocks so that the road is flat.

LUK.3.7	Crowds of people were going out into the 
LUK.3.8	You have to show that you are sorry. Change how you live. Stop doing things that God does not like. Do not begin to say to yourselves, “We are in the 
LUK.3.9	You are like trees that have bad fruit. God has an axe ready to use. He will cut down every tree that does not make good fruit. He will throw those trees into the fire.’ 
LUK.3.10	‘So, what should we do?’ the crowd asked.
LUK.3.11	John answered, ‘If you have two shirts, give one away. Give it to someone who does not have even one shirt. If you have some food, give some of it away. Give some to someone who has no food.’
LUK.3.12	In the crowd, there were people that took 
LUK.3.13	John told them, ‘You must take the right amount of money from people. You must not take more money than the rules say you should take.’
LUK.3.14	Then some soldiers asked John, ‘What about us? What should we do?’
LUK.3.14	‘Do not rob people of their money,’ John replied. ‘Do not say that a person has done something wrong, if he has not. It is wrong to get money by doing that. You should be happy with the money that you receive for your work.’ 
LUK.3.15	At this time people were thinking, ‘Is John the

LUK.4.1	Then Jesus returned from the river Jordan. He was full of the 
LUK.4.2	He stayed there for 40 days and he did not eat anything. During this time the 
LUK.4.3	The 
LUK.4.4	‘No!’ Jesus replied, ‘The Bible says that food alone cannot cause people to live.’ 
LUK.4.5	After that, the 
LUK.4.6	He said to Jesus, ‘I will let you rule the whole world. I will give you power over all these things. That power all belongs to me. So, I can give it to anyone that I choose. 
LUK.4.7	Just go down on your knees and 
LUK.4.8	‘No!’ Jesus replied, ‘The Bible says,
LUK.4.8	“Only 
LUK.4.8	He is the only one that you should obey.” ’ 
LUK.4.9	The 
LUK.4.10	You know that the Bible says:
LUK.4.10	“God will tell his 
LUK.4.11	“They will hold you safely in their hands.
LUK.4.11	They will not let you hurt your foot on a stone.” ’ 
LUK.4.12	‘No!’ Jesus replied. ‘The Bible says,
LUK.4.12	“Do not do a foolish thing to see if your

LUK.4.14	Then Jesus returned to Galilee. The 
LUK.4.15	He taught people in the 
LUK.4.16	Jesus went to Nazareth, the town where he had grown up. On the 
LUK.4.17	They gave him the book of messages that God had given to his 
LUK.4.18	‘The Spirit from the 
LUK.4.18	He has chosen me to tell good news to poor people.
LUK.4.18	He has sent me to tell people who are in prison, “You can go free!”
LUK.4.18	I must say to people that cannot see, “See again!”
LUK.4.18	I must cause people that are like slaves to be free.
LUK.4.19	I must tell everyone, “This is the year when God will save his people.” ’ 
LUK.4.20	When Jesus had read this to the people, he closed the book. He gave it back to an officer of the meeting place. Then he sat down to teach the people. Everyone in the meeting place was looking carefully at him.
LUK.4.21	Jesus said to them, ‘Today this message has become true. It has happened while you were listening.’
LUK.4.22	Everyone was talking about Jesus. They were surprised at the good way in which he spoke. They said to each other, ‘He is really only the son of Joseph. Isn't that true?’
LUK.4.23	Jesus then said to them, ‘Now you will tell me the 
LUK.4.24	I tell you this, people do not accept a 
LUK.4.25	What I tell you is true. There were many 
LUK.4.26	But God did not send Elijah to help a 
LUK.4.27	Here is another example: When God's 
LUK.4.28	The people in the meeting place heard what Jesus said. They became very angry. 
LUK.4.29	They stood up and they made him leave the town. They took him to the top of the hill where the town was. They wanted to throw him over the edge to the bottom. 
LUK.4.30	But Jesus walked through the middle of the crowd and he went away. 
LUK.4.31	Jesus went to a town in Galilee called Capernaum. On the 
LUK.4.32	The people were very surprised at the things that Jesus taught them. He spoke with authority. 
LUK.4.33	In the meeting place was a sick man. He had a 
LUK.4.34	He said, ‘Jesus from Nazareth, leave us alone! Do not destroy us! I know who you are. You are God's 
LUK.4.35	Jesus said to the 
LUK.4.36	All the people were very surprised and they said to each other, ‘Listen to what this man says! He has power and authority. He tells bad 
LUK.4.37	So, they began to tell everyone about Jesus. Because of this, people in all the places near Capernaum heard the news about Jesus.
LUK.4.38	Jesus then left the meeting place and he went to Simon's home. The mother of Simon's wife was ill and her body was very hot. So, they asked Jesus to make her well. 
LUK.4.39	Jesus came and he stood near her. He told the illness to go away and immediately she was well again. She got up and she prepared food for her visitors.
LUK.4.40	When the sun was going down, people in the town brought to Jesus all those people who were ill. They had many different kinds of illness. Jesus put his hands on each ill person and they became well again.
LUK.4.41	Also, bad 
LUK.4.42	Early the next morning, Jesus went to a place where he could be alone. The people went to look for him. When they found him they said, ‘Do not leave us! Please stay here with us.’ 
LUK.4.43	Jesus replied, ‘I must go to other towns to tell everyone the good news. I will tell them how God rules in the lives of his people. That is what God sent me to do.’
LUK.4.44	Then he travelled to many towns in the country called Judea. He went into the 
LUK.5.1	One day, Jesus was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret. A crowd was pushing to get near to him. They were listening to him. He was speaking God's message to them. 
LUK.5.2	Jesus saw two fishing boats at the edge of the lake. The 
LUK.5.3	One of the boats belonged to Simon. Jesus climbed into it. He asked Simon to push it away from the shore. Jesus sat in the boat and he started to teach the people. 
LUK.5.4	When Jesus finished teaching, he said to Simon, ‘Now take the boat out into deep water. Then put the 
LUK.5.5	Simon replied, ‘Teacher, we worked all last night and we did not catch anything. But because you say it, I will put the 
LUK.5.6	So they went and they put the 
LUK.5.7	So Simon shouted to the other 
LUK.5.8	When Simon saw all the fish, he went down on his knees in front of Jesus. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I am a bad man. So please go away from me.’ 
LUK.5.9	Simon said this because he was very surprised. He was surprised because they had caught so many fish. His friends in the other boat were also very surprised. 
LUK.5.10	James and John were very surprised too. They were Zebedee's sons and they worked with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, ‘Do not be afraid. You have been catching fish. From now on you will catch people!’
LUK.5.11	After that, they went and they pulled their boats up on the shore. Then they left everything behind and they went with Jesus. 
LUK.5.12	One day, Jesus was in a certain town. A man with a bad illness of the skin was there. 
LUK.5.12	When the man saw Jesus, he threw himself down on the ground in front of him. He said, ‘Sir, if you want, you can make me well again. Please do it.’
LUK.5.13	Jesus put out his hand towards the man and he touched him. He said, ‘I do want to help you. Be clean again!’ Immediately, the illness left the man. 
LUK.5.14	‘Do not tell anyone about this,’ Jesus said to him. ‘Instead, go and show yourself to the 
LUK.5.15	After this, more and more people started to hear the news about Jesus. Crowds were coming to hear him teach. Sick people also wanted him to make them well. 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus would often go away from the crowd to pray in quiet places.
LUK.5.17	One day, while Jesus was teaching in someone's house, many people were sitting there. Some of them were 
LUK.5.18	Then some men arrived. They were carrying a man on a 
LUK.5.19	But the house was full of people, and they could not get in. So, they carried the man on to the flat roof of the house. Then they made a hole in the roof. After that, they put the 
LUK.5.20	Jesus saw them. He knew that they believed in him. So he said to the sick man, ‘My friend, I 
LUK.5.21	The 
LUK.5.22	Jesus knew what these men were thinking. He told them, ‘You should not be thinking these things. 
LUK.5.23	I said to this man, “I 
LUK.5.24	But I want you to know this. I, the 
LUK.5.24	Then he said to the man who could not walk, ‘I am saying to you, “Stand up. Pick up your 
LUK.5.25	Immediately, the man stood up in front of them all. He picked up the 
LUK.5.26	What had happened surprised everyone. They said, ‘God is great and powerful! We have seen very strange and special things happen today.’ 
LUK.5.27	After this happened, Jesus went away from that house. He saw a man that took 
LUK.5.28	So Levi got up and he went with Jesus. He left everything behind.
LUK.5.29	Soon after this, Levi made a large meal for Jesus at his house. Many people also came and they were eating with them there. Many of these people also took 
LUK.5.30	Some 
LUK.5.31	Jesus answered them, ‘People who are well do not need a doctor. It is people who are ill that need a doctor. 
LUK.5.32	Some people think that they always obey God. I have not come to help people like that. Some people know that they have done wrong things. I am asking those people to come to me for help. I want them to change how they live.’
LUK.5.33	Then the 
LUK.5.34	Jesus answered them, ‘When a man marries a wife, his friends cannot refuse to eat food at that time. Nobody can stop them from eating while he is with them. 
LUK.5.35	But there will be a time when people will take that man away from his friends. Then they will stop eating food.’ 
LUK.5.36	Jesus told them this story: ‘Nobody tears a piece of cloth from a new coat to mend an old coat. If he does that, he will have torn the new coat. Also, the piece of cloth from the new coat will not look the same as the old coat. 
LUK.5.37	And nobody pours new 
LUK.5.38	Instead, you must put new 
LUK.5.39	Also, nobody wants to drink new 
LUK.6.1	On a 
LUK.6.2	Some of the 
LUK.6.3	Jesus replied, ‘You have certainly read about what David did one day. He and the men who were with him were hungry. 
LUK.6.4	He went into 
LUK.6.5	Then Jesus said to them, ‘The 
LUK.6.6	On another 
LUK.6.7	Some teachers of God's 
LUK.6.8	But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man, ‘Get up and stand in front of everyone.’ The man got up and he stood there. 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to the people, ‘Let me ask you something. Is it right for us to do good things on our day for rest? Or should we do bad things? Should we save a person's life? Or should we destroy their life?’ 
LUK.6.10	Jesus looked around at everyone. Then he said to the man, ‘Lift up your hand.’ When the man lifted his hand, it became well. He could use it again.
LUK.6.11	Then the 
LUK.6.12	One day Jesus went up a mountain to pray. He remained there all night and he was praying to God. 
LUK.6.13	In the morning, he asked all his 
LUK.6.14	Simon (Jesus gave him the name Peter),
LUK.6.14	Andrew (he was Simon's brother),
LUK.6.14	James,
LUK.6.14	John,
LUK.6.14	Philip,
LUK.6.14	Bartholomew,
LUK.6.15	Matthew,
LUK.6.15	Thomas,
LUK.6.15	James, the son of Alphaeus,
LUK.6.15	Simon the 
LUK.6.16	Judas, son of James,
LUK.6.16	Judas Iscariot. He later gave Jesus to the people who were against him. 
LUK.6.17	After Jesus had chosen these 12 men, they all came down the hill. He stopped and he stood on a flat place. A large crowd of his 
LUK.6.18	These people had all come to hear Jesus teach. Those people who were ill wanted him to make them well. He also made well those people who had bad 
LUK.6.19	All the people were trying to touch him, because he was using great power to make each person well.
LUK.6.20	Jesus looked at his 
LUK.6.20	‘Happy are you people that are poor. The 
LUK.6.21	Happy are you people that are hungry now. God will feed you until you are full. 
LUK.6.21	Happy are you people that are crying now. Later, you will laugh. 
LUK.6.22	People may 
LUK.6.23	God will prepare many good things for you in 
LUK.6.24	Listen, you that are rich.
LUK.6.24	You have a comfortable life now, but trouble will come to you.
LUK.6.25	Listen, you that are full with food now.
LUK.6.25	Trouble will come to you and you will be hungry.
LUK.6.25	Listen, you that are laughing now.
LUK.6.25	Trouble will come to you. You will be sad and you will cry.
LUK.6.26	Do people always say good things about you? Know that trouble will come to you. Long ago their 
LUK.6.27	Jesus went on to say, ‘I say this to you who are listening carefully to me: Love the people who want to hurt you. Do good things to people that 
LUK.6.28	Say good things to people that say bad things against you. Pray for people who give you pain.
LUK.6.29	Someone may slap you on one side of your face. Then you should let him slap the other side of your face too. Someone may take away your coat. If he does, do not stop him from taking your shirt also. 
LUK.6.30	When anyone asks you for something, give it to him. Someone may take something that belongs to you. If he does, let him keep it. Do not ask to have it back again. 
LUK.6.31	Do the good things for other people that you would want them to do for you.
LUK.6.32	Do you only love people who love you? God will not 
LUK.6.33	Do you only do good things to people that do good things to you? God will not 
LUK.6.34	Do you lend things only to people that will give your things back to you? Will God 
LUK.6.35	No! I am telling you to love people that want to hurt you. Do good things to them. Lend things to them and do not want to get them back again. Then God will prepare good things for you. He is kind even to people that do not say “thank you”. He is kind even to very bad people. If you live like this, you will show that you really are children of the powerful God who is over all. 
LUK.6.36	You should be kind to other people, as God your Father is kind.
LUK.6.37	Do not say to anyone, “You are a bad person.” Then God will not say to you, “You are bad person.” Do not say to anyone, “God should 
LUK.6.38	Give to other people and God will give to you. He will give to you even more than you gave. He will fill your pocket until no more will go in. It will be so full that it will come out over the top. Think about how you give to other people. God will give in the same way to you.’ 
LUK.6.39	Jesus also used a story to teach the people. He said, ‘A 
LUK.6.40	A student is not more important than his teacher is. But each student who has learned everything will be like his teacher.
LUK.6.41	Perhaps you want to tell a friend about his little mistake. If you want to do that, first remember your own bigger mistakes. 
LUK.6.42	You are like a person who has a big piece of wood in his eye. But then he says to his friend, “My friend, you have a little piece of dirt in your eye. Let me take it out for you.” Do not be like that person. You think you are better than your friend. But you are not. First, you must take the big piece of wood out of your eye. After that, your eyes will be clear and you will see well. Then you can take the small piece of dirt out of your friend's eye.’
LUK.6.43	Jesus said, ‘Good trees only make good fruit. Bad trees only make bad fruit. 
LUK.6.44	In this way you can know if a tree is good or bad. You can know this by the fruit that the tree makes. 
LUK.6.45	People are the same. A good man keeps good things in his mind. In his life, he brings those good things out from there. But a bad man keeps bad things in his mind. He brings those bad thoughts out from there. It is like things that he brings out of a room where he keeps them. When a person speaks, his words show what is really in his mind.’
LUK.6.46	Jesus said, ‘Do not call me, “Master, Master,” and then not obey me. 
LUK.6.47	Some people come to me. They listen to my message and they obey it. Let me tell you what those people are like. They are like a man who built a house. 
LUK.6.48	This man dug down in the ground to the rock. He put the first line of stones on the rock. After that, he built the house on top of the rock. Then a storm came and it brought a lot of water. The water hit the house but it could not move it. The water could not move the house because the man had built it very well.
LUK.6.49	Some other people hear my message but they do not obey it. Those people are like another man who built a house. This man did not dig down deep to the rock. Instead, he put the first line of stones on the top of the ground. Then he built his house on them. A storm came and it brought a lot of water. It hit that house and it fell down immediately. The water completely destroyed it.’ 
LUK.7.1	After Jesus had finished speaking to the people, he went to Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	A 
LUK.7.3	The officer heard about Jesus, so he sent some important 
LUK.7.4	The 
LUK.7.5	He loves the 
LUK.7.6	So, Jesus went with them. When he was not very far away from the house, the officer sent some friends to talk to him. He told them to say to Jesus, ‘Sir, I do not want to be a trouble to you. I am not good enough for you to come into my house. 
LUK.7.7	That is why I did not come to talk to you myself. Instead, just say that my servant will get better. I know that he will then be well again. 
LUK.7.8	In my work, someone has authority over me. I also have authority over other soldiers. I say to one soldier, “Go!” and he goes. I say to another one, “Come!” and he comes. I say to my servant, “Do this!” and he does it.’
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard this message from the officer, he was very surprised. He turned towards the crowd that was following him. He said to them, ‘I tell you, I have not found anyone like this man in all of 
LUK.7.10	The friends of the officer then returned to his house. When they arrived there, they saw that the servant was well again.
LUK.7.11	The next day, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His 
LUK.7.12	When he had almost reached the gate of the town, lots of people were coming out. They were carrying a dead man in a box. They were going to bury him. His mother had no other sons and her husband was also dead. A large crowd of people from the town were going with her.
LUK.7.13	When the 
LUK.7.14	He went to the box and he touched it. The people who were carrying the box stopped. Jesus said, ‘Young man, I am telling you, get up!’ 
LUK.7.15	Immediately, the dead man sat up and he began to talk. Jesus then gave him back to his mother.
LUK.7.16	Everyone there was very afraid. They 
LUK.7.17	This news about Jesus went all through Judea. The people in the places that were near there also heard about it.
LUK.7.18	Then some 
LUK.7.19	He said to them, ‘I want you to ask Jesus, “Are you the special person that God is sending to us? If not, should we still look for someone else?” ’
LUK.7.20	So the two men came to Jesus. They said to him, ‘John the 
LUK.7.21	At that time, Jesus was making many people well. They had many different illnesses. Some had bad 
LUK.7.22	Then he said to the two men that John had sent, ‘Go back to John. Tell him what you have seen. Tell him what you have heard. 
LUK.7.23	If anyone believes in me and does not turn away, he will be really happy.’ 
LUK.7.24	The two 
LUK.7.25	So, did you go to see a man who was wearing expensive clothes? No! People like that don't live in the 
LUK.7.26	So, what did you go to see? Did you go to see a 
LUK.7.27	This is what they wrote about him a long time ago in the Bible, when God said:
LUK.7.27	“Listen! I will send someone to go in front of you.
LUK.7.27	He will speak my message.
LUK.7.27	He will prepare a way for you.” ’ 
LUK.7.28	Jesus also said to the people, ‘I tell you, John is greater than any person who has ever lived up to now. But now anyone who belongs in the 
LUK.7.29	Many people heard what Jesus said. Even the men who took 
LUK.7.30	But the 
LUK.7.31	Jesus continued to teach. He said, ‘I will talk to you about the people that are alive today. I will tell you what they are like. 
LUK.7.32	They are like children who are sitting in the market place. They are playing games. They shout to other children,
LUK.7.32	“We made happy music on a 
LUK.7.32	but you did not dance.
LUK.7.32	Then we sang a sad song but you did not cry.” 
LUK.7.33	You are like those children. When John the 
LUK.7.34	Then I, the 
LUK.7.35	But God is 
LUK.7.36	One of the 
LUK.7.37	In that town was a woman who had done many wrong things. She heard that Jesus was eating a meal at the house of the 
LUK.7.38	She went into the house and she stood behind Jesus. She was crying and she made his feet wet with her tears. Then she made his feet dry again with her hair and she kissed them. She then poured the 
LUK.7.39	When the 
LUK.7.40	Jesus said to him, ‘Simon, I want to tell you something.’ Simon replied, ‘Yes, Teacher, tell me.’ So Jesus told him a story about two men:
LUK.7.41	‘Someone had lent two men some money. He had lent one of them 500 
LUK.7.42	Neither of the men had enough money to pay him back. Then the man that had lent them the money 
LUK.7.42	Jesus then asked Simon, ‘Which of these two men will love that man most?’ 
LUK.7.43	Simon replied, ‘I think that it is the man that needed to pay back the most money.’
LUK.7.43	‘You are right,’ Jesus said. 
LUK.7.44	Then he turned towards the woman. ‘You see this woman,’ he said to Simon. ‘When I came into your house, you did not give me water for my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and she has dried them with her hair. 
LUK.7.45	You did not say “Hello” to me with a kiss. But this woman began to kiss my feet when she came in. And she has not stopped. 
LUK.7.46	You did not put 
LUK.7.47	So I tell you, this woman has done many bad things. But I have 
LUK.7.48	Then Jesus said to the woman, ‘Woman, I 
LUK.7.49	The other people at the meal talked among themselves. They said, ‘Who is this man? Can he really 
LUK.7.50	Jesus said to the woman, ‘You have believed in me, so God has saved you. You may go now, and be happy.’
LUK.8.1	After this, Jesus went to visit many towns and villages. He told people the good news about the 
LUK.8.2	Some women were also travelling with them. These women had been ill, but Jesus had made them well again. One of the women was Mary from Magdala. Jesus had sent 7 bad 
LUK.8.3	Another of the women was Joanna, the wife of Chuza. Chuza had authority over all the people that worked in the house of King Herod. Another of the women was Susanna. There were many others also. These women were using their own money to help Jesus and his 
LUK.8.4	Lots of people were coming to Jesus from many towns. A large crowd had already come together when Jesus told this story:
LUK.8.5	‘A farmer went out to plant seeds in his field. While he was throwing the seeds, some of them fell on the path. Then people walked on them. Birds came down and they ate those seeds. 
LUK.8.6	Some seeds fell on ground with rocks in it. They started to grow. But the young plants died because the ground was not wet enough in that place. 
LUK.8.7	Some seeds fell among 
LUK.8.8	But some seeds fell on good 
LUK.8.8	When Jesus finished the story, he said, ‘You have ears, so listen well to what I say!’
LUK.8.9	Jesus' 
LUK.8.10	Jesus replied, ‘God has let you know what these stories mean. You understand how God rules in the lives of his people. But other people only listen to my stories. They look, but they do not really see clearly. They hear the words, but they do not really understand.’
LUK.8.11	Jesus went on to say, ‘This is what the story means: The seeds are like the message from God. 
LUK.8.12	Some seeds fell on the path. That is like some people who hear the message, but they do not think about it. The 
LUK.8.13	Some seeds fell on ground with rocks in it. This is like people who hear the message from God and they are very happy for a time. But they are like plants that have not grown down well into the 
LUK.8.14	Some seeds fell among 
LUK.8.15	But some seed fell on good 
LUK.8.16	Jesus went on to say, ‘People do not light a 
LUK.8.17	God hides some things now. But there will be a time when people will see them. God keeps some things secret now. But there will be a time when people will understand those things clearly.
LUK.8.18	So you should think carefully about what you hear. The person who has received some things will receive more. But some other people have nothing. They think that they have a little bit. But they will lose even that.’ 
LUK.8.19	Then Jesus' mother and his brothers came to see him. But they could not reach him because of the large crowd of people who were there. 
LUK.8.20	Someone told Jesus, ‘Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to see you.’
LUK.8.21	Jesus replied, ‘I will tell you who my mother and brothers really are. My mother and my brothers are those people who hear God's message and do what he wants.’ 
LUK.8.22	One day, Jesus got into a boat with his 
LUK.8.23	While they sailed in the boat, Jesus began to sleep. Then a strong wind started to blow across the lake. Water began to fill the boat and they were in danger. 
LUK.8.24	So the 
LUK.8.24	Then Jesus got up and he spoke strongly to the wind and to the water. ‘Stop!’ he said. The wind stopped immediately and the water became flat. 
LUK.8.25	Jesus said to his 
LUK.8.25	All this frightened the 
LUK.8.26	Jesus and his 
LUK.8.27	When Jesus got out of the boat there, a man from the town came towards him. Bad 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he screamed. Then he went down on his knees in front of Jesus and said in a loud voice, ‘Jesus, you are the Son of the powerful God above! We have nothing in common! Please do not hurt me.’ 
LUK.8.29	He said that because Jesus had already said to the bad 
LUK.8.29	The bad 
LUK.8.30	Jesus asked the man, ‘What is your name?’ The man replied, ‘My name is Army.’ He said this because very many bad 
LUK.8.31	These bad 
LUK.8.32	There was a large group of pigs there and they were eating on the hill. The bad 
LUK.8.33	So the bad 
LUK.8.34	The men who were taking 
LUK.8.35	So the people went out from these places to see what had happened. They came to Jesus. The man that the bad 
LUK.8.36	Some people had seen Jesus make the man well. They told the other people how he had done this. 
LUK.8.37	Then all the Gerasene people who lived in that place said to Jesus, ‘Please go away and leave us.’ They said this because they were very afraid. So, Jesus got back into the boat so that they could leave that place. 
LUK.8.38	Then the man that the bad 
LUK.8.39	You must return to your home. Tell everyone about all that God has done for you.’
LUK.8.39	So the man went away. He went everywhere in the town and told all the people, ‘Jesus has done very good things for me.’
LUK.8.40	When Jesus returned to the other side of the lake, the crowd was very happy to see him. They were all waiting for him to come back. 
LUK.8.41	Then a man called Jairus came to see him. He was a leader at the 
LUK.8.42	I have one daughter. She is 12 years old and she is very ill. She will die very soon.’
LUK.8.42	So Jesus went along. A crowd of people went with him and they were pushing against him. 
LUK.8.43	There was a sick woman in the crowd who had lost blood for 12 years. She had paid all her money to doctors and she had no money left. But nobody could help her to become well again. 
LUK.8.44	She came in the crowd behind Jesus and she touched the edge of his coat. Immediately she stopped bleeding. 
LUK.8.45	Jesus asked, ‘Who touched me?’
LUK.8.45	Everyone round him said, ‘It was not me. I did not touch you.’ Then Peter said to Jesus, ‘Master, there is a big crowd round you. Many people are pushing against you.’
LUK.8.46	Jesus said, ‘Someone did touch me. I felt it when something powerful went out from me.’ 
LUK.8.47	The woman knew that she could not hide herself. So she was very afraid. She came to Jesus and she went down on the ground in front of him. She spoke so that all the people could hear her. She said, ‘I wanted to be well again, so I touched him. When I did that, I became well immediately.’ 
LUK.8.48	Jesus said to her, ‘Young woman, you are well again because you believed in me. Do not have any more troubles in your mind.’ 
LUK.8.49	While Jesus was still speaking, someone arrived from Jairus' house. ‘Your daughter is dead,’ he told Jairus. ‘Do not ask the teacher to come now.’
LUK.8.50	Jesus heard what the man said. So he said to Jairus, ‘Do not be afraid. Just believe in me. Then she will become well again.’
LUK.8.51	When they arrived at the house, Jesus would not let everyone go in. He took only Peter, John and James. He also let the mother and father of the girl go into the house. 
LUK.8.52	All the people there were crying loudly because they were very sad. ‘Do not cry,’ Jesus told them. ‘The child is not dead. She is only asleep.’
LUK.8.53	But the people knew that she had died. So they 
LUK.8.54	But Jesus went and held the child's hand. He said to her, ‘My child, get up.’ 
LUK.8.55	Then she became alive again. Immediately she stood up. Jesus said to her parents, ‘Give her something to eat.’ 
LUK.8.56	They were very surprised. Jesus said to them very strongly, ‘You must not tell anyone about what has happened.’
LUK.9.1	Jesus asked his 12 
LUK.9.2	Then he sent them out to tell people about the 
LUK.9.3	He said to them, ‘Do not take anything for your journey. Do not take a stick, or a bag, or food. Do not take any money. Do not take extra clothes. 
LUK.9.4	In each town, continue to stay at the first house that you go into. Stay there until you leave that town. 
LUK.9.5	In some towns, the people will not accept you. You should leave that place. Clean that town's dirt from your feet. Then it will be clear that they have done something wrong.’
LUK.9.6	Then the 
LUK.9.7	People told the ruler, Herod, about all the things that were happening. His mind was confused because people were saying lots of different things about Jesus. Some people were saying, ‘John the 
LUK.9.8	Other people were saying, ‘It is Elijah that has come back.’ Some other people were saying, ‘This is one of God's 
LUK.9.9	Herod said, ‘I sent a soldier to cut off John's head. So who is this man? I hear many things about him.’ After that, Herod was trying to meet Jesus. 
LUK.9.10	The 12 
LUK.9.11	But the crowds found out about this. So they went to find Jesus. When he saw the crowds coming, he received them well. He taught them about the 
LUK.9.12	When it was nearly evening, the 12 
LUK.9.13	Jesus said to them, ‘You should give them some food to eat.’
LUK.9.13	But the 
LUK.9.14	There were about 5000 men in the crowd.
LUK.9.14	Jesus said to his 
LUK.9.15	So they did this. When the people had sat down, 
LUK.9.16	Jesus took the 5 loaves of bread and the 2 fish. Then he looked up towards 
LUK.9.17	Everybody ate and they all had enough food. They were not hungry any more. Then the 
LUK.9.18	One day, Jesus was alone and he was praying. The 
LUK.9.19	They replied, ‘Some people say that you are John the 
LUK.9.20	‘But what do you think?’ Jesus then asked them. ‘Who do you say that I am?’
LUK.9.20	Peter replied, ‘You are the 
LUK.9.21	Jesus spoke very strongly to them. He told them that they must not tell anyone about this. 
LUK.9.22	He went on to say, ‘They will cause the 
LUK.9.23	Then Jesus said to all the people that were there, ‘A person who wants to be my 
LUK.9.24	Whoever wants to keep his own life safe will lose it. But whoever gives his life to 
LUK.9.25	A person could get everything in the whole world for himself. But if he loses his life, this would not be any good for him. He will have destroyed himself in the end. 
LUK.9.26	You must not be ashamed of me and of my words. If you are, then the 
LUK.9.27	Jesus went on to say, ‘What I tell you is true. Some people who are standing here will see clearly how God rules. They will see that before they die.’
LUK.9.28	About 8 days after Jesus had said these things, he went up a mountain to pray. He took Peter, John and James with him. 
LUK.9.29	While Jesus was praying, his face became different to look at. His clothes also became very white; they were shining brightly. 
LUK.9.30	Then two men appeared and they were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah. 
LUK.9.31	They were very great and beautiful to look at. They talked with Jesus about how he would soon die in Jerusalem. This was how God wanted him to leave this world.
LUK.9.32	While this was happening, Peter and his friends were sleeping. Then they really woke up and they saw that Jesus was very great and beautiful. They also saw the two men that were standing near to him. 
LUK.9.33	Then the two men began to leave. So, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, it is good that we are here. Please, let us build three huts. One hut will be for you. One hut will be for Moses and one hut will be for Elijah.’ But Peter did not really know what he was saying. 
LUK.9.34	While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared. It covered them all. When the cloud came over them, the 3 
LUK.9.35	Then a voice spoke from the cloud and it said, ‘This is my Son. He is the one that I have chosen. Listen to him.’
LUK.9.36	The voice stopped speaking. Then the 3 
LUK.9.36	They did not tell anyone at this time about what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day Jesus came down from the mountain with the 3 
LUK.9.38	A man from the crowd shouted to him. ‘Teacher, please, I ask you to help my son. He is my only child. 
LUK.9.39	Sometimes a bad 
LUK.9.40	I asked your 
LUK.9.41	Jesus said, ‘You people today still do not believe in God. You have turned away from him. It is very difficult for me to be with you all this time. It is difficult for me to be patient with you.’ Then Jesus said to the man, ‘Bring your son here.’
LUK.9.42	While the boy was coming, the bad 
LUK.9.43	Everybody was very surprised at what they saw. They knew that God was very powerful.
LUK.9.43	The people were still thinking with surprise about everything that Jesus was doing. Then he began to talk to his 
LUK.9.44	He said to them, ‘Do not forget what I am telling you now. Soon they will deliver the 
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand what Jesus had said. It was still a secret, so they could not understand what he meant. But they were afraid to ask him, ‘What do you mean?’
LUK.9.46	Then the 
LUK.9.47	Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and he made him stand there at his side. 
LUK.9.48	Jesus said, ‘If someone accepts this child because of me, then he is accepting me also. And anyone who accepts me also accepts my Father God, who sent me. The person who makes himself the least important among you is really the greatest.’ 
LUK.9.49	John then said, ‘Teacher, we saw a man who was speaking to people that had bad 
LUK.9.50	‘Do not try to stop him,’ Jesus said, ‘If someone is not against you, he is really working with you.’
LUK.9.51	Time was passing and soon God would take Jesus up to 
LUK.9.52	He arrived near a village in the country of Samaria. He sent some people into the village with a message. They went to ask for a place to stay for the night. 
LUK.9.53	But the people in the village would not let him stay there. This was because he was going to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	Then James and John heard about what had happened. They asked Jesus, ‘Master, do you want us to ask God to send fire down from the sky? Do you want us to kill these people?’
LUK.9.55	Jesus turned round. ‘No!’ he said, ‘Do not do that. That would be wrong.’ 
LUK.9.56	Then they all went on to another village.
LUK.9.57	They continued on their journey. A man came and spoke to Jesus. He said, ‘I will go with you. And I will go with you everywhere that you go.’
LUK.9.58	Jesus replied, ‘Wild animals and birds have their own places to live. But I, the 
LUK.9.59	Then Jesus said to another man, ‘Come with me!’ The man replied, ‘First let me go home and bury my father. Then I will come with you.’
LUK.9.60	‘No!’ Jesus said, ‘Let people who are dead themselves bury their own dead people. You should go and tell people about the 
LUK.9.61	Another man said, ‘Sir, I will come with you. But please let me first go home to say “Goodbye” to my family.’
LUK.9.62	Jesus replied, ‘A man that ploughs a field must continue to look straight in front of him. If he looks behind him, he cannot plough well. People that look back behind them cannot work well for the 
LUK.10.1	After this, Jesus chose another 72 men. He sent them out two by two, to every town and village that he would visit soon. 
LUK.10.2	Before they went, he said to them, ‘Many people are ready to believe God's message. They are like many plants with 
LUK.10.3	Jesus went on to say, ‘I am sending you out, so go! But listen! You will be like young sheep among wild animals. 
LUK.10.4	Do not carry a purse or a bag. Do not take extra shoes. When you meet other people on the road, do not waste time in long conversations. 
LUK.10.5	In each town, when you go into a house, first say to the people who live there, “We pray that all will be well with you!” 
LUK.10.6	Someone in the house may accept what you say. If they do, it will be well with them. But if nobody accepts your kind words, take them back. 
LUK.10.7	Stay in the same house there until you leave that town. Accept the food and drink that the people in the house give to you. You are working to help them. So, they should give you what you need to live. Do not go from one house to another house to get food. 
LUK.10.8	The people may accept you well when you go into a town. Then eat what those people give to you. 
LUK.10.9	Make the sick people well who are there. Give this message to all the people there: “The 
LUK.10.10	Sometimes when you go into a town, the people will not accept you. You should then go into the streets of that town and you should say to the people, 
LUK.10.11	“There is dirt from your town on our feet. We will clean it off to show that you have not accepted us. God is not happy with you. But listen! You should know that the 
LUK.10.12	One day God will 
LUK.10.13	Jesus went on to say, ‘You people in Chorazin, things will be bad for you! And things will be bad for you, people in Bethsaida. I have done great and powerful things in your cities. If I had done such great things in Tyre and in Sidon, the people there would have changed how they lived. They would have shown that they were sorry for their 
LUK.10.14	Yes, when God 
LUK.10.15	And what will happen to you people in Capernaum? You think that God will lift you up to 
LUK.10.16	Jesus then said to his 
LUK.10.17	Later, the 72 men that Jesus had sent out returned to him. They were very happy. ‘Master,’ they said, ‘even bad 
LUK.10.18	Jesus replied, ‘I have seen the 
LUK.10.19	Listen! I have given power to you. You will even stand on dangerous snakes and insects and you will have authority over all the power of the 
LUK.10.20	But do not be happy just because you have authority over bad 
LUK.10.21	At this moment, the 
LUK.10.22	Jesus went on to say, ‘My Father has given me authority over all things. Only the Father really knows who I am, his Son. Only I really know who the Father is, because I am his Son. I also choose to tell some people about him. Then they also know him.’
LUK.10.23	Then Jesus turned and he spoke only to his 
LUK.10.24	I tell you this: Many 
LUK.10.25	A teacher of God's 
LUK.10.26	‘What does God's 
LUK.10.27	The man replied, ‘It says that we must love the 
LUK.10.28	‘You have told me the right answer,’ Jesus said. ‘If you do this, you will have true life with God.’
LUK.10.29	But the man wanted to show that he had been right to ask a question. So he asked, ‘Who are the people near to me that I must love?’
LUK.10.30	Jesus answered him by telling a story: ‘A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho town. On the way, some men attacked him. They took away all his clothes and they hit him with sticks. He was almost dead when they left him. 
LUK.10.31	But it happened that a 
LUK.10.32	A 
LUK.10.33	But then a man from Samaria was also travelling along the road. And he came to the place where the man was lying. When he saw him, he felt very sorry for him. 
LUK.10.34	He went across to him. He poured 
LUK.10.35	The next day, the man from Samaria took out two 
LUK.10.36	Then Jesus asked the teacher of God's 
LUK.10.37	He answered, ‘It was the man who was kind to him.’
LUK.10.37	Then Jesus said to him, ‘Yes. So you should go and do the same for other people.’
LUK.10.38	Jesus and his 
LUK.10.39	Martha had a sister called Mary, and Mary sat down near Jesus. She was listening to the things that he was teaching. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was thinking to herself, ‘I cannot do all this work alone.’ So she went to Jesus. ‘Master,’ she said, ‘my sister is not helping me with the work. She has left me to do it alone. You cannot really believe that this is right! Tell her that she should help me!’
LUK.10.41	The 
LUK.10.42	But only one thing is really important. And Mary has chosen to do that. Nobody will take it away from her.’ 
LUK.11.1	One day, Jesus was praying in a certain place. He finished praying. Then, one of his 
LUK.11.2	Jesus replied, ‘When you pray, you should say this:
LUK.11.2	“God, our Father, you are great. We want people to praise your name.
LUK.11.2	We want the day when you rule everyone to come soon.
LUK.11.3	Please give us the food that we need each day.
LUK.11.4	Because we also 
LUK.11.4	And do not let us agree to do wrong things.” ’
LUK.11.5	Jesus then told a story to teach them how to pray. He said, ‘Let me tell you about someone who goes to a friend's home at midnight. “My friend,” he says, “please give me three loaves of bread. 
LUK.11.6	A friend of mine is on a journey and he has arrived at my house. But I have no food to give him.” 
LUK.11.7	But his friend answers from inside his house. He says, “Do not cause problems for me! I have locked my door. My children and I have gone to bed. So I cannot get up and give you any bread.” ’
LUK.11.8	Jesus went on to say, ‘I will tell you what will happen. Perhaps your friend will not give you anything just because you are good friends. But if you continue to knock and ask for bread, your friend will get up. He will give you bread, as much as you need.
LUK.11.9	So I tell you this. Continue to ask God for what you need. Then God will give it to you. Continue to look for what you need. Then you will find it. Continue to knock at the door and God will open it for you. 
LUK.11.10	Everyone that asks for something will receive it. Everyone that looks for something will find it. God will open the door for everyone that knocks on it. 
LUK.11.11	Some of you are fathers. If your son asks you for a fish, you would not give him a snake instead. 
LUK.11.12	If he asks you for an egg, you would not give him something dangerous. 
LUK.11.13	You are bad. But even you know how to give good things to your children. Your Father in 
LUK.11.14	One day, Jesus was telling a bad 
LUK.11.15	But some people in the crowd were not happy with Jesus and they said, ‘This man can send bad 
LUK.11.16	Some other people wanted to see if God had really sent Jesus. So they asked him, ‘Do something powerful for us to see. Then we will know that God has really sent you.’ 
LUK.11.17	But Jesus knew what those people were thinking. He said to them, ‘If armies in a country start to fight each other, they will destroy their own country. If people in one family fight against each other, they will destroy their own family. 
LUK.11.18	So 
LUK.11.19	If that is true, what do you say about your own 
LUK.11.20	When I send bad 
LUK.11.21	When a strong man has all the 
LUK.11.22	But someone may come who is stronger than he is. The stronger man will attack him and beat him. The strong man believed his 
LUK.11.23	If someone does not agree to help me, he is really against me. You should work with me to bring people to me for help. If you don't do that, you are really making people run away from me.’ 
LUK.11.24	Jesus went on to say, ‘When a bad 
LUK.11.25	It goes back to that person. It finds that the place is empty. Everything there is now good and clean. 
LUK.11.26	So the bad 
LUK.11.27	While Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd shouted out. ‘How happy is the woman that gave birth to you! How happy is the woman that fed you from her breasts!’
LUK.11.28	Jesus replied, ‘How happy, rather, are the people that hear the message from God. That is if they obey it.’
LUK.11.29	The crowd round Jesus was growing very large, so he began to speak to them. ‘The people that are alive today are very bad,’ he said. ‘They want God to show them something powerful. But God will not do this for them. They will only see the same powerful thing that God did for Jonah. 
LUK.11.30	Jonah showed God's power to the people who lived in Nineveh. They knew that God had sent him. In the same way the 
LUK.11.31	Also, the queen of Sheba travelled a long way to see King Solomon. She wanted to hear his 
LUK.11.32	When God 
LUK.11.33	Jesus went on to say, ‘When someone lights a 
LUK.11.34	Your eyes are like 
LUK.11.35	So, you must be careful. Be sure that you really have light in you. Be sure that you are not still in the dark. 
LUK.11.36	Your whole body needs to have lots of light. Nothing dark should be there. It will be as if a lamp is shining its bright light on you.’ 
LUK.11.37	While Jesus was speaking, a 
LUK.11.38	Jesus did not wash his hands before he ate the meal. This surprised the 
LUK.11.39	So the 
LUK.11.40	What fools you are! God made the inside of you as well as the outside. He knows all about you. 
LUK.11.41	So be ready to give things to poor people. Then you will be really clean, on the inside as well as the outside. 
LUK.11.42	It will be bad for you 
LUK.11.43	Yes, it will be bad for you 
LUK.11.44	It will be very bad for you. You want to seem good to other people, but you are bad on the inside. You are like a place where they have buried a dead person. People walk on that place because they do not know that there is a dead person there.’ 
LUK.11.45	Then a teacher of God's 
LUK.11.46	Jesus replied, ‘It will be bad for you teachers of God's 
LUK.11.47	Yes, it will be bad for you! A long time ago, your 
LUK.11.48	You know that your 
LUK.11.49	God is 
LUK.11.50	Since the beginning of the world, people have killed God's 
LUK.11.51	Abel was the first to die like this and Zechariah was the last. They even killed Zechariah in the yard of 
LUK.11.52	It will be bad for you teachers of God's 
LUK.11.53	Then Jesus left that place. The 
LUK.11.54	They wanted to make him say something wrong. Then they could take hold of him.
LUK.12.1	While all this was happening, many thousands of people had come together near that place. The crowd was so big that people were almost walking over each other. Jesus began to talk first to his 
LUK.12.2	Some people hide the things that they do. But there will be a time when other people will see those things clearly. Everyone will know all their secrets. 
LUK.12.3	You may have said things secretly, in the dark of the night. But one day people will hear those things in the light of day. You may have said things quietly into someone's ear, behind a door that you have shut. But one day people will shout out those secrets loudly from the tops of the houses.
LUK.12.4	You are my friends, so I tell you this. Do not be afraid of those people who can kill only your body. After that, they can do nothing worse to you. 
LUK.12.5	But I tell you, it is God that you should be afraid of. He has the power to kill people and then to throw them into 
LUK.12.6	Think about this. People sell five birds for two small coins, don't they? But each little bird is valuable to God. He knows about them all and takes 
LUK.12.7	God even knows how many hairs there are on your head. So, do not be afraid of those people who are against you. You are more valuable to God than many little birds.
LUK.12.8	I tell you this. You should say clearly to other people, “I believe in Jesus.” If you do this, I, the 
LUK.12.9	But if you say to other people, “I do not believe in Jesus,” I will say to the 
LUK.12.10	Somebody may speak against me, the 
LUK.12.11	People will take you into their meeting places. They will make you stand in front of rulers and other people that have authority. They will want to show that you have done bad things. But do not be afraid of them. Do not be troubled about what you should say. 
LUK.12.12	At that time, the 
LUK.12.13	Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, I have a problem with my brother. Our father has died. Tell my brother to give me my part of the things that our father left us.’
LUK.12.14	Jesus replied, ‘It is not my job to say which of you is right or wrong. And it is not my job to say how much each of you should have.’ 
LUK.12.15	Then he said to all the people, ‘Be very careful! Do not want more things than you really need. The life of a person is worth more than just the things that he has. Even if he is very rich, that is still true.’ 
LUK.12.16	Jesus then told them a story: ‘A man had some very good ground, where he planted seeds. The plants grew very well. When they became 
LUK.12.17	He thought about how much he would soon have. “I have nowhere to store all the food from my plants,” he said to himself. 
LUK.12.18	But then he decided what to do. He thought, “I will pull down the building where I now store my food. Then I will build a bigger place to store it all, as well as everything else that is mine. 
LUK.12.19	Then I will say to myself, ‘You have plenty of things stored safely. These will be enough for you for many years. Now you can live an easy life. Eat and drink as much as you want. Enjoy yourself.’ ”
LUK.12.20	But then God said to the man, “You are a fool. Tonight you will die. You will have to leave everything behind. Think about all your things that you have stored. Think about what will happen to them. Think about who will have them after you die.” ’
LUK.12.21	Jesus went on to say, ‘Some people think only about having many things for themselves. That story shows how those people live. But God says about them, “They have nothing of value at all.” ’
LUK.12.22	Then Jesus said to his 
LUK.12.23	Your life is more important than the food that you eat. Your body is more important than your clothes.
LUK.12.24	Think about the birds. They do not plant seeds in the ground. They do not cut down plants to eat. They have no buildings to store food. But God gives them food to eat. You are much more valuable than the birds. 
LUK.12.25	Even if you are always thinking about your life, you cannot make it go on any longer, not even by one hour! 
LUK.12.26	No, you cannot even do a small thing like that. So, if you are always thinking about the things that you need, will that really help you?
LUK.12.27	Think about how the wild flowers grow. They do not do work or make clothes for themselves. But I tell you this about them. Even one wild flower is more beautiful than King Solomon was. And King Solomon wore the most beautiful clothes. 
LUK.12.28	It is God that gives beautiful clothes even to the grass. One day the grass is growing in the field, but the next day people will cut it and burn it. God will certainly take 
LUK.12.29	Do not always be thinking about the food and drink that you need. Do not have trouble in your mind about them. 
LUK.12.30	People that do not know God are always thinking about these things. But as for you, your Father God knows that you need them. 
LUK.12.31	Instead, always think about the things that are important in the 
LUK.12.32	You are only a small group of people, but do not be afraid. Your Father God has given his 
LUK.12.33	So, sell what you have and give the money to poor people. Then you will have valuable things in 
LUK.12.34	Then you will be thinking a lot about 
LUK.12.35	Jesus said, ‘Always be ready for my return. Be like people that are ready to start work at any time. They have put on their clothes so that they are ready for work. And they have lit their 
LUK.12.36	You must be like servants that are waiting for their master to arrive. When he returns home from the marriage party, he will knock on the door. His servants should be ready to open it for him immediately. 
LUK.12.37	Those servants will be very happy if their master finds them awake. Then the master will dress himself to give them food. He will say to them, “Sit at the table. I will come to 
LUK.12.38	The master may arrive in the middle of the night. He may even arrive just before the sun rises. But, if the master finds them awake and ready, the servants will be happy.
LUK.12.39	You can be sure about this. The master of a house does not know when a man might come to rob him. If he knew the time, he would keep awake. He would not let the robber come into his house and take away his things.
LUK.12.40	You also must be ready. The 
LUK.12.41	Peter asked Jesus, ‘Master, are you only telling this story to us, your 
LUK.12.42	Jesus replied, ‘Be a 
LUK.12.43	That servant will be very happy when his master comes home. His master will see that he has done everything well. 
LUK.12.44	Let me tell you what will happen. The master will give that servant authority to rule over everything in his house. 
LUK.12.45	But another servant might say to himself, “My master is very late. He will not come yet.” Then he begins to hit the other servants, both the men and the women. He eats too much, and he drinks too much. He even becomes drunk. 
LUK.12.46	Then the master of that servant will come home and he will surprise the servant. He did not think that his master would come home on that day or at that time. Then the master will 
LUK.12.47	A servant may know what his master wants him to do. Then he should prepare himself and do that. If he does not, his master will 
LUK.12.48	But another servant perhaps does not know what his master wants him to do. So he does wrong things. The master will 
LUK.12.49	I came to start a fire on earth. I would be happy if that fire were already burning. 
LUK.12.50	I have a 
LUK.12.51	I did not come into the world so that everyone will agree with each other. No, I tell you. I came to put people against one another. 
LUK.12.52	From now on, because of me, 5 people in a family will be against each other. 2 will be against the other 3. 3 of them will be against the other 2. 
LUK.12.53	They will not agree together. The father will be against his son and the son will be against his father. The mother will be against her daughter and the daughter will be against her mother. The mother will be against her son's wife. And the son's wife will be against her husband's mother.’ 
LUK.12.54	Then Jesus said to the crowd, ‘If you see a cloud that is rising in the west, immediately you say, “It will rain.” And the rain does come. 
LUK.12.55	Sometimes you see that the south wind is blowing. So you say, “It will be very hot weather.” And the hot weather does come. 
LUK.12.56	You are 
LUK.12.57	You should know what is right. And you should do it. 
LUK.12.58	This may happen to you: Someone says, “You have done something wrong against me.” So he takes hold of you to go to the 
LUK.12.59	I tell you. You will remain in prison until you have paid all the money, even the last small coin.’ 
LUK.13.1	At that time, some people were with Jesus. They told him what happened to some people from Galilee. They had been burning animals as a gift for God. Pilate sent some soldiers to kill them. 
LUK.13.2	Jesus replied, ‘Think about those people from Galilee. Perhaps you think that they had done more bad things than other people from Galilee. Do you think that is why they had to die? 
LUK.13.3	No! But I tell you this. All of you have done many bad things. So you must change how you live and you must turn to God. If you do not, you will also die as they did.
LUK.13.4	And you remember what happened to those 18 people in Siloam. A high building fell down and it killed them. Perhaps you think that they had done more bad things than the other people in Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.5	But I tell you, no, they had not. All of you have also done many bad things. So you must change how you live and you must turn to God. If you do not, you will also die as they did.’
LUK.13.6	Then Jesus told this story. ‘A man had a garden where he grew fruit. He had planted a 
LUK.13.7	So he said to his gardener, “Look, for three years, I have come to look for fruit on this tree. But I have never found any. So cut the tree down! I do not think that it should be here. It is wasting the ground.”
LUK.13.8	“Master,” the gardener replied, “please leave the tree in the ground for one more year. Let me dig round it and let me put some good 
LUK.13.9	If I do that, next year, the 
LUK.13.10	One day, Jesus was teaching in a 
LUK.13.11	There was a woman there that had a bad 
LUK.13.12	Jesus saw her and he called her to come to him. He said, ‘Woman, you are now better from your illness.’ 
LUK.13.13	He put his hands on her and immediately she could stand up straight. She 
LUK.13.14	But the leader of the meeting place was angry because Jesus had made a sick person well on their day for rest. He said to the people there, ‘There are 6 days each week when we should work. Come on any of those days and get well. But you should not come on our rest day to get well.’
LUK.13.15	‘You are wrong,’ the 
LUK.13.16	Now look at this woman. She belongs to the 
LUK.13.17	These words made the leaders of the meeting place feel ashamed. But the other people there were very happy. They were happy because they had seen Jesus do many good and powerful things.
LUK.13.18	Then Jesus said to them, ‘I will tell you a story about the 
LUK.13.19	It is like a very small seed of the plant called mustard. A man took this seed and he planted it in his garden. The seed grew and it became a tree. It was so big that birds came and made their homes among its branches.’
LUK.13.20	Jesus went on to say, ‘Here is another example of what the 
LUK.13.21	It is like how 
LUK.13.22	Jesus was continuing his journey towards Jerusalem. On the way, he went through towns and villages. In each one, he taught the people. 
LUK.13.23	One day, somebody asked him, ‘Sir, will God only save a small number of people?’
LUK.13.24	Jesus said to the people there, ‘Do your best to go in through the narrow door. I tell you that many people will want to get in there. But they will not be able to go through it. 
LUK.13.25	Soon the master of the house will get up and he will shut the door. And then you may still be standing outside the door. You will knock and you will say, “Master, please open the door for us to come in.”
LUK.13.25	But the master will reply, “I do not know you. I do not know where you come from.” 
LUK.13.26	Then you will begin to say, “But Master, we had meals with you. You taught us in the streets of our villages.”
LUK.13.27	But he will tell you, “No! I really do not know you. I don't know where you come from. You have done very bad things, so go away from me, all of you!”
LUK.13.28	Then you will cry very much because you are standing outside. You will bite your teeth together.
LUK.13.29	At that time, people will come from everywhere in the world, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. They will all come to take their place in the 
LUK.13.30	Listen! At that time, some people that are not important now will become the most important. And some people that are now the most important will not be important then.’
LUK.13.31	At that moment, some 
LUK.13.32	‘Herod is a bad man,’ Jesus replied. ‘Tell him this: “I am still causing bad 
LUK.13.33	Anyway, I need to continue my journey for some more days. If they are going to kill a 
LUK.13.34	Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Your people have killed God's 
LUK.13.35	So listen! Your great house will now become like a 
LUK.14.1	One 
LUK.14.2	A sick man came up to Jesus. His arms and legs had grown fat, because they were full of water. 
LUK.14.3	So Jesus spoke to the 
LUK.14.4	But they would not say anything. So Jesus took the sick man and he made him well again. Then he let him go away.
LUK.14.5	Then Jesus asked the people, ‘Maybe one of you has a son or an animal that falls into a well on our day for rest. What will you do? You will pull the child or the animal out of the well immediately.’ 
LUK.14.6	When Jesus said this, they could not say anything else.
LUK.14.7	Jesus watched how people chose the best places to sit at the meal. So he told this story to those who were sitting there: 
LUK.14.8	‘When someone asks you to come to a special meal, do not sit in the best place. A man that is more important than you may come later. 
LUK.14.9	Then the man that asked you to the meal might say to you, “Give the best place to this man.” Then you will feel ashamed that you sat there. You will have to move to the lowest place and sit there. 
LUK.14.10	Instead, when someone asks you to a meal, you should do this. Go and sit in the least important place. Then the man that asked you to the meal will see you there. And he may say to you, “My friend, move up here to a better place.” Everyone who is there at the meal will see this. So they will know that you are an important person. 
LUK.14.11	It will be the same in the 
LUK.14.12	Then Jesus said to the man who had asked him to the meal, ‘When you give a meal at midday or in the evening, do not ask your friends to come. Do not ask your brothers or your family. And do not ask the rich people that live near you to come. If you do, they will later ask you to eat at their house. This will pay you for the meal that you gave to them. 
LUK.14.13	Instead, when you prepare a big meal, you should ask the poor people to come. Ask people that have lost an arm or a leg. Ask people that cannot walk very well, and people that cannot see. 
LUK.14.14	Then God will make you happy. Those people cannot pay you for the meal you have given to them. Instead, God will pay you, on the day when he makes good people become alive again.’
LUK.14.15	The people who were sitting at the meal heard what Jesus said. One of them said to Jesus, ‘One day, there will be a big meal in the 
LUK.14.16	Jesus told this story to him: ‘One day an important man prepared a big meal. He asked many people to come to eat in his house. 
LUK.14.17	When the meal was ready, he sent his servant out to tell those people, “Come now, the meal is ready for you.” 
LUK.14.18	But then each person gave a reason why he could not come to the meal. The first man said, “I have bought a field, so I must go out and see it. Please say that I am sorry. Tell your master that I cannot come to his meal.” 
LUK.14.19	The next man said, “I have bought 5 pairs of 
LUK.14.20	The third man said, “I have just married a wife. That is why I cannot come to the meal.” ’ 
LUK.14.21	‘The servant went back to his master. He told him what everyone had said. Then the master of the house was very angry. “Go out quickly to every street in the town,” he said to his servant. “Bring the poor people here. Bring those that have lost an arm or a leg. And bring those that cannot walk well, and those that cannot see.” 
LUK.14.22	The servant did that. Then he came back to his master. “Sir,” he said, “I have asked all those people to come to your meal. But there are still some places at the table.” 
LUK.14.23	The master spoke to his servant again. “Go to the roads and fields outside the town, and look for people there. 
LUK.14.24	But I tell you this. None of the people that I asked at the beginning will eat any of my food.” ’
LUK.14.25	Crowds of many people were travelling with Jesus on his journey. So he turned and said to them, 
LUK.14.26	‘If someone wants to obey me, he must live like this: He must love me more than he loves his own father and mother. He must love me more than he loves his wife and his children. He must love me more than he loves his brothers and his sisters. He must even love me more than he loves himself. If he does not do that, he cannot be one of my 
LUK.14.27	He must live like a person that carries his own 
LUK.14.28	Here is an example. Perhaps one of you wants to build a tall building. Before you start to build, you will sit down. You will decide how much it will cost. Then you need to know if you have enough money to finish the work. 
LUK.14.29	If you do not do this, you may not have enough money. You may put the first stones in the ground, but then you cannot finish the building. If you have to stop, other people will 
LUK.14.30	“That man is a fool. He started to build, but he could not finish the work.” ’
LUK.14.31	Then Jesus gave them another example. ‘Perhaps a king wants to fight a war against another king. But before he goes to fight, he sits down. He thinks to himself. “Can I win this war? My army is large, with 10000 men. But the other king has twice as many soldiers in his army. 
LUK.14.32	No, I cannot do it. I know I cannot beat the other king.” So, while the stronger king is far away, he will send a man to him with a message. He will tell the other king that he does not want to fight. He will ask him what he can do so that they become friends together.’
LUK.14.33	Jesus then said, ‘It is like that for all of you, if you want to be my 
LUK.14.34	Remember this. Salt is good. But if it is not salty any more, it is no longer any good. You cannot make it salty again. 
LUK.14.35	You would not even put it on your field. It cannot make the 
LUK.14.35	You have ears. So, listen well to what I say.’ 
LUK.15.1	One day, many bad people and men who took 
LUK.15.2	The 
LUK.15.3	So Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.15.4	‘Think about a man who has 100 sheep. He may lose one of them. What does he do then? He leaves all his other sheep in the fields. Then he goes. He looks for the sheep that he has lost. He looks until he finds it. 
LUK.15.5	When he finds the sheep, he is very happy. He lifts it up and he puts it across his shoulders. 
LUK.15.6	Then he carries it back home. He speaks to all his friends and to the people that live near him. He says, “I have found the sheep that I lost. So come to my house and we can all be happy together.” 
LUK.15.7	When one person stops doing wrong things, it is like that. It makes those that live with God in 
LUK.15.8	Jesus told them another story: ‘Now think about a woman who has ten valuable coins. She may lose one of them. What does she do then? She lights a 
LUK.15.9	Then she speaks to all her friends and to those that live near to her. She says to them, “I have found the coin that I lost. So come to my house and we can all be happy together.”
LUK.15.10	When one person stops doing wrong things, it is like that. It makes God's 
LUK.15.11	Jesus then told another story: ‘There was a man that had two sons. 
LUK.15.12	The younger son went to his father and said to him, “Father, please give me now my part of your things.” So, the father gave both sons the part of his things that each of them should have. 
LUK.15.13	After a few days, the younger son sold what his father had given to him. Then he took all the money and left home. He went on a long journey to a country far away. There, he did whatever he wanted to do and wasted all his money. 
LUK.15.14	After he had spent everything, there was no rain in that country. There was almost no food anywhere. So the young man had nothing to eat. 
LUK.15.15	He went to a man who lived in that country. He asked to work for him. So the man sent him into his fields to give food to his pigs. 
LUK.15.16	Nobody gave him anything to eat. He even wanted to eat the food that the pigs were eating. But he had nothing.
LUK.15.17	Then the son began to think about what he had done. He said to himself, “My father has many servants, and they have plenty of food to eat. They even have more food than they need. But I will die here because I do not have any food. 
LUK.15.18	So I will go to my father and tell him, ‘I have done bad things against God, and I have done bad things against you. 
LUK.15.19	So I am not good enough for you to call me your son any longer. Instead, please accept me as one of your servants.’ ”
LUK.15.20	So he went off to return to his father. But he was still a long way from the house when his father saw him. He felt very sorry for his son and he ran towards him. Then he put his arms round his son and he kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	“Father,” the son said, “I have done bad things against God and against you. So I am not good enough for you to call me your son.” 
LUK.15.22	But the father shouted to his servants. “Hurry!” he said. “Fetch the most beautiful coat that we have. Put it on him and also put a ring on his finger. Put shoes on his feet. 
LUK.15.23	Fetch the young cow that we keep ready to eat on a special day. It is already fat. Kill it and prepare it. We will eat a big meal and we will be happy together. 
LUK.15.24	I thought that this son of mine was dead. But now he has returned to me and he is alive! I thought that he had left me for all time. But now he has come home.” Then they all began to be happy together.
LUK.15.25	While these things were happening, the older son was working in the field. On his way back to the house, he heard music. People were dancing. 
LUK.15.26	So he asked one of the servants, “What is happening?” 
LUK.15.27	The servant replied, “Your brother has returned home. Your father has killed the young fat cow for him. He did this because your brother is alive and he is well.” 
LUK.15.28	When the older brother heard this, he was very angry. He would not go into the house. So his father came out. “Please come in to be happy with us,” he said. 
LUK.15.29	“Listen,” the older son replied, “I have worked a lot for you for many years. I have always obeyed you. But you never even killed a young goat for me so that I could be happy with my friends. We could have had a meal together. 
LUK.15.30	But now this other son of yours has returned. He has wasted all the money that you gave to him. He has spent it on 
LUK.15.31	“My son,” his father said, “you are always with me. All the things that I have are yours. 
LUK.15.32	We thought that your brother was dead. But now he has returned to us alive. We thought that he had left us for all time. But now he has come home. So we must all be happy together.” ’ 
LUK.16.1	Jesus told another story to his 
LUK.16.2	So the master sent someone to bring his servant to him. He said to his servant, “I am hearing bad stories about you. So write down everything that you have done with my money and my things. Then you must stop working for me.”
LUK.16.3	“I must think about what I can do,” the servant said to himself. “My master will not let me work for him any longer. I am not strong enough to dig in the ground. I would be ashamed to ask other people for money. 
LUK.16.4	I must stop working for my master. But I know what I can do so that people will then accept me into their homes.”
LUK.16.5	Many people had a debt that they had not paid back to the master. So the servant told those people to come to him. He asked the first man, “How big is your debt to my master?” 
LUK.16.6	The man replied, “I have to give him 100 
LUK.16.7	He asked the next man, “How big is your debt to my master?” The man replied, “I have to give him 100 baskets of 
LUK.16.8	Jesus went on to say, ‘The servant in the story was not honest. But his master spoke well about what he had done. It would help the servant later in his life. People that do not obey God think carefully. They know how to do well with people who are like themselves. But people who live in God's light often think less carefully. 
LUK.16.9	So I tell you this. People may get money in wrong ways. But you should use it to do good to those who need help. Then they will be your friends. You will die, one day. Then those people will be happy to see you in that place where people live for all time.
LUK.16.10	If you can 
LUK.16.11	So if people cannot 
LUK.16.12	And if people cannot 
LUK.16.13	A slave cannot work for two masters at the same time. Maybe he will 
LUK.16.14	The 
LUK.16.15	Jesus replied, ‘You are happy when people like you. You want them to think that you are good people. But God sees inside you. He knows what you are thinking. The things that many people think are valuable are not valuable to God. He 
LUK.16.16	Jesus went on to say, ‘The books of God's 
LUK.16.17	But this does not mean that anyone can destroy God's 
LUK.16.18	A man must not send away his wife and then marry another woman. If he does this, he has done something wrong. It is the same as if he had sex with another man's wife. Also, if a woman has left her husband, another man must not marry her. That is the same as if he had sex with another man's wife.’
LUK.16.19	Jesus then said, ‘At one time, there was a rich man who had very expensive clothes. Some of the clothes were 
LUK.16.20	There was also a poor man called Lazarus. He had 
LUK.16.21	He was very hungry. He even wanted to eat the bits of food that the rich man threw away. Even the dogs came and they tasted the 
LUK.16.22	Then Lazarus died and God's 
LUK.16.23	He went to the dead people's place called Hades. He was in a lot of pain there. He saw Abraham far away in 
LUK.16.24	So he shouted out, “Father Abraham, please be kind to me. Please send Lazarus here to help me. I am in great pain because I am in a fire that burns me. Let him put his finger into some water. Then he can use the water to make my mouth cool.”
LUK.16.25	Abraham replied, “My child, remember the time when you were alive on earth. Remember what happened then. You had many good things, and Lazarus had many bad things. Now I am taking 
LUK.16.26	But that is not everything. Between you and us, there is a big hole. It is wide and long and deep. There is a reason why that hole is there. Nobody can cross from here to where you are. And nobody can cross from where you are to come here.”
LUK.16.27	The rich man said, “If that is true, father Abraham, please send Lazarus to my family. 
LUK.16.28	I have 5 brothers that are still alive. He can tell them not to do the same things as I did. Then they will not also come here when they die. They will not be in great pain, as I am.”
LUK.16.29	Abraham replied, “They have the books that Moses and God's 
LUK.16.30	The rich man said, “That is not enough, father Abraham. But if someone goes to them from among the dead people, they will listen. Then they will turn away from the wrong things that they do.”
LUK.16.31	But Abraham said to him, “They do not listen to what Moses and God's 
LUK.17.1	Jesus said to his 
LUK.17.2	These other people may not seem to be important. But you must not make them do wrong things. Don't do that! It would be better if someone tied a big stone round your neck, and then he threw you into the sea. 
LUK.17.3	Be careful how you live. If your Christian brother does something wrong, speak to him. Tell him that he has done a bad thing. He may say, “I am sorry for what I did. I will not do it again.” If he says that, you must 
LUK.17.4	Your brother may do a bad thing to you 7 times in one day. He may turn to you each time and say, “I am sorry for what I did. I will not do it again.” If he does that, you must 
LUK.17.5	The 
LUK.17.6	The 
LUK.17.7	Think about this. You may have a servant that is ploughing your land. Or you may have a servant that is taking 
LUK.17.8	No, you would not say that. You would say to your servant, “Prepare my meal for me. Dress yourself properly and bring the food to me. I will eat and drink first. You can eat when I have finished.” 
LUK.17.9	Servants should do what their masters tell them to do. When they do that, their masters do not need to thank them. 
LUK.17.10	It is the same with you. The Master tells you what you should do. So when you have done all of it, you should say, “We are not special servants. We have only done what we should do.” ’
LUK.17.11	On his journey to Jerusalem, Jesus was travelling along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	When he was going into a village, 10 men came towards him. These men had a bad illness of the skin. They stopped and stood a long way away from Jesus. 
LUK.17.13	They shouted, ‘Jesus, Master, please be kind to us.’
LUK.17.14	Jesus saw them and said to them, ‘Go and show yourselves to the 
LUK.17.14	While they were going on their way, they became well again. 
LUK.17.15	One of these 10 men saw that Jesus had made him well. He turned back and he 
LUK.17.16	He went down on his knees in front of Jesus and thanked him. This man was from Samaria.
LUK.17.17	Then Jesus said, ‘I made 10 men well again, didn't I? There should be another 9 men somewhere! 
LUK.17.18	But only this one man came back to thank God. And he is a foreign man from Samaria!’
LUK.17.19	Then Jesus spoke to the man. ‘Stand up and go on your way. You believed in me, so now you are really well.’
LUK.17.20	Then some 
LUK.17.20	Jesus replied, ‘When God begins to rule here, people will not see it with their eyes. 
LUK.17.21	Nobody will say, “Look everyone! God is ruling here,” or “Look! God is ruling over there.” No, it is not like that. God is already ruling in the lives of his people.’
LUK.17.22	Jesus said to his 
LUK.17.23	People may say to you, “Look, there he is!” or “Here he is!” But do not go out with them to look. 
LUK.17.24	When 
LUK.17.25	But before this happens, the people of today will refuse to accept me. And I will feel much pain. 
LUK.17.26	Remember what happened when Noah was alive. It will be like that at the time when the Son of Man returns to the earth. 
LUK.17.27	In Noah's time, people were eating their meals every day. Men and women continued to marry. They continued to do all this until the day when Noah went into his boat. Then it rained for a long time and there was deep water everywhere. The water killed all the people. 
LUK.17.28	The same kind of thing happened when Lot was alive. People in the city called Sodom were eating their meals every day. They were buying and selling things. They were planting their seeds and they were building their houses. 
LUK.17.29	But one day Lot went away from Sodom. On that same day, God caused it to rain fire and burning stones from the sky. This killed all the people in Sodom.
LUK.17.30	It will happen quickly like that, on the day when I, the 
LUK.17.31	On that day, a person who is up on the roof of his house must not go back down into the house. He must not get his things that are inside the house to take with him. In the same way, people that are working outside in their fields must not go back to their homes. 
LUK.17.32	Remember what happened to Lot's wife. 
LUK.17.33	Whoever wants to keep his own life safe will lose it. But whoever gives his life to 
LUK.17.34	I tell you this. At that time, two men will be sleeping in one bed. God will take one of them away but he will leave the other man behind.

LUK.17.37	Jesus' 
LUK.18.1	Then Jesus told his 
LUK.18.2	He said to them, ‘In a certain city, there was a 
LUK.18.3	A woman lived in that same city. Her husband had died. She came to the 
LUK.18.4	For a long time, the 
LUK.18.5	But this woman causes me trouble. If I do not do anything for her, she will continue to come to me again and again. She will make me ill. So, I will help her to be safe. I will say that she is right.” ’
LUK.18.6	Jesus went on to say, ‘This 
LUK.18.7	But as for God, he always helps those that he has chosen to be his children. When they continue to ask him for help, in the day and in the night, he will answer them. He will not wait. 
LUK.18.8	I tell you this. He will show that they are right. He will help them quickly. I, the 
LUK.18.9	Jesus told a story to teach other people. These people thought that they were very good in front of God. They thought that they were much better than other people.
LUK.18.10	Jesus said, ‘One day, two men went into 
LUK.18.11	The 
LUK.18.12	I stop eating on two days of each week. I give to you one tenth of all the things and money that I receive.”
LUK.18.13	But the other man stood far away. He would not even look up towards 
LUK.18.14	Jesus went on to say, ‘Let me tell you about these men when they left there. The man that took 
LUK.18.15	People were also bringing babies to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on each child's head. But Jesus' 
LUK.18.16	Then Jesus told the children to come to him. He said to his 
LUK.18.17	What I say is true. A person must become like a little child for God to rule in his life. If he does not become like a child, he will not come into the 
LUK.18.18	A 
LUK.18.19	Jesus asked him, ‘Why do you say that I am good? Only God is good. Nobody else. 
LUK.18.20	You know God's rules: “Do not have sex with anyone who is not your wife. Do not kill anyone. Do not rob anyone. Do not say things that are not true about people. Love your father and your mother, and obey them.” ’
LUK.18.21	The man replied, ‘I have obeyed all these 
LUK.18.22	Jesus heard what he said and he replied, ‘There is still just one thing that you must do. You must sell everything that you have. Then give the money to poor people. If you do that, you will have many valuable things in 
LUK.18.23	When the ruler heard this, he became very sad. This was because he was a very rich man.
LUK.18.24	Jesus saw that the ruler had become sad. He said, ‘It is very difficult for rich people to let God rule in their lives. 
LUK.18.25	The hole in a 
LUK.18.26	The people who were listening to Jesus said, ‘So perhaps God will not save anyone!’ 
LUK.18.27	Jesus replied, ‘God can do things that are impossible for human beings to do.’
LUK.18.28	Peter then said to Jesus, ‘Look! We have left everything that we had. Now we are your 
LUK.18.29	Jesus said to them, ‘What I say is true. Some people have left their home. Or they may have left their wife or their brothers. Or they may have left their parents or their children. They have done this to work for the 
LUK.18.30	Now, in this world, God will give these people many more things than they have left behind. And in the future world they will live for ever with God.’
LUK.18.31	Jesus took the 12 
LUK.18.32	The 
LUK.18.33	They will hit me with 
LUK.18.34	The 12 
LUK.18.35	When Jesus was getting near to Jericho, a 
LUK.18.36	Then he heard a large crowd of people as they went along the road. So, he asked the people near him what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	They told him, ‘Jesus from Nazareth is walking past.’
LUK.18.38	The man began to shout out. ‘Jesus! 
LUK.18.39	The people who were walking at the front of the crowd were angry with him. They told him that he should be quiet. But he started to shout even louder, ‘
LUK.18.40	Then Jesus stopped. He said to the people, ‘Bring that man to me.’ When the man came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ ‘Sir,’ the 
LUK.18.42	Jesus said to him, ‘See again! You are well now because you believed in me.’ 
LUK.18.43	Immediately, the man could see again. He started to follow Jesus along the road. He was 
LUK.18.43	Many people saw what had happened. They also 
LUK.19.1	Jesus went into Jericho and he was walking through the city. 
LUK.19.2	There was a man there called Zacchaeus. He was a leader of the men who took 
LUK.19.3	He was trying to see who Jesus was. There was a big crowd there and he was a small man. So he could not see Jesus. 
LUK.19.4	He ran on in front of the crowd and he climbed up a tree. He could see Jesus more easily from the tree, because Jesus would walk along that way. 
LUK.19.5	When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up at Zacchaeus. He said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, come down quickly. Today I must stay in your home.’
LUK.19.6	So Zacchaeus came down immediately and took Jesus into his home. He was very happy about this. 
LUK.19.7	The people saw what had happened. They were not happy, and they were saying, ‘Jesus has gone to stay in the home of a man that does bad things.’
LUK.19.8	Later, Zacchaeus stood up in front of everyone. He said to the 
LUK.19.9	Jesus said to him, ‘Today God has saved people in this home. Now Zacchaeus also belongs to the 
LUK.19.10	I, the 
LUK.19.11	While the people were still listening, Jesus told them a story. He did this because the people had wrong thoughts. He was now getting near to Jerusalem. So the people with him were thinking that God would begin to rule his people immediately.
LUK.19.12	Jesus said to them, ‘An important man left his home and he travelled a long way to another country. There he would receive authority to rule his own country. After that, he would return home and he would be king. 
LUK.19.13	Before he left, he asked 10 of his servants to come to him. He gave each of them 10 pounds of 
LUK.19.14	But the people who were living in his country did not like the man. So, they sent some of their people to the foreign country with a message. They said, “We do not want this man to rule over us.”
LUK.19.15	Then the man returned home and he was now their king. He asked those 10 servants to come to him. He had given them each some money. Now he wanted to know how much more money they had now. They should have bought things with it and then they should have sold those things again for more money.
LUK.19.16	The first servant came to him and said, “Master, your money has made 10 more pounds for you.” 
LUK.19.17	The king was happy and said to his servant, “You have done well. You are a good servant that I can 
LUK.19.18	The second servant came and said, “Master, your money has made 5 more pounds.” 
LUK.19.19	The king replied, “You will rule over 5 cities.”
LUK.19.20	Then another servant came. He said, “Master, here is your money. I put it away in a piece of cloth to keep it safe. 
LUK.19.21	I did this because I was afraid of you. You tell people what they should do all the time. You take things that you did not work for. You take food from fields where you did not plant any seed.”
LUK.19.22	The king replied, “You are a very bad servant! I will use your own words to show you that you have done the wrong thing. You say that I tell people what they should do all the time. That I take things that I did not work for. That I take food from fields where I did not plant any seed. Did you know all that about me? 
LUK.19.23	Then you should have put my money into the bank. When I came home, I would have had my money back again, with extra money also.”
LUK.19.24	Some other servants were standing near to their master. He said to them, “Take the money from this bad servant. Give it to the servant that has 10 pounds.” 
LUK.19.25	“But, master,” they replied, “that servant has 10 pounds already.”
LUK.19.26	“Let me tell you this,” the king said. “Some people have received good things. They will all receive more. Some other people have nothing. Those people will lose even the little bit that they do have. 
LUK.19.27	Now I must 
LUK.19.28	When Jesus had said all this, he went on in front of them. He was going towards Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	He was getting near to two villages called Bethphage and Bethany. They were on the hill called the 
LUK.19.30	He told them, ‘Go into the village that is in front of you. When you arrive there, you will find a young 
LUK.19.31	Someone may ask you, “Why are you taking the 
LUK.19.32	The two men went into the village. They saw everything there that Jesus had told them about. 
LUK.19.33	While they were taking the young 
LUK.19.34	‘The Master needs it,’ the 
LUK.19.35	They brought the 
LUK.19.36	While he was riding along, the people were putting their coats down on the road in front of him.
LUK.19.37	Jesus got near to the lowest part of the hill called the 
LUK.19.38	They said:
LUK.19.38	‘Great is the king that comes with the authority of the 
LUK.19.38	We want all to be well in 
LUK.19.39	Some of the 
LUK.19.40	‘Let me tell you this,’ Jesus replied. ‘If these people were quiet, the stones of the city would shout out instead!’
LUK.19.41	When Jesus got near to the city, he looked at it. He cried because he felt very sorry for the people in it. 
LUK.19.42	He said, ‘You need to know what would really help you. Then you could have lived without trouble. But now, you are unable to understand properly. 
LUK.19.43	As a result, days of trouble will come to you. Your enemies will build a wall round you. They will shut you in completely, and they will not let you leave. 
LUK.19.44	So your enemies will kill you without pity. They will completely destroy your city and all the people who live in it. They will not leave even one stone on top of another stone. You did not understand that God had come to save you at this time. That is why these bad things will happen to you.’ 
LUK.19.45	Jesus went into the yard of 
LUK.19.46	He said to them, ‘The Bible says, “God's house will be a place where people come to pray.” But you have changed it into a place where robbers meet.’
LUK.19.47	Jesus was teaching every day in 
LUK.19.48	But all the people were listening to him very well. They wanted to hear everything that he was saying. So, those leaders did not know how they could kill him.
LUK.20.1	One day, Jesus was teaching people in the yard of 
LUK.20.2	They asked him, ‘Tell us what authority you have to do these things? Who gave you the authority to do them?’
LUK.20.3	Jesus replied, ‘I also will ask you a question. Tell me the answer. 
LUK.20.4	John 
LUK.20.5	The 
LUK.20.6	But we do not want to say that only men gave John his authority. Then all the people would throw stones at us to kill us. They are sure that John really was a 
LUK.20.7	So the 
LUK.20.8	Jesus said to them, ‘You will not answer my question. So I will not tell you what authority I have to do these things.’
LUK.20.9	Then Jesus began to tell this story to the people. He said, ‘A man planted 
LUK.20.10	The time to cut the 
LUK.20.10	But the farmers hit the servant with sticks and they sent him away with nothing.
LUK.20.11	The master sent another servant to go to the farmers. They hit him with sticks also, and they did other bad things to him. They also sent him away with nothing. 
LUK.20.12	The master then sent a third servant to the farmers. They hurt him badly too, and they threw him out of the garden.
LUK.20.13	Then the master of the garden said to himself, “I know what I will do. I will send my own son to go to them. I love him very much. Perhaps they will 
LUK.20.14	But the farmers saw him coming. They said to each other, “This is the son of our master. When our master dies, his son will receive the garden. So, we should kill the son and then the garden will be ours.”
LUK.20.15	So they threw the son out of the garden and they killed him.’
LUK.20.15	Jesus went on to ask, ‘Then what will the master of the garden do to those farmers? 
LUK.20.16	I tell you, he will come to those farmers and he will kill them. Then he will give the garden to other people to work in.’
LUK.20.16	When the people heard this, they replied, ‘That must never happen!’
LUK.20.17	Jesus then looked at the people and he said, ‘You say that this must not happen. But you have read this in the Bible and you should know what it means:
LUK.20.17	“The builders refused to use a certain stone.
LUK.20.17	They thought that it had no value.
LUK.20.17	But now that stone has become the most important stone at the corner of the building.
LUK.20.18	When a person falls on to that stone, it will break his body into pieces. When that stone falls on top of someone, it will destroy him completely.” ’ 
LUK.20.19	The teachers of God's 
LUK.20.20	So this is what they did to catch Jesus. They gave money to people to ask him difficult questions. These people seemed to be good, but really they were not honest. Instead, they wanted to make Jesus say something wrong. Then they would take him to the ruler of the city to 
LUK.20.21	So these people went and said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, everything that you say and everything that you teach is right. We know that. You do not say something different to an important person to make him happy. Instead, you teach everyone the same true message. You really teach us what God wants us to do. 
LUK.20.22	So, tell us your answer to this question: Should we pay our 
LUK.20.23	Jesus knew that those men were not really honest. They wanted to make him say the wrong thing. 
LUK.20.24	So he said to them, ‘Show me a coin. Tell me, whose picture is on this coin? Whose name is on it?’ 
LUK.20.25	The men replied, ‘It is 
LUK.20.26	So the 
LUK.20.27	Then some of the 
LUK.20.28	They wanted to ask Jesus a question. ‘Teacher,’ they said to him, ‘Moses wrote this in the Bible for us: “A man may die and leave a wife but no children. Then that man's brother must marry the woman. Then their children will be called the children of the brother who died.” 
LUK.20.29	But once there were 7 brothers. The oldest brother married a wife. Then he died before they had any children. 
LUK.20.30	So the second brother married this woman. But he also died without children. 
LUK.20.31	Then the third brother married the woman. The same thing happened to all 7 brothers. They all died but they had no children. 
LUK.20.32	After all this, the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	You teach that one day dead people will become alive again. So, on that day, whose wife will the woman be? She had married all 7 of those brothers.’
LUK.20.34	Jesus answered them, ‘Men and women who are alive on earth are the ones who get married. 
LUK.20.35	But God has chosen some people to live again with him. He will raise them up after they have died. Those people will not marry. They will not have husbands or wives, 
LUK.20.36	and they cannot die any more. This is because they will live as the 
LUK.20.37	It is true that God makes dead people become alive again. Moses showed us this in his report about the bush in the 
LUK.20.38	But God is not the God of people who are dead. He is the God of people who are alive. For God, all people continue to be alive.’ 
LUK.20.39	Some of the teachers of God's 
LUK.20.40	After that, they were all afraid to ask Jesus any more questions.
LUK.20.41	Jesus said to them, ‘Why do people say that the 
LUK.20.42	David himself said this in the book called 
LUK.20.42	“The 
LUK.20.42	Sit at my right side until I beat your enemies completely.
LUK.20.43	You will even be able to put your feet on them.”
LUK.20.44	You see here that David calls the 
LUK.20.45	All the people were listening to Jesus. Jesus then said to his 
LUK.20.46	‘Be careful not to do the same as the teachers of God's 
LUK.20.47	They take things away from women after their husbands have died, even their houses. Then they pray for a long time so that other people will 
LUK.21.1	Then Jesus looked up and saw something that was happening in 
LUK.21.2	Then he saw a woman coming there. Her husband had died and she was very poor. She put two small coins that had only a little value into the box. 
LUK.21.3	‘Let me tell you this,’ Jesus said. ‘This poor woman has put a better gift into the box than all the other people have put in there. 
LUK.21.4	All those rich people have plenty of money. They only gave a small part of that. But this woman has almost nothing. She put everything that she had into the box. That money was what she needed to live.’
LUK.21.5	Some of Jesus' 
LUK.21.6	Jesus said to them, ‘You can see all these beautiful things now. But a day is coming when enemies will completely destroy it all. Not even one stone will remain on top of another stone.’
LUK.21.7	‘Teacher,’ they asked, ‘When will all these things happen? What will show us that they are soon going to happen?’
LUK.21.8	Jesus replied. ‘Be careful! Some people will tell you things that are not true. Do not believe them. Many people will say that they have come on my behalf. They will say, “I am the 
LUK.21.9	You will hear about wars and people fighting each other. Do not be afraid. Those things must happen first, but the end of everything will not happen immediately.’
LUK.21.10	Jesus went on to say to them, ‘People from one country will attack the people from another country. Kings and their armies will fight against other kings and their armies. 
LUK.21.11	The ground will move about strongly, so that people will be afraid. In many different places, people will be hungry, with no food. Illnesses will go from one person to another. Many people will die. Things will also happen in the sky that will frighten people. 
LUK.21.12	But before all those things happen, people will take hold of you. They will do bad things to you and give you pain. They will take you to the leaders in their meeting places and they will keep you in prisons. They will make you stand in front of kings and rulers. All this will happen because you are my 
LUK.21.13	This will be the time to tell them the good news about me. 
LUK.21.14	So prepare your minds. You must decide not to think about how to answer the questions of kings and rulers. Wait until that time comes. 
LUK.21.15	I will give you the right words to speak at that time. I will help you to be 
LUK.21.16	Even your parents and other people in your family will take hold of you. They will make you stand in front of kings and rulers. They will even kill some of you. 
LUK.21.17	Everybody will 
LUK.21.18	But your life will be safe with me. You will not lose even one hair from your head. 
LUK.21.19	Yes, you will have true life, if you remain strong.
LUK.21.20	One day you will see Jerusalem with armies all round it. Then you will know that enemies will soon destroy that city. 
LUK.21.21	People in Judea must then run away to the hills to hide. People that are inside the city must leave it. People that are outside in the fields must not go back into the city. 
LUK.21.22	This is when God will 
LUK.21.23	That will be a very bad time for women who are soon to have a baby! It will also be a bad time for those women who have little babies! Yes, very bad things will happen to all the people of this country. God will be very angry with the people who live here. 
LUK.21.24	At that time, enemies will fight God's people and kill many of them in war. They will take some of them away to live in other countries. They will not be free to return home. People that are not 
LUK.21.25	‘You will see strange things happen to the sun and to the moon and to the stars. Down on earth, things that happen will make people in many countries very afraid. The sea will move up and down and make a lot of noise. There will be great storms. 
LUK.21.26	These things will frighten people because they do not understand them. The great things in the sky will move from their usual places. People will be very afraid about what will happen next in the world. They will become very weak and fall to the ground. 
LUK.21.27	Then they will see the 
LUK.21.28	When these things begin to happen, stand up. And look up, because God will then save you very soon.’
LUK.21.29	Then Jesus told them a story to explain this future time. He said, ‘Think about 
LUK.21.30	When you see new leaves on a tree, you know that summer will come soon. Nobody needs to tell you that. 
LUK.21.31	In the same way, you will see these strange things happening. Then you will know that God will soon begin to rule in his 
LUK.21.32	Let me tell you this. The people who are alive now will not all die until all these things happen. 
LUK.21.33	One day, the earth and the sky will have an end. But my words will be there for ever.
LUK.21.34	But be careful, and watch how you live. Do not eat or drink too much. Do not waste your time like that. Do not waste time by having troubles in your mind about your life. If you do, that day will surprise you. It will come when you are not looking. 
LUK.21.35	It will surprise everyone who lives on all the earth. 
LUK.21.36	So watch all the time! Continue to pray that you will be strong. Then you may be safe through all these things! You will stand in front of the 
LUK.21.37	Every day Jesus was teaching people in 
LUK.21.38	Each morning he returned to 
LUK.22.1	The 
LUK.22.2	The leaders of the 
LUK.22.3	Then 
LUK.22.4	He went to the leaders of the 
LUK.22.5	They were very happy and they promised to give him money for this. 
LUK.22.6	So Judas said that he would do it. Then he waited for the right moment to help them to take hold of Jesus. He wanted to do it when the crowd was not there with Jesus.
LUK.22.7	The day came for 
LUK.22.8	So Jesus said to Peter and John, ‘Go and prepare the 
LUK.22.9	They asked him, ‘Where do you want us to prepare the meal?’
LUK.22.10	Jesus replied, ‘Listen. When you go into the city, a man will meet you. He will be carrying a jar of water. Follow him until he goes into a house. 
LUK.22.11	You must then say to the master of that house, “Our Teacher sends this message to you: ‘Where is the room for visitors? I will eat the 
LUK.22.12	The man will then show you a large room upstairs. It will have all that you need in it. Prepare the 
LUK.22.13	So Peter and John went into the city. They found everything that Jesus had told them about. So, they prepared the 
LUK.22.14	When it was time to eat the meal, Jesus arrived. He sat down with his 
LUK.22.15	He said to them, ‘I have wanted very much to eat this 
LUK.22.16	I tell you this: I will not eat another 
LUK.22.17	Then Jesus took a cup and he thanked God for the 
LUK.22.18	I tell you this. I will not drink 
LUK.22.19	Then he took a loaf of bread and he thanked God for it. He broke the bread into pieces and he gave some of it to each of them. He said, ‘This is my body. I am giving it to save you. When you eat this meal from now on, remember me.’
LUK.22.20	Then after supper, Jesus took a cup of 
LUK.22.21	But look! The person who will give me to the rulers is sitting at the table with me. His hand is eating the same food as I am. 
LUK.22.22	The 
LUK.22.23	The 12 
LUK.22.24	Then the 
LUK.22.25	Jesus said to them, ‘Kings of other countries use great authority over their people. Leaders of those countries want people to say good things about them. 
LUK.22.26	You must not be like that. The most important person among you must become like the least important person. The person who is your leader must become like your servant. 
LUK.22.27	Tell me, which person is the more important one? Is it the person who sits at the table to eat? Or is it the servant that puts out the meal for him? Yes, it is the person who sits at the table. But I am here to be your servant.
LUK.22.28	You have never left me. You have been by my side when trouble came to me. 
LUK.22.29	So now I tell you that you will rule with me. My Father has said that I will rule with him in his 
LUK.22.30	In my 
LUK.22.31	Jesus went on to say, ‘Simon, Simon, be careful to listen to me! 
LUK.22.32	But I have prayed for you, Simon, that you will continue to believe in me. And this is what you must do: When you have turned back to me, you must help your 
LUK.22.33	But Simon replied, ‘Master, I am ready to go to prison with you. I am even ready to die with you!’ 
LUK.22.34	Jesus said to him, ‘I tell you this, Peter. Very soon, you will say that you do not know me. You will say that three times before the 
LUK.22.35	Jesus then asked the 
LUK.22.36	‘Now it is different,’ he said. ‘If you have a purse or bag, you should take it with you. If you do not have a 
LUK.22.37	Let me tell you why. Long ago people wrote in the Bible what must happen to me. It says, “People will think he is one of the bad people.” And this must happen to me soon, so that it becomes true.’
LUK.22.38	The 
LUK.22.39	Jesus left the city. He went to the hill called the 
LUK.22.40	When they arrived there he said to them, ‘Ask God to help you, so that you don't want to do wrong things.’
LUK.22.41	Then he went away from them about as far as you can throw a stone. He went down on his knees and he prayed, 
LUK.22.42	‘Father, if you want, you can save me from this time of great pain. But I do not ask you to do what I want. Do what you want for me.’
LUK.22.42	[
LUK.22.43	Then an 
LUK.22.44	Jesus began to have troubles in his mind. He prayed again even more strongly. His 
LUK.22.45	Then Jesus finished praying and he stood up again. He returned to the 
LUK.22.46	‘You should not be sleeping,’ he said. ‘Get up and pray! Ask God to help you, so that you don't want to do wrong things.’
LUK.22.47	While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd of people came towards him. Judas led the crowd to that place. He was one of the 12 
LUK.22.48	Jesus said to him, ‘Judas, why do you want to kiss me, the 
LUK.22.49	The people near to Jesus saw what was happening. They asked him, ‘
LUK.22.50	One of them hit the servant of the leader of the 
LUK.22.51	‘That is enough!’ said Jesus, ‘Stop doing this!’ He then touched the man's ear and made him well again.
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus spoke to the people that had come to take hold of him. They were the leaders of the 
LUK.22.53	No! But I was with you every day in the yard of 
LUK.22.54	Then they took hold of Jesus. They took him away and they brought him to the house of the leader of the 
LUK.22.55	People lit a fire in the yard of the house and they sat round it. Peter went and he sat with them. 
LUK.22.56	A girl who worked there then saw Peter in the light from the fire. She looked carefully at him and she said, ‘This man also was a friend of Jesus.’ 
LUK.22.57	Peter replied, ‘Woman, that is not true! I do not even know him.’
LUK.22.58	After a short time, someone else looked at him. ‘You also are one of their group,’ he said. Peter replied, ‘Man, I am not one of them.’
LUK.22.59	After about an hour, another man said, ‘I am sure that this man was a friend of Jesus. He also is from Galilee.’ 
LUK.22.60	Peter replied, ‘Man, I do not know what you are talking about.’ While Peter was still speaking, a 
LUK.22.61	Then the 
LUK.22.62	Then Peter went outside away from the house and he cried a lot.
LUK.22.63	The men that were holding Jesus were 
LUK.22.64	They covered his eyes with a cloth and they said to him, ‘Show us that you are a prophet. Tell us who hit you!’ 
LUK.22.65	And they said many other bad things against him.
LUK.22.66	When it became day, the 
LUK.22.67	They asked him, ‘Are you the 
LUK.22.68	I could also ask you a question. But if I do that, you will not answer me. 
LUK.22.69	But from now on, the 
LUK.22.70	‘So, are you the 
LUK.22.71	Then they said, ‘We do not need anyone else to speak against this man. We ourselves have heard what he has said about himself.’
LUK.23.1	All the people at the meeting stood up to leave. They took Jesus to stand in front of Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	Then they all started to tell Pilate that Jesus had done bad things. They said, ‘We found this man when he was telling our people wrong things. He said that we must not pay 
LUK.23.3	Pilate asked Jesus, ‘Are you the king of the 
LUK.23.4	Pilate then said to the leaders of the 
LUK.23.5	But they continued to speak strongly to him. They said, ‘He makes the people angry and ready to fight against the government. He has taught these bad things everywhere in Judea. He started in Galilee and now he has come to Jerusalem.’
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard them say this, he asked if Jesus came from Galilee. 
LUK.23.7	He discovered that he was from the country where Herod ruled. So Pilate sent Jesus to stand in front of Herod. Herod was also in Jerusalem at that time. 
LUK.23.8	Herod was very happy to see Jesus. He had heard about him and he had wanted to meet him for a long time. He wanted to see Jesus do something to show God's power. 
LUK.23.9	He asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus did not answer any of them. 
LUK.23.10	The leaders of the 
LUK.23.11	Then Herod and his soldiers started to 
LUK.23.12	That same day, Herod and Pilate became friends. Until then, they had not liked each other.
LUK.23.13	Pilate then told the leaders of the 
LUK.23.14	He said to them, ‘You brought this man to me. You said that he was causing the people to fight against their rulers. Listen! I have asked him some questions in front of you. But I have not found that he has done anything wrong. 
LUK.23.15	Herod also did not find that he had done anything wrong. That is why he has sent him back to me. You can see this. He has not done anything bad that means he ought to die. 
LUK.23.16	So I will just 
LUK.23.16	[
LUK.23.17	Pilate usually let one person go free out of the prison at 
LUK.23.18	But the crowd all shouted together, ‘Take this man away and kill him! We want Barabbas to go free.’
LUK.23.19	Barabbas had fought against the 
LUK.23.20	But Pilate still wanted to let Jesus go. So, he spoke to the crowd again. 
LUK.23.21	But they continued to shout. They were shouting, ‘Kill him on a 
LUK.23.22	Pilate asked them the same question for the third time. ‘Why should I kill him? What wrong things has he done? You want me to say that he should die. But I have not found anything wrong that would cause me to say that. So, I will 
LUK.23.23	But they continued to shout at Pilate, ‘Kill him on a 
LUK.23.24	Pilate did what they wanted. 
LUK.23.25	They had asked Pilate to let Barabbas go free out of the prison. He was the man that had caused the 
LUK.23.26	So the soldiers took Jesus away, to go to the place where they would kill him. On the way, they took hold of a man called Simon. This man was from the town called Cyrene. He was coming in from outside the city. The soldiers took the 
LUK.23.27	A very large crowd of people were following Jesus. There were many women among them. They were crying with loud voices. They were weeping and crying because they were very sad. 
LUK.23.28	So Jesus turned round and he said to them, ‘You women that live in Jerusalem, do not weep for me. Instead, cry for yourselves and for your children. 
LUK.23.29	Listen! Days will come when people will say, “It is better for those women that could not have babies. Those women that never had babies to feed are the happy ones!” 
LUK.23.30	People will begin to say, “It would be better if we were dead.” They will ask the mountains to fall on top of them. They will ask the hills to cover them up. 
LUK.23.31	There is much trouble and pain now. But much worse things will happen! Now the fire burns slowly. But soon it will be like a fire that quickly burns dry wood!’ 
LUK.23.32	The soldiers also took two other men out of the prison. These men had done bad things. The soldiers were going to kill them and Jesus together. 
LUK.23.33	They took them to the place that is called ‘The 
LUK.23.34	Jesus said, ‘Father, these people do not know what they are doing. So please 
LUK.23.34	The soldiers then picked up Jesus' clothes for themselves. They played a game to decide who would receive each piece of his clothes. 
LUK.23.35	The people stood there and they were watching. The 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also 
LUK.23.37	They said, ‘If you are really the King of the 
LUK.23.38	There was also a notice fixed at the top of the 
LUK.23.39	One of the bad men on a 
LUK.23.40	But the bad man on the other 
LUK.23.41	We two men have done very bad things. So, it is right that we should die. But this man has not done anything wrong.’ 
LUK.23.42	Then the man said to Jesus, ‘Remember me, Jesus, when you start to rule in your 
LUK.23.43	Jesus replied, ‘I promise you, today you will be with me in 
LUK.23.44	It was now about midday. The whole country became dark for three hours. 
LUK.23.45	The sun did not give any light. Then the curtain inside 
LUK.23.46	Then Jesus shouted loudly, ‘Father, I give my 
LUK.23.47	There was a captain of the soldiers there. When he saw what had happened, he 
LUK.23.48	A very big crowd had come together to watch the men die. They saw what had happened. Then they began to go home. They were very sad, and they were hitting their own bodies with their hands. 
LUK.23.49	The friends of Jesus were there. The women that had come with him from Galilee were also there. They were all standing a long way away. They also saw what happened to him.
LUK.23.50	A man called Joseph was also there. He was one of a special group of important 
LUK.23.51	He was from the 
LUK.23.52	So Joseph went to see Pilate. He asked to have the dead body of Jesus. Pilate agreed to this. 
LUK.23.53	Joseph then went to the place where Jesus died. He took the dead body down from the 
LUK.23.54	This all happened on the day before the 
LUK.23.55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph. They saw the place where the hole in the rock was. They also saw Joseph put Jesus' body into the empty hole. 
LUK.23.56	Then they returned to the house where they were staying in Jerusalem. They prepared 
LUK.24.1	Very early on the first day of the week, they went to the place where Joseph had buried Jesus. They took with them the 
LUK.24.2	They arrived there. They found that someone had rolled the big stone away from the hole. 
LUK.24.3	They went inside the hole in the rock, but they did not find the body of the 
LUK.24.4	They did not understand this at all. But while they were thinking about it, two men appeared. Their clothes shone brightly like 
LUK.24.5	So the women became very afraid and they went down low with their faces on the ground.
LUK.24.5	The men said to the women, ‘This is a place to bury dead people. You should not be looking here for someone who is alive. 
LUK.24.6	Jesus is not here. He has become alive again! Remember what he said to you, while he was still with you in Galilee. 
LUK.24.7	He said, “It is necessary that someone should give the 
LUK.24.8	Then the women remembered the words that Jesus had said in Galilee. 
LUK.24.9	They left the hole where Jesus' body had been. They went to the 11 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary from Magdala, Joanna, James' mother Mary, and other women who were with them that told the news about Jesus to the 
LUK.24.11	But they did not believe what the women said. They thought that it was just a silly story. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and he ran to the hole in the rock. He bent down and he looked inside. He saw only the long cloth that they had put round Jesus' body. There was nothing else. So he went home again. He could not understand what might have happened.
LUK.24.13	Later on that same day, two of Jesus' 
LUK.24.14	They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking like this, Jesus himself came near to them. He started to walk along with them. 
LUK.24.16	They saw him, but for some reason they did not recognise him. 
LUK.24.17	Jesus asked them, ‘What are you talking about while you walk along the road?’
LUK.24.17	They stood still and they seemed sad. 
LUK.24.18	One of them, called Cleopas, answered him, ‘Many things have happened in Jerusalem in the last few days. Are you the only visitor here that does not know about it?’ 
LUK.24.19	Jesus asked them, ‘What things have happened?’
LUK.24.19	They replied, ‘The things that happened to Jesus who was from Nazareth. He was a 
LUK.24.20	Then the leaders of the 
LUK.24.21	But before that we had hoped that he would save the people of 
LUK.24.21	There are other things too. Today is the third day since Jesus died. 
LUK.24.22	After all this happened, some women in our group surprised us. Early this morning, they went to the place where Joseph had buried him. 
LUK.24.23	But they did not find his body there. So they returned to us and said, “Some 
LUK.24.24	So some people from our group went to the place where his body had been. They found everything just the same as the women had said. But they did not see Jesus.’
LUK.24.25	Jesus then said to them, ‘How silly you are! You are very slow to believe everything that God's 
LUK.24.26	You should have known that the 
LUK.24.27	Jesus then began to explain to them what Moses and all God's 
LUK.24.28	Then they came near to the village that the 
LUK.24.29	But they wanted him to stop there. They said to him, ‘Please stay in our home with us. It is getting late, and it will soon be night.’
LUK.24.29	So Jesus went into their house to stay with them. 
LUK.24.30	He sat down to eat with them. He took the bread and he thanked God for it. He broke it into pieces and he gave some to them. 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes became clear and they recognised him. Immediately after that they could no longer see him. 
LUK.24.32	They said to each other, ‘When he talked to us, it was like a fire that was burning inside us. We felt it while we were walking along the road. We also felt it when he was explaining God's message in the Bible.’
LUK.24.33	They immediately got up and they returned to Jerusalem. There they found the 11 
LUK.24.34	The people there gave the 2 
LUK.24.35	Then the 2 
LUK.24.36	While they were still speaking like that, Jesus himself stood among them. He said to them, ‘
LUK.24.37	But the whole group was very surprised and afraid. They thought that they were seeing a 
LUK.24.38	Jesus said to them, ‘You should not be so afraid. You seem to have trouble in your minds about what you are seeing. 
LUK.24.39	Now look at my hands and my feet. It is really me! Touch me. Then you will know that I am not a 
LUK.24.40	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 
LUK.24.41	This was such good news, they were very happy. But they could still not really believe it. So he asked them, ‘Do you have anything that I could eat?’ 
LUK.24.42	They gave him a piece of fish that they had cooked. 
LUK.24.43	While they were watching, he took it and he ate it.
LUK.24.44	Then he said to them, ‘I told you about these things while I was still with you. Everything that God's servants wrote about me in the Bible had to happen. Moses wrote about me in his book of God's 
LUK.24.45	Then he helped them to understand God's message in the Bible. 
LUK.24.46	He told them, ‘This is what it says there: The 
LUK.24.47	People in every country of the world must hear God's message. They must stop doing wrong things and change how they live. When they do this, God will 
LUK.24.48	You are the people who have seen what has happened here. You must tell other people about it. 
LUK.24.49	Now listen! I will send to you the gift that God my Father has promised to give to you. You must stay here in the city until this happens. Then the power of God will come from 
LUK.24.50	Then Jesus led the group of his 
LUK.24.51	While he was praying for them like that, he went up away from them. God lifted him up to 
LUK.24.52	The 
LUK.24.53	All the time they were in 
JHN.1.1	In the beginning, the Word was already there. The Word was with God. The Word was God.
JHN.1.2	He was with God from the beginning. 
JHN.1.3	God made all things through the Word. God did not make anything without him. 
JHN.1.4	It is the Word who caused everything to live. Because of this, he has brought light to all people. 
JHN.1.5	The light shines in the dark, and the dark cannot put out the light.
JHN.1.6	God sent a man to bring his message. His name was John.
JHN.1.7	He came to tell people about the light. God wanted everyone to believe in the one who is the light. 
JHN.1.8	John himself was not that light. God sent him to tell people about the light. 
JHN.1.9	The true light gives light to every person. That light was now coming into the world. 
JHN.1.10	The Word was now in the world. God had made the world through him. But the people in the world did not know who he was. 
JHN.1.11	He came to the place that was his own. But his own people did not accept him. 
JHN.1.12	But some people did accept him. They did believe in him. He gave authority to those people to become God's children. 
JHN.1.13	They did not become God's children in the usual human way. They were not born because of what any people wanted. They were not born because of what any man decided. No! They were born from God.
JHN.1.14	The Word became a human person. He lived among us. We saw how great and how good he is. He is great and good as only the Father's one true Son can be. He is completely kind. He speaks only what is true.
JHN.1.15	John told people about the Word. He shouted, ‘This is the man that I told you about. He comes after me. But he is greater than I am. He was already there before I was born.’ 
JHN.1.16	The Word is full of everything that we need. We have all received one good thing after another good thing. 
JHN.1.17	God gave his 
JHN.1.18	Nobody has ever seen God. But God's only Son has shown God to us. He is very near to the Father, and he himself is God. 
JHN.1.19	The 
JHN.1.20	John did not refuse to answer. He said, ‘I am not the 
JHN.1.21	So they asked him, ‘So who are you? Are you Elijah?’ John said, ‘No, I am not.’ They asked, ‘Are you the 
JHN.1.22	Then they said, ‘Tell us who you are. We must say something to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?’ 
JHN.1.23	He said, ‘I am the voice of somebody shouting in the 
JHN.1.23	“The 
JHN.1.23	Make a straight path for him to follow.”
JHN.1.23	That is what the 
JHN.1.24	The men who came to ask these questions were 
JHN.1.25	They said to John, ‘You say that you are not the 
JHN.1.26	John replied, ‘I 
JHN.1.27	He is the one who comes after me. I am not good enough even to undo his shoes for him.’
JHN.1.28	All these things happened at a place east from the Jordan river. It was a village called Bethany. John was 
JHN.1.29	The next day, John saw Jesus, who was coming towards him. John said, ‘Look! Here is the 
JHN.1.30	This is the man that I told you about. I told you, “He comes after me, but he is greater than I am. He was already there before I was born.” 
JHN.1.31	I did not know him. But I had to show Israel's people who he was. That is why I am 
JHN.1.32	Then John told them, ‘I saw God's Spirit come down from 
JHN.1.33	I would not have known who Jesus was. But God had sent me to 
JHN.1.34	Now I have seen this. So, I can tell you that this is God's Son.’
JHN.1.35	John was standing there again the next day, with two of his 
JHN.1.36	He saw Jesus, who was walking past them. John said, ‘Look! Here is the 
JHN.1.37	When the two 
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned round. He saw that they were following him. He asked them, ‘What do you want?’ They said, ‘Rabbi (which means “Teacher”), where are you staying?’ 
JHN.1.39	Jesus replied, ‘Come with me, and you will see.’ So, they went with him. They saw where he was staying. It was about 4 in the afternoon. And they stayed with him that day. 
JHN.1.40	Andrew was one of the two 
JHN.1.41	The first thing that Andrew did was to find his brother, Simon. Andrew said to Simon, ‘We have found the 
JHN.1.42	Then he brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at Simon and he said, ‘You are Simon, John's son. Your name will be Cephas.’ This name is the same as Peter, which means ‘rock’.
JHN.1.43	The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He met Philip, and Jesus said to Philip, ‘Follow me.’ 
JHN.1.44	Philip, like Andrew and Peter, came from the town called Bethsaida. 
JHN.1.45	Philip went to find Nathanael. He told Nathanael, ‘We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the book of God's 
JHN.1.46	Nathanael said, ‘I did not think that anything good could come from Nazareth!’ Philip replied, ‘Come and see.’
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael, who was coming towards him. Jesus said, ‘Here is a completely honest man. That is what a person from Israel should really be like.’ 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael asked, ‘How do you know me?’ Jesus answered, ‘I saw you before Philip asked you to come. I saw you when you were under the 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael said, ‘Teacher, you are the 
JHN.1.50	Jesus said to him, ‘I told you that I saw you under the 
JHN.1.51	And Jesus said to him, ‘I am telling you what is true. You will see 
JHN.2.1	Two days after that, there was a marriage. It was in the town called Cana, in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there. 
JHN.2.2	People had asked Jesus and his 
JHN.2.3	When people had drunk all the 
JHN.2.4	Jesus replied, ‘Woman, why do you tell me this? It is not my time yet.’ 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you to do.’
JHN.2.6	There were 6 big pots there. People had used stone to make them. Each pot could contain 20 to 30 gallons of water. These pots contained water so that the 
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the pots with water.’ So they filled the pots to the top. 
JHN.2.8	Then he said, ‘Now take some of the water from the pots and give it to the master of the party.’ So they did that. 
JHN.2.9	The master of the party tasted the water. The water had now become 
JHN.2.10	The master said to him, ‘Everyone else brings out the best 
JHN.2.11	Jesus did this first 
JHN.2.12	After this, Jesus went to a town called Capernaum. His mother, his brothers and his 
JHN.2.13	It was almost time for the 
JHN.2.14	He went into the yard of God's Great House. There he found people who were selling cows, sheep and 
JHN.2.15	So Jesus made a 
JHN.2.16	He said to the people who sold birds, ‘Take them out of here! Do not make my Father's house into a market!’ 
JHN.2.17	His 
JHN.2.18	Then the 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered them, ‘If you destroy this house of God, I will build it up again in 3 days.’ 
JHN.2.20	The 
JHN.2.21	But the house that Jesus was speaking about was his own body. 
JHN.2.22	The 
JHN.2.23	While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus himself did not 
JHN.2.25	He did not need anyone to tell him what people are like. He knew already what was really in each person.
JHN.3.1	There was a 
JHN.3.2	He came to speak with Jesus at night. He said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, we know that God has sent you to us. We have seen the 
JHN.3.3	Jesus replied, ‘What I am telling you is true. Unless a person is born from above
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus asked, ‘How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot return into his mother's body. He cannot be born a second time.’ 
JHN.3.5	Jesus explained, ‘I am telling you what is true. Unless a person is born by water and by God's Spirit, he cannot come into the 
JHN.3.6	Human people give birth to what is human. But God's Spirit gives birth to 
JHN.3.7	I said to you, “You must be born from above.” What I said should not surprise you. 
JHN.3.8	When someone is born by God's Spirit, it is like the wind that blows. The wind blows where it wants. You can hear it. But you cannot say where it came from or where it is going.’
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus asked, ‘How can this happen?’ 
JHN.3.10	Jesus replied, ‘You are an important teacher of people in Israel. You ought to understand these things! 
JHN.3.11	I am telling you what is true. We speak about things that we know. We tell you about what we have seen. But even then, you people do not believe our message. 
JHN.3.12	I have told you about things that happen in this world. And you do not believe me. But now I am telling you about things that happen in 
JHN.3.13	The Son of Man came down from 
JHN.3.14	Long ago Moses lifted up the metal snake in the 
JHN.3.15	As a result, everyone who believes him will be able to live for ever with God. 
JHN.3.16	God loved the people in the world so much that he gave his one and only Son on their behalf. So, as a result, everyone who believes in the Son will not die. Instead, they will live for ever with God.’
JHN.3.17	God did not send his Son into the world because he wanted to 
JHN.3.18	God will not 
JHN.3.19	Light has come into the world. But some people did not love the light. They loved the dark instead. That was because they were doing bad things. That is why God has already decided to 
JHN.3.20	Everyone who does bad things 
JHN.3.21	But anyone who does what is true will come to the light. The light will show clearly that he has been doing what is right. Everyone can see that he has been obeying God.
JHN.3.22	After this, Jesus and his 
JHN.3.23	John was also 
JHN.3.24	(This happened before the rulers put John in a prison.) 
JHN.3.25	John's 
JHN.3.26	The 
JHN.3.27	John replied, ‘A man can receive only what God gives to him, nothing else. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves will remember that I said, “I am not the 
JHN.3.29	When a man marries a wife, she belongs to him. The man's special friend listens carefully. He wants to know when the man will come with his wife. That friend is very happy when he hears the man's voice. I am like that friend, so I am completely happy now. 
JHN.3.30	Jesus must become greater, but I must become less important. 
JHN.3.31	The one who comes from above is greater than all things. A person who comes from the earth belongs to the earth. A person like that speaks only about things that belong to the earth. But the one who comes from 
JHN.3.32	He tells people about the things that he has seen. He tells about what he has heard. But people do not believe his message. 
JHN.3.33	Anyone who does believe his message agrees that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	The one that God has sent speaks God's words. God has given his Spirit to fill that person completely. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son. He has given his Son authority over all things. 
JHN.3.36	Anyone who believes in the Son has life with God for ever. But anyone who refuses to obey the Son will never have life with God. God will continue to be angry with people like that.’
JHN.4.1	The 
JHN.4.2	But really Jesus himself did not 
JHN.4.3	Jesus discovered what the Pharisees were thinking, so he left Judea. He returned to Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	On his way, he had to go through Samaria.
JHN.4.5	He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar. It was near to the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son, Joseph, many years earlier. 
JHN.4.6+JHN.4.7+JHN.4.8	Jacob's well was there. Jesus was tired after his journey and he sat down by the well. It was about midday. 
JHN.4.9	The woman from Samaria said to him, ‘You are a 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered the woman, ‘You do not know what God could give to you. I asked you to give a drink to me. But you do not know who I am. If you did know, you would have asked me to give a drink to you. Then I would have given to you water that gives life.’ 
JHN.4.11	The woman said, ‘Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where can you get this water that gives life? 
JHN.4.12	Jacob, our 
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered, ‘Everyone who drinks water from this well will get 
JHN.4.14	But I can give people a different kind of water. Everyone who drinks that kind of water will never get 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to him, ‘Sir, give this water to me. Then I will never get 
JHN.4.16	Jesus said to her, ‘Go and fetch your husband. Then return here.’ 
JHN.4.17	The woman replied, ‘I have no husband.’ Jesus said to her, ‘You are right when you say, “I have no husband.” 
JHN.4.18	It is true that you have had 5 husbands. And now you live with a man who is not your husband. What you have said is quite true.’ 
JHN.4.19	The woman said to him, ‘Sir, I can see that you are a 
JHN.4.20	Our 
JHN.4.21	Jesus said to her, ‘Believe me, woman. Soon you will not 
JHN.4.22	You people from Samaria do not really know what you 
JHN.4.23	More than that, people will soon have a new way to 
JHN.4.24	God is 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to Jesus, ‘I know that the 
JHN.4.26	Jesus said to her, ‘I, who am speaking to you, am he.’
JHN.4.27	At this moment, Jesus' 
JHN.4.28	Then the woman left her water pot and she returned to the town. She said to the people there, 
JHN.4.29	‘Come and see a man who has told me everything about myself. He told me all the things that I have ever done! He must be the 
JHN.4.30	So they left the town and they went to find Jesus.
JHN.4.31	While that was happening, the 
JHN.4.32	But he said to them, ‘I have food that I can eat. But you do not know about it.’ 
JHN.4.33	So the 
JHN.4.34	Jesus said to them, ‘My Father has sent me. I must do the things he wants me to do. I must finish the work that he has given to me to do. That is my food. 
JHN.4.35	You often say, “It is still 4 more months until the plants in the farmers' fields will be ready for the 
JHN.4.36	The workers are already bringing in the fruit and their master is paying them. As a result, people are receiving life for ever with God. So, the person who plants the seeds will be very happy. And the person who brings in the fruit will also be very happy. Both of them will be happy together. 
JHN.4.37	You also say, “One person plants the seeds and another person brings in the fruit.” Now you can see that that is true. 
JHN.4.38	I have sent you to bring people to me like a 
JHN.4.39	Many of the people who lived in that town in Samaria heard the woman's story. She had said to them, ‘He told me all the things that I have ever done!’ Because of this, they believed in Jesus. 
JHN.4.40	So when these people came to Jesus, they asked him to stay with them. So he stayed there for two days. 
JHN.4.41	Many more people believed in Jesus when they listened to his own words. 
JHN.4.42	The people said to the woman, ‘Now we believe in him because we ourselves have heard him. We do not believe only because of what you told us. He really is the man that God has sent to save the world. We know that now.’
JHN.4.43	After those two days in Samaria, Jesus left there and he went to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	Jesus himself had said earlier, ‘When a 
JHN.4.45	When he arrived in Galilee, the people there were happy to see him. They had been in Jerusalem at the 
JHN.4.46	Jesus visited Cana again. This was the town in Galilee where he had changed the water into 
JHN.4.47	The officer had heard the news that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea. So, he went to Jesus and asked him to go to Capernaum. His son was dying. So he asked Jesus strongly to make his son well again.
JHN.4.48	Jesus said to him, ‘You people want me to do great 
JHN.4.49	The king's officer said to Jesus, ‘Sir, come with me now before my child dies.’ 
JHN.4.50	Jesus replied, ‘Go home. Your son will live.’ The man believed what Jesus had said. He started to go home. 
JHN.4.51	While he was on the way, his servants met him. They told him, ‘Your child is better. He will live.’ 
JHN.4.52	He asked them, ‘At what time did he start to get well?’ They told him, ‘He stopped being ill yesterday afternoon, at 1 o'clock.’ 
JHN.4.53	Then the father remembered. He knew it was the time when Jesus had said to him, ‘Your son will live.’ So, the man and all his family believed in Jesus.
JHN.4.54	This was the second 
JHN.5.1	Some time after that, Jesus went to Jerusalem, because it was time for one of the 
JHN.5.2	There is a pool near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem. Its name in the 
JHN.5.3	A large number of sick people were lying in these places. Some of them were 
JHN.5.4	An 
JHN.5.5	One man who was lying there had been ill for 38 years. 
JHN.5.6	Jesus saw this man. He knew that the man had been ill like this for a very long time. So he asked the man, ‘Do you want to get well?’ 
JHN.5.7	The sick man said, ‘Sir, I do not have anyone who will help me. I need somebody who will put me into the pool. When the water starts to move, I try to get in. But someone else always gets in before me.’ 
JHN.5.8	Then Jesus said to him, ‘Stand up! Pick up your 
JHN.5.9	The man became well immediately. He picked up his 
JHN.5.9	The day when this happened was a 
JHN.5.10	Because of this, the 
JHN.5.11	The man replied, ‘The man who made me well said to me, “Pick up your 
JHN.5.12	So they asked him, ‘Who is this man? Who said to you, “Pick up your 
JHN.5.13	The man did not know who had made him well. Jesus had gone away and joined the crowd that was there.
JHN.5.14	Some time after that, Jesus found the man in God's Great House. Jesus said to him, ‘See, you have become well. Stop doing wrong things. If you do not stop, something worse may happen to you.’ 
JHN.5.15	Then the man went to the 
JHN.5.16	The 
JHN.5.17	But Jesus said to them, ‘My Father is still working, and I too must work.’ 
JHN.5.18	Because Jesus said this, the 
JHN.5.19	So, Jesus answered them, ‘I am telling you what is true. The Son can do nothing by himself. He sees what the Father does, and he can do only those same things. What the Father does, the Son does also. 
JHN.5.20	The Father loves the Son. He shows the Son all the things that he himself does. And the Father will show the Son even greater things to do than these. Those greater things will surprise you even more than what you have already seen. 
JHN.5.21	The Father raises dead people, to make them alive again. In the same way, the Son gives life to whoever he chooses. 
JHN.5.22	More than that, the Father does not 
JHN.5.23	So then all people will know how great the Son is. They know that the Father is very great. In the same way, they will know that the Son is also very great. Some people may refuse to agree that the Son is great. But those people are thinking the same things about the Father, because he sent the Son. 
JHN.5.24	I am telling you what is true. Everyone who hears my message should believe in the Father who sent me. If they do believe, they will have life for ever with God. God will not 
JHN.5.25	I am telling you what is true. A time will soon come when those who are dead in their 
JHN.5.26	The Father himself can give people life. In the same way, he has given authority to the Son also to give people life. 
JHN.5.27	The Father has also given authority to the Son to 
JHN.5.28	Do not be surprised by this. There will be a time when all the dead people will hear the Son's voice. 
JHN.5.29	They will come out from under the ground. Those people who have done good things will rise and live with God always. Those people who have done bad things will also rise. But they will rise so that God can 
JHN.5.30	Jesus went on to say, ‘I can do nothing by myself. I hear what the Father says to me. Then, because of what he says, I 
JHN.5.31	If I say great things about myself, nobody would know that my words are true. 
JHN.5.32	But there is someone else who speaks about me. I know that what he says about me is true. 
JHN.5.33	You have sent your people to ask John about me. What he has told you about me is true. 
JHN.5.34	I do not really need any man to speak on my behalf. But I am telling you this to help you. Then God will be able to save you. 
JHN.5.35	John was like a light that shone brightly. For a certain time, you enjoyed the light that he gave.
JHN.5.36	But it is not only John who shows who I am. There are other things that show it more strongly. My Father has given work to me so that I could finish it. These are the things that I do, and they show who I am. They show clearly that the Father has sent me. 
JHN.5.37	Also, the Father himself has spoken about me. You have never heard his voice. And you have never seen his shape. 
JHN.5.38	I am the one that he has sent. You do not receive his message because you do not believe in me. 
JHN.5.39	You study carefully what the Bible teaches. You think that those books will give you life with God. And those books do really explain what is true about me. 
JHN.5.40	But then you refuse to come to me so that you could have life with God!
JHN.5.41	I do not want people to 
JHN.5.42	But I know what kind of people you are. I know that you do not really love God. 
JHN.5.43	I have come with my Father's authority, but you do not accept me. But if someone else comes with his own authority, then you will accept him. 
JHN.5.44	You like to 
JHN.5.45	But I will not need to tell the Father that you are wrong. Do not think that I will do that. No, it is Moses who will do that. You hope that Moses is the one who will help you. But he is the one who will show that you are wrong. 
JHN.5.46	Moses wrote about me. So, if you had really believed Moses, you would have believed me. 
JHN.5.47	But you do not believe what Moses wrote. So, you will never believe what I say.’ 
JHN.6.1	Some time after that, Jesus went across Lake Galilee, which is also called Lake Tiberias. 
JHN.6.2	A large crowd of people followed him, because of the 
JHN.6.3	Jesus went up a hill and he sat down there with his 
JHN.6.4	It was nearly the time for the 
JHN.6.5	Jesus looked up. He saw a large crowd of people who were coming towards him. He said to Philip, ‘Where can we buy enough bread to feed all these people?’ 
JHN.6.6	Jesus himself already knew what he would do. But he asked Philip this question because he wanted to know what Philip would say. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered, ‘A man could work for 8 months to get 200 coins. But he still would not have enough money to buy bread for all these people. There would not be enough bread for each person here to have even a little piece.’ 
JHN.6.8	Then Andrew, another one of Jesus' 
JHN.6.9	He said to Jesus, ‘Here is a boy who has 5 small loaves and two fish. But that will not be nearly enough food for so many people.’
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, ‘Tell the people to sit down.’ There was plenty of grass in that place, so the people sat down. There were about 5000 men in the crowd. 
JHN.6.11	Jesus took the loaves of bread and he thanked God for them. Then he broke the loaves into pieces. He passed them to all the people who were sitting there. Everyone had as much bread as they wanted to eat. Jesus did the same with the fish. 
JHN.6.12	When everyone had eaten enough food, Jesus said to his 
JHN.6.13	So the 
JHN.6.14	The people saw this 
JHN.6.15	The people wanted to take Jesus so that they could make him their king. But Jesus knew what they wanted to do. So, he went away to the hills again by himself.
JHN.6.16	When it was evening, Jesus' 
JHN.6.17	They got into a boat and they started to sail towards Capernaum. It had become dark and Jesus still had not come to them. 
JHN.6.18	A very strong wind was blowing and the water became dangerous. 
JHN.6.19	The 
JHN.6.20	But Jesus said to them, ‘It is I. Do not be afraid.’ 
JHN.6.21	So, the 
JHN.6.22	The crowd of people had stayed on the other side of the lake. The next day, they saw that the only boat had gone. They knew that Jesus' 
JHN.6.23	Other boats from Tiberias then arrived near to the place where all the people were. They had eaten the bread there after the 
JHN.6.24	The crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his 
JHN.6.25	The people found Jesus on the other side of the lake. They asked him, ‘Teacher, when did you arrive here?’ 
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered, ‘I am telling you what is true. You saw me do 
JHN.6.27	Do not work only for that kind of food. It soon becomes bad. Instead, work to get the food that continues for ever. That kind of food gives you life with God. The Son of Man, will give this food to you. God, the Father, has shown that the Son has his authority to do this.’
JHN.6.28	Then the people asked him, ‘How can we do the work that God wants us to do?’ 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered, ‘You should believe in the one that God has sent to you. That is the work that God wants you to do.’ 
JHN.6.30	So then the people asked him, ‘What 
JHN.6.31	Our 
JHN.6.32	Jesus said to them, ‘I am telling you what is true. It was not Moses who gave bread to you from 
JHN.6.33	God's bread is the one who comes down from 
JHN.6.34	So they said to him, ‘Sir, please give this bread to us now and always.’
JHN.6.35	Then Jesus said to them, ‘I am the bread that gives life to people. Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry. Anyone who believes in me will never be 
JHN.6.36	You have seen me, but still you do not believe in me. I have told you that before. 
JHN.6.37	Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me. When anyone comes to me, I will never send that person away. 
JHN.6.38	I have not come down from 
JHN.6.39	He has sent me. He does not want me to lose any of the people that he has given to me. Not even one of them. He wants me to raise all of them up to life on the last day. 
JHN.6.40	Who are these people who will have life for ever with God? It is everyone who sees the Son and believes in him. I will raise them all up on the last day. That is what my Father wants.’
JHN.6.41	Jesus had said, ‘I am the bread that came down from 
JHN.6.42	They said, ‘This is Jesus, the son of Joseph. We know his father and his mother. He should not say that he came down from 
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered, ‘Stop saying these bad things about me to each other. 
JHN.6.44	The Father has sent me. Nobody can come to me unless the Father brings them to me. I will raise those people up on the last day, so that they have life for ever. 
JHN.6.45	The 
JHN.6.46	I do not mean that anyone has seen the Father. Only the one who has come from God has seen the Father. Nobody else has seen him. 
JHN.6.47	I am telling you what is true. The person who believes my message has life for ever. 
JHN.6.48	I am the bread that causes you to live. 
JHN.6.49	Your 
JHN.6.50	This bread that comes down from 
JHN.6.51	I am the bread that has life. This bread came down from 
JHN.6.52	Then the 
JHN.6.53	Jesus said to them, ‘I tell you what is true. You must eat the body of the Son of Man and you must drink his blood. Unless you do those things, you do not have true life. 
JHN.6.54	Every person needs to eat my body and they need to drink my blood. If they do those things, they have life for ever with God. I will raise them up on the last day. 
JHN.6.55	My body is the true food and my blood is the true drink. 
JHN.6.56	Every person needs to eat my body and they need to drink my blood. If a person does that, that person lives in me. And I live in them. 
JHN.6.57	The Father, who has life, sent me. I live because of him. In the same way, anyone who takes me as their food will live because of me. 
JHN.6.58	This is the bread that came down from 
JHN.6.59	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the 
JHN.6.60	Many of Jesus' 
JHN.6.61	Jesus himself knew that the 
JHN.6.62	Think about this: The Son of Man will go up again to the place where he was before. And you will see him go up. Will you agree to that? 
JHN.6.63	It is the Spirit that gives you life. Human beings cannot do that. The words that I have spoken to you come from the Spirit. They give you life. 
JHN.6.64	But some of you do not believe my message.’
JHN.6.64	Jesus had known from the beginning which of them would not believe in him. Also, he had always known who would sell him to his 
JHN.6.65	Then Jesus said to them, ‘That is why I told you that only the Father can bring people to me. Nobody can come to me unless the Father makes them able to come.’
JHN.6.66	From that time, many of Jesus' 
JHN.6.67	Then Jesus asked the 12 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered him, ‘
JHN.6.69	We believe that you are the 
JHN.6.70	Jesus replied, ‘I have chosen the 12 of you. But one of you is a servant of 
JHN.6.71	He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was one of the 12 
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus visited many places in Galilee. He did not want to visit Judea because the 
JHN.7.2	It was almost time for the 
JHN.7.3	So Jesus' brothers said to him, ‘You should leave this place and you should go to Judea. Then your 
JHN.7.4	Nobody does things secretly if he wants everyone to know him. You are doing these things, so you should show yourself to everybody.’ 
JHN.7.5	Even his own brothers did not believe in him.
JHN.7.6	So Jesus said to them, ‘It is not the right time for me yet. For you, any time is right. 
JHN.7.7	People who belong to this world cannot 
JHN.7.8	You should go to the 
JHN.7.9	After Jesus said this, he stayed in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	Some time after his brothers had gone, Jesus went to the 
JHN.7.11	The 
JHN.7.12	People in the crowd were talking quietly to each other about Jesus. Some people said, ‘He is a good man.’ But other people said, ‘No, he is telling the people things that are not true.’ 
JHN.7.13	But nobody spoke clearly about him, because they were afraid of the 
JHN.7.14	When about half of the time for the 
JHN.7.15	The 
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered, ‘What I teach does not come from me. No, it comes from the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.17	Some people choose to do what God wants. Those people will know about what I teach. They will know whether it comes from God, or whether it comes from my own thoughts. 
JHN.7.18	A person who teaches his own ideas wants people to think that he himself is great. But it is different for me. I want to show that the one who sent me is great. A person like that is honest and there is nothing false in him. 
JHN.7.19	Moses gave God's 
JHN.7.20	The crowd answered, ‘You have a 
JHN.7.21	Jesus replied, ‘I did one 
JHN.7.22	Moses gave you a 
JHN.7.23	You will do that so that you obey Moses' 
JHN.7.24	Do not quickly decide whether something is right or wrong just because of what you see. Instead, think about it carefully. Then you will decide in a right way.’
JHN.7.25	Some of the people in Jerusalem began to say, ‘This is the man that our leaders want to kill. 
JHN.7.26	But look! He is speaking to the crowds, and the leaders are not saying anything against him! Perhaps they think that he is really the 
JHN.7.27	But we know where this man came from. When the 
JHN.7.28	Jesus was still teaching in the yard of God's Great House. He shouted, ‘Yes, that's right! You say that you know me. And you know where I came from. But I have not come because I myself decided to come. He who sent me is true. You do not know him. 
JHN.7.29	But I know him because I have come from him. He is the one who sent me.’ 
JHN.7.30	When they heard this, they tried to take hold of him. But nobody could put their hands on him, because it was not yet the right time. 
JHN.7.31	But many people in the crowd believed in Jesus. They said, ‘This man has done so many 
JHN.7.32	The 
JHN.7.33	Jesus said, ‘I will be with you for only a short time. Then I will return to the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.34	You will look for me, but you will not find me. You cannot go to the place where I will be.’ 
JHN.7.35	The 
JHN.7.36	He said, “You will look for me, but you will not find me.” And he also said, “You cannot go to the place where I will be.” What does he mean?’
JHN.7.37	The last day of the 
JHN.7.38	It says in the Bible, “God will cause streams of water to pour out from anyone who believes in me. Water that gives life will come out from inside that person.” ’ 
JHN.7.39	Jesus was speaking about God's Spirit, who would come to people some time after that. Those people who believed in Jesus would receive God's Spirit at that later time. But God had not given his Spirit to people yet, because he had not raised Jesus back up to 
JHN.7.40	The people in the crowd heard Jesus say these words. Some of them said, ‘This man really must be the 
JHN.7.41	Other people said, ‘This man is the 
JHN.7.42	The Bible says that the 
JHN.7.43	In this way the people had different thoughts about Jesus. 
JHN.7.44	Some people wanted to take hold of him. But nobody could put their hands on him to take him away.
JHN.7.45	The officers returned to the leaders of the 
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, ‘Nobody has ever spoken great things like this man speaks.’ 
JHN.7.47	The 
JHN.7.48	None of the 
JHN.7.49	But this crowd does not know what God's 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus spoke to them. He himself was one of the 
JHN.7.51	‘We must find out first what this man has done. Then we can decide if it is right to 
JHN.7.52	They answered Nicodemus, ‘Perhaps you come from Galilee, as well as him! Study what the Bible teaches. You will learn that no 
JHN.7.53	Then everyone went to his own home. 
JHN.8.1	But Jesus went to the hill which is called the 
JHN.8.2	Early the next morning, Jesus returned to God's Great House in Jerusalem. All the people came to him. He sat down and he began to teach them. 
JHN.8.3	The 
JHN.8.4	They said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, we found this woman. She was having sex with a man who was not her husband. 
JHN.8.5	In God's 
JHN.8.6	They asked this question for a reason. They wanted Jesus to say something wrong, so that they could 
JHN.8.7	They continued to ask him questions. So he stood up and he said to them, ‘Has any one of you never done anything wrong? That person may throw the first stone to kill her.’ 
JHN.8.8	Then he bent himself down again and he wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	When they heard what Jesus said, the people began to go away. They went one at a time. The older people went first. So then only Jesus remained with the woman. She was still standing there. 
JHN.8.10	Jesus stood up. He said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Is there nobody still here who wants to 
JHN.8.11	She said, ‘There is nobody, sir.’ So Jesus said, ‘I also do not want to 
JHN.8.12	Jesus spoke to the people again. He said, ‘I am the light of the world. Those people who become my 
JHN.8.13	The 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered, ‘What I say is true. Even if I do speak about myself, my words are true. I know where I have come from. I also know where I will go. As for you, you do not know where I came from. You do not know where I will go. 
JHN.8.15	You 
JHN.8.16	But if I did 
JHN.8.17	Your own 
JHN.8.18	I speak what is true about myself. The Father, who sent me, also speaks what is true about me.’
JHN.8.19	Then they asked him, ‘So, where is your Father?’ Jesus answered, ‘You do not know either me or my Father. If you really knew me, you would know my Father also.’ 
JHN.8.20	Jesus said all these words while he taught in the yard of God's Great House. He was near the place where they kept the gifts of money. But nobody took hold of him, because it was not the right time for that yet.
JHN.8.21	Jesus said to them again, ‘I will go away and you will look for me. But even when you die, you will still be doing wrong things. God will not have 
JHN.8.22	So, the 
JHN.8.23	Jesus answered, ‘You belong to the things down here in the world. But I have come from above. You belong to this world, but I do not belong to this world. 
JHN.8.24	I told you that when you die, God will not have 
JHN.8.25	Then they asked Jesus, ‘So, who are you?’ He answered, ‘I have told you who I am from the beginning. 
JHN.8.26	I have many things I could say about you. I could show that you have done many wrong things. But the one who sent me speaks to me. I tell the world only what I have heard him say to me. What he says is true.’ 
JHN.8.27	They did not understand that he was speaking to them about his Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said to them, ‘You will lift up the Son of Man on a 
JHN.8.29	He who sent me is with me. I always do the things that make him happy. So he has never gone away so that I am alone.’ 
JHN.8.30	Many people who heard Jesus say these things believed in him. 
JHN.8.31	Then Jesus spoke to the 
JHN.8.32	Then you will know what is really true. And that will make you free.’ 
JHN.8.33	They answered him, ‘We belong to Abraham's family. We have never been anyone's slaves. But you say that we will become free. What do you mean?’
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, ‘I am telling you what is true. Everyone who does wrong things is a slave to 
JHN.8.35	A slave does not belong to a family for ever. But a son does belong to a family for ever. 
JHN.8.36	So, if the Son makes you free, you will really be free. 
JHN.8.37	I know that you belong to Abraham's family. But you are looking for a way to kill me. That is because you have no place in yourselves for my words. 
JHN.8.38	I speak about the things that my Father has shown me. You also do what you have heard from your father.’
JHN.8.39	They answered, ‘Abraham is our father!’ Jesus replied, ‘If you were really Abraham's children, you would do the same kind of things that he did. 
JHN.8.40	I have told you the true message that I have heard from God. But you want to kill me. Abraham did not do anything like that! 
JHN.8.41	You do the same things that your own father does.’ They said to him, ‘God himself is our only Father, and we are his proper sons!’
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, ‘If God was really your Father, you would love me. I came from God and now I am here with you. I did not come on my own behalf, but God sent me. 
JHN.8.43	Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot really accept my message. 
JHN.8.44	You belong to your father, the 
JHN.8.45	As for me, I tell you what is true. And that is why you do not believe me. 
JHN.8.46	None of you can show that I have done anything wrong. You should believe me, because I am telling you God's true message. 
JHN.8.47	Someone who belongs to God accepts God's message. But you do not belong to God. That is why you do not accept his message.’
JHN.8.48	The 
JHN.8.49	Jesus replied, ‘There is no 
JHN.8.50	I myself do not want people to 
JHN.8.51	I am telling you what is true. Anyone who obeys my words will never die.’ 
JHN.8.52	The 
JHN.8.53	You cannot be greater than our father Abraham, and he died! You cannot be greater than the 
JHN.8.54	Jesus replied, ‘If I myself wanted people to 
JHN.8.55	You have never really known him, but I know him. I might say, “I do not know him.” But then I would be telling a 
JHN.8.56	Your 
JHN.8.57	The 
JHN.8.58	Jesus said, ‘I am telling you what is true. Before Abraham was even born, “I am”.’ 
JHN.8.59	Then they picked up stones. They wanted to throw them at him and kill him. But Jesus hid himself from them. He went away from God's Great House.
JHN.9.1	While Jesus was walking along, he saw a certain man. This man had been 
JHN.9.2	Jesus' 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, ‘It was not because either this man or his parents did something wrong. It happened so that God could show his great work in this man. 
JHN.9.4	While it is still day, we must continue to work. God has sent me and we must do his work. We must work now because it will be night soon. Then nobody can work. 
JHN.9.5	While I am still here in the world, I am the world's light.’
JHN.9.6	When Jesus had finished speaking, he 
JHN.9.7	Jesus said to him, ‘Go and wash in the Siloam pool.’ (The name Siloam means ‘Sent’.) So the man went there and he washed himself. When he returned, now he could see.
JHN.9.8	People began to talk about him. Some of these people lived near him. Others had seen him when he was asking for money. They said, ‘This is the man who sat here. He asked people to give him money. Isn't that right?’ 
JHN.9.9	Some people said, ‘Yes, it is him.’ But other people said, ‘No, it is someone who seems to be like him.’ But the man himself said, ‘I am that man.’
JHN.9.10	They asked him, ‘How did your eyes now become able to see?’ 
JHN.9.11	He answered, ‘The man called Jesus made some mud. He put the mud on my eyes. Then he sent me to wash in the Siloam pool. So I went there and I washed. Then I could see.’
JHN.9.12	They asked him, ‘Where is this man?’ He replied, ‘I do not know.’
JHN.9.13	The people brought the man who had been 
JHN.9.14	It was a 
JHN.9.15	So the 
JHN.9.16	So some of the 
JHN.9.17	The 
JHN.9.18	The 
JHN.9.19	They asked the parents, ‘Is this your son? You say, “When he was born, he was 
JHN.9.20	The parents replied, ‘We know that this is our son. And when he was born, he was 
JHN.9.21	But we do not know how he can see now. We do not know who made his eyes able to see. Ask him. He is old enough to answer you for himself!’ 
JHN.9.22	The man's parents said these things because they were afraid of the 
JHN.9.23	That is why the man's parents said, ‘Ask him. He is old enough.’
JHN.9.24	So the leaders again spoke to the man who had been 
JHN.9.25	The man replied, ‘I do not know whether he obeys God or not. But I do know one thing: I was 
JHN.9.26	Then they asked him, ‘What did he do to you? How did he make your eyes able to see?’ 
JHN.9.27	He answered them, ‘I have told you already and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Maybe you want to become his 
JHN.9.28	Then the leaders were very angry with him. They shouted at him, ‘No, it is you! You are that man's 
JHN.9.29	We know that God spoke to Moses. But who is this man? We do not even know where he comes from.’
JHN.9.30	The man answered, ‘That is a very strange thing! You do not know where this man comes from. But he is the one who made my eyes able to see. 
JHN.9.31	We know that God does not listen to people who do not obey him. But he does listen to good people who do what he wants them to do. 
JHN.9.32	Nobody has ever made the eyes of a 
JHN.9.33	So, this man Jesus must have come from God. Unless he came from God, he could not do anything like that.’
JHN.9.34	The 
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that the 
JHN.9.36	The man answered, ‘Sir, please tell me who he is. Then I can believe in him.’ 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, ‘You have already seen him. It is me, and I am talking to you now.’ 
JHN.9.38	Then the man said, ‘
JHN.9.39	Then Jesus said, ‘I came into this world to show what people are really like. Then people who know they are 
JHN.9.40	Some of the 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said to them, ‘If you really were 
JHN.10.1	Jesus went on to say, ‘I am telling you what is true. A 
JHN.10.2	The 
JHN.10.3	The person who watches the gate opens it for the 
JHN.10.4	When he has brought out all his own sheep, he goes in front of them. The sheep follow him because they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	They will not follow a stranger. They will run away from a stranger because they do not recognise his voice.’
JHN.10.6	Jesus told them this story like a picture to teach them. But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus spoke again. He said, ‘I am telling you what is true. I am like the gate for the sheep. 
JHN.10.8	All other men who ever came to the sheep before me were like robbers. But the sheep did not listen to them. 
JHN.10.9	I am like the gate. Everyone who comes in through me will be safe. They will be free to come in and to go out. And they will find plenty of food. 
JHN.10.10	The robber only wants to take away my sheep. He wants to kill them. He comes only to destroy them. But I have come so that they can have true life. And so that they can have everything that they need.
JHN.10.11	I am the good 
JHN.10.12	Another man may work with sheep so that he gets money. But the sheep are not his own. A man like that is not the 
JHN.10.13	That man runs away because the sheep are not his own. The sheep do not really matter to him.
JHN.10.14	I am the good 
JHN.10.15	I know them in the same way that my Father knows me. And they know me in the same way that I know the Father. I will die so that I can save my sheep. 
JHN.10.16	I have other sheep also, and I must bring them too. They do not belong to this group of sheep. But they also will listen to my voice. So, all the sheep will become one group, and they will have one 
JHN.10.17	The Father loves me because I choose to die for my sheep. But after I give my life like that, I will become alive again. 
JHN.10.18	Nobody can take my life from me. Instead, I myself choose to die. I have authority to do that. I also have authority so that I can become alive again. My Father has said that I must do that.’
JHN.10.19	Again, the 
JHN.10.20	Many of them said, ‘He has a 
JHN.10.21	But other people said, ‘A man with a 
JHN.10.22	It was the time for the 
JHN.10.23	Jesus was walking in the yard of God's Great House, under a place with a roof. The place was called 
JHN.10.24	The 
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered, ‘I have already told you, but you do not believe. The things that I do by my Father's authority show you who I am. 
JHN.10.26	But you refuse to believe, because you are not my sheep. 
JHN.10.27	My sheep recognise my voice. I know them, and they follow me. 
JHN.10.28	I give them life for ever with God. They will never die. Nobody can ever take them away from me. 
JHN.10.29	My Father has given them to me. He is greater than all things. Nobody can ever take my sheep out of my Father's hand. 
JHN.10.30	My Father and I are one Person.’
JHN.10.31	Then the 
JHN.10.32	Jesus said to them, ‘I have done many good things. The Father sent me to do them, and I have shown them to you. Which of those good things make you want to kill me with stones?’ 
JHN.10.33	The 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, ‘It says in your own books of God's 
JHN.10.35	God called the people to whom he spoke “gods”. And you know that the Bible remains always true. 
JHN.10.36	So, when I said that I am God's Son, why am I wrong? The Father chose me for himself. And he sent me into the world. So you should not say that I am speaking bad things against God. 
JHN.10.37	If I am not doing my Father's work, do not believe me. 
JHN.10.38	But if I am doing his work, you should believe that work. Even if you do not believe me, you should believe the things that I do. Then you will know certainly that the Father is in me. And you will know that I am in the Father.’
JHN.10.39	Again, the 
JHN.10.40	After that, Jesus returned across the Jordan river. He went to the place where John had earlier 
JHN.10.41	Many people came to him. They said to each other, ‘John did not do any 
JHN.10.42	And in that place, many people believed in Jesus.
JHN.11.1	There was a certain man, who was called Lazarus. He lived at Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived too. He became ill. 
JHN.11.2	It was this Mary who had poured 
JHN.11.3	So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus to say, ‘
JHN.11.4	Jesus heard the message. Then he said, ‘This illness will not finish with Lazarus's death. No, its purpose is to show how great God is. Because of this, people will see how great God's Son is.’ 
JHN.11.5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and their brother Lazarus, too. 
JHN.11.6	He heard the news that Lazarus was ill. But then he stayed in the place where he was for two more days.
JHN.11.7	After that, Jesus said to his 
JHN.11.8	The 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, ‘You know that there are 12 hours in the day. Anyone who walks during the day will not fall down. He will not fall down because he sees this world's light. 
JHN.11.10	But anyone who walks during the night will fall down. He will fall down because he has no light.’
JHN.11.11	Jesus said that. Then he said to them, ‘Our friend Lazarus is sleeping. But I will go there to wake him up.’ 
JHN.11.12	So the 
JHN.11.13	The 
JHN.11.14	So then, Jesus told them clearly, ‘Lazarus is dead. 
JHN.11.15	But I am happy that I was not there with him. I am happy about that because it will help you. Now you will believe in me. We must go to him now.’ 
JHN.11.16	Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to the other 
JHN.11.17	Jesus arrived at Bethany. He discovered that they had buried Lazarus 4 days earlier. 
JHN.11.18	Bethany was less than 2 miles (about 3 kilometres) from Jerusalem. 
JHN.11.19	Many 
JHN.11.20	Martha heard the news that Jesus was coming. So, she went out to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house with the visitors. 
JHN.11.21	Martha said to Jesus, ‘
JHN.11.22	But even now, I know that God will answer you. He will do whatever you ask him.’ 
JHN.11.23	Jesus told her, ‘Your brother will rise, to become alive again.’ 
JHN.11.24	Martha replied, ‘I know that he will rise, to become alive again, on the last day.’ 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, ‘I have authority over death. I raise dead people, and I give people true life. Anyone who believes in me will live. Even if that person dies, he will continue to live. 
JHN.11.26	People who live because they believe in me will never die. Do you believe that?’ 
JHN.11.27	Martha answered, ‘Yes, 
JHN.11.28	After this, Martha went back to the house. She took Mary on her own and said to her, ‘The Teacher is here, and he is asking to meet you.’ 
JHN.11.29	When Mary heard this, she got up immediately. She went out to meet Jesus. 
JHN.11.30	Jesus had not arrived in the village yet. He was still in the place where Martha had met him. 
JHN.11.31	There were still 
JHN.11.32	Mary arrived at the place where Jesus was. When she saw Jesus, she fell at his feet. She said, ‘
JHN.11.33	Jesus saw that Mary was weeping. He saw that the 
JHN.11.34	He asked them, ‘Where have you put his dead body?’ They answered, ‘Come and see, 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	Then the 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, ‘He opened the eyes of the 
JHN.11.38	Jesus arrived at the place where they had put Lazarus' dead body. It was a big hole in the rock. A very large stone covered the front of the hole. Once again, Jesus felt very 
JHN.11.39	He said, ‘Take the stone away.’ Martha, the dead man's sister, said to Jesus, ‘But 
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, ‘I told you already that you must believe in me. Then, as a result, you will see how great and how powerful God is.’ 
JHN.11.41	So they moved the stone away. Jesus looked up towards the sky. He said, ‘Father, I thank you that you have listened to me. 
JHN.11.42	I know that you listen to me always. But I said this to help all the people who are standing here. I want them to believe that you sent me.’ 
JHN.11.43	When Jesus had said this, he shouted with a loud voice, ‘Lazarus, come out!’ 
JHN.11.44	The dead man came out. There were pieces of cloth round his hands and round his feet. Another piece of cloth was round his face. Jesus said to them, ‘Undo the cloths and let him go.’
JHN.11.45	The 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the 
JHN.11.47	Then the 
JHN.11.48	If we let him do more things like this, everyone will believe in him. Then the 
JHN.11.49	One of the group was the leader of the 
JHN.11.50	It is better that one man should die on behalf of our people. That is better than if all 
JHN.11.51	Caiaphas did not say this because he had thought it by himself. No, he was speaking as a 
JHN.11.52	And Jesus would die not only for Israel's people. Also, he would die for all God's people who lived in many different places. He would bring them all together. They would become like one big 
JHN.11.53	From that day, the 
JHN.11.54	So, Jesus stopped travelling about in Judea where everyone could see him. Instead, he went away from there to a town called Ephraim that was near to the 
JHN.11.55	It was almost time for the 
JHN.11.56	They were continuing to look for Jesus. While they stood in the yard of 
JHN.11.57	The leaders of the 
JHN.12.1	Six days before the 
JHN.12.2	Some friends prepared a special meal there for Jesus. Martha gave out the food, and Lazarus sat among the visitors, with Jesus. 
JHN.12.3	Then Mary brought a pound of very expensive 
JHN.12.4	Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' 
JHN.12.5	Judas said, ‘We could have sold this 
JHN.12.6	He did not say this because he really wanted to help the poor people. No, he said it because he wanted the money himself. He kept the bag of money, and sometimes he took money from it for himself. 
JHN.12.7	But Jesus said, ‘Do not stop her! She has kept this 
JHN.12.8	You will always have poor people with you. But you will not always have me with you.’
JHN.12.9	By this time, a large crowd of 
JHN.12.10	So the leaders of the 
JHN.12.11	They wanted to do that because many 
JHN.12.12	The next day, a large crowd of people were in Jerusalem for the 
JHN.12.13	So, they took branches from 
JHN.12.14	Jesus found a young 
JHN.12.15	‘Do not be afraid, you people in 
JHN.12.15	Look! Your king is coming.
JHN.12.15	He is riding on a young 
JHN.12.16	Jesus' 
JHN.12.17	The crowd who had been with Jesus before at Bethany, continued to tell people about Lazarus. They said, ‘Jesus told Lazarus that he should come out of the hole in the rock. He made Lazarus alive again after he had died and his body had been put in there.’ 
JHN.12.18	That is why many people came to meet Jesus. They had heard that he had done this 
JHN.12.19	So, the 
JHN.12.20	There were some 
JHN.12.21	These 
JHN.12.22	Philip went and he told Andrew this. Then Philip and Andrew went to Jesus and they told him.
JHN.12.23	Jesus said to them, ‘God will show how great the Son of Man is. It is now time for that to happen. 
JHN.12.24	I am telling you what is true. A seed of 
JHN.12.25	Anyone who loves his own life will lose it. But anyone who 
JHN.12.26	Anyone who wants to be my servant must follow me. Then he will be with me, where I am. My Father will 
JHN.12.27	Now I have trouble in my mind. What shall I say? I might say, “Father, save me from this time of trouble!” But this difficult time is the purpose for which I came to the world. 
JHN.12.28	So, I will say, “Father, show how great and how good you are.” ’
JHN.12.28	Then a voice spoke from 
JHN.12.29	The crowd of people who were standing there heard the sound of this voice. They said that it was like the noise of 
JHN.12.30	Jesus said, ‘When this voice spoke, it was not so that it could help me. No, it spoke so that it could help you. 
JHN.12.31	It is time now for God to 
JHN.12.32	But when people lift me up from the ground, then I will bring everyone to myself.’ 
JHN.12.33	Jesus said this to show in what way he would soon die. 
JHN.12.34	The crowd said, ‘The Bible tells us that the 
JHN.12.35	Jesus answered, ‘The light will be with you for only a short time longer. So, continue to walk while you still have the light. Do that, so that the dark will not come over you. Anyone who walks in the dark does not know where they are going. 
JHN.12.36	While you still have the light with you, believe in that light. So then you will become children of light.’ When Jesus had said this, he went away. He hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	Jesus had done many 
JHN.12.38	This showed that the 
JHN.12.38	‘
JHN.12.38	You have shown how powerful you are,
JHN.12.38	but nobody has really understood.’ 
JHN.12.39	Isaiah spoke also about why the people could not believe. 
JHN.12.40	He said:
JHN.12.40	‘God has made their eyes unable to see.
JHN.12.40	He has closed their minds.
JHN.12.40	So they cannot see with their eyes,
JHN.12.40	and they cannot understand with their minds.
JHN.12.40	They will not turn to me, so that I can make them well.’ 
JHN.12.41	Long ago, Isaiah had seen how great Christ would be. That is why he said these things.
JHN.12.42	But even at that time, many of the 
JHN.12.43	They wanted other people to 
JHN.12.44	Jesus said in a loud voice, ‘Anyone who believes in me does not believe only in me. That person believes also in the one who sent me. 
JHN.12.45	Anyone who looks at me does not see only me. They see also him who sent me. 
JHN.12.46	I have come into the world to be a light for people. Everyone who believes in me will not remain in the dark. That is why I came. 
JHN.12.47	Not everyone who hears my words will obey them. I will not 
JHN.12.48	But there is something that will 
JHN.12.49	The words that I have spoken did not come from me myself. They came from the Father, who sent me. He told me what message I must speak. He told me the words I must say. 
JHN.12.50	The message that the Father has given me causes people to have life for ever. I know that. So, I speak only those things that the Father has said to me.’
JHN.13.1	It was nearly time for the 
JHN.13.2	Jesus and his 
JHN.13.3	Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over everything. He knew that he had come from God. And he knew that he would soon return to God. 
JHN.13.4	So, during the meal, he stood up. He took off the coat that he wore over his other clothes. He tied a piece of cloth round himself. 
JHN.13.5	Then he poured water into a bowl and he began to wash the 
JHN.13.6	Jesus came to Simon Peter. Peter asked him, ‘
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered him, ‘You do not understand now what I am doing. But you will understand some time after this.’ 
JHN.13.8	Peter said, ‘No! You will never wash my feet!’ Jesus answered, ‘If I do not wash you, you do not belong with me.’ 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter replied, ‘So 
JHN.13.10	Jesus said, ‘A person who has bathed is completely clean. He needs only to wash his feet. And all of you are clean, except one of you.’ 
JHN.13.11	Jesus knew already who would sell him to his 
JHN.13.12	When he had finished washing the 
JHN.13.13	You call me Teacher and 
JHN.13.14	I am your Teacher and your 
JHN.13.15	I have given you an example. You should do the same for others as I have done for you. 
JHN.13.16	I am telling you what is true. No servant is more important than his master is. No 
JHN.13.17	Now you know these things. So, you will be happy if you really do them.’
JHN.13.18	Jesus went on to say, ‘I am not talking about all of you. I know the people that I have chosen. The Bible says, “Someone who ate food with me has become my 
JHN.13.19	I am telling you this now, before it happens. So then, when it does happen, you will believe me. You will believe that “I am who I am”. 
JHN.13.20	I am telling you what is true. Anyone who accepts someone that I send to them is accepting me also. Anyone who accepts me is also accepting my Father God who sent me.’
JHN.13.21	After Jesus had said this, he felt very 
JHN.13.22	The 
JHN.13.23	The 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter pointed at that 
JHN.13.25	So that 
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, ‘I will put a piece of bread in the dish of food. Then I will give the bread to him. That is the man.’ So he put a piece of bread in the dish. Then he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
JHN.13.27	When Judas had taken the bread, 
JHN.13.28	None of the other 
JHN.13.29	Judas kept the bag of money on behalf of the group of 
JHN.13.30	Judas took the bread and ate it. Then he went out immediately. By now it was night.
JHN.13.31	When Judas had left, Jesus said, ‘Now people will see how great the Son of Man is. Because of him, they will also see how great God is. 
JHN.13.32	The Son will show how great God is. Then God will take the Son to himself and he will show how great the Son is. He will do that immediately.
JHN.13.33	My children, I will be with you for only a short time now. You will look for me. But I tell you now what I told the 
JHN.13.34	I give a new rule to you. Love each other. You must love each other as I have loved you. 
JHN.13.35	In this way, everyone will know that you are my 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter asked him, ‘
JHN.13.37	Peter said, ‘
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, ‘You say that you would die for me. But I tell you this. Soon you will even say that you do not know me. Before the 
JHN.14.1	Jesus said to his 
JHN.14.2	There are many rooms in my Father's house. I will go now so that I can prepare a place for you there. If it was not true, I would not have told you this. 
JHN.14.3	After I have prepared a place for you, I will return. Then I will take you so that you will be with me. You will be where I am. 
JHN.14.4	You know the way to the place where I will go.’
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to him, ‘
JHN.14.6	Jesus answered, ‘I am the way. I am the 
JHN.14.7	If you really know me, you will know my Father also. From now on, you do know him, and you have seen him.’
JHN.14.8	Philip said, ‘
JHN.14.9	Jesus answered, ‘I have been with all of you for a long time. But still you do not seem to know me, Philip! Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. So why do you say, “Show the Father to us”? 
JHN.14.10	I am in the Father and the Father is in me. You should believe that. The words that I say to you do not come from me myself. But the Father lives in me, and he is doing his work. 
JHN.14.11	I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Believe me when I say that. You have seen the things that I have done. So, if you do not believe my words, believe because of my work. 
JHN.14.12	I am telling you what is true. Whoever believes in me will do the same things that I have been doing. Yes, he will do even greater things than these, because I will go to my Father. 
JHN.14.13	Ask me to help you. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it for you. In that way, the Son will show everyone how great the Father is. 
JHN.14.14	Yes, you should ask me for anything in my name. I will do it for you.’ 
JHN.14.15	Jesus went on to say, ‘If you love me, do what I have told you to do. 
JHN.14.16	I will ask the Father to help you with this. He will send another Helper to be with you. That Helper will stay with you always. 
JHN.14.17	He is God's Spirit, and he shows you what is true. The people who belong to this world cannot receive him. That is because they cannot see him. They cannot know who he is. But you know him because he stays with you. And he will be in you. 
JHN.14.18	I will not let you remain alone, like children without parents. I will come to you.
JHN.14.19	Soon, the people who belong to this world will not see me any longer. But you will see me. Because I will live, you will live also. 
JHN.14.20	On that day, you will know that I am in my Father. You will know that you are in me, and I am in you. 
JHN.14.21	Those people who obey my message are the ones who really love me. They accept my words and do what I say. My Father will love everyone who loves me. I also will love them and I will show myself to them.’
JHN.14.22	Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, ‘
JHN.14.23	Jesus replied, ‘Everyone who loves me will obey my message. My Father will love them. And my Father and I will come to them and we will make our home with them. 
JHN.14.24	Anyone who does not love me will not obey my message. These words that you hear are not my own. No, they come from the Father, who sent me. 
JHN.14.25	I have said these things to you while I am still with you. 
JHN.14.26	But the Father will send the 
JHN.14.27	I will go away but I will give you a gift of 
JHN.14.28	You heard me say to you, “I will go away, but I will return to you.” If you loved me, you would be happy because of that. You would be happy because I will go to the Father. And he is greater than I am. 
JHN.14.29	I have told you this now, before it happens. So then, when it does happen, you will believe. 
JHN.14.30	I will not talk with you much more, because the ruler of this world will come soon. He has no power over me. 
JHN.14.31	But the people who belong to this world must learn about me. They must know that I love the Father. I do everything that he tells me to do. I must show that to them. Now get up, we must go from here.’ 
JHN.15.1	Jesus said, ‘I am the true 
JHN.15.2	Some branches that are part of me may have no fruit on them. My Father completely removes all those branches. But other branches do have fruit. My Father cuts all those branches to make them better. Then they will be good and make more fruit. 
JHN.15.3	The words that I have spoken to you have made you good already. 
JHN.15.4	Continue to live in me, and I will continue to live in you. A branch cannot make fruit by itself. It can make fruit only if it continues to be part of the 
JHN.15.5	I am the 
JHN.15.6	If anyone does not remain in me, that person is like a dead branch. The gardener will throw that branch away and it will become dry. People throw all those dry branches into the fire so that they burn. 
JHN.15.7	You must remain in me, and my message must remain in you. Then you may ask for anything that you want. And God will do it for you. 
JHN.15.8	If you make plenty of fruit, that will show how great and how good my Father is. You will show that you really are my 
JHN.15.9	I have loved you in the same way that the Father has loved me. Continue to live in a way that shows my love. 
JHN.15.10	If you obey what I have told you, you will be living in my love. In the same way, I have obeyed what my Father has told me to do. In that way, I live in his love. 
JHN.15.11	I want you to be completely happy, in the same way that I myself am happy. That is why I have told you these things.
JHN.15.12	This is the rule that I give to you: You must love each other, in the same way that I have loved you. 
JHN.15.13	A person really loves his friends if he dies on behalf of them. Nobody could love anyone more than that. 
JHN.15.14	And you are my friends, if you obey my message. 
JHN.15.15	A servant does not know what his master is doing. So I do not call you servants any longer. No, I call you my friends. This is because I have told you everything that I have heard from my Father. 
JHN.15.16	You did not choose me, but I chose you. I chose you to go and to make plenty of fruit. That kind of fruit will continue always. For that reason, the Father will help you with anything that you ask him. If you ask him in my name, he will do it for you. 
JHN.15.17	This is what I tell you to do: You must love each other.’
JHN.15.18	‘The people who belong to this world may 
JHN.15.19	If you belonged to this world, this world's people would love you. They would love you because you would belong with them. But I chose you so that you would be separate from this world's people. You do not belong with them, so they 
JHN.15.20	Remember what I told you: “No servant is more important than his master is.” If they have caused trouble for me, they will also cause trouble for you. But if they have obeyed my message, they will also obey your message. 
JHN.15.21	They will do all these things to you because you belong to me. They will do them because they do not know the one who sent me.
JHN.15.22	I have come and I have spoken my message to them. If I had not done that, they would not have been 
JHN.15.23	Anyone who 
JHN.15.24	When I was with them, I did many great things. Nobody else ever did things like that. If I had not done those great things among them, they would not have known what is wrong. But they have seen what I did. As a result, they have 
JHN.15.25	Their book of God's Law says, “They 
JHN.15.26	When I return to my Father, I will send the Helper to you. The Helper is God's Spirit who speaks only true things. He comes to you from the Father. I will send him to you and he will speak true things about me. 
JHN.15.27	You also must speak to people about me, because you have been with me from the beginning.’
JHN.16.1	Jesus went on to say, ‘I have told you all these things, so that you will not turn away from God. 
JHN.16.2	People will send you away from their meeting places. There will be a time when people will want to kill you. When they do this, they will even think that they are doing what God wants. 
JHN.16.3	They will do these things to you because they have never known either the Father or me. 
JHN.16.4	But I have told you this so that you will remember. When they begin to do these things, you will remember that I told you about them already.’
JHN.16.4	‘I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you. 
JHN.16.5	But now I will go to the Father who sent me. But none of you asks me, “Where will you go?” 
JHN.16.6	And now you are very sad, because I have told you these things. 
JHN.16.7	But what I tell you is true. It will be better for you if I go away. Because, if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I do go away, I will send him to you. 
JHN.16.8	When he comes, he will show the people of this world what they are like. He will show that they are wrong. They are wrong about what 
JHN.16.9	They are wrong about 
JHN.16.10	They are wrong about who is right with God, because I will go to the Father. And you will not see me any longer. 
JHN.16.11	They are wrong about how God 
JHN.16.12	I have many more things to tell you. But you are not strong enough to know them now. 
JHN.16.13	But the Spirit will come. He is the one who shows people true things about God. When he comes, he will be a guide to you. He will help you to understand everything that is true. He will not speak on his own authority. He will tell you only what he hears from the Father. He will tell you about things that will happen after this time. 
JHN.16.14	He will take my message and he will tell it to you. In that way, he will show how great and how good I am. 
JHN.16.15	Everything that the Father has is mine. That is why I said, “The Spirit will take what is mine and then he will tell it to you.” ’
JHN.16.16	Jesus then said, ‘After a short time, you will not see me any longer. But soon after that, you will see me again.’ 
JHN.16.17	Some of his 
JHN.16.18	What does he mean when he says, “a short time”? We do not know what he is talking about!’
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him about this. So, he said to them, ‘I said, “After a short time, you will not see me any longer. But soon after that, you will see me again.” Perhaps you are asking each other about that. 
JHN.16.20	I am telling you what is true. You will be sad and you will cry. But the people who belong to this world will be happy. Yes, you will be sad. But soon after that, you will become happy instead. 
JHN.16.21	It will be like this. When a woman is soon to give birth to a baby, she is sad. She knows that it will be painful. But after the baby is born, she is happy. She forgets her pain, because now she is so happy. She is happy because her child has been born into the world. 
JHN.16.22	It is like that for you. You are sad now. But I will see you again, and then you will be happy. You will be really happy. Nobody will be able to stop you being happy.
JHN.16.23	When that day arrives, you will not ask me for anything. I am telling you what is true. The Father will help you with anything that you ask him for in my name. 
JHN.16.24	Until now, you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask God, and you will receive what you ask for. Then you will be completely happy.
JHN.16.25	I have spoken to you with words and stories that are like pictures. But there will be a time when I will not speak like that any longer. Instead, I will speak clearly to you about the Father. 
JHN.16.26	When that day arrives, you yourselves will ask the Father in my name. I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 
JHN.16.27	I will not need to do that, because the Father himself loves you. He loves you because you love me, and you have believed that I came from God. 
JHN.16.28	Yes, I came from the Father, and I came into the world. Now I will leave the world, and I will return to the Father.’
JHN.16.29	Jesus' 
JHN.16.30	Now we are sure that you know everything. You do not even need to ask people what they are thinking. Because of this, we believe that you came from God.’ 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, ‘You say that you believe in me now. 
JHN.16.32	But it will happen very soon that all of you will run away to your own homes. Yes, that time has already arrived. You will run away and leave me alone. But I will not really be alone, because the Father is always with me. 
JHN.16.33	I have told you these things so that you will have 
JHN.17.1	After Jesus said this, he looked up to 
JHN.17.2	You gave to me authority over all people. You did this so that I could give people life for ever. Those are the people that you gave to me. 
JHN.17.3	What does it mean for people to live always? It means that they will know you, the one who is the only true God. They will also know me, Jesus Christ, the one that you have sent. 
JHN.17.4	I have shown here on the earth how great you are. In that way, I have finished the work that you gave to me to do. 
JHN.17.5	So, Father, now that I return to you, show how great I am. Before the world began, I was with you. I was great and powerful with you. Show again that I am great like that.’
JHN.17.6	‘You gave some people to me out of the world. I have shown them who you are. They were yours and you gave them to me. They have obeyed your message. 
JHN.17.7	Everything that I have comes from you. Now they know that you gave me everything. 
JHN.17.8	I gave to them the message that you gave to me. They accepted that message. They know certainly that I came from you. They believe that you sent me.
JHN.17.9	I pray for them. I am not praying for the people who belong to this world. No, I am praying for those people that you have given to me. I am praying for them because they are yours. 
JHN.17.10	Everything that I have is yours. And everything that you have is mine. These people have shown how great I am. 
JHN.17.11	I will not remain in the world any longer. I will return to you now. But they will still be here in the world. Holy Father, please keep them safe in your name. That is the powerful name that you gave to me. Then they can be 
JHN.17.12	While I was with them, I kept them safe in the power of your name. That is the name that you gave to me. I kept them safe so that none of them turned away from you, except one. That was the man who had to turn away from you and lose himself. It had to happen in the way a prophet already wrote in the Bible. 
JHN.17.13	Now, Father, I will come to you. I am saying these things while I am still in the world. Then these people, my 
JHN.17.14	I have given your message to them. The world's people have 
JHN.17.15	I am not asking that you will take them out of the world. But I ask you to keep them safe from the 
JHN.17.16	They do not belong to the world, in the same way that I do not belong to the world. 
JHN.17.17	Help them to belong completely to you, as they follow the 
JHN.17.18	I have sent them into the world, in the same way that you sent me into the world. 
JHN.17.19	On their behalf I give myself to you, so that I belong completely to you. Then they also can completely belong to you, as they follow the 
JHN.17.20	‘I do not pray only for these people, my 
JHN.17.21	I pray that all of them will become 
JHN.17.22	I have given to them the great and special gift that you gave to me. Now they can be 
JHN.17.23	I will be in them, and you will be in me, so that they can be completely 
JHN.17.24	Father, you have given these people to me. I want them to be with me where I am. Then they will see how great I am. You made me great because you loved me. You loved me even before the world began. 
JHN.17.25	Father, you always do what is right. The world's people do not know you, but I know you. These 
JHN.17.26	I have shown them what you are like. And I will continue to show them what you are like. Then they will love other people, in the same way that you love me. And I myself will be in them.’ 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had finished praying, he and his 
JHN.18.2	Judas, who sold Jesus to his 
JHN.18.3	The leaders of the 
JHN.18.4	Jesus knew everything that would soon happen to him. He went towards them and he asked them, ‘Who are you looking for?’ 
JHN.18.5	They answered, ‘Jesus, who comes from Nazareth.’ Jesus said, ‘That is who I am.’
JHN.18.5	Judas, who sold Jesus to his 
JHN.18.6	When Jesus said the words, ‘I am,’ the soldiers quickly moved away from him. They fell down to the ground. 
JHN.18.7	So Jesus asked them again, ‘Who are you looking for?’ They said, ‘Jesus, who comes from Nazareth.’ 
JHN.18.8	Jesus replied, ‘I have told you already, that is who I am. Since it is me that you are looking for, let these other men go.’ 
JHN.18.9	Jesus said this because earlier he had said, ‘I have lost none of those people that you gave to me.’ This made what he had spoken earlier really happen.
JHN.18.10	Simon Peter had a 
JHN.18.11	Then Jesus said to Peter, ‘Put your 
JHN.18.12	The group of soldiers, with their captain and the 
JHN.18.13	They led him first to Annas, who was the father of Caiaphas's wife. Caiaphas was the leader of the 
JHN.18.14	It was Caiaphas who had spoken to the 
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter and another 
JHN.18.16	But Peter stayed outside by the gate. Then the other 
JHN.18.17	The girl who was at the gate asked Peter, ‘Are you another of this man's 
JHN.18.18	It was cold. So the servants and the officers had made a fire. They were standing round it to make themselves warm. Peter went to stand with them, so that he could make himself warm too.
JHN.18.19	The leader of the
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, ‘I have always taught in the 
JHN.18.21	So, you do not need to ask me these questions. You can ask the people who heard me when I taught them. They know what I said.’
JHN.18.22	When Jesus said this, one of the soldiers hit him on the face. The soldier said, ‘You should not speak to the leader of the 
JHN.18.23	Jesus replied, ‘If I said something wrong, tell us what it is. But if I said something that is true, you should not have hit me.’ 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the leader of the 
JHN.18.25	Simon Peter was still standing there by the fire to make himself warm. The other people there said to him, ‘You must also be one of that man's 
JHN.18.26	One of the people there was a servant of the leader of the 
JHN.18.27	Again, Peter said, ‘No, that is not true.’ Immediately a 
JHN.18.28	The 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate, the Roman ruler, went outside to meet them. He asked them, ‘What wrong thing do you say that this man has done?’ 
JHN.18.30	They replied, ‘We would not have brought him to you if he had done nothing wrong.’ 
JHN.18.31	Pilate said to them, ‘You yourselves take him away. You should 
JHN.18.32	Jesus had already told people how he was going to die. These things happened so that he would die in that way.
JHN.18.33	Pilate went back inside his big house. He told Jesus to come and stand in front of him. He asked Jesus, ‘Are you the king of the 
JHN.18.34	Jesus said, ‘Is that your own idea, or have other people spoken to you about me?’ 
JHN.18.35	Pilate replied, ‘I am not a 
JHN.18.36	Jesus said, ‘My 
JHN.18.37	Pilate said to him, ‘So, that means you really are a king!’ Jesus answered, ‘You have said that I am a king! I was born for this reason: I came into the world to tell people the 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said, ‘I do not know what 
JHN.18.38	When Pilate had said that, he went outside again to the 
JHN.18.39	But every year we do something for you 
JHN.18.40	They shouted their answer, ‘No, we do not want him! Let Barabbas go free!’ (Barabbas was a bad man who had attacked people and robbed them.)
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate told the soldiers to take Jesus outside. He told them to hit Jesus many times with a 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers took some branches that had sharp points all over them. They made the branches into a circle and they put it on Jesus' head. Then they took a dark red coat and they put that on him. They did all this as if he was a king. 
JHN.19.3	They came to him many times and they were saying to him, ‘Hello, King of the 
JHN.19.4	Pilate went outside once more. He said to the crowd, ‘Listen to me. I will bring Jesus out here to you. You should know this: I do not see that this man has done anything wrong. I have no reason to 
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came out, with the circle of branches on his head. He was wearing the dark red coat. Pilate said to them, ‘Look. Here is the man!’ 
JHN.19.6	When the leaders of the
JHN.19.7	The 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard that, he was even more afraid. 
JHN.19.9	He went back into the house. He asked Jesus, ‘Where are you really from?’ But Jesus did not answer him. 
JHN.19.10	Pilate said to him, ‘Are you refusing to speak to me? Remember that I have authority. I can let you go free, or I can let them kill you on a 
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, ‘You could have no power against me unless God had given it to you. So, the man who sold me to you has done a worse thing than you have done.’ 
JHN.19.12	From that moment, Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the 
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard those words, he brought Jesus outside. Pilate sat down on a special seat for the 
JHN.19.14	It was about noon on the day when they prepared the 
JHN.19.15	But they shouted, ‘Take him away! Take him away! Kill him on a 
JHN.19.16	Then Pilate gave Jesus to them, so that they could kill him on a 
JHN.19.16	The soldiers took hold of Jesus. 
JHN.19.17	He was carrying the 
JHN.19.18	When they arrived there, the soldiers fixed him to the 
JHN.19.19	Pilate wrote a notice, and then they put it on the 
JHN.19.20	The place where they put Jesus on the 
JHN.19.21	The leaders of the 
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, ‘I will not change what I have written.’
JHN.19.23	After the soldiers had put Jesus on the 
JHN.19.24	So they said to each other, ‘We will not tear it. Instead, we will play a game. The person who wins the game will have the coat.’ This happened in the way that the Bible had already said:
JHN.19.24	‘Each of them took some of my clothes.
JHN.19.24	They played a game to win what I was wearing.’
JHN.19.24	And that is what the soldiers really did. 
JHN.19.25	Some women stood near to Jesus while he was on the 
JHN.19.26	Jesus saw his mother there. He also saw the 
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus knew that everything was now finished. Then he said, ‘I am 
JHN.19.29	There was a pot full of cheap 
JHN.19.30	Jesus drank the 
JHN.19.31	It was the day when the 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers went there. They broke the legs of the two men who were on the 
JHN.19.33	Then they went to Jesus. They saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers put a 
JHN.19.35	The man who saw these things has spoken about them. What he says is true. He knows that it really happened. He is telling you the 
JHN.19.36	The Bible already said how it would happen. It says:
JHN.19.36	‘Nobody will break any of his bones.’ 
JHN.19.37	In another place, the Bible says:
JHN.19.37	‘People will push a 
JHN.19.37	and then they will look at him.’
JHN.19.37	And that is how it really happened. 
JHN.19.38	There was a man called Joseph who came from the town called Arimathea. He was one of Jesus' 
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus went with Joseph. He was the man who had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought about 75 pounds of 
JHN.19.40	The two men covered Jesus' dead body with these 
JHN.19.41	There was a garden near the place where they killed Jesus on the 
JHN.19.42	The next day was the 
JHN.20.1	Early on the first day of the week, Mary from Magdala went to the hole in the rock. It was still dark. She saw that someone had removed the big stone from the front of the hole. 
JHN.20.2	So she ran to where Simon Peter was. He was with the other 
JHN.20.3	So Peter and the other 
JHN.20.4	Both of them were running. But the other 
JHN.20.5	He bent himself down and he looked inside the hole. He saw the long pieces of cloth that were lying there. But he did not go in. 
JHN.20.6	Simon Peter had run behind the other 
JHN.20.7	Also, he saw the piece of cloth that had been round Jesus' head. This was not in the same place as the long pieces of cloth. Someone had put it carefully in a separate place. 
JHN.20.8	Then the other 
JHN.20.9	They still did not understand what the Bible already said. It said that Jesus had to become alive again after he had died. 
JHN.20.10	Then the 
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood outside the hole in the rock. She was crying. While she cried, she bent herself down to look inside the hole. 
JHN.20.12	She saw two 
JHN.20.13	They asked her, ‘Woman, why are you crying?’ She replied, ‘They have taken away my 
JHN.20.14	When she had said this, she turned round. She saw a man who was standing there. It was Jesus, but she did not recognise him. 
JHN.20.15	Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?’ Mary thought that he was the gardener. So she said, ‘Sir, if you have carried him away somewhere, please tell me. Tell me where you have put him. Then I will go and I will take him back.’
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, ‘Mary.’ She turned towards him and she said in the 
JHN.20.17	Jesus said, ‘Do not hold on to me because I have not gone up to the Father yet. But go to my brothers, the 
JHN.20.18	Mary from Magdala took this message to the 
JHN.20.19	On the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, the 
JHN.20.20	After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The 
JHN.20.21	Jesus said again, ‘
JHN.20.22	When he had said this, he 
JHN.20.23	If you 
JHN.20.24	One of the 12 
JHN.20.25	So the other 
JHN.20.26	Eight days after that, the 
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, ‘Put your finger in here. Look at my hands. Put your hand here, in my side. Do not refuse to believe what is true. Now, believe.’ 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered him, ‘My 
JHN.20.29	Jesus said to him, ‘You believe because you have seen me. Other people have not seen me, but they do believe in me. God is really happy with those people.’
JHN.20.30	Jesus did many other 
JHN.20.31	But I have written about these things, so that you will be able to believe the 
JHN.21.1	After that, Jesus showed himself to the 
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, Thomas the 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said to the other 
JHN.21.4	Early in the morning, Jesus was standing on the shore of the lake. But the 
JHN.21.5	Then Jesus asked them, ‘Friends, have you caught any fish?’ They answered, ‘No!’ 
JHN.21.6	He said, ‘Throw your 
JHN.21.7	The 
JHN.21.8	The other 
JHN.21.9	When they came to the shore, they saw that someone had lit a fire. Some fish were cooking on it. There was some bread there, too. 
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, ‘Bring here some of the fish that you have just caught.’
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter got back into the boat and he pulled the 
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, ‘Come here and eat breakfast.’ None of the 
JHN.21.13	So Jesus got the bread and he gave it to them. Then he did the same with the fish.
JHN.21.14	After Jesus died and became alive again, this was now the third time that he showed himself to his 
JHN.21.15	When they had finished eating, Jesus spoke to Simon Peter. He said, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these other 
JHN.21.16	Jesus asked him a second time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter answered, ‘Yes 
JHN.21.17	Jesus asked him a third time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter was sad because Jesus asked him a third time, ‘Do you love me?’ So he said to Jesus, ‘
JHN.21.18	I am telling you what is true. When you were young, you put on your own clothes. Then you went to any place that you wanted to visit. But when you are old, it will be different. You will hold out your arms and someone else will tie your clothes for you. Then they will take you to a place where you do not want to go.’ 
JHN.21.19	When Jesus said this, he was showing how Peter would die. His death would show how great God is. Then Jesus said to Peter, ‘Follow me.’ 
JHN.21.20	Peter turned round and he saw the 
JHN.21.21	When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, ‘
JHN.21.22	Jesus answered him, ‘Perhaps I might want him to still be alive until I return to this earth. But that should not matter to you. You must follow me!’
JHN.21.23	At that time, people began to talk about these words that Jesus had said. Some 
JHN.21.24	I am the 
JHN.21.25	Jesus did many other things also. If people wrote about all those things, there would be very many books. I do not think that the whole world would have enough room for all those books.
ACT.1.1	Jesus began to do many things when he was living on earth. He also began to teach people many things. I told you about all these things in the first book that I wrote for you, Theophilus. 
ACT.1.2	Those are the things that Jesus did before God took him up into 
ACT.1.3	Jesus died and then he became alive again. During the 40 days after that, he showed himself many times to his 
ACT.1.4	One time when Jesus and his 
ACT.1.5	John 
ACT.1.6	While Jesus' 
ACT.1.7	Jesus replied, ‘My Father decides when things will happen in the world. You do not need to know what day or time that this will happen. 
ACT.1.8	But the 
ACT.1.9	When Jesus had finished speaking to his 
ACT.1.10	The 
ACT.1.11	The men said to the 
ACT.1.12	Then the 
ACT.1.13	When the 
ACT.1.14	All the 
ACT.1.15	One day, about 120 people who believed in Jesus were meeting together. Peter stood up and he said to them, 
ACT.1.16	‘My friends, long ago, the 
ACT.1.17	Judas belonged to our group of 
ACT.1.18	Judas received some money for the bad thing that he did. He bought a field with that money. But he fell down in that field and he died. His body broke open and the inside parts of his body poured out. 
ACT.1.19	All the people who lived in Jerusalem heard about his death. So they called that field ‘Akeldama’ in their own language. ‘Akeldama’ means ‘The Field of Blood’. 
ACT.1.20	Peter went on to say, ‘This is what King David wrote in the book of Psalms:
ACT.1.20	“The house that he lived in must now become empty.
ACT.1.20	There will be nobody to live in it.” 
ACT.1.20	David also wrote:
ACT.1.20	“Another person must now do the work which he did.” ’ 
ACT.1.21	Peter then said, ‘Because of this, we must choose another man instead of Judas. That man must have been one of our group all the time that the 
ACT.1.22	That is, from the time when John was 
ACT.1.23	So the 
ACT.1.24	Then the whole group prayed, ‘
ACT.1.25	Which of these two men do you want to be an 
ACT.1.26	Then the group picked out the name of one man. It happened that they chose Matthias. So Matthias now became the 12th 
ACT.2.1	Then the day of the 
ACT.2.2	, as they were sitting together, they heard a noise. The noise came from the sky and it filled the whole house. It was like the sound of a strong wind. 
ACT.2.3	Then they saw something that looked like many small fires. The separate fires moved and went to sit on each person there. 
ACT.2.4	All the 
ACT.2.5	At that time, 
ACT.2.6	When these 
ACT.2.7	They were very surprised and they said to each other, ‘These men who are speaking our languages are all from Galilee. 
ACT.2.8	But each of us can hear them speak in the language of our own home country. How can this happen? 
ACT.2.9	Some of us are from Parthia, Media and Elam. Some of us live in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia. Some of us are from Pontus and 
ACT.2.10	Some of us are from Phrygia and Pamphylia. Some of us are from 
ACT.2.11	Some of us have been 
ACT.2.12	All the people were very surprised. They did not understand what was happening. ‘What does all this mean?’ they asked each other. 
ACT.2.13	But some other people 
ACT.2.14	Peter was there with the other 11 
ACT.2.15	Some of you think that my friends here are drunk. But they are not drunk, because it is only 9 o'clock in the morning. 
ACT.2.16	No, something different is happening here. Long ago, the 
ACT.2.17	God says “This is what I will do in the last days.
ACT.2.17	I will give my 
ACT.2.17	Your sons and daughters will speak my message to people.
ACT.2.17	Your young men will see pictures from me in their minds.
ACT.2.17	And your old men will see things in their dreams.
ACT.2.18	At that time, I will give my 
ACT.2.18	both men and women.
ACT.2.18	Then they will speak my message to people.
ACT.2.19	I will cause special things to appear in the sky.
ACT.2.19	I will cause special things to appear on the earth too.
ACT.2.19	Those things will show how great I am.
ACT.2.19	There will be blood, fire and thick dark smoke.
ACT.2.20	The sun will become dark to people.
ACT.2.20	The moon will become dark red like the colour of blood.
ACT.2.20	These things will happen before the great day of the 
ACT.2.20	On that day, he will come with power and authority.
ACT.2.21	The 
ACT.2.22	Peter went on to say, ‘People of 
ACT.2.23	God knew that Jesus' enemies would give him to you. God had decided that this should happen. You let people who don't obey God's 
ACT.2.24	But after his death, God caused him to become alive again. God saved Jesus from the power of death. It was impossible for death to keep hold of him. 
ACT.2.25	A long time ago, King David spoke about the 
ACT.2.25	“I saw the 
ACT.2.25	He is next to me, on my right side,
ACT.2.25	so nothing will cause me trouble.
ACT.2.26	Because of this, I am very happy,
ACT.2.26	and I will 
ACT.2.26	I am human and one day I will die,
ACT.2.26	but I know that you will help me while I live.
ACT.2.27	When I die, you will not leave me in the place for dead people.
ACT.2.27	You will not let anything destroy the body of your 
ACT.2.28	You have shown me the paths that lead to life with you.
ACT.2.28	I will be completely happy because you will be with me for ever.” ’ 
ACT.2.29	Peter then said, ‘Friends, people of 
ACT.2.30	He was a 
ACT.2.31	David understood what God would do in future days. He did not speak about himself, but he spoke about this special man, the 
ACT.2.32	This man that David talked about is Jesus. After his death, God caused him to become alive again. We ourselves saw this happen. All of us saw it. 
ACT.2.33	God took Jesus back up to 
ACT.2.34	King David himself did not go up into 
ACT.2.34	“The 
ACT.2.34	Sit at my right side until I beat your enemies completely.
ACT.2.35	Then you will be able to put your feet on them.” 
ACT.2.36	So, all you people of 
ACT.2.37	The people heard what Peter said to them. They were very 
ACT.2.38	Peter said to them, ‘Each of you must stop doing wrong things. You must change how you live. If you believe in Jesus Christ, then we will 
ACT.2.39	God has promised to do all this for you and your children. He has also promised this to people who live far away in other places. The 
ACT.2.40	Peter also told them many other things. He continued to speak strongly to them. He told them to be careful and he said, ‘People who are alive today do not do what is right. Save yourselves from the 
ACT.2.41	Many of the people who listened to Peter believed his message. So the 
ACT.2.42	These new 
ACT.2.43	The 
ACT.2.44	All the 
ACT.2.45	They sold some of their own things. Then they gave that money to any other 
ACT.2.46	The whole group of 
ACT.2.47	All the time, they 
ACT.3.1	One day, Peter and John went to 
ACT.3.2	There was a man who could not walk. He had never been able to walk. Every day, his friends put him at the gate of 
ACT.3.3	The man saw Peter and John as they were coming through the gate. So he asked them to give him some money. 
ACT.3.4	Peter looked carefully at the man and so did John. Peter said to him, ‘Look at us!’ 
ACT.3.5	So the man looked at Peter and John. He thought that they would give him some money.
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said to the man, ‘I do not have any money. But I do have something else that I will give to you. Jesus Christ from Nazareth gave me authority to do this. So now I tell you to walk!’ 
ACT.3.7	Peter held the man's right hand and he helped him to stand up. Immediately the man's feet and ankles became strong. 
ACT.3.8	The man jumped up and he stood on his feet. Then he began to walk about. He went into 
ACT.3.9	A large crowd of people were there. They saw the man walking. They heard him 
ACT.3.10	‘Look!’ they said. ‘We know this man. He usually sits at the Beautiful Gate of 
ACT.3.11	The man was still holding Peter and John as they went into the yard of 
ACT.3.12	Peter saw all the people who had come together. So he said to them, ‘People of 
ACT.3.13	It happened because of Jesus, who was the special servant of God. That is the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and our other 
ACT.3.13	But you helped the rulers to take hold of Jesus. The 
ACT.3.14	Jesus was God's 
ACT.3.15	But Jesus is the person who leads people to true life. When you refused him, it meant that you killed him. But God made him alive again and raised him up. We ourselves saw him alive after he had died and we are telling you that.
ACT.3.16	It is the power of Jesus that has made this man completely well again. We believe in him. We know that he has authority. You know this man. You saw that he had weak legs. Jesus has caused this man's legs to become strong. You can all see for yourselves what has happened. Yes, he is now well because we 
ACT.3.17	Friends, when you did all this to Jesus, you did not really know what you were doing. Your leaders also did not understand. 
ACT.3.18	Jesus was God's 
ACT.3.19	So you must stop doing wrong things. Change how you live and turn to God. Then God will 
ACT.3.20	The 
ACT.3.21	Jesus must stay in 
ACT.3.22	For example, Moses said this about the 
ACT.3.23	God will 
ACT.3.24	Peter then said, ‘All of God's 
ACT.3.25	You are the people who receive that message from God today. The promise that God made to 
ACT.3.26	God chose Jesus to be his special servant. God sent him to you first. He wants to help you, so that you stop doing bad things. That is how he will 
ACT.4.1	Peter and John were still speaking to the crowd in the yard of 
ACT.4.2	They were angry because of the things that Peter and John were teaching the people there. They were teaching that Jesus had became alive again after his death. The 
ACT.4.3	So they took hold of Peter and John. They took them and put them in the prison, because by then it was evening time. They put them in the prison until the next day. 
ACT.4.4	But many of the people who had heard Peter's message believed what he said. There were now about 5000 men who believed in Jesus.
ACT.4.5	The next day, the 
ACT.4.6	They met with Annas who was the most important 
ACT.4.7	The 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter became full with the 
ACT.4.9	Today you are asking us questions about the good thing that we did for this man. Before that, he could not walk. You are asking us how we caused his legs to become strong. 
ACT.4.10	Now I need to tell you and all the people of 
ACT.4.11	The Bible says this about him:
ACT.4.11	“The builders refused to use a certain stone. They thought that it had no value.
ACT.4.11	But now that stone has become the most important stone at the corner of the building.” ’ 
ACT.4.12	Then Peter said, ‘Only Jesus can save people. There has never been another person in the world that could do this. God has not given any other man the authority to save us.’
ACT.4.13	The 
ACT.4.14	The man who had had weak legs stood there in front of the 
ACT.4.15	They told Peter and John to go out of the room where their leaders' group was meeting. Then they talked together to decide what they should do. 
ACT.4.16	‘What should we do with these men?’ they said. ‘Everyone who lives in Jerusalem knows about this 
ACT.4.17	But we want to stop more people from joining their group. So we must say to these men, “You must stop using the name of Jesus. You must stop teaching people about him.” ’ 
ACT.4.18	Then the 
ACT.4.19	Then Peter and John replied to the leader, ‘What do you think God wants us to do? Should we obey you? Or should we obey God? You decide! 
ACT.4.20	We know what is right. We must continue to speak about these things. We must tell people about the things that we have seen and heard.’
ACT.4.21	The 
ACT.4.22	The man who became well because of this 
ACT.4.23	After the 
ACT.4.24	The 
ACT.4.25	Our 
ACT.4.25	“People from other countries were very angry.
ACT.4.25	People decided to do things that would never happen.
ACT.4.25	Why did they do that?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the world prepared to fight.
ACT.4.26	The rulers of many countries met together.
ACT.4.26	They wanted to fight against the 
ACT.4.26	They wanted to fight against his 
ACT.4.28	But you are powerful. These men did only what you said would happen. You had already decided on these events. 
ACT.4.29	 God, you know that the 
ACT.4.30	Show people that you are strong. Cause sick people to become well. Do other powerful things that show you are really God. It is the authority of your special servant Jesus that will make these things happen.’
ACT.4.31	The 
ACT.4.32	All the 
ACT.4.33	The 
ACT.4.34	They all had as much as they needed. Some 
ACT.4.35	Then the 
ACT.4.36	One of the 
ACT.4.37	Joseph sold a field that belonged to him. He took the money from this and he gave it to the 
ACT.5.1	But there was a man called Ananias among the group of 
ACT.5.2	Ananias gave part of the money that he received to the 
ACT.5.3	Peter said to Ananias, ‘Ananias, 
ACT.5.4	Before you sold the field, it belonged to you. And after you sold the field, the money was yours. You could choose what to do with it. But you chose to do a very bad thing. You did not only tell a 
ACT.5.5	As soon as he heard Peter say this, Ananias fell down and he died. When people heard what had happened, they were all very afraid. 
ACT.5.6	Some young men came into the room. They put cloths round Ananias' dead body and they carried it outside. Then they buried it.
ACT.5.7	About three hours later, Ananias' wife, Sapphira, came into the room. She did not know what had happened to her husband. 
ACT.5.8	Peter asked Sapphira, ‘Was this all the money that you and your husband received for your field?’ ‘Yes,’ Sapphira answered. ‘That was all the money that we received.’
ACT.5.9	Peter said to her, ‘It was wrong for you and your husband to do this bad thing. You agreed together to tell a lie to the 
ACT.5.10	Immediately, Sapphira fell down in front of Peter and she died. Then the young men came into the room. They saw that Sapphira was dead. So they carried her outside and they buried her body next to her husband. 
ACT.5.11	The whole group of 
ACT.5.12	At that time, the 
ACT.5.13	The other people who were not 
ACT.5.14	More and more people became 
ACT.5.15	As a result, people carried their sick friends into the streets and put them on beds and 
ACT.5.16	Many people also came into Jerusalem from the small towns near the city. They brought their sick friends with them. Some of those sick people had bad 
ACT.5.17	The most important 
ACT.5.18	These important men took hold of the 
ACT.5.19	But during the night, one of the 
ACT.5.20	The 
ACT.5.21	The 
ACT.5.21	Then the most important 
ACT.5.22	But when the police arrived at the prison, they did not find the 
ACT.5.23	They said, ‘We arrived at the prison. We saw that the soldiers had locked the gates. They were standing at the gates and they were watching carefully. But when we opened the gates of the prison, we did not find anybody there!’ 
ACT.5.24	The leader of the police of 
ACT.5.25	Then a man came to the leaders. He said to them, ‘Listen! Those men that you put in the prison are now standing in the yard of 
ACT.5.26	So, the leader of the police took his men with him to find the 
ACT.5.27	The police brought the 
ACT.5.28	‘We told you that you must not teach people any more with the authority of Jesus. But now look at what you have done! Now people all over Jerusalem have heard your teaching. You also want people to think that we are 
ACT.5.29	Peter and the other 
ACT.5.30	You fixed Jesus to a 
ACT.5.31	God raised Jesus and he put him in the most important place at his right side. Jesus is now the one who leads us and the one who saves us. He has made a way for the people of 
ACT.5.32	We tell people about what happened to Jesus. We ourselves saw these things. Now God has given his 
ACT.5.33	The group of 
ACT.5.34	But one man did not agree. He was called Gamaliel and he was a 
ACT.5.35	When they had gone, Gamaliel spoke to the group of leaders: ‘Men of 
ACT.5.36	Remember what happened to Theudas a few years ago. That man told everyone, “I am a very important leader.” As a result, about 400 men joined his group. But then somebody killed him, and all his men went away. Nobody heard any more about them. 
ACT.5.37	Later, Judas from Galilee appeared at the time when the 
ACT.5.38	Now think about what is happening with these men. I tell you it would be better to leave them alone. Let them go free. If their message only comes from human ideas, all their work will fail. 
ACT.5.39	But perhaps what they are doing really does come from God himself. If that is true, then you cannot stop them. You might even find that you are fighting against God!’
ACT.5.40	So, the 
ACT.5.41	The 
ACT.5.42	Every day the 
ACT.6.1	At that time, more and more people became 
ACT.6.2	The 12 
ACT.6.3	So, friends, please choose 7 men from among you. You must know that each of them is full of the 
ACT.6.4	Then we will have more time to pray. We will also have more time to teach people God's message.’
ACT.6.5	The whole group of 
ACT.6.6	The group of 
ACT.6.7	So more and more people heard the message from God. The number of people in Jerusalem who believed in Jesus grew more and more. Many of the 
ACT.6.8	God helped Stephen in many special ways. God's power was with him. He did many 
ACT.6.9	But some men spoke against Stephen. They did not agree with what he taught people. These men were from one of the 
ACT.6.10	But the 
ACT.6.11	Then those men secretly gave money to some bad men. They told them to say to the 
ACT.6.12	This made the people become angry against Stephen. The important 
ACT.6.13	Then they brought in some men to say bad things about Stephen. The things that these men said were not true. They said about Stephen, ‘This man is always saying bad things about 
ACT.6.14	We also heard him talk about Jesus, the man who comes from Nazareth. He said that Jesus will destroy this 
ACT.6.15	All the
ACT.7.1	The most important 
ACT.7.2	Stephen said, ‘Men of 
ACT.7.3	God said to Abraham, “Leave your own country and your own 
ACT.7.4	So Abraham left his country where the Chaldean people lived. He went to Haran and he stayed there. While he was there, his father died. Then God said to him, “Leave this place.” God then sent him to live in Canaan. This is where we are living now. 
ACT.7.5	At that time, God did not give Abraham any part of Canaan for his own 
ACT.7.6	This is what God said to him: “Your 
ACT.7.7	But I will

ACT.7.9	One of Jacob's sons was called Joseph. Jacob was more kind to Joseph than to his other sons. For this reason, Joseph's brothers did not like him. So one day they took Joseph and they sold him as a slave. The men that bought Joseph took him to 
ACT.7.10	God saved him from all his troubles and he helped him to live in a 
ACT.7.11	Then one year food plants did not grow in 
ACT.7.12	Jacob heard news that 
ACT.7.13	Later, Jacob sent his sons back to 
ACT.7.14	After this, Joseph sent a message to his father, that he should also come to Egypt with the whole 
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went to 
ACT.7.16	When the people of 
ACT.7.17	Stephen went on to say, ‘After many years, the time arrived for God to make his promise to Abraham become true. By this time, Jacob's 
ACT.7.18	Now, a different king ruled 
ACT.7.19	He was very cruel to our 
ACT.7.20	It was at this time that Moses was born. He was a very beautiful baby. His parents took 
ACT.7.21	Then they had to put him outside. But 
ACT.7.22	Moses had teachers who taught him all the wise things that the 
ACT.7.23	When Moses was 40 years old, one day he went to see his own people, the people of 
ACT.7.24	He saw that an 
ACT.7.25	Moses thought that his own people would understand him. They would know that God was using him to save them. They would no longer be slaves to work for the 
ACT.7.26	On the next day, Moses saw two 
ACT.7.27	The man who was being cruel to the other man pushed Moses away. He said to Moses, “You have no authority to rule us. You are not our 
ACT.7.28	I know that yesterday you killed an 
ACT.7.29	Moses heard what the man said. So he decided to run away. He went to the country called Midian and he lived there. He married a wife and they had two sons.
ACT.7.30	Moses lived in Midian for 40 years. Then, one day, he was in the 
ACT.7.31	Moses was very surprised by what he saw. He went near to the bush so that he could see it better. Then he heard the 
ACT.7.32	God said, “I am the God of your 
ACT.7.33	Then the 
ACT.7.34	I have seen that the 
ACT.7.35	Then Stephen said, ‘Moses is the man that the people of 
ACT.7.36	So, it was Moses who led the people of 
ACT.7.37	It was Moses who said to the people of 
ACT.7.38	This is the same Moses who was leader of our people in the 
ACT.7.39	But our 
ACT.7.40	So the people said to Aaron, “Please make us some gods that we can carry in front of us. Yes, that man Moses brought us out of 
ACT.7.41	It was then that the people made something that would be an 
ACT.7.42	But God turned away from his people. He let them do what they wanted to do. He let them 
ACT.7.42	One of God's 
ACT.7.42	“God said, ‘People of 
ACT.7.42	When you were in the 
ACT.7.42	you brought 
ACT.7.42	But you did not really 
ACT.7.43	No. You carried with you the 
ACT.7.43	You also carried an 
ACT.7.43	to be like your god, Rephan.
ACT.7.43	These were the 
ACT.7.43	So now I will send you away from your own country.
ACT.7.43	You will go to live in places beyond Babylon.’ ” 
ACT.7.44	When our 
ACT.7.45	Later, our 
ACT.7.46	God was happy with King David and he helped him very much. So David said to God, “Can I make a special house where you can live among your people? You are the God of our 
ACT.7.47	But it was David's son, Solomon, who built a house for God. 
ACT.7.48	But we know that God does not live in a house that people have made. He is the powerful God who is over all. God's 
ACT.7.49	The 
ACT.7.49	“
ACT.7.49	The earth is the place where I put my feet.
ACT.7.49	You could not build a house for me where I could live.
ACT.7.49	You could not make a place for me to rest there.
ACT.7.50	I am the one who has made all these things myself.” ’
ACT.7.51	Then Stephen said, ‘You people do not want to obey God! You do not want to listen to God's true message. You are the same as your 
ACT.7.52	Your 
ACT.7.53	You are the people who received God's 
ACT.7.54	The group of 
ACT.7.55	But the 
ACT.7.56	‘Look!’ Stephen said. ‘I can see into 
ACT.7.57	When the 
ACT.7.58	They took hold of Stephen and they pulled him out of the city. They removed their coats. They gave them to a young man to keep them safe. This young man was called Saul. Then they began to throw stones at Stephen to kill him.
ACT.7.59	While the men were throwing stones at him, Stephen prayed, ‘
ACT.7.60	Then he fell down on his knees. He shouted, ‘
ACT.8.1	Saul was standing there while the Jewish leaders killed Stephen. He agreed with what they did.
ACT.8.1	On the same day that Stephen died, the group of 
ACT.8.2	Some good men who loved God buried Stephen's dead body. They were very sad and they cried with loud voices. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul brought great troubles to the 
ACT.8.4	The 
ACT.8.5	One of them who was called Philip went to a city in Samaria. There he told the people the message about Jesus Christ, God's 
ACT.8.6	Crowds of people came together to hear Philip speak. They saw him do many 
ACT.8.7	Many people there had bad 
ACT.8.8	As a result, the people in that city were very happy. 
ACT.8.9	A man called Simon lived in that city. For a long time, he had used 
ACT.8.10	All the people in the city watched Simon carefully. This included the people who were important and all the other people too. Everyone said, ‘This man really has great power that comes from God.’ 
ACT.8.11	Simon had used his 
ACT.8.12	But then Philip told them the good news about the 
ACT.8.13	Simon also believed and Philip 
ACT.8.14	The 
ACT.8.15	When these two 
ACT.8.16	The 
ACT.8.17	So Peter and John put their hands on the head of each 
ACT.8.18	Simon saw that that God gave the 
ACT.8.19	Please give me this same power. I want to put my hands on other people, so that they will receive the 
ACT.8.20	Peter answered Simon, ‘I pray that God will destroy you and your money! You think that you can buy this gift with your money! It is very wrong for you to think that. It is God who gives that gift. 
ACT.8.21	You cannot do the work which we are doing. God knows that you are not thinking the right things. 
ACT.8.22	You must turn away from those very bad thoughts. Turn to the 
ACT.8.23	You are very 
ACT.8.24	Then Simon said to Peter and John, ‘Please, pray to the 
ACT.8.25	Peter and John told the people about the 
ACT.8.26	Then God sent an 
ACT.8.27	So Philip prepared himself and he went. While he was going along this road, he met an important officer from Ethiopia. This man had authority over the queen of Ethiopia's money. She was called Candace. The officer was travelling home from Jerusalem. He had been there to 
ACT.8.28	Now the man was travelling home again in his 
ACT.8.29	The 
ACT.8.30	So Philip ran to the 
ACT.8.31	The man answered, ‘I cannot understand it. I need someone to explain it to me.’ Then he said to Philip, ‘Come up here and sit with me in the 
ACT.8.32	The officer was reading these words from the book of Isaiah:
ACT.8.32	‘People led him away like a sheep that they are going to kill.
ACT.8.32	He did not make a noise.
ACT.8.32	He was like a young sheep when they are going to cut its hair.
ACT.8.32	He did not say anything against them.
ACT.8.33	People did not 
ACT.8.33	They just said he was 
ACT.8.33	Nobody can say anything about his children, because he did not have any.
ACT.8.33	They just took away his life on earth.’ 
ACT.8.34	The officer said to Philip, ‘Please tell me who the 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip explained to the man the words that Isaiah had written. Then he went on to tell him the good news about Jesus. 
ACT.8.36	As they were travelling along the road, they came to a place with some water. The man said to Philip, ‘Look! There is some water here. Please will you 
ACT.8.36	[
ACT.8.37	Philip said to him, ‘I can

ACT.8.39	They both came up out of the water again. Immediately the 
ACT.8.40	Philip saw that he was now in Azotus. From there, he visited many towns and he told people the good news about Jesus. He did this as he went all the way to Caesarea. 
ACT.9.1	All this time, Saul was still speaking strongly against the 
ACT.9.2	Saul asked him, ‘Please will you write some letters for me? Then I can give one of these letters to the leader of each 
ACT.9.2	Saul wanted to find anyone who agreed with the Way of the 
ACT.9.3	He travelled towards Damascus. He was very near the city when a bright light 
ACT.9.4	Saul fell down on the ground. He heard a voice which said to him, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you fight against me?’
ACT.9.5	Saul asked, ‘
ACT.9.6	Now I say to you, get up and go into the city. Someone there will tell you what you must do.’
ACT.9.7	The men who were travelling with Saul stood still. They could not say anything. They could hear that someone was speaking. But they could not see anyone. 
ACT.9.8	Saul stood up. He opened his eyes, but he could not see anything. So, the men who were with Saul held his hand. They led him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	For three days, Saul could not see anything. During that time, he did not eat any food or drink anything.
ACT.9.10	There was a 
ACT.9.11	Jesus said to Ananias, ‘Prepare yourself and go to Straight Street. A man called Judas lives on that street. Go to his house. When you get there, ask for a man from Tarsus who is called Saul. He is praying to God. 
ACT.9.12	He has had a message from God in a special dream. In his dream, he saw a man who is called Ananias come to him. He saw you put your hands on him so that he could see again.’
ACT.9.13	Ananias replied, ‘
ACT.9.14	Now he has come here to Damascus, and he has brought letters with him from the leaders of the 
ACT.9.15	But the 
ACT.9.16	I myself will tell him about the many troubles that he will have. He will have much pain on my behalf.’
ACT.9.17	So Ananias went to Judas's house and he went inside. He put his hands on Saul and he said to him, ‘
ACT.9.18	When Ananias said that, immediately something like bits of fish skin fell from Saul's eyes. Then Saul could see again. So he stood up and Ananias 
ACT.9.19	Then Saul ate some food and he became strong again.
ACT.9.19	Saul stayed with the 
ACT.9.20	He immediately went to the 
ACT.9.21	All the people who heard what Saul said were very surprised. They said to each other, ‘This is the same man who caused much pain to the 
ACT.9.22	But Saul became even more powerful when he taught the people. He showed very clearly that Jesus is God's 
ACT.9.23	After many days, the 
ACT.9.24	But someone told Saul about this. The 
ACT.9.25	But one night, Saul's friends helped him to leave the city secretly. They put him in a basket, and they put him through a hole in the city wall. Then they let the basket go slowly down to the ground outside the city. 
ACT.9.26	Saul returned to Jerusalem. He wanted to join the group of 
ACT.9.27	But one of the 
ACT.9.28	After that, Saul stayed with the 
ACT.9.29	Saul also talked with the 
ACT.9.30	The other 
ACT.9.31	By this time there were 
ACT.9.32	Peter often travelled to many different places. One day he travelled to Lydda, and he went to see the 
ACT.9.33	In Lydda, he met a man called Aeneas. Aeneas could not move his arms and legs. He lay on his 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to Aeneas, ‘Jesus Christ now makes you well again! So stand up and put away your mat.’ Immediately Aeneas stood up. 
ACT.9.35	Many people who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas. They saw that he was now well and they believed in the 
ACT.9.36	There was a woman called Tabitha who lived in Joppa. She was a 
ACT.9.37	Dorcas became very ill and then she died. Women washed her body and they put it in a room upstairs. 
ACT.9.38	Joppa was not very far from Lydda. The 
ACT.9.39	Peter then returned to Joppa with the two men. When he arrived at Dorcas's house, some women took him upstairs. Many 
ACT.9.40	Peter sent all these women out of the room. He went down on his knees and he prayed to God. Then he turned his head towards the dead woman and he said, ‘Tabitha, stand up!’ She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	Peter held her hand and he helped her to stand up. Then he told the 
ACT.9.42	People everywhere in Joppa heard what had happened. As a result, many more people believed in the 
ACT.9.43	Peter stayed in Joppa for many days. He stayed with a man called Simon, who was a 
ACT.10.1	There was a man who lived in 
ACT.10.2	Cornelius was a good man. He and all his 
ACT.10.3	One afternoon, at about 3 o'clock, Cornelius had a special dream. He clearly saw one of God's 
ACT.10.4	Cornelius looked at the 
ACT.10.4	The 
ACT.10.5	You must now send some men to Joppa. They will find a man who is staying there. He is called Simon Peter. Your men must tell him to come here to 
ACT.10.6	He is staying at the house of Simon the 
ACT.10.7	Then the 
ACT.10.8	Cornelius explained to these three men what the 
ACT.10.9	The next day, at about noon, Cornelius's men were coming near to Joppa. At this time, Peter went up on the roof of the house to pray to God. 
ACT.10.10	He became hungry, and he wanted to eat some food. While someone was preparing a meal for him, Peter had a special dream. 
ACT.10.11	He saw 
ACT.10.12	Inside the cloth there were many different animals with 4 legs. There were also wild birds and snakes there inside the cloth. 
ACT.10.13	Then Peter heard a voice that said to him, ‘Peter, stand up and kill some of these animals. Then you can cook them and eat the meat.’
ACT.10.14	Peter answered, ‘No, 
ACT.10.15	Then, for the second time, the voice said to Peter, ‘God has made these animals good for people to eat. So, you must not say that it is not right to eat them.’
ACT.10.16	All this happened three times. After that, the cloth immediately went back up into 
ACT.10.17	Just then, Cornelius' men arrived there in Joppa. They found Simon's house. When they stopped at the gate of the house, Peter was still thinking about his dream and what it meant. 
ACT.10.18	The men shouted out, ‘Is a man called Simon Peter staying here?’
ACT.10.19	While Peter was still thinking about his dream, the 
ACT.10.20	Get up and go downstairs to meet them. I have sent these men to come to you. So, you should go with them. Don't be afraid.’
ACT.10.21	Peter went downstairs and he said to the men, ‘I am the person that you are looking for. Why have you come here?’
ACT.10.22	The men answered him, ‘The 
ACT.10.23	Then Peter said to the men, ‘Please come into the house and stay here with us tonight.’
ACT.10.23	The next day, Peter left Joppa to go to Caesarea with Cornelius's men. Some 
ACT.10.24	The next day, Peter arrived in 
ACT.10.25	When Peter arrived at the house, Cornelius went out to meet him. He went down on his knees in front of Peter to 
ACT.10.26	But Peter lifted Cornelius up from the ground and he said to him, ‘Stand up. I am only a man, like you are.’
ACT.10.27	Peter continued to talk to Cornelius and they went into the house. Peter saw that many people had come together there in the house. 
ACT.10.28	He said to them, ‘You all know that we 
ACT.10.29	So when you asked me to come here, I was happy to come. I knew that it was right. So, tell me now. Why did you ask me to come?’
ACT.10.30	Then Cornelius said, ‘Three days ago, I was in my house at this time of the day. It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I was praying to God. 
ACT.10.31	The man said to me, “Cornelius, you have prayed to God and you have often given money to poor people. Now God wants to answer you. 
ACT.10.32	So send some men to Joppa to fetch a man who is called Simon Peter. He is staying there at the house of Simon the 
ACT.10.33	So, I sent some men immediately to bring you here. Thank you that you agreed to come. Now we are all here together, and God is with us. We are ready to listen to your message. Please tell us everything that the 
ACT.10.34	Then Peter said to them, ‘Now I understand that God accepts all people in the same way. God has shown me that this is true. 
ACT.10.35	God accepts all people who 
ACT.10.36	This is the message that God has sent to the people of 
ACT.10.37	You know about the important things that have happened everywhere in Judea. These things began in Galilee after John spoke God's message to the people. He 
ACT.10.38	You know that God chose Jesus to do special work for him. He gave Jesus his 
ACT.10.39	We saw everything that Jesus did in Jerusalem and in all the country of the 
ACT.10.40	But then, three days after that, God caused Jesus to become alive again. God caused him to appear to us. 
ACT.10.41	Not all the people saw him. God chose us to be Jesus' 
ACT.10.42	At that time, Jesus said to us, “Go and tell people the message about me. Tell them that God has given me authority to 
ACT.10.43	Then Peter said, ‘All of God's 
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking, the 
ACT.10.45	The 
ACT.10.46	They heard the new 
ACT.10.46	Then Peter said, 
ACT.10.47	‘God has clearly given his 
ACT.10.48	So Peter told the 
ACT.11.1	The 
ACT.11.2	Peter then returned from Caesarea and he arrived in Jerusalem. Some of the 
ACT.11.3	So they said to Peter, ‘You stayed in the house of men who were not 
ACT.11.4	Peter then began to explain everything that had happened. He said to them, 
ACT.11.5	‘I was staying in a house in the city called Joppa. One day, when I was praying, I had a special dream. I saw something that came down from 
ACT.11.6	I looked carefully at it. I saw that there were farm animals with 4 legs inside the cloth. There were also wild animals, snakes, and birds in it. 
ACT.11.7	Then I heard a voice that said to me, “Peter, stand up and kill some of these animals. Then you can cook them and eat the meat.”
ACT.11.8	But I answered, “No, 
ACT.11.9	Then the voice spoke to me from 
ACT.11.10	All this happened three times. After that, the cloth went back up into 
ACT.11.11	At that moment, three men from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying. Someone had sent these men to find me. 
ACT.11.12	The 
ACT.11.13	Then Cornelius told us what had happened to him. He had seen an 
ACT.11.14	He will come and speak to you. His message will tell you how God will save you and everyone else in your house.”
ACT.11.15	When I started to speak to Cornelius and his family, the 
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered what the 
ACT.11.17	So we see that God gave these 
ACT.11.18	The 
ACT.11.19	After the 
ACT.11.20	Some of the 
ACT.11.21	The 
ACT.11.22	The 
ACT.11.23	Barnabas arrived in Antioch. He saw how God had been kind to the people there and helped them. Barnabas was happy about this. So he said to the new 
ACT.11.24	Barnabas was a good man. The power of God's 
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul. 
ACT.11.26	When Barnabas found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For one whole year, Barnabas and Saul met together with the group of 
ACT.11.27	During this time, some 
ACT.11.28	One of these men was called Agabus. The 
ACT.11.29	The 
ACT.11.30	Then they gave the money to Barnabas and Saul. Barnabas and Saul took this gift to the leaders of the 
ACT.12.1	At that time, King Herod took hold of some of the group of 
ACT.12.2	He sent his soldiers to cut off James' head. James was John's brother. 
ACT.12.3	King Herod saw that the 
ACT.12.4	After the soldiers caught Peter, they put him in prison. While he was in prison, 4 different groups of soldiers 
ACT.12.5	So Herod kept Peter in prison. But during that time, the group of 
ACT.12.6	It was the night before King Herod wanted to bring Peter out of the prison and 
ACT.12.7	Then, an 
ACT.12.8	Then the 
ACT.12.9	So Peter followed the 
ACT.12.10	Peter and the 
ACT.12.11	Then Peter understood what had happened. He said to himself, ‘Now I know that these things really have happened to me. The 
ACT.12.12	When Peter understood all these things, he went to Mary's house. She was the mother of John Mark. Many people were meeting together in her house. They were praying to God. 
ACT.12.13	Peter knocked on the outside door of the house. A servant girl called Rhoda came to the door. 
ACT.12.14	She recognised Peter's voice and she was very happy. But she did not open the door. Instead, she ran back into the house and she said to all the people there, ‘Peter is standing outside the door!’
ACT.12.15	The people in the house said to her, ‘You are crazy.’ But she told them again that Peter really was there. So then they said, ‘It is not him, but it is his 
ACT.12.16	While all this was happening, Peter was still knocking at the door. Then someone went and opened the door. They were all very surprised when they saw him there. 
ACT.12.17	Peter raised his hand towards them so that they would all be quiet. Then he explained to them how the 
ACT.12.18	When morning arrived, there was a lot of trouble at the prison. The soldiers did not understand what had happened to Peter. 
ACT.12.19	When Herod knew about it, he said to the soldiers, ‘Go and look for Peter!’ But they could not find him anywhere. Herod then asked the soldiers who 
ACT.12.19	After this happened, Herod went away from Judea. He went to 
ACT.12.20	At that time, King Herod was angry with the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon. A group of men from these cities went together to speak to Herod about the problem. A man called Blastus was an important servant in King Herod's house. The group of men said to Blastus, ‘Please help us when we speak to King Herod.’ Then they went and they said to Herod, ‘Please stop being angry with our people. We want to be friends again.’ They said this because they needed to buy food in King Herod's country. 
ACT.12.21	Herod decided on which day he would meet with them. He put on his beautiful clothes and he sat in his special seat as king. Then he spoke his message to all the people. 
ACT.12.22	When he spoke, the people shouted, ‘This is not just a man who is speaking to us. This is the voice of a god!’
ACT.12.23	Herod let the people 
ACT.12.24	Everywhere that the 
ACT.12.25	Barnabas and Saul had gone to Jerusalem to help the 
ACT.13.1	There were some 
ACT.13.2	One day, the 
ACT.13.3	The 
ACT.13.4	The 
ACT.13.5	They arrived at a town called Salamis. There they went into the 
ACT.13.6	They travelled across the whole island and they arrived at a town called Paphos. There they met a man called Bar-Jesus. He was a 
ACT.13.7	The ruler of Cyprus was called Sergius Paulus, and Bar-Jesus was his friend. Sergius Paulus understood things well. So he asked Barnabas and Saul to come to him. He wanted them to tell him God's message. 
ACT.13.8	Bar-Jesus was also called Elymas. That was his name in the 
ACT.13.9	Then God filled Saul with the power of his 
ACT.13.10	‘You are a servant of the 
ACT.13.11	The 
ACT.13.11	When Paul said that, immediately something like a dark cloud covered Elymas's eyes. He could not find his own way. He needed someone to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	Sergius Paulus saw what had happened to Elymas. He was very surprised about the things that Barnabas and Saul taught him about the 
ACT.13.13	Paul and the 2 other men got in a boat and they sailed away from Paphos. They arrived at a town called Perga, which is in the 
ACT.13.14	Paul and Barnabas left Perga, and they went to a town called Antioch in Pisidia. On the 
ACT.13.15	Someone read aloud some words from the Bible. They read from God's 
ACT.13.17	The God of the people of 
ACT.13.18	The people of 
ACT.13.19	He destroyed 7 
ACT.13.20	All of these things took about 450 years to happen.
ACT.13.20	After this, God gave to his people leaders who were called 
ACT.13.21	Then the people of 
ACT.13.22	Then God removed Saul. He caused David to be their king instead. God said this about David: “I have watched David, the son of Jesse. He does things that make me happy. So I know that he will do everything that I want.”
ACT.13.23	God promised to send to the people of 
ACT.13.24	Before Jesus began his work in this world, John spoke a message to all the people of 
ACT.13.25	When John had almost finished his work, he said to the people, “Perhaps you think that I am the special man that God will send. I am not that man. But listen! That man will come soon. And I am not good enough even to undo his shoes for him.” ’ 
ACT.13.26	Paul went on to say, ‘I speak to all you people here. Some of you, like us, have Abraham as your 
ACT.13.27	The people who were living in Jerusalem, and their leaders, did not understand about Jesus. They did not know that he was God's special man. Every 
ACT.13.28	The 
ACT.13.29	When the soldiers did that, it happened just like the 
ACT.13.30	But after Jesus died, God caused him to become alive again. 
ACT.13.31	For many days after this, Jesus appeared to his 
ACT.13.32	So, we have come here to tell you this good news. God promised our 
ACT.13.33	Now he has really done these things for us who are alive today. He has raised up Jesus to live again. We can read about this in the second Psalm. God says,
ACT.13.33	“You are my Son.
ACT.13.33	Today, I have become your Father.”
ACT.13.34	God caused Jesus to live again so that nothing would destroy his body. He will not die again. This is what God said to our 
ACT.13.34	“I will surely help you with good things,
ACT.13.34	just like I promised to David.”
ACT.13.35	God also says this in another Psalm:
ACT.13.35	“Your servant who loves you will not remain dead.
ACT.13.35	You will not let anything destroy the body of your 
ACT.13.36	While David was alive, he worked well as God's servant. Then he died and men buried him next to his 
ACT.13.37	But as for Jesus, God caused him to become alive again. He did not die again and nothing destroyed his body.
ACT.13.38	My friends, I want all of you to know this. God 
ACT.13.39	God can cause anyone to become right with him. If you believe in Jesus, God will make you free from your 
ACT.13.40	Be careful then! Remember what God's 
ACT.13.41	“Listen to me, you people who 
ACT.13.41	You will be surprised at the great things that I do.
ACT.13.41	And then you will die.
ACT.13.41	I am working now, while you are still alive.
ACT.13.41	But still you will not believe what is true.
ACT.13.41	Even if someone explains everything to you,
ACT.13.41	you will never believe.” ’
ACT.13.42	After Paul spoke this message, he and Barnabas were leaving the meeting place. The people there said to them, ‘Please return on our next rest day. Then you can tell us more about what you have already told us.’ 
ACT.13.43	When the meeting finished, many people followed Paul and Barnabas. Some of them were 
ACT.13.44	On the next 
ACT.13.45	But when some 
ACT.13.46	But Paul and Barnabas were not afraid of them. They said to them, ‘It was right that we first tell you who are 
ACT.13.47	The 
ACT.13.47	“I have chosen you to be like a light to the 
ACT.13.47	You must go to people everywhere in the world.
ACT.13.47	You must tell them how God wants to save them.” ’
ACT.13.48	When the 
ACT.13.49	Many people in that part of the country heard the message about the 
ACT.13.50	But the 
ACT.13.51	So, Paul and Barnabas cleaned the dirt of that place off their feet. This showed that the people in that town had done a bad thing. Paul and Barnabas then travelled to a town called Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	The 
ACT.14.1	When Paul and Barnabas arrived in Iconium, they did the same as they had done before. They went to the 
ACT.14.2	But some of the 
ACT.14.3	So Paul and Barnabas stayed in Iconium for a long time. They spoke the message about the 
ACT.14.4	The people in the city did not agree with each other. Some of them believed the message from the 
ACT.14.5	Some of the 
ACT.14.6	Paul and Barnabas heard that these people wanted to hurt them. So they left Iconium quickly and they went to Lystra and Derbe, and other places near there. These cities were in the 
ACT.14.7	In all these places, they continued to tell people the good news about Jesus.
ACT.14.8	There was a man who lived in Lystra. His feet had been weak since he was born. So he had never been able to walk. 
ACT.14.9	While Paul was speaking God's message, this man listened to him. Paul looked at him carefully. He could see that the man believed in Jesus. The man believed that God could make him well. 
ACT.14.10	So Paul said to him loudly, ‘Stand up on your feet!’ Immediately the man jumped up and he began to walk about.
ACT.14.11	The crowd saw what Paul had done. They began to shout in their own language, the language of the people who lived in Lycaonia. ‘The gods have become like men and they have come down from the sky to us,’ they said. 
ACT.14.12	They called Barnabas by the name of their god Zeus. They called Paul by the name of their god Hermes, because he was the one who spoke God's message to the people. 
ACT.14.13	The building where people 
ACT.14.14	Paul and Barnabas heard what the people wanted to do. So they tore their own clothes to show that they were very upset. They ran into the middle of the crowd, 
ACT.14.15	and they shouted, ‘Stop! You people should not do this. We are only men like you. We are not gods. We came here to tell you some good news about the great God. You must stop 
ACT.14.16	In past times, God let people everywhere do what they wanted to do. 
ACT.14.17	But God has showed everybody very clearly what he is like. He has shown you that he is kind. He causes the rain to fall from the sky. He causes the plants to give you food at the right time each year. He gives you enough food to eat and be full. In these ways he makes you very happy.’
ACT.14.18	Even when Paul had said all this, some people still wanted to offer 
ACT.14.19	Then some 
ACT.14.20	But some 
ACT.14.20	The next day, Paul and Barnabas left Lystra and they went to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	While they were there, they told people the good news about Jesus. Many people in Derbe became 
ACT.14.22	In all these towns, they taught the 
ACT.14.23	Paul and Barnabas chose leaders for each group of 
ACT.14.24	Then Paul and Barnabas travelled through Pisidia, and they arrived in Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	They spoke God's message to the people in Perga. Then they went down to the coast, to the town called Attalia.
ACT.14.26	From there they got in a boat and they sailed back to Antioch. That was the place where the 
ACT.14.27	When they arrived, they sent a message to the group of 
ACT.14.28	Paul and Barnabas stayed there with the 
ACT.15.1	Some 
ACT.15.2	Paul and Barnabas did not agree with these men. They argued strongly against them. As a result, the 
ACT.15.3	The group of 
ACT.15.4	When Paul, Barnabas and the others arrived in Jerusalem, they met with the 
ACT.15.5	Some 
ACT.15.6	So the 
ACT.15.7	After they had all talked about this problem for a long time, the 
ACT.15.8	God knows what people really believe. He showed clearly that he accepts 
ACT.15.9	He made no difference between them and us. When they believed in Jesus, he saved them. He made them clean inside.
ACT.15.10	So, do not say that God has done a wrong thing. God has shown us that he accepts 
ACT.15.11	God saves us who are 
ACT.15.12	After Peter said this everybody in the group was quiet. Then Barnabas and Paul spoke to them. They said, ‘God helped us to do great 
ACT.15.13	When they had finished their report, James spoke to the group. ‘Listen to me, my friends!’ he said. 
ACT.15.14	‘Simon Peter has just described to us what happened first with the 
ACT.15.15	The message of God's 
ACT.15.16	The 
ACT.15.16	At that time I will bring back the 
ACT.15.16	People have destroyed his 
ACT.15.16	but I will make it strong again.
ACT.15.17	Then other people in the world will look for me, the 
ACT.15.17	I have chosen some 
ACT.15.17	All of them will look for me.
ACT.15.17	I, the 
ACT.15.17	and I will make these things happen.
ACT.15.18	Long ago I caused people to know all these things.” ’ 
ACT.15.19	James then went on to say, ‘So, this is what I have decided about this problem. Many 
ACT.15.20	Instead of that, we should write a letter to tell them how to live as 
ACT.15.21	These rules are important, because people have known the 
ACT.15.22	The whole group of 
ACT.15.23	This is the letter that they sent with those men:
ACT.15.23	‘We, the 
ACT.15.24	We have heard that some men from our group have confused your thoughts. These men came to you and they taught you without our authority. The things that they said were not right and they have 
ACT.15.25	So now we have all met together. We have agreed what to do about this problem. We have chosen some men to bring this message to you. They will travel with our good friends, Barnabas and Paul. 
ACT.15.26	These two men have worked as servants of the 
ACT.15.27	So we are also sending Judas and Silas to you. They will tell you the same things that we have written in this letter. 
ACT.15.28	The 
ACT.15.29	Do not eat any food that people have given to their 
ACT.15.30	So the 
ACT.15.31	When the 
ACT.15.32	Judas and Silas were both 
ACT.15.33	Judas and Silas remained in Antioch for some time. Then the group of 
ACT.15.34	[But Silas decided to stay there.] 
ACT.15.35	Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch for a longer time. Together with many other 
ACT.15.36	After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, ‘We should go back to the towns where we spoke the message of the 
ACT.15.37	Barnabas agreed and he wanted to take John Mark with them. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul did not think that this was right. He said to Barnabas, ‘John Mark did not remain with us until we had finished our work. He left us when we were in Pamphylia.’
ACT.15.39	Paul and Barnabas argued strongly about this. They could not agree, so they went in different directions. Barnabas took John Mark with him and they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	Paul chose Silas to go with him. The 
ACT.15.41	They travelled through Syria and Cilicia. Paul taught the 
ACT.16.1	Paul travelled on to Derbe and then he came to Lystra. A man called Timothy lived in Lystra. He was a 
ACT.16.2	All the 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him to different places. All the 
ACT.16.4	Paul, Silas and Timothy travelled through many towns. In each place, they told the 
ACT.16.5	In this way, the groups of 
ACT.16.6	Paul and his friends wanted to go to the 
ACT.16.7	Then they arrived at the edge of the 
ACT.16.8	So they went quickly through Mysia, and they arrived at the city called Troas, on the coast.
ACT.16.9	During that night, Paul had a dream. In the dream, he saw a man from the 
ACT.16.10	After Paul's dream, the next morning we immediately prepared ourselves for the journey to Macedonia. We decided that God was telling us to go to there. He wanted us to tell the people there the good news about Jesus. 
ACT.16.11	We got in a boat at Troas and we sailed across the sea. We went across to an island called Samothrace. The next day, we continued our journey to a port called Neapolis. 
ACT.16.12	We then travelled across the land to Philippi. This city is the most important city in the 
ACT.16.13	On the 
ACT.16.14	One of the women who listened to us was called Lydia. She was from the city called Thyatira. She bought and sold expensive dark red cloth. She was a 
ACT.16.15	Then Paul and Silas 
ACT.16.16	One day, we were going to the place where people prayed to God. On the way there, we met a slave girl. A bad 
ACT.16.17	She followed Paul and all of us. She was shouting, ‘These men are servants of the powerful God who is over all! They are telling you how God can save you!’
ACT.16.18	The slave girl continued to do this for many days. After some time, Paul became angry. So he turned round and he said to the bad 
ACT.16.19	Her masters now knew that the girl could not get money for them any more. So they took hold of Paul and Silas and they pulled them to the market place of the city. They took them to stand in front of the leaders of the city. 
ACT.16.20	They asked the important officers to 
ACT.16.21	They are teaching people to obey strange ideas. We are Roman people. We cannot agree with these 
ACT.16.22	A lot of people quickly came together there. They started to attack Paul and Silas. So the important officers said to their soldiers, ‘Tear the clothes off Paul and Silas. Then hit them with sticks!’ 
ACT.16.23	The soldiers hit Paul and Silas many times. Then they took hold of them and they pushed them into the prison. The officers said to the prison 
ACT.16.24	The prison 
ACT.16.25	At midnight, Paul and Silas were praying. They were also singing songs to 
ACT.16.26	The ground 
ACT.16.27	The prison 
ACT.16.28	Paul shouted very loudly to him, ‘Do not hurt yourself! We are all still in here!’
ACT.16.29	The 
ACT.16.30	Then he led Paul and Silas out of the prison. He said to them, ‘Masters, what must I do so that God will save me? Tell me!’
ACT.16.31	Paul and Silas said to him, ‘Believe in the 
ACT.16.32	Then Paul and Silas went to the 
ACT.16.33	In the middle of the night, the man took 
ACT.16.34	The man gave them some food to eat in his house. The 
ACT.16.35	The next morning, the important officers sent their police to the prison with a message for the 
ACT.16.36	The 
ACT.16.37	But Paul spoke to the police who had brought the message. He said, ‘The city officers did not find that we had done anything wrong. But they 
ACT.16.38	So the police returned to the city officers masters. They told them what Paul had said. The officers now understood that Paul and Silas were 
ACT.16.39	So they went to see Paul and Silas in the prison. They told Paul and Silas that they were very sorry. Then they led Paul and Silas out of the prison. They asked them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	After Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia's house. There they met the other 
ACT.17.1	Paul and his friends continued their journey. They went through the two towns called Amphipolis and Apollonia.
ACT.17.2	Paul went to the meeting place, as he usually did on a 
ACT.17.3	He told the people what was true about God's 
ACT.17.4	Some of the 
ACT.17.5	Some other 
ACT.17.6	But they did not find Paul and Silas there. So they took hold of Jason and some other 
ACT.17.7	Jason has let them stay in his house. They speak against the 
ACT.17.8	The whole crowd of people and the important officers heard this about Paul and Silas. They became very angry and 
ACT.17.9	The officers decided that Jason and the other 
ACT.17.10	As soon as it became dark, the 
ACT.17.11	The 
ACT.17.12	Many of the 
ACT.17.13	But the 
ACT.17.14	Immediately, the 
ACT.17.15	When Paul left Berea, some men went with him. They went by boat with him as far as the city called Athens. Before these men returned to Berea, Paul gave them a message for Silas and Timothy. He said, ‘Please come quickly and meet me here in Athens.’
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting in Athens for Silas and Timothy, he looked round the city. He saw that the people in the city had many 
ACT.17.17	So he went to the 
ACT.17.18	There were also some teachers there who talked with Paul. They taught people about what they should believe. Some of them were called Epicureans and some were called Stoics. They said to each other, ‘Who is this silly man? He knows nothing and he talks too much!’ But some of these teachers said, ‘We think that he is talking about the gods of foreign people.’ They said this because Paul was telling people the good news about Jesus. He was also talking about the time when God will cause dead people to live again. 
ACT.17.19	So these men asked Paul to go with them to the hill called Areopagus. They wanted him to speak to the city's important officers who met there. 
ACT.17.20	The officers said, ‘These strange ideas that you are teaching surprise us. Please explain to us what these ideas mean.’ 
ACT.17.21	(The people of Athens liked to talk about new ideas. So did the foreign people who lived there. They all wanted to hear new things and to talk about them. They seemed to do this all the time.)
ACT.17.22	So Paul stood up in front of the important officers of the city. He said to them, ‘People of Athens. I see that you have many gods. 
ACT.17.23	I have walked round your city. I see that you have built many special places where you 
ACT.17.24	The true God made the earth and everything that is in it. He rules everything in the earth and in 
ACT.17.25	People make things to give to God. But God does not need anything like that. It is God himself who causes everyone to live. He gives them everything that they need. 
ACT.17.26	God first made one man. From that one man he made all the different groups of people. He caused them to live in different places all over the world. He decided where each group of people should live. He also decided how long they should live in each place. 
ACT.17.27	God did all this so that people would look for him. They would try very hard to find him. He wanted people to find him. Really, God is close to each of us. 
ACT.17.28	Someone said this: “Because God gives us life, we are alive. Because of him, we can move about. Because of him we can be who we are.” One of your writers has also said, “We too are God's children.”
ACT.17.29	So, because we are God's children, we should know what God is really like. He is not a thing like an idol. Clever people use gold or 
ACT.17.30	In past times people did not know the true things about God. Because of this, God did not 
ACT.17.31	God has already chosen one special day. On that day he will 
ACT.17.32	Paul had said, ‘God caused that man to live again.’ When the people heard this, some of them 
ACT.17.33	So then Paul left the meeting of the important officers of the city. 
ACT.17.34	Some of the people who had heard Paul's message joined his group. They believed the good news about Jesus. One of these 
ACT.18.1	After Paul had spoken to the important officers of Athens, he left the city. He went from there to the city called Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	In Corinth, he met a man called Aquila. Aquila was a 
ACT.18.3	They knew how to make 
ACT.18.4	Every 
ACT.18.5	Then Silas and Timothy arrived there from the country called Macedonia. After that, the only work that Paul did was to teach people God's message. He told the 
ACT.18.6	The 
ACT.18.7	So Paul did not speak in the 
ACT.18.8	A man called Crispus was the leader of the 
ACT.18.9	But one night, the 
ACT.18.10	I am here with you. Nobody will hurt you. There are many people in this city who will believe in me.’
ACT.18.11	So Paul stayed in Corinth for 18 months and he taught the people God's message about Jesus.
ACT.18.12	Gallio then became the 
ACT.18.13	The 
ACT.18.14	Paul was ready to speak, but Gallio spoke first to the 
ACT.18.15	But you are arguing about words and names and your own 
ACT.18.16	Then Gallio told his soldiers to take the 
ACT.18.17	Then the whole crowd of people took hold of a man called Sosthenes. He was the leader of the 
ACT.18.18	Paul remained in Corinth with the 
ACT.18.19	They all arrived in the city called Ephesus. Paul left Priscilla and Aquila, and he went into the 
ACT.18.20	Some of them asked Paul to remain in Ephesus with them for a longer time. But he did not agree to stay. 
ACT.18.21	Before he left, he said to them, ‘If God wants me to come back, I will return to you.’ Then Paul got in a boat and he sailed from Ephesus to 
ACT.18.22	When Paul arrived in 
ACT.18.23	He stayed in Antioch for some time. Then he left there and he travelled through the 
ACT.18.24	A certain 
ACT.18.25	Someone had taught him the good news about the 
ACT.18.26	Apollos went to the 
ACT.18.27	Later, Apollos decided to go to the 
ACT.18.28	Some of the 
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul travelled through the 
ACT.19.2	Paul asked them, ‘When you believed the message about Jesus, did you receive God's 
ACT.19.2	The 
ACT.19.3	So Paul asked them, ‘When someone 
ACT.19.3	‘We received the 
ACT.19.4	Then Paul said, ‘John 
ACT.19.5	When the 
ACT.19.6	Then Paul put his hands on each 
ACT.19.7	There were about 12 men there.
ACT.19.8	For three months, Paul went to the 
ACT.19.9	But some of them did not accept what Paul said. They refused to believe the message about Jesus. Some of them said bad things against the Way of the 
ACT.19.10	Paul taught the people there for two years. During that time, all the people who lived in 
ACT.19.11	God was helping Paul to do special 
ACT.19.12	Because of this, people were taking pieces of cloth and clothes that Paul gave to them. Paul had used these things, and people took them to those who were ill. After they touched these cloths, the sick people would become well again. Bad 
ACT.19.13	There were some 
ACT.19.14	Sceva was a leader of the 
ACT.19.15	But one day the bad 
ACT.19.16	The man who had the bad 
ACT.19.17	All the 
ACT.19.18	Many of the 
ACT.19.19	Some of them had used 
ACT.19.20	As a result of this, more and more people heard the good news about the 
ACT.19.21	After these things happened, Paul decided to travel through Macedonia and Greece. From there, he decided to travel to Jerusalem. He said, ‘After I have been there, I must also go to Rome.’ 
ACT.19.22	At that time, Timothy and Erastus were helping Paul with his work. Paul sent them to Macedonia while he stayed longer in 
ACT.19.23	Soon after that, there was bad trouble in Ephesus. Some people began to speak strongly against the Way of the 
ACT.19.24	In Ephesus there was a man called Demetrius. He used 
ACT.19.25	So he told all his workers to meet with him. He also asked other workers to come, who did the same kind of work. He said to all these men, ‘Men, you know that our work has caused us to become rich. 
ACT.19.26	Also, you can see what this man Paul is doing. You have heard his message. Many people here in Ephesus, and in nearly all the places in 
ACT.19.27	If people continue to believe Paul's message, it will be bad for us. People will say bad things against our work. The house of our god Artemis will not be important any more. People will even think that Artemis herself is not a great god. As it is now, people in all of 
ACT.19.28	When the workers heard Demetrius, they became very angry. They all shouted, ‘Our god Artemis of Ephesus is very great!’ 
ACT.19.29	More and more people through the whole city began to shout. There was trouble everywhere. Gaius and Aristarchus had been travelling with Paul. They had come with him from Macedonia. Some people from the crowd took hold of these two men. They pulled them quickly to the open meeting place in the middle of the city. 
ACT.19.30	Paul himself wanted to go there. He wanted to speak to the crowd. But the other 
ACT.19.31	Some 
ACT.19.32	The crowd of people in the meeting place continued to shout loudly. Some people were shouting one thing and other people were shouting something different. Not many of the people even knew why they had all met together. 
ACT.19.33	There was a 
ACT.19.34	But the crowd knew that Alexander was a 
ACT.19.35	After 2 hours, an important officer of the city caused the crowd to be quiet. He said, ‘People of Ephesus! Everybody knows about our god Artemis who has her great house here in Ephesus. People come here to 
ACT.19.36	Nobody can say that this is not true. So be careful! Do not quickly do anything that is silly. 
ACT.19.37	You have brought Gaius and Aristarchus here to the city officers' meeting place. But what bad thing have they done? They have not robbed the house of Artemis. They have not said bad things against her. 
ACT.19.38	Perhaps Demetrius and his workers think that someone has done a wrong thing. If they think that, they should let a 
ACT.19.39	So, if you want to argue about these problems any more, do it properly. Go to the place where the 
ACT.19.40	Today, there is a crowd of people who are shouting and fighting. The 
ACT.19.41	When the officer had said all this, he said to the crowd, ‘All of you should go home now.’
ACT.20.1	After the trouble in Ephesus had finished, the crowd went home. Then Paul asked all the 
ACT.20.2	He visited many places in that 
ACT.20.3	Paul stayed in Greece for 3 months. One day, he was preparing to travel to Syria by boat. But then he heard news that some 
ACT.20.4	These are the men who went with Paul: Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, from Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; Tychicus and Trophimus from 
ACT.20.5	These men all left by boat before we did. When they arrived in Troas, they waited for us there. 
ACT.20.6	As for us, we sailed by boat from Philippi, after the 
ACT.20.6	After 5 days we arrived in Troas. We met the other men there and we all stayed there for 7 days.
ACT.20.7	On the Sunday evening, we met together with the 
ACT.20.8	Many 
ACT.20.9	A young man called Eutychus was at the meeting. He was sitting on the edge of a window. When Paul had talked for a long time, Eutychus started to sleep. When he was really sleeping, he fell out of the window. He dropped down a long way to the ground. Some of the 
ACT.20.10	So Paul went down the stairs to them all. He lay on top of the young man and held him with his arms. Then Paul said to them all, ‘Do not be afraid. He is still alive.’ 
ACT.20.11	Paul went back upstairs. He 
ACT.20.12	The other 
ACT.20.13	Paul decided to travel to Assos across the land. But we got on a boat and we sailed on it to Assos. We agreed with Paul that we would wait for him there. 
ACT.20.14	When he met us at Assos, he came on the boat with us. Then we all sailed to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	We sailed from there and we arrived the next day at the coast near Chios. The day after that, we came to Samos. The next day, we arrived at Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	Paul had decided to leave quickly from there. He did not want to visit Ephesus, because he did not want to remain in 
ACT.20.17	When we were in Miletus, Paul sent someone to Ephesus with a message. This message was for the leaders of the 
ACT.20.18	When they arrived, Paul said to them, ‘You yourselves know about everything that I did here in 
ACT.20.19	I did not say that I was an important man. Instead, I worked as a servant of the 
ACT.20.20	But I have not been afraid to teach God's message. I have taught you everything that would help you. I have done this outside for everyone to hear. I have also taught you in your own homes. 
ACT.20.21	I have taught the same things both to 
ACT.20.22	Now I am going to Jerusalem. God's 
ACT.20.23	But I do know that much trouble will come to me. The 
ACT.20.24	But even if people kill me, this is not important to me. The 
ACT.20.25	I have lived among you and I have taught you all about the 
ACT.20.26	So I want to say this clearly to you today. If any of you have not believed in Jesus, it is not my 
ACT.20.27	I have told you everything that God wants you to know. 
ACT.20.28	You leaders should be careful about how you live. Also help the people that the 
ACT.20.29	I know that trouble will come to you after I leave. Bad people will come to teach you. They will cause trouble for the 
ACT.20.30	Even men from your own group of 
ACT.20.31	So, be very careful! For 3 years I taught you, in the day and in the night. I told you to be careful. I even cried because I wanted to help you.
ACT.20.32	Now I ask God to keep you safe. I brought God's message to you, which tells us how kind he is. That message will cause you to be strong. As a result, God will give to you all the good things that he has for his special people. 
ACT.20.33	When I stayed among you, I did not ask you to give me money or clothes. 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that I worked with my hands. I did that to get money. Then my friends and I could have the things that we needed. 
ACT.20.35	In this way I have shown you how you should live. You should work well so that you may help sick or weak people. You should remember what Jesus himself said: “It may make you happy when you receive things. But it makes you more happy when you give things to someone.” ’
ACT.20.36	Then Paul finished speaking. He went down on his knees together with the leaders of the 
ACT.20.37	They all cried a lot, because Paul was going to leave them. They put their arms round him and kissed him in a friendly way. 
ACT.20.38	They were very, very sad because Paul had said, ‘I will never see you again.’
ACT.20.38	After that, they walked with Paul to the ship to say ‘Goodbye’.
ACT.21.1	We said ‘Goodbye’ to the leaders of the 
ACT.21.2	At Patara, we found a ship that was going to Phoenicia. So we got on to the ship and we sailed across the sea.
ACT.21.3	After travelling for some time, we could see the island called Cyprus. We sailed south of Cyprus, and we continued on to Syria. We arrived on the coast at the city called Tyre and we got off the ship. The ship would remain in Tyre for some days, because people had to remove the things off the ship. 
ACT.21.4	We went round the city and we found some 
ACT.21.5	After a week with the 
ACT.21.6	Then we said ‘Goodbye’ to each other and the 
ACT.21.7	We continued our journey across the sea. We sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais. There, we met some 
ACT.21.8	The next day, we left Ptolemais and we sailed to 
ACT.21.9	He had 4 daughters who were not married, and they spoke messages from God.
ACT.21.10	We stayed with Philip in 
ACT.21.11	Agabus came to where we were. He took Paul's belt and he tied it round his own feet and hands. He said, ‘Listen to this message from the 
ACT.21.12	When we heard Agabus' message, we all said many times to Paul, ‘Please do not go to Jerusalem.’ 
ACT.21.13	But Paul answered, ‘Stop crying like this! You are making me very sad! I am ready for men in Jerusalem to take hold of me. They may tie me up, and I may even die there. I am ready for all this because I believe in the 
ACT.21.14	We could not cause Paul to think in a different way. So we stopped saying to him, ‘You should not go to Jerusalem.’ Instead we said to him, ‘We want the 
ACT.21.15	We stayed in 
ACT.21.16	Some of the 
ACT.21.17	When we arrived in Jerusalem, the 
ACT.21.18	The next day, we went with Paul to see James. The leaders of the 
ACT.21.19	Paul said ‘hello’ to them and then he told them everything about his work. God had helped him to do many good things for the 
ACT.21.20	After the leaders had listened to Paul, they 
ACT.21.21	These 
ACT.21.22	We need to do something about this problem. These 
ACT.21.23	We will tell you what you must do. There are 4 
ACT.21.24	You must go with these men to 
ACT.21.25	But it is different for the 
ACT.21.26	So the next day, Paul went with the 4 men. He joined with them when they washed to make themselves clean in front of God. Then he went into the yard of 
ACT.21.27	At the end of those 7 days, some 
ACT.21.28	The 
ACT.21.29	(These men had earlier seen Paul in the city with a man called Trophimus. Trophimus was a 
ACT.21.30	Many other people in the city heard about the trouble and they also became angry. They all ran from their homes to 
ACT.21.31	The angry crowd was trying to kill Paul. But someone sent a message to the leader of the 
ACT.21.32	So, the soldiers' leader quickly took some other officers and a large group of soldiers and they ran down to the crowd. The angry crowd of people saw the leader with his soldiers. So then they stopped hitting Paul.
ACT.21.33	The 
ACT.21.34	Some people in the crowd shouted one thing and other people shouted something different. There was so much noise that the leader of the soldiers was not sure about the true facts. He did not know what had really happened. So he said to his soldiers, ‘Take this man up into our strong building!’ 
ACT.21.35	The soldiers then led Paul as far as the steps of their building. Then they had to carry him because the crowd was so angry. 
ACT.21.36	The crowd followed close behind Paul and the soldiers. They were shouting, ‘Kill him!’
ACT.21.37	While the soldiers were leading Paul into their building, he asked their leader, ‘Please can I say something to you?’
ACT.21.37	The soldiers' leader replied, ‘Oh! Do you speak the 
ACT.21.38	I thought that you must be that bad man who came from 
ACT.21.39	Paul answered, ‘I am a 
ACT.21.40	The leader of the soldiers said to Paul, ‘Yes, you may speak to the people.’ So Paul stood still on the steps of the soldiers' building. He raised his hands towards them so that the people became quiet. Then he spoke to them in the 
ACT.22.1	Paul said to the crowd, ‘Please, listen to me, you 
ACT.22.2	The crowd heard Paul speaking to them in their own 
ACT.22.2	Paul continued to speak. He said, 
ACT.22.3	‘I am a 
ACT.22.4	I caused great trouble to the 
ACT.22.5	The most important 
ACT.22.6	Paul continued to say, ‘As I was travelling, I came near to Damascus. About midday, a bright light from the sky 
ACT.22.7	I fell down to the ground. Then I heard a voice that said to me, “Saul, Saul, why do you fight against me?”
ACT.22.8	“
ACT.22.8	He said to me, “I am Jesus from Nazareth. And you are fighting against me.” 
ACT.22.9	The men who travelled with me saw the light. But they did not understand the voice that spoke to me.
ACT.22.10	I asked, “
ACT.22.11	The bright light hurt my eyes so that I could not see. So the men who were with me held my hand. They led me into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	In Damascus, there was a man called Ananias. He 
ACT.22.13	Ananias came to see me. He stood close to me and he said, “
ACT.22.14	Then Ananias said to me, “The God that we

ACT.22.16	So, now you do not need to wait any longer. Stand up and I will 
ACT.22.17	So, then I returned to Jerusalem. I went into 
ACT.22.18	In the dream, I saw the 
ACT.22.19	I replied, “
ACT.22.20	I myself was there when the people killed Stephen. He was your servant who told people your message. But I agreed that it was right to kill him. I even held the coats of the people while they killed him.”
ACT.22.21	But the 
ACT.22.22	The people listened carefully to Paul until he spoke about the 
ACT.22.23	While they were shouting this, they were taking off their coats. They also threw dirt from the ground up into the air. 
ACT.22.24	The leader of the soldiers said to his men, ‘Take this man into our building. Then hit him with 
ACT.22.25	So the soldiers tied Paul's arms and they were ready to hit him. But Paul spoke to the soldiers' officer who stood close to him. He said, ‘I am a 
ACT.22.26	The officer heard what Paul said. So he went to the leader of the soldiers and he said, ‘That man is a 
ACT.22.27	So the soldiers' leader went to speak to Paul. He asked him, ‘Tell me. Are you really a 
ACT.22.27	Paul answered, ‘Yes, I am.’
ACT.22.28	The soldiers' leader said, ‘I paid a lot of money to the government so that I could become a

ACT.22.29	Immediately, the men who were going to hit Paul with 
ACT.22.30	The soldiers' leader wanted to find the reason why the 
ACT.23.1	Paul looked at the group of 
ACT.23.2	The most important 
ACT.23.3	Paul said to him, ‘God will certainly hit you! You are a 
ACT.23.4	The men who were standing near Paul said to him, ‘You must not say bad things against our most important 
ACT.23.5	Paul replied, ‘My 
ACT.23.6	Then Paul saw that there were some 
ACT.23.7	As soon as Paul said that, the 
ACT.23.8	(The 
ACT.23.9	The 
ACT.23.10	The two groups argued more and more strongly. The leader of the soldiers thought that the people there might hurt Paul badly. So he said to his soldiers, ‘Go down into the group and take Paul away from them. Take him back with you into our strong building.’
ACT.23.11	The next night, the 
ACT.23.12	The next morning, a group of 
ACT.23.13	More than 40 men were in the group that decided this. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the leaders of the 
ACT.23.15	So, now we want you and the group of 
ACT.23.16	But the son of Paul's sister heard what the 
ACT.23.17	So Paul asked one of the soldiers' officers to come to him. He said, ‘Please take this young man to your leader. He has something important to tell him.’ 
ACT.23.18	Then the officer led the young man to the soldiers' leader. He said to him, ‘Paul, who is here in the prison, spoke to me. He asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.’
ACT.23.19	The leader of the soldiers held the young man's hand and he led him to another place. When they were alone, he asked the young man, ‘What do you want to tell me?’
ACT.23.20	The young man said, ‘Some 
ACT.23.21	Do not agree to do what they want. There are more than 40 men who will be hiding somewhere. They are waiting for Paul. They have made a serious promise to God. They will not eat or drink anything until they have killed Paul. They are now ready to do this. They will be waiting to hear your answer.’
ACT.23.22	The leader of the soldiers said to him, ‘Do not tell anybody that you told me about this.’ Then he sent the young man away.
ACT.23.23	Then the soldiers' leader told two of his officers to come to him. He said to them, ‘Tell 200 of our soldiers to prepare themselves. They must go to 
ACT.23.24	Take some horses for Paul to ride on. Take him to Felix the 
ACT.23.25	Then the soldiers' leader wrote a letter to Felix. He sent this message:
ACT.23.26	‘I, Claudius Lysias, write this letter. I say “hello” to you, Felix, our great ruler.
ACT.23.27	I am sending this man to you. The 
ACT.23.28	The 
ACT.23.29	The 
ACT.23.30	But a group of 
ACT.23.31	The soldiers did what their leader had told them to do. They took Paul out from the prison in their building. That night, they took him as far as Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	The next day, the soldiers who had walked returned to their building in Jerusalem. But the soldiers who rode horses continued to travel with Paul. 
ACT.23.33	When they arrived in 
ACT.23.34	Felix read the letter and he asked Paul, ‘Which 
ACT.23.35	Felix said, ‘When the 
ACT.23.35	Felix then said to his soldiers, ‘Put this man in the prison in Herod's house. 
ACT.24.1	Five days after that, Ananias, the leader of the 
ACT.24.2	Felix told a soldier to bring Paul to the meeting. Then Tertullus began to speak against Paul. He said, ‘Sir, you have ruled us well for many years. Because of you, our country has had no wars for a long time. You have made new 
ACT.24.3	Everywhere, the people are happy about what you have done. So we want to thank you very much for all these good things. 
ACT.24.4	I do not want you to sit here for a long time. So, I will speak for a short time about our problem. Please be kind to us and listen to me.
ACT.24.5	We know that this man brings trouble everywhere. Anywhere in the world that 
ACT.24.6	‘He also did bad things in 
ACT.24.7	But Lysias, the leader of the soldiers, came to us. He attacked us and he took Paul away from us. 
ACT.24.8	Then he told us to come and to speak to you about it.] You should ask this man some questions about what he has done. You will find out that what we say against him is true.’
ACT.24.9	The other 
ACT.24.10	Then Felix raised his hand towards Paul to show that he should speak. So Paul said to Felix, ‘I know that you have 
ACT.24.11	I went to Jerusalem less than 12 days ago. You can check that that is true. I went there to 
ACT.24.12	When the 
ACT.24.13	They have said bad things against me. But they cannot show you that these things are true. 
ACT.24.14	What I do agree is this: I worship the same God that our 
ACT.24.15	I also 
ACT.24.16	Because of that, I always try to do what is right. I do not want to do anything bad against God or against other people.
ACT.24.17	I had not been to Jerusalem for several years. Now I returned there with a gift of some money. I brought it to give to poor people who are 
ACT.24.18	I was doing this in the yard of 
ACT.24.19	But there were some 
ACT.24.20	Or these men here should tell you what wrong thing I have done. I stood in front of the meeting of the 
ACT.24.21	When I stood there, I shouted, “I believe that dead people will rise and they will live again. That is the reason why you are 
ACT.24.22	Felix knew much about the Way of the 
ACT.24.23	He said to the officer who was holding Paul, ‘Continue to 
ACT.24.24	After some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his 
ACT.24.25	Paul continued to speak for some time. He said, ‘People need to do what is right. They need to stop themselves doing wrong things. One day, God will 
ACT.24.25	While Paul talked about these things, Felix became afraid. He said to Paul, ‘You can leave us now. At some time I may want to listen to you again. Then I will ask you to come to me again.’ 
ACT.24.26	But Felix also hoped that Paul would give him some money. For that reason he often met with Paul and they talked together. 
ACT.24.27	This happened for two years. Felix left Paul in the prison, because he wanted to make the Jewish leaders happy. Then Porcius Festus became the ruler instead of Felix.
ACT.25.1	3 days after Festus began to rule in Caesarea, he travelled from there to Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.2	When he arrived there, the leaders of the 
ACT.25.3	They said to Festus, ‘Please listen to us. We really want you to bring Paul here to Jerusalem. You can

ACT.25.5	So, your leaders should go to 
ACT.25.6	Festus stayed for another 8 or 10 days in Jerusalem. Then he returned to 
ACT.25.7	Some of the 
ACT.25.8	Then Paul spoke to show what was true. He said, ‘I have not done anything wrong against our 
ACT.25.9	Festus wanted to make the 
ACT.25.10	Paul answered him, ‘I am already in the place where 
ACT.25.11	Have I done something bad that you should kill me for it? If that is true, then I will agree to it. It is right that I should die. But these 
ACT.25.12	Festus talked to his officers about what Paul had said. Then he said to Paul, ‘You have asked to go to 
ACT.25.13	Several days after this, King Agrippa and Bernice came to 
ACT.25.14	They stayed in 
ACT.25.15	When I went to Jerusalem, the important 
ACT.25.16	I answered them, “You are saying that this man has done wrong things. He must first stand in front of you who are speaking against him. Then he can answer you, and I can 
ACT.25.17	So when I came back here, the 
ACT.25.18	The men who had spoken against him stood up. I thought they would say that Paul had done some very bad thing. But they did not say that. 
ACT.25.19	Instead, they were arguing with Paul about what the 
ACT.25.20	I did not know how I could 
ACT.25.21	But Paul did not want to go to Jerusalem. He said to me, “Please keep me safe here in prison. Then send me to 
ACT.25.22	Agrippa said to Festus, ‘I would like to hear this man myself.’
ACT.25.22	Festus replied, ‘You will hear him tomorrow.’
ACT.25.23	The next day, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea's public meeting room. They wore beautiful clothes to show that they were great people. Some 
ACT.25.24	Festus said, ‘King Agrippa, and everyone here today, listen to me! You see this man who is standing in front of you. Many 
ACT.25.25	But I could not find any reason to kill him. He has not done anything against our 
ACT.25.26	But I do not know what to write about him to our ruler, 
ACT.25.27	I need to tell 
ACT.26.1	King Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You may now say what you think about this problem.’
ACT.26.1	Paul raised his hand so that people would listen to him. 
ACT.26.2	He said, ‘King Agrippa, I am happy that you are here. I ask you to listen to me today. These 
ACT.26.3	You yourself know all about the 
ACT.26.4	The 
ACT.26.5	So, they have known me for a long time. They could tell you that I always obeyed our 
ACT.26.6	So, what is the reason that I stand here today for you to 
ACT.26.7	He promised a great thing to our 12 
ACT.26.8	Is it impossible for God to cause dead people to become alive again? Why do you not believe me when I say that?
ACT.26.9	I myself wanted to work against Jesus, the man from Nazareth, and against his message. 
ACT.26.10	That is what I was doing in Jerusalem. The leaders of the 
ACT.26.11	I went to our 
ACT.26.12	For that reason, one day I was travelling to Damascus. The leaders of the 
ACT.26.13	Listen to this, King Agrippa! I was travelling along the road at midday. 
ACT.26.14	All of us fell down to the ground. I heard a voice that spoke to me in my own language, Hebrew
ACT.26.15	“
ACT.26.15	He replied, “I am Jesus. And you are fighting against me. 
ACT.26.16	Now you must get up. Stand on your feet. I have chosen you to be my servant. That is why I have appeared to you today. You must tell other people about what you have seen. After that, I will show you other things that you must tell people. 
ACT.26.17	I will send you to speak about me to 
ACT.26.18	You will help them to understand what is really true. They are like people who live in the dark. Teach them what is true about me. Then they will be like people who live in the light. Now 
ACT.26.19	‘So you should know this, King Agrippa. I obeyed the things that I heard from 
ACT.26.20	First, I taught God's message to the 
ACT.26.21	This is the reason that the 
ACT.26.22	But God has helped me every day, even until today. So now I stand here and I can tell you what is true. I say the same thing to people who are very important and to people who are not important. I am telling you the same things that Moses and God's other 
ACT.26.23	They said that God's special 
ACT.26.24	While Paul was still speaking to Agrippa, Festus shouted at him, ‘Paul, Your mind is confused! You have learned many things. But all these things are making you crazy.’
ACT.26.25	Paul said, ‘Festus, sir, I am not crazy. Everything that I have said is true. It is not difficult to understand. 
ACT.26.26	King Agrippa knows about these things. He understands what I am talking about. None of these things happened in secret places. So I am sure that he has heard news about all this. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe what God's 
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said to Paul, ‘Can you change what I believe in this short time? Should I become a Christian already? Is that what you think?’
ACT.26.29	Paul answered him, ‘It is not important if it takes a long time or a short time. I pray to God for you and for everyone who is listening to me today. I pray that you may all become like me. But I would not want you to become a 
ACT.26.30	Then King Agrippa, the ruler Festus, and Bernice all got ready to leave. Everyone else there also stood up. 
ACT.26.31	After they left the meeting room, they said to each other, ‘This man has not done anything bad. We should not kill him, or even hold him in prison.’
ACT.26.32	King Agrippa said to Festus, ‘We could have let this man go free from the prison. But he has asked that 
ACT.27.1	Some time after that, Festus decided that we should sail to Italy. So he 
ACT.27.2	We went on to a ship that had come from Adramyttium. This ship was ready to leave. It would sail to the towns on the coast of 
ACT.27.3	The next day after we left Caesarea, we arrived at Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He said, ‘Paul, you can go and visit your friends here. They can give you anything that you need.’ 
ACT.27.4	Then we sailed out across the sea again. But the wind was blowing against our ship. So we sailed round the island called Cyprus. We sailed on the side of the island where the wind was not strong. 
ACT.27.5	When we were near to Cilicia and Pamphylia, we sailed straight across the sea. Then we arrived at Myra, in the 
ACT.27.6	The 
ACT.27.7	We sailed slowly for several days. It was difficult to sail, but after some time we arrived near the town called Cnidus. Because of the strong wind, we could not continue to sail in that direction. So we sailed along the side of the island called Crete, where the wind was not strong. We sailed past the point of land called Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	It was still difficult to sail, so we sailed close to the coast. Then we arrived at a place called ‘Safe Port’. This port was near to the town called Lasea.
ACT.27.9	We remained there for many days. By then it had become dangerous to continue the journey. It was already after the Day of 
ACT.27.9	So Paul spoke to the army officer and to the sailors. 
ACT.27.10	He said, ‘Friends, I understand that now our journey will be dangerous. The ship may break in pieces. You may lose the things that the ship is carrying. All of us may even die.’ 
ACT.27.11	But the army officer did not believe what Paul said. Instead, he decided to do what the owner of the ship and the captain said. 
ACT.27.12	This port was not a good place for a ship to remain during the winter. Most of the men on the ship wanted to continue the journey. They wanted to sail as far as Phoenix, if they could get there. They could stay there for the winter. Phoenix was a port on the island called Crete. It was open to the sea both to the south-west and to the north-west. 
ACT.27.13	The wind began to blow from the south, but it was not strong. So the sailors thought, ‘Now we can do what we wanted to do. We can sail to Phoenix.’ So they pulled up the ship's 
ACT.27.14	But soon a very strong wind began to blow. This wind blew from the north-east and it blew strongly across the island. 
ACT.27.15	The wind blew strongly against the ship. It was not possible for the sailors to sail the ship straight into the wind. So they did not try to do that any more. Instead, they let the wind blow the ship along. 
ACT.27.16	After that, we passed the south end of a small island called Cauda. Here we found a place where the wind did not blow so strongly. The sailors lifted the ship's small boat out of the water to make it safe. 
ACT.27.17	They tied it on the ship with 
ACT.27.18	The strong storm continued to blow against the ship. The ship was carrying many things. So the next day, the sailors threw some of these things into the sea. 
ACT.27.19	The day after that, they took hold of the 
ACT.27.20	For many days, we did not see the sun or any stars. The storm continued to blow strongly. So then we thought, ‘It is not possible for us to remain alive.’ 
ACT.27.21	The men on the ship had not eaten any food for a long time. So Paul stood in front of them and he said, ‘Men, you should have listened to me! We should not have sailed away from Crete. If we had not left there, the ship and everything on it would still be safe. 
ACT.27.22	Now I ask you, please be brave. The storm will completely destroy the ship, but not one of you will die. 
ACT.27.23	Last night one of God's 
ACT.27.24	The 
ACT.27.25	Because of the 
ACT.27.26	But the wind will blow the ship so that we hit an island.’
ACT.27.27	The storm had continued for 14 days and nights. The strong wind was blowing the ship across the Mediterranean Sea. About midnight, the sailors thought that we were near to the land. 
ACT.27.28	So they used a 
ACT.27.29	The sailors were afraid that the ship would hit some rocks. So they dropped 4 
ACT.27.29	After that, they prayed that dawn would come soon. 
ACT.27.30	Some of the sailors tried to leave the ship. They put the little boat into the sea. They tried to go away secretly. They said, ‘We are going to the front of the ship to put some more 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the army officer and to the soldiers, ‘These sailors must stay on the ship. If they do not stay, you will not be safe. You will die.’ 
ACT.27.32	So the soldiers cut the 
ACT.27.33	Now it was almost dawn. Paul said to everyone, ‘Please eat some food. You have now waited for 14 days for the storm to stop. You did not know what would happen. You have not eaten anything during all that time. 
ACT.27.34	You must eat some food now. Then you will be strong enough to get to the shore safely. None of you will die. You will not even lose one hair from your head.’
ACT.27.35	After Paul said this, he took some bread in his hands. He stood in front of them all and he thanked God for the bread. Then he broke the bread into pieces and he began to eat it. 
ACT.27.36	Everyone became less afraid and we all ate some food. 
ACT.27.37	There were 276 people on the ship. 
ACT.27.38	After everyone had eaten enough, the sailors threw bags of 
ACT.27.39	In the morning, the ship was close to some land, but the sailors did not recognise the place. They saw a place on the shore where the water was quieter. There was a lot of sand there. They wanted to drive the ship on to the sand. 
ACT.27.40	So the sailors cut the 
ACT.27.41	But there was a place in the sea where the water was not deep. The ship sailed on to the sand in this place and it stayed there. The front of the ship pushed into the sand and it could not move. The sea was very strong and it hit against the back of the ship. As a result, the back of the ship broke into pieces.
ACT.27.42	The soldiers decided to kill the 
ACT.27.43	But the army officer wanted to save Paul. So he 
ACT.27.44	You other people must follow them. Hold on to pieces of wood, or pieces of the ship.’
ACT.27.44	In this way all of us got safely out of the sea and we arrived on the land.
ACT.28.1	So, then we were on the shore and we were all safe. We discovered that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The people who lived on the island were very kind to us. Rain was falling and the weather was cold. So the people lit a fire and they helped all of us. 
ACT.28.3	Paul picked up some small branches to put on the fire. When he did this, a dangerous snake came out from among the sticks. It had felt the heat from the fire. The snake bit Paul's hand and it held on to it. 
ACT.28.4	The people who lived on the island saw the snake. They saw that it was hanging from Paul's hand. So they said to each other, ‘We know now that this man murdered someone. He did not die in the sea but now the snake will kill him. The god who 
ACT.28.5	Then Paul waved his hand about so that the snake fell off into the fire. The snake had not hurt Paul in any way. 
ACT.28.6	So, the people watched Paul carefully. They thought that his body would become very sick. They thought that he might die 
ACT.28.7	There was an important officer who ruled the island. He was called Publius. He had some fields near to the shore where we had the fire. He was very kind to us. He asked us to stay in his house. We stayed there for three days. 
ACT.28.8	Publius's father was lying in bed because he was ill. His body was hot and he was very sick. Paul went into his room to see him. Paul prayed for him and he put his hands on the man's head. As a result, the man became well again. 
ACT.28.9	After Paul did this, the other sick people on the island came to him. He caused them also to become well again. 
ACT.28.10	The people gave us many gifts. Later, we got ready to leave the island on another ship. They gave us the things that we needed for the journey.
ACT.28.11	When we left Malta, we had been there for 3 months. We got on a ship that was called ‘The Twin Gods’. It had come from Alexandria and it had stayed in Malta during the winter. 
ACT.28.12	We sailed across the sea and we arrived at the city called Syracuse. We stayed there for 3 days. 
ACT.28.13	We left Syracuse and we sailed to the city called Rhegium. The next day, the wind began to blow from the south, so we sailed more quickly. The day after that, we arrived at the town called Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	We found some 
ACT.28.15	The 
ACT.28.16	When we arrived in Rome, the 
ACT.28.17	After 3 days, Paul asked the leaders of the 
ACT.28.18	The 
ACT.28.19	But the 
ACT.28.20	That is why I want to talk with you now. I want to tell you why they are 
ACT.28.21	The 
ACT.28.22	But we know that people everywhere are saying bad things about your new group. So we would like you to tell us your ideas.’
ACT.28.23	So, the 
ACT.28.24	Some of them believed that Paul's message was true. But other 
ACT.28.25	They argued about it with each other. When they began to leave the house, Paul said, ‘The 
ACT.28.26	“Go and say to this people,
ACT.28.26	‘You will listen and listen. But you will not understand.
ACT.28.26	You will look and look. But you will not see anything.’
ACT.28.27	These people do not really want to understand.
ACT.28.27	They are like people who have shut their ears.
ACT.28.27	They are like people who have shut their eyes.
ACT.28.27	If they did want to look, then they would really see.
ACT.28.27	If they did want to listen, then they would really hear.
ACT.28.27	They would understand my message.
ACT.28.27	They would turn back to me and they would obey me.
ACT.28.27	Then I would 
ACT.28.28	Paul then said to the 
ACT.28.28	[
ACT.28.29	After Paul had said this, the 
ACT.28.30	Paul lived in a house in Rome for 2 years. He paid money to live in the house. Many people came to visit him there. He was very happy to see them all. 
ACT.28.31	He told people clearly about the 
ROM.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. I am a servant of Christ Jesus. God chose me to be his 
ROM.1.2	God promised this good news long ago, before it became true. His 
ROM.1.3+ROM.1.4	This good news is about God's Son, who is Jesus Christ, our 
ROM.1.5	Because of Jesus Christ, God has been very kind to us. He has chosen me to 
ROM.1.6	You Christians in Rome are also among those people! God has chosen you to belong to Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.7	So, I am writing to all you Christians who are in Rome. God loves you and he has chosen you to be his own people.

ROM.1.14	Because God has been kind to me, I must tell his message to all people. I must tell his good news to people who have learned many things, and to those who have never been to school. I must tell it to people who are 
ROM.1.15	Because of that, I want very much to tell God's good news also to you people who live in Rome. 
ROM.1.16	I am not ashamed to tell people the good news. God uses that good news to show his great power. He uses it to save all people who believe in Jesus Christ. First, God saves all 
ROM.1.17	The good news explains how God accepts people as right with himself. He does this when they believe in Christ. It is only because of their 
ROM.1.17	‘Everyone that God accepts as right with him will live, because they 
ROM.1.18	God in 
ROM.1.19	They should understand what God is like, because God himself has shown it to them clearly. 
ROM.1.20	Ever since God made the world, he has been showing people clearly about himself. We cannot see God. But the things that he has made show us clearly what he is like. We can understand his great power that continues for ever. We can know that he is the true God. So there is no reason for anyone to say, ‘We could not know about God.’
ROM.1.21	Those people really knew about God. But they did not respect him as a great God, and they did not thank him. They did not even think clearly any more. Their minds became confused and they did not understand God's message. 
ROM.1.22	They said that they were 
ROM.1.23	They refused to 
ROM.1.24	So God let those people do all the bad things that they wanted to do. God let those dirty things rule their lives. As a result, they did bad things with each other's bodies. They did things that people should be ashamed to do. 
ROM.1.25	They refused to believe the true things about God. Instead, they chose to believe 
ROM.1.26	Because those people turned against God, he let those bad things rule their lives. They strongly wanted to do things that they should be ashamed about. Even the women stopped having sex in a way which is proper. Instead, they began to have sex with other women, which is not proper. 
ROM.1.27	Also, the men stopped having sex with women. Instead, they strongly wanted to have sex with other men. Men did bad things with other men that they should be ashamed about. Because they did such wrong things, they received in their own bodies the 
ROM.1.28	Those people decided that they did not need to understand God's message. So God let their minds become spoiled. As a result, they do bad things that people ought not to do. 
ROM.1.29	They only think about wrong and bad things that they want to do. They want many things for themselves. They want to hurt other people. They are always 
ROM.1.30	They tell 
ROM.1.31	They do not understand what is right. They do not do what they have promised to do. They do not love anyone and they are not kind to anyone. 
ROM.1.32	These people understand God's message about what is right. They know that people who do bad things like this ought to die. But they still continue to do those bad things. Also, they are even happy when other people do those bad things too.
ROM.2.1	So I say this to each one of you: ‘Do not 
ROM.2.2	When God 
ROM.2.3	I ask each of you again: ‘Do you speak against people who do bad things, but you do those same bad things yourself?’ Then God will certainly 
ROM.2.4	Remember that God is very kind and patient with us. He waits a long time before he 
ROM.2.5	But you refuse to change the way that you live. You are not sorry about the wrong things that you have done. As a result, you cause God to become even angrier with you. So, he will 
ROM.2.6	He will give to each person what they ought to have because of the things that they have done. 
ROM.2.7	Some people continue patiently to do good things. They want to do what is right so that God will 
ROM.2.8	But other people think only about themselves. They refuse to obey God's true message. Instead, they continue to do things that are wrong. God will be very angry with people like that and he will 
ROM.2.9	God will 
ROM.2.10	But God will 
ROM.2.11	God is always fair when he 
ROM.2.12	The 
ROM.2.13	Who does God accept as right with himself? It is those people who obey his 
ROM.2.14	The 
ROM.2.15	Those people show that they know what is right. It is like God has written his 
ROM.2.16	That is the message that I tell people. God knows everything that people think secretly. One day he will 
ROM.2.17	Do you say that you are a 
ROM.2.18	You know what God wants people to do. His 
ROM.2.19	You are sure that you yourself can teach other people about God. You think that you can be like a guide to 
ROM.2.20	You are sure that you can teach fools and people who do not know very much. You know that God's 
ROM.2.21	So, you teach other people, do you? But do you teach yourself? You tell other people, ‘Do not rob anyone.’ But maybe you yourself rob other people. 
ROM.2.22	You say, ‘People must not have sex with anyone who is not their wife or their husband.’ But maybe you yourself have sex in a wrong way. You say that you 
ROM.2.23	You are proud that you know God's 
ROM.2.24	This is written in the Bible:
ROM.2.24	‘Because of you 
ROM.2.25	As a 
ROM.2.26	But a 
ROM.2.27	In that way, even 
ROM.2.28	Not everyone who seems to be a 
ROM.2.29	No! A true 
ROM.3.1	So someone may ask, ‘Does it help a person if they are a 
ROM.3.2	Yes, it helps in many ways. The first is that God chose to give his messages to the 
ROM.3.3	But you may say, ‘Some 
ROM.3.4	No, certainly it does not mean that! God will always do what he says. He will always say what is true, even if every human person should tell 
ROM.3.4	‘Your message is true. It shows that you are right.
ROM.3.4	People may say that you are wrong.
ROM.3.4	But it will always be clear that you are right.’ 
ROM.3.5	Maybe some people may say, ‘The wrong things that we do show more clearly that God is always right. So, perhaps God is wrong to 
ROM.3.6	That is not true! God always decides what is right and fair. That is why he is able to 
ROM.3.7	Someone might also say, ‘When I tell 
ROM.3.8	But if that is true, you could also say, ‘We should do more and more bad things. Then something good will happen as a result.’ Some people even say that is the message which I teach. But if they say that, they are 
ROM.3.9	So then, what do we learn from that? We cannot say that we 
ROM.3.10	This is written in the Bible:
ROM.3.10	‘There is nobody who is right with God.
ROM.3.10	There is not even one person who is like that.
ROM.3.11	There is nobody who understands what is true.
ROM.3.11	There is nobody who wants to 
ROM.3.12	Everyone has turned away from God.
ROM.3.12	All people have become completely bad.
ROM.3.12	Nobody does what is good or kind.
ROM.3.12	There is not even one person who is like that. 
ROM.3.13	Bad words come out of their mouth, like a very bad smell.
ROM.3.13	They tell 
ROM.3.13	so that people do wrong things.
ROM.3.13	The things that they say hurt people, like a snake's poison. 
ROM.3.14	They are always saying bad things against people,
ROM.3.14	because they want to cause trouble for them. 
ROM.3.15	They hurry to kill people.
ROM.3.16	Everywhere they go, they destroy things.
ROM.3.16	They only make people very sad.
ROM.3.17	They have never known how to live in 
ROM.3.18	They refuse to 
ROM.3.19	So, we know that God's 
ROM.3.20	God's 
ROM.3.21	But now we can know how to become right with God. God has shown us the way that he will accept people as right with himself. This way is not part of the 
ROM.3.22	God accepts people as right with himself because Jesus Christ did what God wanted. God accepts every person who believes in Christ. It is the same way for everyone, whether they are 
ROM.3.23	All people have done wrong things. Nobody can be good and great, as God wanted them to be. 
ROM.3.24	But because God is very kind, he accepts us as right with himself. That is God's gift to us. Jesus Christ has paid for our 
ROM.3.25	God showed that Jesus Christ died on the 
ROM.3.26	He did not 
ROM.3.27	So then, nobody should be 
ROM.3.28	So, this is what we are saying. A person becomes right with God if they 
ROM.3.29	God is not God only for 
ROM.3.30	There is only one God. He will accept 
ROM.3.31	What does this show us about God's 
ROM.4.1	Abraham was the 
ROM.4.2	God did not accept Abraham because Abraham had done good things. If God had done that, then Abraham would have been able to say great things about himself. But he could not say that to God. 
ROM.4.3	Remember what the Bible tells us. It says: ‘Abraham believed God. As a result, God accepted Abraham as right with him.’ 
ROM.4.4	When a person works to get money, it is right for him to receive his money. That money is not a gift. It is what that person ought to receive as a result of his work. 
ROM.4.5	But nobody can do any work that will make himself right with God. Instead, if he believes in God, then God will accept him. Because of that person's 
ROM.4.6	David also wrote about the same thing. He described those people that God has accepted as right with himself. He has not accepted them because they have done good things, but as his gift to them. David tells us how happy people like that are. 
ROM.4.7	David says:
ROM.4.7	‘The people that God has 
ROM.4.7	They have done wrong things, but he has 
ROM.4.8	A person is really happy when the 
ROM.4.8	The 
ROM.4.9	God does this for all people, both 
ROM.4.10	They 
ROM.4.11	Some time after that, God told Abraham that someone should 
ROM.4.12	But Abraham is also like the father of all 
ROM.4.13	God promised to Abraham, and to his 
ROM.4.14	People cannot get what God promised because they obey rules. If they could get it like that, then 
ROM.4.15	The rules in Moses' 
ROM.4.16	So, God gives us his promise as a gift, because he is very kind. We receive it when we 
ROM.4.17	In the Bible, God said to Abraham, ‘I have chosen you to become the 
ROM.4.18	Abraham continued to 
ROM.4.19	Abraham was about 100 years old. His body was already so old that it was nearly dead. His wife, Sarah, was unable to have children. Abraham understood all that, but he did not stop 
ROM.4.20	He never stopped believing what God had promised. Instead, he believed in God more strongly. He 
ROM.4.21	Abraham was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do. 
ROM.4.22	So we see that it is true: Because Abraham believed in God, God accepted Abraham as right with him. 
ROM.4.23	These words that are written in the Bible, ‘God accepted him as right’ are not only speaking about Abraham. 
ROM.4.24	They are written to help us also. If we believe in God, he will accept us as right with him. God raised our 
ROM.4.25	God let people kill Jesus on the 
ROM.5.1	So we see that God has accepted us as right because we believe in him. As a result, we are friends with God, because of what our 
ROM.5.2	Also, because we 
ROM.5.3	We are happy even when we have troubles and pain. That is because we know that those troubles help us to become patient and strong. 
ROM.5.4	And when we remain strong, we show that we 
ROM.5.5	And when we hope like that, it will not disappoint us. That is because we know that God loves us very much. God has given his 
ROM.5.6	At one time we were weak and we could not help ourselves. Then, at the right time, Christ died to save us. He died on behalf of people who have not obeyed God. 
ROM.5.7	Nobody will agree to die on behalf of another person, even if that person has done what is right. Maybe someone might be brave enough to die on behalf of a person who is very good. 
ROM.5.8	But God has shown us how much he loves us. Even when we still did not obey God, Christ died on our behalf.
ROM.5.9	Because Christ died on the 
ROM.5.10	While we were still God's enemies, God's Son died on our behalf. As a result, we became God's friends. So, now that we are God's friends, his Son will certainly save us. Christ will save us because he is alive again. 
ROM.5.11	But that is not everything! We are very happy now because of what God has done for us. Our 
ROM.5.12	It was because of one man, Adam, that 
ROM.5.13	Before God gave his 
ROM.5.14	But still death ruled all people, from the time when Adam lived until the time when Moses lived. Everyone died, even those who did not fail in the same way that Adam failed.
ROM.5.14	Adam shows us something about God's special 
ROM.5.15	But they are not the same. Adam was the man who did not obey what God said to him. Jesus Christ is the man who brought God's free gift to people. Adam was just one person but many people died because of his 
ROM.5.16	Also, God's gift is different from the result of Adam's 
ROM.5.17	One man, Adam, did not obey God, and death began to rule everyone as a result. But what the one man, Jesus Christ, did is much greater! Because of him, people can become right with God. They receive that great gift from God because he is very good and very kind. Because of what Jesus Christ has done, those people will rule like kings in their lives.
ROM.5.18	So, God's 
ROM.5.19	One man did not obey God and, as a result, many people became 
ROM.5.20	God gave his 
ROM.5.21	We see that 
ROM.6.1	Someone might say, ‘Perhaps we should continue to do wrong things. Then God can be kind to us in more and more ways.’ 
ROM.6.2	No! Certainly we should not do that! 
ROM.6.3	Remember what your 
ROM.6.4	Your 
ROM.6.5	We have become 
ROM.6.6	We know that God has caused our old 
ROM.6.7	 no longer has any authority over someone who has died.
ROM.6.8	So, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will live with him also. 
ROM.6.9	God raised Christ, so that he became alive again after his death. Because of that, we know that he will never die again. Death has no authority over him any more. 
ROM.6.10	When Christ died, he died once to destroy the power of 
ROM.6.11	So, you also should think about yourselves in the same way. 
ROM.6.12	So, do not let 
ROM.6.13	 can use your body to do things that are wrong. So, do not let any parts of your body 
ROM.6.14	 will no longer have authority over you. You do not have a new life because you obey the 
ROM.6.15	Someone might say: ‘So, we have a new life because God is kind to us. Moses' 
ROM.6.16	Remember this: When you agree to serve someone as a slave, you have to obey that person as your master. You may choose to 
ROM.6.17	At one time, you were slaves to 
ROM.6.18	As a result, God has made you free from the power of 
ROM.6.19	It is difficult for you to understand these things, because you are still weak. So I am using a human picture of slaves to help you to understand better. At one time, you agreed to 
ROM.6.20	When you were slaves to 
ROM.6.21	You did things that you are ashamed about now. Nothing good came from them. In the end, the result of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now God has made you free from the power of 
ROM.6.23	If you 
ROM.7.1	My Christian friends, you know about 
ROM.7.2	So think about this. A woman who has a husband must stay with him as long as he still lives. That is what the 
ROM.7.3	While her husband is alive, the 
ROM.7.4	My friends, it is like that for you also. When Christ's body died on the 
ROM.7.5	In our old lives, we did the bad things that we wanted to do. Moses' 
ROM.7.6	But now we have become free from the 
ROM.7.7	So then, someone might say, ‘The 
ROM.7.8	But that rule gave 
ROM.7.9	As for me, there was a time when I did not know Moses' 
ROM.7.10	As a result, I died. 
ROM.7.11	That rule gave 
ROM.7.12	So then, we understand that God's 
ROM.7.13	So, someone might say, ‘This means that something good brought death to you.’ No! God's 
ROM.7.14	We understand that the 
ROM.7.15	I do not understand the things that I do. I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, I do the things that I 
ROM.7.16	But I do not want to do those wrong things. So then I am agreeing that God's 
ROM.7.17	So, it is not really I myself who am doing those wrong things. Instead, 
ROM.7.18	I know that there is nothing good in me. I am a weak human person. I want to do what is good. But I am unable to do it. 
ROM.7.19	I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, I continue to do the bad things that I do not want to do. 
ROM.7.20	So, when I do bad things that I do not want to do, what does that show? It shows that it is not really I myself who am doing those wrong things. It is 
ROM.7.21	So I understand what is happening in me. Whenever I want to do something good, I can only choose something bad. 
ROM.7.22	Deep inside myself, I really love God's 
ROM.7.23	So, my mind tells me to obey God's rules. But my body wants to make me do something else. Every part of me fights against what my mind tells me to do. 
ROM.7.24	This makes me very sad! My body is leading me to death. I need someone to make me free from the power of 
ROM.7.25	I thank God! He has made me free, because of what Jesus Christ has done.
ROM.7.25	So then, with my mind I want to obey God's 
ROM.8.1	Now we know this: God has 
ROM.8.2	If you belong to Christ Jesus, God's 
ROM.8.3	The 
ROM.8.4	God did this so that we could become right with him. God's 
ROM.8.5	Some people do what their weak human thoughts want them to do. They think about the things that will make themselves happy. But people who live with God's 
ROM.8.6	People who let their human thoughts rule them will die. But people who think about what God's 
ROM.8.7	If our weak human thoughts rule us, we become God's enemies. People like that do not want to obey God's 
ROM.8.8	People who let their human thoughts rule them cannot make God happy.
ROM.8.9	But you are not like that. You no longer obey your weak human thoughts. Instead, you obey God's 
ROM.8.10	But, if Christ lives in you, you have a new life because of his 
ROM.8.11	God raised Jesus, to make him alive again after his death. Now God's 
ROM.8.12	So, my Christian friends, we must not obey what our weak human thoughts tell us to do. We no longer have to live like that. 
ROM.8.13	If you agree to live in that way, you will die. Instead, you should let God's 
ROM.8.14	All those people who live with God's 
ROM.8.15	The 
ROM.8.16	God's 
ROM.8.17	Because we are God's children, we also know that we will receive good things from him. Those are the things that he has promised to give to his children. Together with Christ, we will receive the things that God has kept for him. That is true if we agree to have troubles like Christ did. Then we will also enjoy life in 
ROM.8.18	During this time now, we have troubles and pain. But I am sure that these troubles are not really very great. One day God will show us all the great things he has prepared for us. That will make the troubles that we have now seem very small. 
ROM.8.19	The whole 
ROM.8.20	God has caused everything in the 
ROM.8.21	At that time, the 
ROM.8.22	We know that everything in the 
ROM.8.23	It is the same for us who are 
ROM.8.24	Ever since God saved us, we have continued to wait for this to happen. One day, we will receive what we have hoped for. Then we will not need to hope for it any more. Nobody continues to hope for something that he has already. 
ROM.8.25	But we continue to hope for what we do not yet see. And so, we wait for it patiently.
ROM.8.26	God's 
ROM.8.27	God sees deep inside us, and he knows our thoughts. He understands what is in the mind of his 
ROM.8.28	We know that God works to help those people who love him. He uses everything that happens to them to bring something good. He does this for those people that he has chosen to 
ROM.8.29	God already had those people in his thoughts from the beginning. He decided that they should become like his Son. So then, his Son would have many younger brothers and sisters. 
ROM.8.30	God had already chosen those people to be his children. Because of that, he called them to come to him. He accepted those people as right with himself. And those that he accepted, he also caused them to become great.
ROM.8.31	So, because of all the things that God does for us, we can say this: If God is working on our behalf, nobody can really do anything against us. 
ROM.8.32	God did not even keep his own Son safe. Instead, he gave his Son to die on behalf of all of us. So certainly, God will continue to be kind to us. As well as his Son, he will give to us all things that we need. 
ROM.8.33	Nobody can say that God's people are 
ROM.8.34	So, nobody can say that God should still 
ROM.8.35	Christ will always continue to love us. Nothing can stop that! We may have troubles. Things may make us sad or afraid. People may do bad things to us. We may have no food or no clothes. There may be great danger. People may even try to kill us. But none of these things can stop Christ from loving us. 
ROM.8.36	As it says in the Bible:
ROM.8.36	‘Because we are your people, God,
ROM.8.36	people try to kill us all the time.
ROM.8.36	They think that we are like sheep
ROM.8.36	and we are ready to be killed.’ 
ROM.8.37	Because God loves us, none of these troubles can ever beat us. He makes us win against them. 
ROM.8.38+ROM.8.39	I am sure of this. Nothing can stop God from loving us. Death cannot do that. Life cannot do that. 
ROM.9.1	What I am telling you is true. I speak as someone who belongs to Christ. I am not telling 
ROM.9.2	I tell you this: I am very sad deep inside myself. I am always very 
ROM.9.3	I belong to the same family as they do. They are my own people. I really want them to believe in Christ too. If it would help them, I would even ask God to 
ROM.9.4	They are 
ROM.9.5	It was their 
ROM.9.6	God promised good things to Israel's people. But I am not saying that what God promised did not happen. It is clear that not all of Israel's people are God's true people. 
ROM.9.7	Not all of them are true 
ROM.9.8	This means that not all of Abraham's children are really God's children. It is only those children who were born as a result of God's promise. Only they are the people that God calls true 
ROM.9.9	This is what God promised to Abraham: ‘At this time next year I will come back. Then Sarah, your wife, will have a son.’ 
ROM.9.10	Remember this also: Later, Isaac's wife, Rebekah, gave birth to 
ROM.9.11	And God spoke to Rebekah before her sons were born. God spoke before the boys had done anything either good or bad. God did this to show clearly that he himself was choosing one child. He was not choosing someone because of what that person had done. He himself decided who he would choose. 
ROM.9.12	God said to Rebekah, ‘The older son will 
ROM.9.13	This is written in the Bible: ‘I loved Jacob, but I 
ROM.9.14	Because of this, someone might say that God is not fair. No! We should never say that! 
ROM.9.15	Think about this. God said to Moses, ‘I will be kind to whoever I choose to be kind to. I will feel sorry for whoever I choose to feel sorry for.’ 
ROM.9.16	So then, it is God who decides these things. It is not because of what people want. It is not because of what people do. It is because God chooses to be kind.
ROM.9.17	The Bible tells us what God said to 
ROM.9.18	So we see this: God is kind to some people and he 
ROM.9.19	One of you may say to me, ‘God always does what he wants to do. Nobody can change what God makes them do. So, God should not say that people have done wrong things.’ 
ROM.9.20	But you are only a human person. You have no authority to speak against God like that. God has made you. A pot cannot speak against the person who made it! It cannot ask him, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ 
ROM.9.21	Somebody who makes pots can choose to make any kind of pot. He can use the same piece of 
ROM.9.22	What does that teach us about God? Some people are like pots that are ready for God to destroy. God is angry with people like that. He is ready to show his power against them. But he has chosen to wait patiently. He keeps his 
ROM.9.23	Other people are like valuable pots that God has chosen to make. God wants to be kind to people like that. He wants to use them to show people how great he is. He has prepared them to be with him for a special party in 
ROM.9.24	We are those people! God has chosen us to be his people. It is not only 
ROM.9.25	God says this in the book of Hosea:
ROM.9.25	‘I will say to people who were not my people,
ROM.9.25	“Now you are my people.”
ROM.9.25	I will say to people that I did not love,
ROM.9.25	“I love you.” ’ 
ROM.9.26	‘God had said to them,
ROM.9.26	“You are not my people.”
ROM.9.26	In the same place where he said that,
ROM.9.26	people will now call them “Children of God, who lives for ever.” ’ 
ROM.9.27	Also, God's 
ROM.9.27	‘There are so many of Israel's people, nobody can count them.
ROM.9.27	They are as many as the bits of sand on the shore of the sea.
ROM.9.27	But God will save only a few of them.
ROM.9.28	The 
ROM.9.28	He has 
ROM.9.28	And he will 
ROM.9.29	Isaiah had already said this:
ROM.9.29	‘The 
ROM.9.29	If he had not done that, no 
ROM.9.29	We would have become like the people in Sodom and Gomorrah.’ 
ROM.9.30	So, we must think about what all this means. The 
ROM.9.31	But Israel's people tried to find a 
ROM.9.32	They failed because they refused to believe in Christ. Instead, they were trying to do certain things so that God would accept them. Because of that they fell to the ground. Their feet hit the stone which causes people to fall. 
ROM.9.33	It says this in the Bible:
ROM.9.33	‘Look, I am putting a special stone in 
ROM.9.33	That stone will cause people to fall to the ground.
ROM.9.33	It is a rock that will make them fall down.
ROM.9.33	But anyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.’ 
ROM.10.1	My Christian friends, I want God to save Israel's people. I want that very much. I pray to God that he will save them. 
ROM.10.2	I can say this about them: They really want to 
ROM.10.3	They have not understood the way that God accepts people. Instead, they tried to make their own way to become right with God. They refused to accept God's way that would make them right with him. 
ROM.10.4	God gave his 
ROM.10.5	Moses wrote about how God's 
ROM.10.6	But the Bible speaks also about another way. It shows how to become right with God because you 
ROM.10.7	‘Do not say to yourself either, “Someone will have to go down into the world below.” ’ (That means: ‘Someone will have to bring Christ up from the place where dead people are.’) 
ROM.10.8	But the Bible says: ‘God's message is near you. You can talk about it, and you can think about it.’ 
ROM.10.9	The message is this: You must say clearly that Jesus is the 
ROM.10.10	God accepts people as right with him when they believe like that, deep inside themselves. And when people say clearly that Jesus is 
ROM.10.11	It says in the Bible:
ROM.10.11	‘Everyone who believes in him will not be disappointed.’ 
ROM.10.12	It says ‘everyone’. There is no difference between 
ROM.10.13	As it says in the Bible: ‘The 
ROM.10.14	But people will never ask Christ to help them if they have not believed in him. And they will never believe in him if they have not heard about him. And they will not hear about him unless somebody tells God's message to them. 
ROM.10.15	And nobody can go to tell God's message to people unless God sends them. This is written in the Bible: ‘When people arrive to tell us good news, we say “welcome!” ’ 
ROM.10.16	But not every person who hears the good news obeys its message. Isaiah said this: ‘
ROM.10.17	So then, people must hear the message before they can 
ROM.10.18	Let me ask you this: ‘Did Israel's people hear that message?’ They certainly did! The Bible says:
ROM.10.18	‘People have spoken God's message everywhere.
ROM.10.18	People have heard his message in every part of the world.’ 
ROM.10.19	So, I ask this too: ‘When Israel's people heard God's message, did they understand it?’ First, think about what Moses wrote. God said to Israel's people:
ROM.10.19	‘I will make you 
ROM.10.19	I will make you angry because of people who know nothing about me.’ 
ROM.10.20	Also, this is what Isaiah said very bravely:
ROM.10.20	‘God says: Those people who were not looking for me have found me.
ROM.10.20	I showed myself to people who were not even asking about me. ’ 
ROM.10.21	But Isaiah says this about Israel's people:
ROM.10.21	‘God says: For a very long time,
ROM.10.21	I have been asking my people to return to me.
ROM.10.21	But they refused to obey me.
ROM.10.21	They turned against me.’ 
ROM.11.1	So, I ask this: ‘Has God turned away from his people?’ No, certainly, he has not done that! I myself belong to Israel's people. I am a 
ROM.11.2	God chose who would be his people from the beginning. He has not turned against them now. Remember what the Bible tells us about Elijah. He wanted God to 
ROM.11.3	‘
ROM.11.4	This was God's answer to Elijah: ‘There are still 7000 men that I have kept for myself. Those men have not 
ROM.11.5	It is the same at this time also. There is a small number of Israel's people that God has chosen to 
ROM.11.6	This shows that God has not chosen them because of any good things that they have done. If that was true, we could not say that God was really being kind to them. It would not be his gift.
ROM.11.7	So, we can say this: Israel's people did not all find what they were looking for. Only those people that God had chosen received it. But the other people of Israel became unable to understand God's message. 
ROM.11.8	It says this in the Bible:
ROM.11.8	‘God caused them to be like people who are sleeping.
ROM.11.8	Even until this day, their eyes cannot really see,
ROM.11.8	and their ears cannot really hear.’ 
ROM.11.9	King David says this:
ROM.11.9	‘They enjoy eating lots of good food together.
ROM.11.9	I pray that God will catch them while they are eating!
ROM.11.9	I want those good things to lead them into trouble.
ROM.11.9	I want God to 
ROM.11.10	I want their eyes to become dark so that they cannot see.
ROM.11.10	I want their bodies always to be in pain, like slaves.’ 
ROM.11.11	So, now I ask this: ‘When Israel's people failed to accept Jesus as God's 
ROM.11.12	Because of their mistake, God has done good things for everyone in the world. Israel's people failed to receive what God wanted to give them. As a result, the 
ROM.11.13	Now I am speaking to you who are 
ROM.11.14	I hope that my work among you 
ROM.11.15	When God turned away from Israel's people, he then accepted other people in the world as his friends. So, when God does accept Israel's people, the result will be even better! It will be like dead people who have become alive again!
ROM.11.16	If you offer the first piece of bread to God, then all the bread will belong to God. If the 
ROM.11.17	Israel's people are like an 
ROM.11.18	Israel's people are like the branches that God broke off. But you must not think that you are better than those branches. Remember that you are still only a branch. You do not make the 
ROM.11.19	You might say, ‘God broke off the branches so that I could become part of the tree.’ 
ROM.11.20	That is true. God broke them off because they did not believe in Christ. God has accepted you as part of the tree because you do believe in Christ. So, do not become 
ROM.11.21	God broke off the proper branches and he did not let them stay in the tree. So, if you no longer 
ROM.11.22	So, you should think about what God is like. He is kind, but he also 
ROM.11.23	God is able to accept Israel's people back again. If they come to believe in Christ, God will put them back as part of the tree. He is able to make them become branches of the tree again. 
ROM.11.24	God cut you like branches from a wild 
ROM.11.25	My Christian friends, I want to help you to understand about Israel's people. It is a secret that God has shown to us. If you really understand it, you will not be 
ROM.11.26	When that has happened, God will save all Israel's people. This is written in the Bible:
ROM.11.26	‘The one who 
ROM.11.26	He will turn Jacob's people away from their 
ROM.11.27	And I will make this 
ROM.11.27	I will 
ROM.11.28	Israel's people have become God's enemies, because they have refused to believe the good news about Christ. This has happened in order to help you 
ROM.11.29	God's thoughts about his people cannot change. He has 
ROM.11.30	In past times, you 
ROM.11.31	They do not obey God now. As a result God has been very kind to you. That has happened so that God may now be very kind to them also. 
ROM.11.32	God says that everyone is 
ROM.11.33	Yes! God is very great! He has everything! He knows and he understands all things! Nobody can completely understand the things that he decides. Nobody can explain the ways in which he works. 
ROM.11.34	The Bible says this:
ROM.11.34	‘Nobody knows the thoughts of the 
ROM.11.34	Nobody is able to tell him what he should do.’ 
ROM.11.35	‘Nobody has ever given anything to God,
ROM.11.35	so that God had a debt to pay back to them.’ 
ROM.11.36	It is God who made all things. He also causes all things to continue. And all things are there to show how great he is.
ROM.11.36	We praise him! He is great for ever! Amen. This is true!
ROM.12.1	My Christian friends, God has been very kind to us. Because of that, I really want you to 
ROM.12.2	Do not become like the people who belong to this world. But let God completely change the way that you think, so that you live differently. Then you will understand what God wants you to do. You will know what is good. You will know what 
ROM.12.3	God has been kind to me so that I can 
ROM.12.4	Each part of our body works in a different way. But all the parts belong to our one body. 
ROM.12.5	In the same way, we are many people but we all belong to Christ, like one body. We also belong to each other, like the different parts of one body belong to each other.
ROM.12.6	God has been kind to us. He has given to each of us different gifts so that we can 
ROM.12.7	God helps some people to 
ROM.12.8	If God has helped you to make others strong, then you should do that. If God has helped you to 
ROM.12.9	Really love other people, not like a 
ROM.12.10	Love each other truly like brothers and sisters. Be really happy to respect other Christians. 
ROM.12.11	Do not be lazy, but always work hard. 
ROM.12.12	Be happy, because you can 
ROM.12.13	If any of God's people need anything, then help them with what you have. Always be happy to let people stay in your home.
ROM.12.14	Ask God to 
ROM.12.15	If you are with someone who is happy, you be happy also. If you are with someone who is sad, you also should be sad. 
ROM.12.16	Always try to agree and to be friends with each other. Do not be proud. Be friends with people who are not important. Do not think that you know everything.
ROM.12.17	If someone has done bad things against you, do not do bad things back to them. Try to live in a good way so that people will 
ROM.12.18	If it is possible, try always to be friends with other people. 
ROM.12.19	My friends, if someone has done bad things to you, do not try to 
ROM.12.19	‘The 
ROM.12.19	I am the one who will 
ROM.12.19	I will pay them back.” ’
ROM.12.20	But the Bible also says this:
ROM.12.20	‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him.
ROM.12.20	If he is 
ROM.12.20	If help your enemies, they will be ashamed.
ROM.12.20	He will become sorry because of what he did to you.’
ROM.12.21	Do not let bad things win against you! Instead, do good things. Then you will win against the bad things that people do.
ROM.13.1	Everyone must obey the authority of the government. It is God who gives the authority to rule. The people who rule have received their authority from God. 
ROM.13.2	So, anyone who refuses to obey that authority is refusing to obey God. That person will receive the proper 
ROM.13.3	People who do good things do not need to be afraid of the rulers. Only people who do bad things should be afraid of the rulers. Do you want to live and not be afraid of the rulers? Then you must do good things and they will 
ROM.13.4	Rulers are God's servants. They help you to do good things. But if you do bad things, then you should be afraid of them. They really do have authority to 
ROM.13.5	So, you must obey those people who rule. You must obey them not only so that they do not 
ROM.13.6	This is also the reason why you pay 
ROM.13.7	So, you must give to each person what you ought to give them. Pay 
ROM.13.8	Always pay your debts to people. The only debt that you should have is to love each other. Anyone who loves other people has obeyed God's 
ROM.13.9	The rules in God's 
ROM.13.10	If you love other people, you will never do anything bad to them. So, anyone who loves other people has obeyed God's 
ROM.13.11	Live in that way, because you know what is happening in this time now. It is time that you should stop sleeping. It is now time to wake up. The time when God will save us completely is near. That time is nearer now than when we first believed in him. 
ROM.13.12	The night has nearly finished and the day is almost here. So, we must stop doing the bad things that belong to the dark. Instead, we must take 
ROM.13.13	We should live in a good way, because we live in the light of day. We should not go to wild parties. We must not be drunks. We must not have sex with anyone who is not our own wife or husband. We must not do wrong things with our bodies. We must not quarrel. We must not be 
ROM.13.14	Instead, you must live with the 
ROM.14.1	It is difficult for some Christians to 
ROM.14.2	Some people believe that they may eat all kinds of food. But other people are not so sure, so they eat only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	People who eat anything must not think that they are better than people who eat only vegetables. Also, people who eat only vegetables must not 
ROM.14.4	God is the master of all 
ROM.14.5	Some people think that certain days are special and more important than other days. Other people think that all days are the same. Each person should decide what seems right to him. 
ROM.14.6	A person who makes a certain day special does that in order to 
ROM.14.7	None of us lives only to 
ROM.14.8	While we live, we want to 
ROM.14.9	Christ died and then he became alive again. That happened so that he could be the 
ROM.14.10	So then, if you eat only vegetables, you must not 
ROM.14.11	This is written in the Bible:
ROM.14.11	‘The 
ROM.14.11	“As surely as I live, this will certainly happen:
ROM.14.11	Everyone will go down on their knees in front of me.
ROM.14.11	Everyone will 
ROM.14.12	So, each of us will have to explain to God about the things that we have done.
ROM.14.13	So, we must no longer 
ROM.14.14	As for me, I am sure that we may eat any kind of food. God does not think that any food is 
ROM.14.15	You should not cause another 
ROM.14.16	You may think that something is good. But still you should not do it, if other people will say that it is bad.
ROM.14.17	We belong to God's people and he is our King. The things that we eat and drink are not really important to him. This is important: We should do what is right. We should have 
ROM.14.18	If anyone 
ROM.14.19	So then, we should try to live in a way that brings 
ROM.14.20	Do not bring trouble to someone because of the food that you eat. Do not destroy what God has done in the life of another 
ROM.14.21	It is good not to do anything that might cause another believer to do something wrong. That includes if you eat meat or if you drink 
ROM.14.22	What you believe about these things should be a secret between yourself and God. You should do what you have decided is right for you. Do not feel 
ROM.14.23	But someone else may not be sure whether it is right to eat certain kinds of food. If that person does eat that kind of food, then he shows that he is 
ROM.15.1	Some of us 
ROM.15.2	Instead, each of us should do things that will make other 
ROM.15.3	Even Christ did not just do things that would make himself happy. It is written in the Bible that he said this: ‘People have 
ROM.15.4	Everything that people wrote in the Bible in past times is there to teach us something. Those words help us to be patient and strong. As a result, we can 
ROM.15.5	It is God himself who helps us to be patient and strong. So I pray that he will help you to agree with each other and to be friends. That is how Christ Jesus wants you to live. 
ROM.15.6	As a result, all of you will 
ROM.15.7	Christ has accepted you, so you must accept each other. In that way you will be 
ROM.15.8	Remember this: Christ became a servant of the 
ROM.15.9	The

ROM.15.9	I will

ROM.15.10	‘Be very happy, you 
ROM.15.11	It says this also:
ROM.15.11	‘Say how great the 
ROM.15.11	All people, from every country, should say how great he is.’ 
ROM.15.12	God's 
ROM.15.12	‘The 
ROM.15.12	He will come to rule the 
ROM.15.12	The 
ROM.15.13	God is the one who causes us to hope for good things. I pray that God will 
ROM.15.14	My Christian friends, I myself am completely sure that you are always good. You know everything about God's message, so that you are able to teach one another what is right. 
ROM.15.15	I know that is true, but I still needed to write this letter to you. I have written to you strongly, so that you would remember certain things. Because God is kind, he has chosen me to 
ROM.15.16	I am a servant of Christ Jesus among the 
ROM.15.17	So, I can be 
ROM.15.18	But I will only speak about the work that Christ has made me able to do. I have lived among the 
ROM.15.19	God's 
ROM.15.20	I want to go to places where nobody has ever told people about Christ before. I want to tell the good news to people in those places. That is what I have always wanted to do. I do not want to work in a place where someone else has already started to teach God's message. 
ROM.15.21	This is written in the Bible about God's 
ROM.15.21	‘Those people that nobody ever told them about him will now see.
ROM.15.21	Those people who have never heard about him will now understand.’ 
ROM.15.22	That is why, many times, I have not had a chance to visit you. 
ROM.15.23	For many years I have been waiting for the chance to come. But now I have finished my work in these places here. 
ROM.15.24	So, I hope to visit you while I am travelling to Spain. I will stay with you in Rome for a short time. I will really enjoy having some time together with you there. Then you can help me to continue my journey.
ROM.15.25	But now, I am ready to go to Jerusalem so that I can help God's people there. 
ROM.15.26	Some of them are poor, and the Christians in Macedonia and Achaia wanted to help them. So, they got some money to send to those people. 
ROM.15.27	The Christians in Macedonia and Achaia were happy to 
ROM.15.28	So, I must take their gift safely to the Christians in Jerusalem. When I have finished that job, I will come to visit you. Then I will continue my journey to Spain. 
ROM.15.29	When I visit you, I know that Christ will 
ROM.15.30	My Christian friends, please pray for me as I do this difficult work. Together we belong to our 
ROM.15.31	Pray that God will keep me safe from those people in Judea who have refused to believe in Jesus. Pray also that God's people at Jerusalem will happily accept the gift that I am taking to them. 
ROM.15.32	If God agrees, I will then be able to come to you, and we will be happy together. I will enjoy having some rest while I stay there with you. 
ROM.15.33	I pray that God will give you 
ROM.16.1	I want you to know that our Christian friend Phoebe is a good person. She works to help the group of Christians at Cenchrea. 
ROM.16.2	Please be kind to her when she comes to you, because you belong to the 
ROM.16.3	Say ‘hello’ on my behalf to Priscilla and Aquila. They have worked together with me as servants of Christ Jesus. 
ROM.16.4	They were even ready to die in order to help me. So I have a good reason to thank them. All the groups of 
ROM.16.5	Also say ‘hello’ for me to the group of 
ROM.16.5	Say ‘hello’ to my very good friend Epenetus. He was the first person in 
ROM.16.6	Say ‘hello’ to Mary, who has worked very much on your behalf. 
ROM.16.7	Say ‘hello’ to my 
ROM.16.8	Say ‘hello’ to Ampliatus on my behalf. He is my very good friend in the 
ROM.16.9	Say ‘hello’ to Urbanus, who works with us to 
ROM.16.10	Say ‘hello’ to Apelles. He has shown that he 
ROM.16.11	Say ‘hello’ to my 
ROM.16.12	Say ‘hello’ to Tryphena and Tryphosa. They work hard to 
ROM.16.13	Say ‘hello’ to Rufus. He is a special servant of the 
ROM.16.14	Say ‘hello’ to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas and Hermas. Say ‘hello’ also to all our Christian friends who are there with them. 
ROM.16.15	Say ‘hello’ to Philologus and Julia, to Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas. Say ‘hello’ also to all God's people who are there with them.
ROM.16.16	When you meet each other, kiss each other as Christian brothers and sisters. The people of all the Christian 
ROM.16.17	My Christian friends, I want to tell you something important. Be very careful about people who teach wrong things. They teach things that are different from God's true message that you learned. Those people cause you to quarrel with each other. They cause people to turn away from God. You must stay away from them. 
ROM.16.18	People who are like that are not servants of our 
ROM.16.19	Everyone knows that you obey God well. So, I am very happy because of you. But I want you to understand clearly what things are good. And I want you to stay away from the things that are bad. 
ROM.16.20	God gives us 
ROM.16.21	Timothy, who is working together with me, says ‘hello’ to you. My 
ROM.16.22	I am Tertius, and I have written down this letter for Paul. I also belong to the 
ROM.16.23	Gaius says ‘hello’ to you also. I, Paul, am staying in his house. The group of Christians here also meet together in his house. Erastus also says ‘hello’ to you. He is an officer who takes 
ROM.16.23	[
ROM.16.24	I pray that our 
ROM.16.25	We 
ROM.16.26	God's 
ROM.16.27	Yes, we 
1CO.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an 
1CO.1.2	I am sending this letter to you, the people of the 
1CO.1.3	I pray that God, our Father, and the 
1CO.1.4	I thank God always because of you. I thank him because he has been so very kind to you. He has given such great things to you because he has made you join to Christ Jesus. 
1CO.1.5	And, as a result, Christ has made you really like rich people in every way. You are like rich people because you can do many things. Christ has made you able to speak as he wants you to speak. And he has made you able to know everything that he wants you to know. 
1CO.1.6	God has made our message about Christ clear in you who believe it. 
1CO.1.7	You are not without any of God's gifts while you continue to wait for our 
1CO.1.8	God will cause you to continue believing him until the end. Then, on the day when our 
1CO.1.9	God always does what he has promised to do. And God has chosen you to know Christ. He has made you join to his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our 
1CO.1.10	My Christian friends, I speak to you with the authority of our 
1CO.1.11	Some people from Chloe's house have told me what is happening among you, my friends. They say that you are quarrelling among yourselves. 
1CO.1.12	I will explain: One of you says, ‘Paul is my leader.’ Another person says, ‘Apollos is my leader.’ Another person says, ‘Peter is my leader.’ And another person says, ‘Christ is my leader.’
1CO.1.13	When you speak like that, it is bad. It is as if you are breaking Christ into several parts. Certainly, I, Paul, did not die on a 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I did not 
1CO.1.15	So, none of you can say, ‘Paul is my leader because he 
1CO.1.16	(Oh yes, I remember that I 
1CO.1.17	Christ did not send me to 
1CO.1.18	People who are far from God cannot understand that message about Christ's death on the 
1CO.1.19	It says in the Bible:
1CO.1.19	‘I will destroy all the clever thoughts of clever people.
1CO.1.19	I will refuse the ideas of people who seem to understand a lot.’
1CO.1.20	So then, the clever people in this world are not great really. The clever teachers of God's 
1CO.1.21	God has his own great thoughts and ideas. And he has made it impossible for people to know him by their own thoughts and ideas. Instead, God uses that message about Jesus. He uses it to save everyone who believes it. And we tell that same message to everyone, even if it seems crazy.
1CO.1.23	But as for us, we talk about how Christ died on a 
1CO.1.24	But all of us whom God has chosen, both 
1CO.1.25	It seems to be a crazy thing for God to do. But it is better than the cleverest human thoughts and ideas. What seems to be God's weakness is stronger than any human 
1CO.1.26	Christian friends, remember when God spoke to you. Remember what you were like then. Most of you were not clever or powerful. Most of you did not come from rich or important families. 
1CO.1.27	People think that you are not great or important. But God chose you. He did this so that clever people would be ashamed. Yes, God chose the weak people in the world so that the powerful people would be ashamed. 
1CO.1.28	God chose people who do not seem important in this world. He chose people who seem silly in this world. He chose people who seem to be worth nothing in this world. The people who do not know God think differently from him. They think that different kinds of people are great and important. But God destroys their ideas when he chooses his people.
1CO.1.29	So, because of all this, nobody can say in front of God: ‘I am better than other people.’ 
1CO.1.30	It is God who has made you join to Christ Jesus. And, because of Christ, God causes us to know everything that he wants us to know. As a result of what Christ did, God makes us right with himself. Also he makes us his own special people. He makes us his free people, that he has bought. 
1CO.1.31	So now, as it says in the Bible:
1CO.1.31	‘Anyone who wants to speak about great or important things should speak about the 
1CO.1.31	That person should not speak about himself, nor about the things that he himself has done.
1CO.1.31	Instead, he should speak only about the great things that the 
1CO.2.1	Christian friends, I came to tell you God's message, which is certainly true. I did not use clever words when I told it to you. I did not use great thoughts and ideas that were my own. 
1CO.2.2	I decided to teach you only about Jesus Christ. I wanted to forget everything else while I was with you. So, I taught only about Jesus. I taught you about how he died on a 
1CO.2.3	I was feeling very weak when I arrived. I was so afraid that I was trembling. 
1CO.2.4	Neither clever words nor my own thoughts and ideas made you believe that my message was true. No, instead God's Spirit showed by my words how powerful God is. 
1CO.2.5	So, you believe because of God's 
1CO.2.6	But we do speak about great ideas to those of you who really know Christ. We do not speak about clever human thoughts and ideas that belong to this world. The rulers of this world think thoughts and ideas like that, but they will stop being powerful soon. 
1CO.2.7	No, the great ideas that we speak about are secret. They belong to God. He hid them from the people who belong to this world. But he decided to show these secrets to us so that we could live with him always. He decided this before he made the world. 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this world understood these great ideas. If they had understood, they would not have killed the 
1CO.2.9	It says in the Bible:
1CO.2.9	‘Nobody ever saw or heard anything about this.
1CO.2.9	Nobody ever thought that it could happen.
1CO.2.9	But this is the thing that God has prepared for his people.
1CO.2.9	He has prepared it for those people who love him.’
1CO.2.10	But God has shown these secrets to us by his Spirit. God's Spirit looks at everything. He looks even at the things that are deep in God. 
1CO.2.11	Only a person's own 
1CO.2.12	We have not received the 
1CO.2.13	These are the things that we speak about. We do not use human ideas that other people have taught us. Instead, we use ideas that God's Spirit teaches us. That is why we can explain God's ideas to people. But we can explain only to people in whom God's Spirit is living.
1CO.2.14	If God's Spirit is not living inside people, they cannot receive anything from God. They cannot understand what God wants to teach them. They think that it is crazy. They think that it is worth nothing. 
1CO.2.15	Only people with God's Spirit inside them can really understand and decide about all things. But people without God's Spirit cannot understand anything about God's people. 
1CO.2.16	As it says in the Bible:
1CO.2.16	‘Nobody can know what the 
1CO.2.16	Nobody can teach him anything.’
1CO.2.16	But we can think as Christ thinks.
1CO.3.1	Christian friends, in past times, I could not talk to you as I wanted to talk. I should have been able to talk to you as people who understand things by God's Spirit. But instead, I could only talk to you as people who understand things about this world. You were like babies because you did not understand very much about Christ. 
1CO.3.2	I had to give milk to you, instead of proper food, because you were not ready to receive proper food. You are not ready for it even now! 
1CO.3.3	You are still living like people who do not know God. You want things that other people have. And you quarrel with each other. This shows that you are not like God's people. You are still like people who do not know God. 
1CO.3.4	One of you says, ‘Paul is my leader.’ And another person says, ‘Apollos is my leader.’ With words like these, you are talking like people who do not know God.
1CO.3.5	You should know that we, Apollos and Paul, are not important really. God used us as his servants, who could help you to believe Christ. The 
1CO.3.6	I was like a servant who planted seeds. Apollos was like the servant who gave water to the young plants. But it was God who caused the seeds and the plants to grow. 
1CO.3.7	The servant who plants the seeds is not important really. The servant who gives water to the plants is not important really. The important person is God, because he causes the plants to grow. 
1CO.3.8	The person who plants is doing God's work. The person who gives water is doing God's work also. We are equal servants. And God will pay each of us what is right because of our own work. 
1CO.3.9	We work together with God. You are like God's field and you are like God's building.
1CO.3.10	God has made me able to work for him like a very good builder. So, I built the 
1CO.3.11	God has already put Jesus Christ as the only 
1CO.3.12	People may build on this 
1CO.3.13	But God will show how good each person's work is. He will show it on the day when Christ returns. There will be a fire on that day and God will put each person's work into the fire. The fire will show whether the work is good or not. 
1CO.3.14	If the fire does not destroy the work, then the work is good. So, the person who did it will receive good things from God. 
1CO.3.15	But if the fire destroys the work, then the work is not good. The person who did that work will lose it. God will still save that person. But that person will be like someone who must run through the fire to a safe place.
1CO.3.16	You ought to know that you yourselves are God's house. You ought to know that God's Spirit lives in you. 
1CO.3.17	God's house belongs only to God. So, God will destroy anyone who destroys God's house. And you yourselves are God's house.
1CO.3.18	Nobody should think things about himself that are not really true. The people in this world who do not know God think differently from God. Maybe one of you thinks like them, that you are a very clever person. But instead, you should be ready for other people to think that you are a fool. Then you will really be clever. 
1CO.3.19	The people in this world think that their ideas are very clever. But God thinks that they are crazy. It says in the Bible:
1CO.3.19	‘People may try to show that they themselves are very clever.
1CO.3.19	But God causes those people to become confused.’
1CO.3.20	In another place, the Bible says:
1CO.3.20	‘The 
1CO.3.21	So, nobody should think that clever or great people are important really. Do not think like that, because all things are yours. 
1CO.3.22	Paul, Apollos and Peter, all of us are yours. All of this world is yours. While you live, all things are yours. And when you die, all things are yours. Both today and tomorrow are yours, because all things are yours. 
1CO.3.23	And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
1CO.4.1	You should think about us, who are special workers and teachers on Christ's behalf, as Christ's servants. God has given a special job to us. He has shown his secrets to us and now we must explain them to other people. 
1CO.4.2	A servant must remember all the things that his master wants him to do every day. He must do all those things, because his master wants him to do them.
1CO.4.3	But it is not important to me how you think about me. You may decide about how good I am. It does not matter to me what people decide about me. I do not even try to decide about myself. 
1CO.4.4	I may think that I have not done any wrong things. But that does not make me right. Only the 
1CO.4.5	So, you should not decide about things before the right time comes. You must wait until the 
1CO.4.6	Now, my Christian friends, I want to help you to understand better everything that I have said. I have used Apollos and myself as examples. So then you can learn by us what this means: ‘Obey what it says in the Bible.’ None of you should say that one person is more valuable than any other person. 
1CO.4.7	You yourselves are no better than other people. God gave everything that you have to you. You know that. What you have was a gift. So, you should not think that you are more important than anyone else. You have no reason to think that.
1CO.4.8	You have plenty of everything already! You think that you are very rich already! So, you are ready to rule like kings, even while we are not rulers at all! I would really like you to be rulers, so that we could rule together with you! 
1CO.4.9	God sent us, his special workers, to teach his message to people. But I think that he has given the least important place to us. We are like 
1CO.4.10	People think that we are fools because of Christ. But you think that you yourselves understand so much! You think that, because you are 
1CO.4.11	Until this day, we are often hungry, and we are often 
1CO.4.12	We work very much, so that we are very tired. When people say bad things about us, we ask God to be good to them. When people are cruel to us, we are patient and brave. 
1CO.4.13	When people say cruel words about us, we answer with kind words. Until this day, we are like the dirt of the whole world. We are like the dirty things that people throw away.
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to make you ashamed. You are like my own children that I love. And I want to explain to you why you are wrong. I want you to understand correctly. 
1CO.4.15	I told the good news to you, so I became like a father to you. You belong to Christ now. And even if you have ten thousand guides to help you, you do not have many fathers. 
1CO.4.16	That is why I ask you to copy my example. 
1CO.4.17	For this reason, I am sending Timothy to visit you. He is like a son to me, and I love him very much. He continues always to believe the 
1CO.4.18	Some of you think that I will never come to visit you. You think that you yourselves are very important and powerful. You think that you know everything. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to visit you soon, if the 
1CO.4.20	When people are really obeying God as their king, it shows. We can see it because God's people live by his 
1CO.4.21	Certainly, I will come to visit you. So, you must choose what I come to do. I might come to be angry with you and to 
1CO.5.1	We have heard very bad news about what is happening in your group. One of you is having sex with someone who is not his own wife. We have heard that he is having sex with his own father's wife! Even people who do not know God do not do things as bad as this! 
1CO.5.2	But, you still think that you are important and good! Instead, you ought to be very ashamed and sad. You must put this man, who has done this bad thing, outside your meetings. You should not let him continue to belong to your group.
1CO.5.3	Even if I am far away from you, my 
1CO.5.4	When you meet together with the authority of the 
1CO.5.5	When you meet like this, you must give this man to 
1CO.5.6	You should not think that you yourselves are so good and so important. You have no reason to think that. You should know about what 
1CO.5.7	This 
1CO.5.8	So, we can have our 
1CO.5.9	I wrote a letter to you. In that letter, I told you that you must not be friends with bad people. You must stay away from people who have sex with anyone other than their own wife or husband. I told you that. 
1CO.5.10	But I did not mean people who do not know God. I did not mean that you must stay away from all those people. Some of those people often have sex with people who are not their own wife or husband. Some of them want more things than they need. Some of them take things that belong to other people. And some of them 
1CO.5.11	What I meant was this: You should not be friends with any bad person among your group. That person may say that they are Christ's. But if they have sex with people other than their own wife or husband, do not be friends with them. Some people want a lot more things than they need. Do not be friends with those people. If they 
1CO.5.12	It is not right for me to decide about the people outside, the people who do not believe Christ. But you should decide about the people inside, the people who meet together with you as Christians. It is right for you to decide whether they are right or wrong. 
1CO.5.13	But God will decide about the people outside, who are not Christians. As the Bible says:
1CO.5.13	‘You must send that bad person away from among yourselves.’
1CO.6.1	Perhaps one of you does not agree with another Christian about something that matters. But you should not go for help to people who do not know God. No! Instead, you should go to God's people. And you should ask them to decide about this thing. 
1CO.6.2	You should know that God's people will decide about all the people in the world one day. So, if you will decide about the world, certainly you should be able to decide about small things among yourselves. 
1CO.6.3	You should know that we will even 
1CO.6.4	Sometimes you may not agree among yourselves about things that belong to our lives here on earth. But when that happens, do not go to people who do not belong to the 
1CO.6.5	I say this so that you will feel ashamed. Certainly, there should be one person in your group who understands enough to decide about things like this between 
1CO.6.6	But instead, you have let 
1CO.6.7	When you do this, you are completely wrong. You should not go to people in the government to argue with each other. It would be better to let other people do wrong things to you. Even if people rob you, that would be better. 
1CO.6.8	Instead, you yourselves do wrong things, and you do those things to other 
1CO.6.9	God has prepared good things for his own people that he rules over. But he will never let any bad person receive those good things. You ought to know this. You can be very sure that no kind of bad person will receive those good things. People who have sex with anyone other than their own wife or husband will not receive them. People who 
1CO.6.10	People who rob will not receive them. Some people want more than they need. Those people will not receive them. Drunks will not receive them. People who say wrong things about other people will not receive them. People who are not honest about other people's things will not receive those good things either. God has prepared things for his own people that he rules over. But no bad people will ever receive those things. 
1CO.6.11	Some of you did bad things like this. But the Spirit of our God has washed you clean with the 
1CO.6.12	One of you may say: ‘I am free to do anything. I can do anything that I want to do.’ But not everything will help you. I myself could say: ‘I am free. I can do whatever things I want to do.’ Yes, but I will not let anything rule over me. 
1CO.6.13	Someone else may say: ‘Food is there for the stomach. So the stomach is there for me to fill it with food.’ Yes, but God will destroy both the stomach and the food. The 
1CO.6.14	God raised the 
1CO.6.15	You ought to know that your bodies are parts of Christ's body. So, you must never take your body and make it part of a 
1CO.6.16	Anyone who makes his own body join to a 
1CO.6.16	‘The man and the woman become like one body.’ 
1CO.6.17	But everyone who is 
1CO.6.18	So, do not have sex with anyone who is not your own wife or husband. Be careful never to do that. Any other bad thing that you do is outside your own body. But if you have sex with the wrong person, you do something wrong to your own body. 
1CO.6.19	Your body is the home of God's Spirit, who is completely good and separate from everything bad. You should know that. God gave his Spirit to you and he lives in you. You do not belong to yourselves any longer. But you belong to God, 
1CO.6.20	because God bought you. He paid the price for you. So, show how great and how good God is. Use your body to show that.
1CO.7.1	You wrote to ask me about certain things. And now I will answer your questions. Yes, it is a good thing when a man does not marry. 
1CO.7.2	Many people have sex with other people who are not their own wife or husband. But you must be careful never to do that. So, every man should have his own wife and every woman should have her own husband.
1CO.7.3	The husband should have sex with his wife to make her happy. He should do that because it is his duty. And the wife should do the same thing for her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not rule over her own body, but her husband rules over it. In the same way, the husband does not rule over his own body, but his wife rules over it. 
1CO.7.5	Do not refuse to have sex with each other, unless both of you agree to stop for a short time. So then you can use your time to pray. But you should come together again soon. You need each other so that 
1CO.7.6	I am not saying that you must do this. No, but I am saying that you can do it. You can stop like this for a short time if you want. 
1CO.7.7	It would be good if all of you could be like me. But each person has his own gift from God. One person has a gift to do a certain thing. And another person has a different gift.
1CO.7.8	Now I want to say something to those of you who have not married yet. Also, I am speaking to those of you whose husbands or wives have died. It is better for all of you to continue alone. That is what I do myself. 
1CO.7.9	But if you cannot rule yourselves well, then you should marry. It is better for you to marry. That is better than to always want sex very much.
1CO.7.10	I speak now to people who have married. I tell you a rule that comes from the 
1CO.7.11	But if she does leave, she must continue to be alone. Or she must go back to stay with her husband. And a husband must not send his wife away.
1CO.7.12	To you other people, I myself say this. The 
1CO.7.13	If a Christian woman's husband does not believe Christ, she must not send him away. He may agree to continue living with her. Then she must not send him away. 
1CO.7.14	God accepts a husband who does not believe Christ. God accepts him because of his Christian wife. Also, God accepts a wife who does not believe Christ. God accepts her because of her Christian husband. If this was not true, God would not accept your children. But God does accept them, because to him they are clean.
1CO.7.15	But the husband or wife who does not believe Christ may want to leave. If they want to do that, let them leave. Then the Christian man or woman does not have a duty to make them stay. God does not want us to fight with each other. 
1CO.7.16	Perhaps, Christian wife, you will save your husband. Or perhaps, Christian husband, you will save your wife.
1CO.7.17	Each one of you has what the 
1CO.7.18	Some of you are 
1CO.7.19	It is not important whether someone has 
1CO.7.20	At a certain time, God chose to speak to you so that you came to Christ. So, each of you should continue as you were then. 
1CO.7.21	You may have been a slave when God spoke to you. That does not matter. But you may have the chance to become a free person. If you do, then use it. 
1CO.7.22	Sometimes the 
1CO.7.23	God has bought you and he has paid the price for you. So, do not let anyone else make you their slave. 
1CO.7.24	My friends, who are like brothers to me, each one of you should live for God. He put you where you were. Then he spoke to you. So, each of you should continue as you were then.
1CO.7.25	Now I want to answer your question about people who have not married. The 
1CO.7.26	It is very difficult to live in the world today. So, it is better that each man continues as he is. That is what I think. 
1CO.7.27	If you have a wife, you should continue like that. If you do not have a wife, do not look for one. 
1CO.7.28	But if you do marry, that is not wrong. And if a young woman marries, that is not wrong. But those people who marry will have many troubles during their life together in this world. And I want to save you from that kind of trouble.
1CO.7.29	My friends, what I mean is this: The end of time will come soon. So, those men with wives should live as if they had none. 
1CO.7.30	Some of you weep. But you should live as if you were not sad. Some of you laugh because you are happy. But you should live as if you were not happy. Some of you buy things. But you should live as if you did not have those things. 
1CO.7.31	Some of you are busy with things in this world. But you should live as if these things were not important. This world, as it is now, will finish.
1CO.7.32	I want all of you to be free so that you are not thinking about problems and troubles. A Christian man who has not married thinks a lot about the 
1CO.7.33	But a Christian man who has married is different. He thinks also about the things that belong to this world. He thinks like that because he wants to make his wife happy too. 
1CO.7.34	So, these things make him think in two opposite ways. Also, a Christian woman or young girl who has not married thinks a lot about the 
1CO.7.35	I am saying this because I want to help you. I am not trying to make rules that you have to obey. Instead, I want you to live in a right and proper way. I want you to be the 
1CO.7.36	Perhaps a man and a woman among you love each other but they have decided not to marry. They have agreed to wait. But, as they grow older, the man may begin to think differently. He may think that he cannot wait any longer. He may think that he needs to marry her. Then, if they want to marry, it is not wrong. 
1CO.7.37	But another man among you may decide that he will never marry his young woman. He may be sure that he does not need to marry. He may be able to rule himself strongly, with authority. So, he need not marry her. He is doing the right thing also. 
1CO.7.38	So, the man who marries does a good thing. But the man who does not marry does a better thing.
1CO.7.39	If a woman has married a man, he is her husband. She is not free to marry anyone else all the time that her husband is alive. But if he dies, then she is free. Then she can marry again. But she must marry someone who is the 
1CO.7.40	Even so, she would be happier if she continued without a husband. That is what I myself think. And I think that God's Spirit is my guide in all this.
1CO.8.1	Now I want to answer your question about food that people have offered to false gods. We know that all of us know about many things. And when we know something, that can make us think wrongly about ourselves and about other people. It can make us think that we are more important than other people. But when we love other people, it helps to make them strong. 
1CO.8.2	Nobody should think that they really know about something. Some people might think that. But those people do not know anything yet as well as they should know it. 
1CO.8.3	But God knows every person who loves him.
1CO.8.4	So, I will speak about the food that people have offered to 
1CO.8.5	Yes, people may have many false gods and many false 
1CO.8.6	But for us there is only one God, who is the Father. All things come from him and we live for him. There is only one 
1CO.8.7	But some people do not understand these facts. Some people have 
1CO.8.8	But food does not bring us near to God. If we do not eat the food, that will not make us worse. If we do eat the food, it will not make us better.
1CO.8.9	But you must be very careful. You are free to do anything that is right. But some Christians are not so sure about what is right. So, you must not do anything that might cause them to do something wrong. 
1CO.8.10	You may be eating food in a place where people 
1CO.8.11	Then you would destroy other Christians who are not so sure. What you know would be their guide. You must remember that Christ died on behalf of them too. 
1CO.8.12	When other Christians do something wrong because of you, you do something wrong too. They are not sure what is right or wrong. So, when you hurt them like this, really you are hurting Christ. 
1CO.8.13	I must not cause any other Christian, who is like a brother or a sister to me, to do anything wrong. So, I have decided this. I will never eat meat again, if my food causes another Christian to do anything wrong.
1CO.9.1	You know that I am a free man. You know also that God has sent me to be a special worker and teacher on his behalf. You know that I have seen Jesus, our 
1CO.9.2	Other people may not accept me as a special worker whom the 
1CO.9.3	When people say bad things about me, this is my answer to them: 
1CO.9.4	It is right that people give food and drink to me for my work. 
1CO.9.5	It is right for each of us special workers to have a Christian wife. And it is right if we take our wives with us. We can take them with us to all the places where we go. The other men whom the 
1CO.9.6	Barnabas and I seem to be the only ones who must work with our hands. 
1CO.9.7	Think about these examples, which are certainly true. A soldier never has to pay for his own food and clothes. A farmer will eat some of the fruit from the bushes that he has planted. A person who works with cows or sheep or goats will drink some of the milk from those animals.
1CO.9.8	I am not only saying what a man would say. God's 
1CO.9.9	God's 
1CO.9.9	God is not telling us only about 
1CO.9.10	No, certainly he is speaking about us. God told Moses that he should write these words down. That was because God wanted to help us. A man ploughs the fields so that he can plant seeds. He is like us. The man who threshes the plants from the fields is like us too. Both of them hope to enjoy some of the food that has grown in the fields. 
1CO.9.11	We have planted 
1CO.9.12	Other people think that they should receive things like this from you. So, it is even more right for us to think like that. But we have not asked you to give anything to us. We do not want anyone to stop listening to the good news about Christ because of us. Instead, we would rather have any kind of trouble. So, we chose not to demand anything from you. 
1CO.9.13	You know about the people who work in 
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the 
1CO.9.15	So, as a result of my work, I should receive everything that I need. That would be right. But I have not asked for anything. And I do not demand anything from you now, while I write to you. I would die, rather than demand anything for myself. This is the true reason that I can 
1CO.9.16	I tell the good news to people. But I have no reason to 
1CO.9.17	I was not the person who decided to tell the good news to people. If I myself had decided to do it, then I could demand money for this work. But it was God who decided. He has given a duty to me to tell the good news. 
1CO.9.18	I do get something as a result of my work, but it is not money. Instead, it is this. It makes me very happy that I can tell the good news to people without any cost to them. It would be right if they did pay me for my work. But I do not ask them to pay, and that makes me very happy.
1CO.9.19	I am a free man. I am not anybody's slave. But I have made myself everybody's slave because I want to help as many people as possible. I want to bring them to Christ. 
1CO.9.20	With 
1CO.9.21	With people who are without Moses' rules, I became like someone without those rules too. But this does not mean that I do not obey God's rules. No, I let Christ rule me. I became like the people without Moses' rules because I really wanted them to know Christ. 
1CO.9.22	With weak people, I became like someone who is weak too. I became weak like them because I really wanted them to know Christ. I have become all things to all people so that I could, by all possible ways, save some of them. 
1CO.9.23	I do all these things because of the good news about Christ. I want other people, together with me, to enjoy the good things that the good news promises.
1CO.9.24	You should know that, in a 
1CO.9.25	All people who do athletics make their own bodies practise. They want to make their bodies do what they want them to do. So they rule themselves in all things. They do this so that they will win a reward. But that reward continues for a short time only. But we rule ourselves in all things so that we will win God's reward. And that reward continues always. 
1CO.9.26	So, I run in a straight line to the end of the 
1CO.9.27	I rule my own body strongly and I make it my slave. I have taught other people about how to run this 
1CO.10.1	My friends, I want you to remember something. Remember what happened to our 
1CO.10.2	God 
1CO.10.3	All our 
1CO.10.4	All of them drank the same 
1CO.10.5	But God was not happy with most of them. So, their dead bodies lay everywhere in that land, where there was no water. 
1CO.10.6	These things that happened to our 
1CO.10.7	Nor must we 
1CO.10.7	‘The people sat down to eat and to drink. And they stood up to enjoy themselves. And they danced in front of their false god.’
1CO.10.8	Nor must we ever have sex with anyone who is not our own wife or husband. Some of our grandfathers did that, and so 23000 of them died in one day. 
1CO.10.9	Nor must we get angry with the 
1CO.10.10	Nor must you say that God is doing bad things. Some of our grandfathers spoke like that. And so God sent an 
1CO.10.11	All these things that happened to our grandfathers are examples to us. God caused people to write about these things so that we could learn from them. We ourselves must learn to be careful. We are alive today, but the end of all things will come soon. 
1CO.10.12	Perhaps you think that you are standing strongly. But be very careful that you do not fall down! 
1CO.10.13	Sometimes it will be difficult for you not to do something wrong. Or it will be difficult not to think something wrong. You will have difficulties like this. But they are the same kind of difficulties that every person has. God always does what he has promised to do. Remember this. He will not let any difficulty be too big for you. He does not want you to do anything wrong because of any difficulty. He will make you strong. He will show you a way out of the difficulty. So then you will be able to do what is right.
1CO.10.14	So then, my friends, whom I love, stay away from false gods. Do not 
1CO.10.15	I am saying this to you because you are clever people. You can think clearly about things. You yourselves can decide about what I am saying. You can decide whether it is true. 
1CO.10.16	At the 
1CO.10.17	We are many people, but all of us eat from one loaf of bread. All of us are one body because we eat from the same loaf.
1CO.10.18	Think about Israel's people. Their 
1CO.10.19	But I was speaking about false gods. I do not want you to think that false gods are important. I do not mean that you should think like that. The food that people offer to 
1CO.10.20	But the people who offer food to 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink from the 
1CO.10.22	We will make the 
1CO.10.23	Some of you may say: ‘We are free. We can do anything that we want to do!’ But not everything is good for us to do. You may say: ‘We are free to do anything!’ But not everything helps to make us stronger. 
1CO.10.24	None of you should think only about the things that matter to you yourselves. Instead, each of you should think about what matters to other people.
1CO.10.25	You can eat anything that people sell in the meat market. You do not need to ask questions about whether that is right or wrong. 
1CO.10.26	As it says in the Bible:
1CO.10.26	‘The earth, and everything in it, is the 
1CO.10.27	Perhaps people who do not believe Christ will ask you to eat a meal with them. And perhaps you will decide to go there. Then you should eat whatever food they give to you. You should not ask questions about the food. It does not matter where that food comes from. 
1CO.10.28	But someone there may say to you: ‘They offered this food to false gods.’ If someone says that, do not eat the food. Do not eat it, because of the person who told you about it. He may not be sure that it is right to eat that food. And you would not want to cause a problem for that person. 
1CO.10.29	It will not matter to you yourself. You are sure about what is right or wrong. But it will matter to a person who is not sure. Perhaps you will say: ‘Why should another person decide what I ought to do? 
1CO.10.30	I thank God for my food. So, when I eat that food, nobody else should say bad things against me. Nobody should say that it is wrong for me to eat it.’ 
1CO.10.31	But do everything to show how great and how good God is. Even when you eat and drink, do it like that. 
1CO.10.32	Do not do anything that might cause difficulties for other people. Do not cause difficulties either for 
1CO.10.33	Do what I do. All the time I try to do what everyone thinks is good. I am not doing that to help myself. No, but I am trying to help other people. I hope that God will save many people among them. That is why I live like this.
1CO.11.1	Copy my example, because I copy Christ's example. I copy the example of how Christ lived.
1CO.11.2	You make me very happy, because you always remember me. You remember everything that I taught you. And you are careful about what I taught you to do. 
1CO.11.3	Now I want you to understand that Christ has authority over every man. Christ is like the man's head. Also, the man is the head of the woman and God is the head of Christ.
1CO.11.4	So, when all of you meet together, you meet to 
1CO.11.5	But when a woman prays in your meeting, she should cover her head. Or, when a woman speaks a message from God in your meeting, she should cover her head. If she does not cover her head, she is not showing the right thing about her leader. She is not showing that she respects the man as her leader. It looks very bad when someone cuts off all the hair from a woman's head. And it is bad in the same way when a woman does not cover her head in your meetings. 
1CO.11.6	So, if a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off all her hair. But, if it is bad for a woman to cut off her hair, then she should cover her head.
1CO.11.7	A man should not cover his head, because God made the man like himself. God wanted to show how great and how good God himself is. That is why God made the man. But a woman shows how good and how beautiful people can be. 
1CO.11.8	God made a man first. After that, God made a woman from that first man. God did not make the man from the woman. 
1CO.11.9	Neither did God make the man to help the woman. No, God made the woman to help the man. 
1CO.11.10	That is why a woman should cover her head. It shows that she has authority on her head. It shows that to the 
1CO.11.11	But we must live as the 
1CO.11.12	It is true that God made the first woman from the first man. But it is also true that the mother of every man is a woman. But all things come from God.
1CO.11.13	Answer this question for yourselves: Perhaps a woman prays to God but she has not covered her head. Is that proper? 
1CO.11.14	If a man has long hair, he should be ashamed. Everyone understands that. 
1CO.11.15	But if a woman has long hair, it is beautiful. God gave long hair to her to cover her. 
1CO.11.16	Some people may want to argue about this. But I have told you what we do. And all the 
1CO.11.17	Now I must speak about something else. I am not happy about what happens at your meetings. Your meetings are more bad than good. 
1CO.11.18	First, some people have told me that there are different groups among you. And these groups do not agree with each other when you meet together as God's people. I believe that some of this is true. 
1CO.11.19	But perhaps these groups have some purpose. Perhaps you need to be in separate groups when you do not agree. Then, as a result, you can see clearly which people among you are right. You can see which people God is happy with.
1CO.11.20	You meet together so that you can 
1CO.11.21	Each of you eats your own meal, and you do not wait for anyone else. So, as a result, one of you may be hungry, while another one drinks too much. 
1CO.11.22	But certainly, you have your own homes where you can eat! You can drink there in your own homes too! You seem to think that God's 
1CO.11.23	The 
1CO.11.23	On the night when Judas sold the 
1CO.11.24	He thanked God for the bread and then he broke it into pieces. He said: ‘This is my body. I give it to save you. Eat this bread, so that you remember me.’
1CO.11.25	Then after supper, Jesus took a cup of 
1CO.11.26	Every time that you eat bread together like this, you are telling about the 
1CO.11.27	We want to show how great and how good the 
1CO.11.28	So, each of us needs to think very carefully about our own life. Then we will know whether everything is right. We need to be sure that everything in our life is right with God. We should do this first. Then we can eat this bread and we can drink from this cup. 
1CO.11.29	Nobody should ever eat and drink at the 
1CO.11.30	That is why many of you are weak and sick. Some of you have died because of this. 
1CO.11.31	But if we really think carefully about our own lives, we ourselves can recognise the wrong things. Then God will not need to decide about us because we are doing wrong things. He will not need to 
1CO.11.32	The 
1CO.11.33	So, my Christian friends, you meet together to eat the 
1CO.11.34	If any of you are hungry, you should eat at home. Eat before you come. Then there will be nothing wrong. So then, when you meet together, the 
1CO.11.34	I will come to visit you. Then I will talk to you about all the other things.
1CO.12.1	My friends, I want you to understand about those gifts that God's Spirit gives to us. 
1CO.12.2	You know how you lived in past times. You lived as people who do not know Christ. Things made you, in whatever way, 
1CO.12.3	I want you to understand me now. If God's Spirit is helping someone, they cannot say: ‘Jesus is bad.’ And, unless God's Spirit is helping them, nobody can really say: ‘Jesus is 
1CO.12.4	There are different kinds of gifts. But it is the same Spirit who gives them. 
1CO.12.5	We 
1CO.12.6	Different people can do different things. But the same God gives everything that we need to each of us. He makes us able to work for him as he wants us to do. 
1CO.12.7	In each one of us, God shows in certain ways that his Spirit is present in us. He gives certain gifts to each of us so that we can help each other.
1CO.12.8	The Spirit gives to one person a message that causes people to understand something. And he gives to another person a message that causes people to know something. 
1CO.12.9	The same Spirit causes another person to believe God strongly. And he gives to someone else gifts to make sick people well. 
1CO.12.10	The same Spirit causes another person to do 
1CO.12.11	It is the same Spirit who does all these things. He decides which gifts he will give to each person.
1CO.12.12	Each person has only one body, but that body has many parts. All those different parts make only one body. And it is like that with Christ too. 
1CO.12.13	God 
1CO.12.14	A person's body does not have only one part. No, it has many parts. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot could speak, it might say: ‘I am not a hand, so I do not belong to this body.’ But what it says makes no difference. It is still a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	If the ear could speak, it might say: ‘I am not an eye, so I do not belong to this body.’ But what it says makes no difference. It does still belong to the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body was an eye, it could not hear. Or if the whole body was an ear, it could not know about different smells. 
1CO.12.18	But God decided where he wanted to put each different part in our bodies.
1CO.12.19	A body is not a body if it has only one part. 
1CO.12.20	But there are many parts, and there is one whole body. 
1CO.12.21	That is why the eye cannot say to the hand: ‘I do not need you.’ And the head cannot say to the feet: ‘I do not need you.’ 
1CO.12.22	No. Even the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are really very necessary. 
1CO.12.23	And we are most careful about the parts of our bodies that seem not to be worth very much. And we cover carefully those parts that we do not want people to see. 
1CO.12.24	But we do not need to cover the beautiful parts of our bodies. God has put all the parts together in one body and some parts seem not to be worth very much. But God has made those parts more important. 
1CO.12.25	So, the parts of the body do not quarrel. All the parts work together so that they help each other. 
1CO.12.26	Then if one part of the body hurts, every other part hurts with it. Or perhaps people say that one part is doing well. Then every part is happy.
1CO.12.27	All of you are Christ's body. And each of you is a part of that body. 
1CO.12.28	God has put different people in different places in his 
1CO.12.29	God did not send all of you to be his special workers and leaders. Not all of you can speak his messages. Not all of you are teachers. Not all of you do 
1CO.12.30	Not all of you have gifts to make sick people well. Not all of you can speak in different kinds of languages. Nor can all of you explain what they say in those languages. 
1CO.12.31	But it is good if you really want the more important gifts.
1CO.12.31	Now I will show you a way that is better than any other way.
1CO.13.1	If I do not love, I am nothing. I may be able to speak different languages that people use. I may be able to speak languages that 
1CO.13.2	I may be able to speak messages from God. I may know all the facts and I may understand all the secret things. I may believe God enough so that I could move mountains. But I am nothing if I do not love. 
1CO.13.3	I may give all the things that I have to poor people. I may even let other people burn my body so that I die. But that is worth nothing if I do not love.
1CO.13.4	If I love, I will be patient. I will be kind. I will not want to be like other people so much that I get angry with them. I will not tell people how good I am. I will not think that I am better than other people. 
1CO.13.5	If I love, I will always be polite. I will think about what other people want. I will not think only about what I myself want. I will not get angry quickly. And I will not always be remembering the wrong things that other people have done to me. 
1CO.13.6	If I love, I will not be happy about bad things. But instead, I will be happy about things that are right and true. 
1CO.13.7	If I really love people, I will never stop loving them. It will not matter what happens. Whatever things may happen, I will still continue to love. If I love, then, during all things, I will still continue to believe. If I love, then, during all things, I will still continue to hope for good things. If I love then, during all things, I will still continue to be patient and strong.
1CO.13.8	If I love, that will never come to an end. But it is different for all those gifts that God has given to us. The time will come when we do not need them any longer. People will stop telling messages from God. They will stop speaking in special languages. The many things that people know will finish. 
1CO.13.9	Now, at this time, we know only a small part of everything that is true. And we can tell other people only a small part of the messages that come from God. 
1CO.13.10	Now, we have only a part of what God wants to give to us. But the time will come when he will give everything to us completely. Then we will not have only a part any longer.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I talked like a child. I thought like a child thinks. I understood only what a child understands. But now that I am a man, I have stopped being like a child. 
1CO.13.12	Now we see things as if we were looking at them in a dark mirror. What we see is not clear. But the time will come when we will see everything clearly. Now we know some things, but then we will understand all things. God knows us and he understands us completely. And we will understand like that too, then.
1CO.13.13	So, there are three things that continue. We continue to believe God. We continue to hope for good things. We continue to love. But the greatest of these things is love.
1CO.14.1	So, want to love more than you want anything else. Also, want very much to have gifts from God's Spirit. And want most to tell messages from God. Want that gift more than the other gifts. 
1CO.14.2	Anyone who speaks in a special language speaks only to God. That person is not speaking to other people, because the other people do not understand him. The Spirit is causing him to speak about secret things, but other people do not understand. 
1CO.14.3	But anyone who tells messages from God is speaking to other people. That person is helping other people to understand more, so that they become stronger. Also, he is helping people to be more sure and happier. He is helping them to be without trouble in their minds. 
1CO.14.4	Anyone who speaks in a special language helps only himself. But a person who tells messages from God helps all the 
1CO.14.5	I want all of you to speak in special languages. But even more, I want you to tell God's messages to people. Anyone who can tell messages from God is a very valuable person. That person is greater than someone who can speak in special languages. Anyone who speaks in special languages is less valuable to you. That person is less valuable unless they themselves can explain their special words. Then everyone can understand those words, and so they will help the 
1CO.14.6	My friends, if I come to visit you, perhaps I may speak in special languages to you. But that by itself will not help you. But I may tell you something that God has shown to me. Then, that will help you. I may tell you something that I know about God. Then, that will help you too. If I tell you a message from God, that will help you. Or if I teach you something, that will help you. 
1CO.14.7	Think about music. The different kinds of 
1CO.14.8	Soldiers will not prepare to fight the enemy unless they hear a clear sound from the 
1CO.14.9	It is the same for you. You must speak words that people can understand. Only then will your message be clear. If people do not understand your words, then you will only be speaking those words into the air. 
1CO.14.10	Certainly, there are many different languages in this world, and all of them mean something. 
1CO.14.11	Perhaps a person will speak to me in a language that I do not know. But I will not understand what his words mean. So, I will be like a foreign person to him. And he will be like a foreign person to me also. 
1CO.14.12	You yourselves really want the gifts that come from God's Spirit. That is good. But the best gifts are those that will help the 
1CO.14.13	So, anyone among you who speaks aloud in a special language should pray to God about it. Ask God to help you explain those words. 
1CO.14.14	If I pray in a special language, only my 
1CO.14.15	So, the best way is this: I should pray both with my 
1CO.14.16	If you thank God only with your 
1CO.14.17	You may be really thanking God, but your words do not help anyone else there.
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in special languages more than all of you. 
1CO.14.19	But when the 
1CO.14.20	My friends, do not think like children think. Babies do not know very much about bad things. So, with bad things, be like babies. But do not think and understand things like children. No, instead, think and understand like proper men and women. 
1CO.14.21	It says in the Bible:
1CO.14.21	‘I will cause foreign people to speak my messages to my people. These foreign people will speak to them in strange languages.
1CO.14.21	But my people will not listen to me, even if I speak to them by foreign people.’ That is what the 
1CO.14.22	So then, the gift from God that causes people to speak in special languages is a sign. It shows something to people who do not believe God. But it is not a sign for those people who do believe God. Also, the other gift from God that causes people to speak his messages is a sign. It shows something to those people who believe God. But it is not a sign for those people who do not believe.
1CO.14.23	Think about when the whole 
1CO.14.24	But if all of you are telling messages from God, it will be different. If a stranger comes in, then he will listen. He might not know very much, or he might not believe God. But still, he will understand that he is not right with God. The messages that all of you are telling will make him sure about that. 
1CO.14.25	The messages from God will show every secret thought that the stranger thinks. And so, he will bend himself down and he will 
1CO.14.26	So, this is what you should do in your meetings, my friends. You meet together to 
1CO.14.27	No more than two or three people should speak aloud in special languages. They should speak one person at a time. Then someone must explain what each person said. 
1CO.14.28	But perhaps there is nobody there who can explain the special languages. Then, those people who can speak aloud in special languages must be quiet. They must speak only to themselves and to God.
1CO.14.29	Two or three people can tell messages from God. Then those of you who are listening must think carefully about each message. You should decide carefully whether each message is good. 
1CO.14.30	Perhaps someone among you will receive a message from God during the meeting. Then, if another person is already telling a message at that time, that other person should stop. 
1CO.14.31	Each person among you can tell a message from God, but you must speak one person at a time. Then everyone will learn something and it will help all of you to believe God more. 
1CO.14.32	All of you who can speak messages from God have authority over your own 
1CO.14.33	God does not want anyone to confuse his people. No, he wants us to do things properly. He wants us to be friends and to be without trouble among ourselves.
1CO.14.33	As in all the 
1CO.14.34	the women should be quiet in the meetings. They should not speak, because they should be under authority. That is what God's 
1CO.14.35	If a woman wants to ask about something, she should ask her husband at home. Women should be ashamed if they speak in the 
1CO.14.36	Remember that the word of God certainly did not start from you! You are not the only people who have heard it, either.
1CO.14.37	Someone may think that he really tells messages from God well. He may think that he has received gifts from God's Spirit. So, that person should understand about what I am writing to you. He should recognise that it comes from the 
1CO.14.38	If that person refuses to recognise this, you should not believe his messages. Do not believe what he says.
1CO.14.39	So, my friends, you should really want to tell messages from God. And do not stop someone when they speak in a special language. 
1CO.14.40	But you must do everything in a right and proper way.
1CO.15.1	Now, my friends, I want you to remember the good news that I taught you. You were happy to believe that message. And you still believe strongly that it is true. 
1CO.15.2	You must continue to believe strongly that same good news. If you do, then it has saved you. If you do not, you have believed it for nothing.
1CO.15.3	I received the good news from Christ, and I told that message to you. I told you the most important thing, that Christ died to save us. As a result, God 
1CO.15.4	I told you that people buried his body, but on the third day after that God raised him to live again. The Bible already told us about that too. 
1CO.15.5	After that, Christ appeared to Peter. Then later he appeared to his 12 special workers that he sent to tell the good news. 
1CO.15.6	And after that, he appeared to more than 500 
1CO.15.7	Then Christ appeared to James. Later he appeared to all the special workers that he had sent to tell the good news.
1CO.15.8	After all these people had seen him, Christ appeared to me also. I was like someone who was born at the wrong time. 
1CO.15.9	Christ sent other people to tell his message. And all of those other people are greater than I am. People should not really call me one of them, because I caused so much trouble for God's 
1CO.15.10	But God was very kind to me. He changed me. He has made me what I am today. And I have not wasted what he has done in me. No, because I have worked more than all the other people that Christ sent to tell his message. But it was not really I myself who did that work. No, it was God himself who made me able to do the work. 
1CO.15.11	So then, all of us teach this same good news about Christ. I teach it. And all the other special workers that Christ sent teach it too. And this is the message that you have believed.
1CO.15.12	Our message is this: Christ died, but God raised him. God raised him, to make him alive again. So, some of you are wrong. You say that dead people do not live again. 
1CO.15.13	But what you say cannot be true. It cannot be true, because then Christ would still be dead. You are saying, ‘God did not raise him, to make him alive again.’ 
1CO.15.14	But if Christ is still dead, then our message to you is not true. There would be nothing for you to believe. 
1CO.15.15	And even more important, we would have told you something false about God. We told you that God caused Christ to live again. But if dead people cannot live again, then that cannot be true. But it is true! 
1CO.15.16	If God does not make dead people alive again, then Christ cannot be alive. But he is! 
1CO.15.17	And if God did not make Christ alive again, then you have believed something false. There would be no reason for you to believe about Christ. God could not choose to forget all the wrong things that you have done. But he can! 
1CO.15.18	Also, if God does not cause dead people to live again, then dead Christians would continue to be dead. They could not be alive with God. 
1CO.15.19	And if Christ gives us a reason to hope during this life only, then we are the saddest people in the world! Then everybody should be more sorry for us than for any other people.
1CO.15.20	But it is true that God raised Christ. And he did make him alive again. Yes, Christ died. But he has become the first of all dead people to live again. 
1CO.15.21	It was because of one man, Adam, that people died. And it is because of another man, Christ, that people can rise. And people can live again. 
1CO.15.22	All of us are in Adam's family, so all of us must die. But all people who are in Christ will live again. 
1CO.15.23	It is like this: Christ died and then he became alive again. So, he shows us the way. When he returns, his people will live again too. 
1CO.15.24	Then the end will come and Christ will destroy every other ruler and power and authority. Then he will give everything to God, the Father, and God will rule. 
1CO.15.25	Christ must rule as king until God has put all enemies under Christ's authority. 
1CO.15.26	God will destroy the last enemy. And that enemy is death. 
1CO.15.27	It says in the Bible:
1CO.15.27	‘God has put all things under his authority.’
1CO.15.27	But it is clear that the words ‘all things’ do not include God himself. No, because it is God who put all things under Christ's authority. 
1CO.15.28	When God has put all things under Christ's authority, then Christ, the Son, will put himself under God's authority. So then God will have all authority over all things, everywhere.
1CO.15.29	Some Christians have died before anyone could 
1CO.15.30	Also, think about us! All the time we are in danger. 
1CO.15.31	Christian friends, I say strongly to you that I die every day! That is as true as the fact that I am very happy because of you. It is a great thing that all of us are 
1CO.15.32	At Ephesus city, I fought as a man fights wild animals. 
1CO.15.32	‘Tomorrow we will die.
1CO.15.32	So we should just eat and drink as much as we like.’
1CO.15.33	Do not believe false words. But these words are true:
1CO.15.33	‘Do not have friends who are bad. They will make you do the bad things that they do.’
1CO.15.34	Start thinking properly! Do what is right! Stop doing wrong things! Some of you do not really know God. So, I am saying all this to make you feel ashamed about that.
1CO.15.35	One of you may ask: ‘How does God raise dead people, to make them alive again? What kind of body will they have?’ 
1CO.15.36	You are a fool to ask those questions! When you plant a seed in the ground, it has to die first. It does not become alive again, unless it dies first. Then it can become alive again and grow into a new plant. 
1CO.15.37	You put just a seed into the ground. It might be 
1CO.15.38	But God makes that seed become a plant. He gives to it the special body that he has chosen for it. To each kind of seed, God gives its own body.
1CO.15.39	All things that are alive are not the same. They have different kinds of bodies. People have one kind of body. Animals have another, different kind of body. Birds have another kind of body and fish have another kind. 
1CO.15.40	Also, there are bodies in the sky and there are bodies here on the earth. The bodies in the sky are beautiful. But they are beautiful in a different way from the bodies on the earth. 
1CO.15.41	The sun is beautiful. The moon is beautiful also, but it is different from the sun. The stars are beautiful too, but again they are different from the sun and the moon. Also, among the stars, one star is brighter than another star.
1CO.15.42	So, when God makes a dead person alive again, it will be like this. The dead person's human body, which we bury in the ground, had to die. But when God makes it alive again, it will never die. 
1CO.15.43	At the time that we bury a body, it is not beautiful any longer. It is weak. When God makes it alive again, that body will be beautiful and strong. 
1CO.15.44	What we bury in the ground is only a human body. What God makes alive again is a 
1CO.15.45	It says in the Bible:
1CO.15.45	‘The first man, Adam, became a human person who was alive.’
1CO.15.45	But the last Adam (Christ) is the spirit who gives people true life.
1CO.15.46	The 
1CO.15.47	God made the first man, Adam, out of the ground. But the second Adam came from 
1CO.15.48	People who belong to the earth are like the first man. They are like the man who came from the ground. But people who belong to 
1CO.15.49	Our human bodies are like the first man, that God made out of the ground. But our 
1CO.15.50	I tell you this, Christian friends: Our human bodies cannot live always with God, in the place where he rules. The human body has to die. It cannot receive something that will continue always.
1CO.15.51	Listen to me while I tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but God will change all of us. 
1CO.15.52	It will happen when the last 
1CO.15.53	All things that become old and weak must change. They must change into things that cannot become old and weak. Our bodies, that have to die, must change. They must become bodies that cannot die. 
1CO.15.54	Our human bodies have to die. But they will become bodies that cannot die. And before this happens, God has told us about it in the Bible. It says:
1CO.15.54	‘I have destroyed death. I have won completely!’
1CO.15.54	When he changes us, we will know this. We will know that it is true.
1CO.15.55	God says to 
1CO.15.55	‘When you 
1CO.15.55	There is nothing to hurt you at that time.’
1CO.15.56	All of us have been wrong because we have not obeyed God's rules. So, without Jesus, we would be afraid to die, because then God would have to 
1CO.15.57	But God causes us to win by our 
1CO.15.58	So, my friends, that I love, continue to be strong. Continue holding on to God. Do not let anything move you from your place. Continue always to work on the 
1CO.16.1	Now, I want to speak about the money that you will give to God's people at Jerusalem. I told the 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of every week, each of you should put some of your money in a special place. You should keep this money separate and safe. Then, when I come to you, your gift of money will be ready. Some of you have more money than other people, so you can give more. 
1CO.16.3	Then you should choose people from your group who will take your gift to Jerusalem. I will visit you. And then, I will send those people to Jerusalem with letters from me. Those letters will tell the Christians at Jerusalem who is bringing your gift. 
1CO.16.4	I may go myself also, if that seems the right thing for me to do. Then they can travel with me.
1CO.16.5	But I must go to Macedonia first. 
1CO.16.6	Perhaps I could remain with you for some time then. I may even stay for the whole winter. Then you can help me to continue my journey to the next place. I am not sure yet where that may be. 
1CO.16.7	I want to stay with you for more than a short time, so I will not come immediately. If the 
1CO.16.8	But now, I will remain here at Ephesus city until Pentecost. 
1CO.16.9	God has given me the chance to do a great and powerful work for him here. But there are many enemies here too.
1CO.16.10	If Timothy comes to you, then make him feel completely happy there with you. He is doing the 
1CO.16.11	So, nobody should think that Timothy is not important. You must help him to be free from trouble. Then, send him on his way, so that he can return to me. I am waiting for him, with the other Christian friends, to return here.
1CO.16.12	Now I want to talk about our friend Apollos. I asked him very seriously to go, with the other Christians, so that he could visit you. But he does not think that this is the right time. He will go when he gets the chance.
1CO.16.13	Stay awake. Watch what is happening. Never stop believing God. Be brave and strong. 
1CO.16.14	Do everything because you love God and other people.
1CO.16.15	You know about Stephanas and his family. They were the first people in Achaia to become Christians. 
1CO.16.16	I ask you to let people like these be your leaders. Also, be ready to obey everyone else who helps with the same work. 
1CO.16.17	I was very happy when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived here. You could not help me because you were far away. But they have given to me what you could not give. 
1CO.16.18	They have made my 
1CO.16.19	The 
1CO.16.20	All the Christians here say ‘Hello’ to you. When you meet each other, kiss each other like brothers and sisters.
1CO.16.21	I myself am writing this now with my own hand: I, Paul, say ‘hello’ to you. 
1CO.16.22	If any of you do not really love the 
1CO.16.23	I pray that the 
1CO.16.24	I love all of you, because Christ Jesus makes us join together.
2CO.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an 
2CO.1.1	I am sending this letter to you, the people of the 
2CO.1.2	I pray that God, our Father, and the 
2CO.1.3	We thank God, the Father of our 
2CO.1.4	He 
2CO.1.5	We have very much trouble and pain, as Christ did. We have very much trouble and pain because we are his. But, in the same way, we know also how very much Christ 
2CO.1.6	If we are sad because of troubles and pain, that helps you. It helps to 
2CO.1.7	So, we continue to be completely sure about you. You have the same troubles and pain as we have. And, in the same way also, God will 
2CO.1.8	Friends, we want you to know about the great trouble that we had in 
2CO.1.9	Deep inside ourselves, we thought that we would certainly die. This showed us that we ourselves are not strong. It is God who is strong. He is the one who causes dead people to live again. We needed to know that only he could help us. 
2CO.1.10	And God did save us from great danger that would have killed us. We believe strongly that he will continue to save us in future times. 
2CO.1.11	You also help us because you pray for us. Many people pray for us. And God will answer what they pray. He will be good to us. And so, many people will thank him on our behalf.
2CO.1.12	We have lived in this world as God's people should live. We have been careful to be honest and good with everyone. And we have been like that very much with you. We ourselves are sure that this is true. And we are very happy about it. We have not tried to be clever as human people can be clever. But instead, we have done only what God has made us able to do. 
2CO.1.13	We are writing to you only things that you yourselves can read and understand. And I hope that you will understand completely. 
2CO.1.14	You do not understand us completely yet. But I hope that you will understand. On the day when our 
2CO.1.15+2CO.1.16	And because I was so sure about you, I decided to visit you first. I decided to visit you on my way to Macedonia. And then I would visit you again on my way back from Macedonia. So then you would see me twice and I could help you twice. And then you could help to send me on my journey to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	When I decided this, I was serious about it. I do not decide to do things only because I myself want to do them. I am not ready to say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ at the same time, like someone who does not know God.
2CO.1.18	As certainly as God is true, our message to you was not ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. 
2CO.1.19	Silas, Timothy and I told you about Jesus Christ, who is God's Son. He is not someone who is ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. Instead, by him God was and is saying ‘Yes’ to us. 
2CO.1.20	Everything that God has promised becomes ‘Yes’ because of Christ. That is why, by Christ, we can thank God. By him, we can agree that all God's promises are true. And we can say how very great and good God is.
2CO.1.21	God causes both us and you to be sure and strong because we are 
2CO.1.22	God has also put his mark on us, to show that we are his. He has given his Spirit to us, to live deep inside us. And his Spirit causes us to be sure about what we will receive from God.
2CO.1.23	I decided not to come to Corinth at that time, for this reason. It was because I wanted to be kind to you. I did not want to be angry with you. God knows that this is true! 
2CO.1.24	We are not trying to be like masters. Masters would tell you what to believe about everything. We are not trying to have authority over you like that. We know that you believe the right things. And you are strong because you believe those things. But instead, we are working with you so that you will be happy.
2CO.2.1	So, I thought about what would be the best thing to do. And I decided not to visit you again at that time, because I did not want to make you sad. 
2CO.2.2	If I make you sad, there will be nobody to make me happy. Only you, the people that I had made sad, could make me happy. 
2CO.2.3	That is why I wrote that letter to you. I did not want you to make me sad when I visited you. But instead, you ought to make me happy. I felt sure about all of you. If I was happy, then all of you would be happy too. I was sure about that.
2CO.2.4	When I wrote that letter, I was very, very sad. I had very much trouble and pain deep inside myself, and I cried very much. I did not want to make you sad. Instead, I wanted you to know how very, very much I love you.
2CO.2.5	Someone has done things that have made other people sad. And that person has made not only me sad. No, but really he has made all of you sad too. I do not want to say too much about the wrong things that he did. 
2CO.2.6	Most of you have 
2CO.2.7	Now, instead, you ought to 
2CO.2.8	So, I ask you strongly to show him that you really do love him. 
2CO.2.9	It was for this reason that I wrote to you. I wanted to know what you would do. I wanted to know whether you would obey me always. 
2CO.2.10	When you 
2CO.2.11	I have done that so that 
2CO.2.12	When I arrived at Troas city to tell the good news about Christ, the way was open for me. I discovered that the 
2CO.2.13	But in my 
2CO.2.14	But I thank God, who leads us always as winners. He makes us winners because we are 
2CO.2.15	Because, to God, we ourselves are the lovely smell that brings Christ. We are like that among those people that God is saving. And we are like it among those people who are dying. They are dying because they are far from God. 
2CO.2.16	To the people that God is saving, we are like a lovely smell. We are like a lovely smell that causes them to live. To the people who are dying, far from God, we are like a bad smell from a dead thing. That bad smell leads them to death.
2CO.2.16	No person could think that he himself was able enough to do this work! 
2CO.2.17	But we are not like so many other people, who sell God's message for money. No, God himself has sent us. And God sees what we are doing. So, we speak honestly because we really want people to know God's message. We speak as those who are 
2CO.3.1	We are not trying again to make you think good things about us. We do not need letters, either to you or from you, that say good things about us. Some other people need letters like that, but we do not need them. 
2CO.3.2	You yourselves are our letter, that God has written deep inside us. Everybody can know and can read this letter. 
2CO.3.3	It is clear that you are a letter from Christ. And he has given this letter to us to deliver. Nobody wrote this letter with a pen. Instead, the Spirit of God, who is alive, wrote it deep inside us. He did not write it on flat pieces of stone. Instead, he wrote it deep inside us. 
2CO.3.4	We say these things only because, by Christ, we are sure about our work. We are sure that God makes us able to do it. 
2CO.3.5	We are not able by ourselves even to think that we could do this work. No, but it is God who makes us able to do it. 
2CO.3.6	God has made us able to be his servants, who tell people about his new 
2CO.3.7	Moses wrote down on stones the words of the old 
2CO.3.8	So certainly, the new 
2CO.3.9	As a result of the old 
2CO.3.10	The old 
2CO.3.11	The old 
2CO.3.12	So, because we hope certainly for such great things, we speak bravely. 
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses. He covered his face with a cloth because the light from God was becoming less bright. So then Israel's people could not see that the light was coming to an end. 
2CO.3.14	But those people could not understand anyway. Even until this day, they cannot understand the old 
2CO.3.15	Even today, when they read Moses' rules, a cloth still covers their minds. 
2CO.3.16	But when a person turns to the 
2CO.3.17	The 
2CO.3.18	But all of us are like people who have no cloth over our faces. Like mirrors, we shine with God's bright light. And he is changing us so that we become more and more like him. We become brighter and brighter as the 
2CO.4.1	God has given this work to us because he is so very kind. So, we do not let ourselves become sad about it. 
2CO.4.2	We have turned away completely from secret things that people should be ashamed to do. We refuse to do anything that is not honest. We refuse to say anything that is not true. We do not change God's message, to include things that are not really true. God is watching us. And we tell clearly only what is true. So, everyone should know that we are honest and good. 
2CO.4.3	Not everyone can understand the good news that we tell. People who are dying because they are far from God cannot understand it. 
2CO.4.4	Those people do not believe it, because the god of this world has kept their minds in the dark. He stops them from seeing the light. Christ is completely like God. And that light shines from the good news about how great Christ is.
2CO.4.5	We tell people about Christ Jesus because we want them to know him as 
2CO.4.6	God said: ‘Let light shine in the dark.’ And the same God has caused his light to shine deep inside us. He has given light to us because he has caused us to know him. He has caused us to know how great and good he is. And this light is in Christ's face. In Christ, we see how great and good God is. 
2CO.4.7	But we, who have this very valuable gift in us, are quite like weak 
2CO.4.8	We have every kind of bad trouble and pain, but those things do not beat us. Sometimes we do not understand what to do, but we never stop believing God. 
2CO.4.9	We have many enemies, but we are never completely alone. People hurt us badly, but they never destroy us. 
2CO.4.10	We carry Jesus' death in our bodies always. And so, we can show also in our bodies that Jesus is alive. 
2CO.4.11	Yes, God is always sending us, who are alive, to death because of Jesus. So then, as a result, people can see in our weak, human bodies that Jesus is alive. 
2CO.4.12	So, death is working in us but you are becoming more and more alive.
2CO.4.13	It says in the Bible: ‘I believed, and so I spoke.’ And we believe by the same Spirit. So, we also speak because we believe. 
2CO.4.14	God, who raised the 
2CO.4.15	All this is helping you. God is showing to more and more people how very, very kind he is. And so, people will thank God more and more. They will show how very great and good God is.
2CO.4.16	That is why we do not let ourselves become sad about our work. The person that we are on the outside is getting older and less able. But the person that we are on the inside is becoming newer day by day. 
2CO.4.17	We have these little troubles that continue only during this time now. But these troubles are preparing something much, much greater for us, which will continue always. As a result of them, we will enjoy something much better always with God, who is so great and so good. 
2CO.4.18	So, we do not look at the things that we can see. But instead, we look at the things that we cannot see. The things that we can see are there for only a short time. But the things that we cannot see continue always.
2CO.5.1	Our body that we live in here on earth is like a 
2CO.5.2	Now, while we are in our body here, we cry with pain. We want to put our house from 
2CO.5.3	We want to put on that new house, and then we will never be like people without clothes. 
2CO.5.4	While we still live in our body here on earth, as in a 
2CO.5.5	God is the one who has prepared us for this change. He has prepared us because he has given his Spirit to us. And his Spirit causes us to know that this change will certainly happen.
2CO.5.6	So, we are happy and brave because we are always sure. While we are at home in this body, we are away from the 
2CO.5.7	We know it because we believe God. We believe him, and so we obey him. We do not live by the things that we can see. 
2CO.5.8	I say again that we are always sure. It would be better if we could leave our home in this body. That is what we think. So then, we could be at home with the 
2CO.5.9	But, more than anything else, we want to make God happy. We want to do that, whether we are at home in our body here or away from it. 
2CO.5.10	Because all of us must stand in front of Christ when he decides about us. He will decide about the things that we have done during our lives. So then, each person will receive from God as a result of the things that they have done. What each person has done while they lived in the body here may be either good or bad. And each person will receive from God what they ought to have as a result of those things.
2CO.5.11	We know what it means to be afraid of the 
2CO.5.12	We are not trying again to make you think great things about us. No, but instead we want to give you the chance to show that you are happy about us. So then you will be able to answer those people who look at the outside of a person. To those people, the important thing is what somebody is like on the outside. But they do not think about what a person is like on the inside. 
2CO.5.13	If we seem crazy, that is because we are God's. Or, if we are serious, and not crazy, that is to help you.
2CO.5.14	We want to obey only Christ, because he loves us so very much. And we are completely sure that one man died on behalf of all people. This means that all people died with him. 
2CO.5.15	He died on behalf of all people, so that they should not live for themselves any more. But instead, all those people who live should live for him. They should live for him, who died on their behalf. He died and then he rose, to live again.
2CO.5.16	So, from now on, we do not know anyone only because they are human like us. We have even known Christ as a human person, but we do not know him like that any more. 
2CO.5.17	When anyone is 
2CO.5.18	All this is the work of God, who, because of Christ, has stopped being angry with us. By Christ, we have become God's friends instead of his enemies. And he wants us to bring other people to be his friends also. This is the job that he has given to us. 
2CO.5.19	God wants us to tell people that, by Christ, he was bringing the world to himself. He was bringing all people in the world back to himself, to be his friends. God was not continuing to remember all the wrong things that people do. This is the message that God has given to us. He wants us to tell people that he has brought them back to himself.
2CO.5.20	So, we are speaking on behalf of Christ. It is quite as if God himself is asking you strongly by us. On behalf of Christ, we are asking you very strongly to become God's friends. 
2CO.5.21	Christ never thought or did any wrong things. But God 
2CO.6.1	So we, who work together with God, ask you strongly to be careful. God is very good to us because he is so very kind. But be careful not to waste the good things that God has done for you. 
2CO.6.2	In the Bible God says:
2CO.6.2	‘I listened to you at the time when I was ready to be kind.
2CO.6.2	I helped you on the day when I was ready to save you.’
2CO.6.2	Listen! Now is the time when God is ready to be kind! Now is the day when he is ready to save you!
2CO.6.3	We do nothing that might cause anyone to be angry or sad because of us. We do not want anyone to think bad things about our work. 
2CO.6.4	Instead, we want to show, by everything, that we are God's servants. We show that because we are very patient and brave during bad troubles and pain. Sometimes we have many difficulties and so we are very sad. 
2CO.6.5	Sometimes people hit us. Sometimes they put us in prison. Sometimes people attack us. Sometimes we work very, very much. Sometimes we stay awake at night to watch. Sometimes we have no food. 
2CO.6.6	But still we show that we are God's servants. We are good and clean inside ourselves and we have no bad purposes. We know what is true. We are patient and kind. We have God's Spirit, who is completely good. And we really love God and other people.
2CO.6.7	We speak only words that are true. We have God's 
2CO.6.8	Sometimes people think that we are great and important. And sometimes they think that we are worth nothing. Sometimes people say bad things about us and sometimes they say good things. Sometimes people think that we are not honest about ourselves. But we are always honest and we say only true things. 
2CO.6.9	People say that they do not know us. But really, everybody knows what we are. People think that we are dying. But see, we are still alive! People 
2CO.6.10	We seem sad, but we are always happy really. We seem poor, but we make many people rich. We seem to have nothing, but really we have everything.
2CO.6.11	Our friends at Corinth, we have spoken to you very honestly. We have hidden nothing from you. You know everything that we feel. 
2CO.6.12	We have done nothing to stop you from being our friends that we know well. No, but you yourselves have not been completely honest with us. It is you yourselves who have not told us everything. 
2CO.6.13	I am speaking to you as I would speak to my own children. Be fair to us! Be completely honest with us also. Tell us everything that you feel.
2CO.6.14	Do not try to be 
2CO.6.15	Christ and the 
2CO.6.16	God's house has nothing in common with false gods. And we are the house of the God who lives for ever. As God has said:
2CO.6.16	‘I will live with them and I will be among them.
2CO.6.16	I will be their God and they will be my people.’
2CO.6.17	And so, the 
2CO.6.17	‘Come out from among them and be separate.
2CO.6.17	Touch nothing that is not good and clean.
2CO.6.17	And I will accept you.’
2CO.6.18	‘I will be a Father to you,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my sons and my daughters.
2CO.6.18	This is what the 
2CO.7.1	So, my friends, that I love, God has promised these things to us. And so we must keep ourselves clean from everything that makes our bodies or our 
2CO.7.2	Make room deep inside yourselves to love us. We have done nothing wrong to anyone. We have not hurt anyone. We have not used anyone for any wrong purposes of our own. 
2CO.7.3	I am not saying this to show that you have done anything wrong. As I have told you before, you are very special to us. We love you so very much that, deep inside ourselves, you are always with us. And so, we live or die with you. 
2CO.7.4	I am very sure about you. I am very happy because of you. God has 
2CO.7.5	When we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies did not rest at all. 
2CO.7.6	But God 
2CO.7.7	God 
2CO.7.8	But even if I made you sad by my letter, I am not sorry about that. I was sorry about it before. I saw that my letter made you sad for a short time. 
2CO.7.9	But now I am happy, not because my letter made you sad. No, instead I am happy because it made you sad enough to turn away from wrong things. You became sad as God wanted you to be sad. So, as a result, we did not really hurt you or cause you loss in any way by our letter. 
2CO.7.10	People need to become sad in the way that God wants. When they are sad like that, it causes them to turn away from wrong things. It causes them to turn to God, who saves them. And they will never be sorry that they did that! But this world makes people sad only because they have troubles or pain. It does not make them sad in a way that leads them to God. When the world makes people sad like that, it only causes them to die.
2CO.7.11	You became sad as God wanted you to be sad. And see what good results that has brought! It has made you think so seriously and so carefully. It has made you want so much to show that you have turned away from wrong things. It has made you so angry, so afraid, and so ready to change. It has made you want so very much to do better things. It has made you want to 
2CO.7.12	I did not write that letter to you because of the person who had done something wrong. I did not write it to help that person. Neither did I write it to help the person that somebody had done something wrong to. Instead, I wrote the letter so that you could understand something. I wanted you to understand clearly how very much you yourselves love us. And God knows how much you love us. 
2CO.7.13	That is what has 
2CO.7.13	Yes, that 
2CO.7.14	I did say good things about you to Titus, and you have not disappointed me. We have always spoken only true things to you. And, in the same way, when we said good things about you to Titus, those things were true also. It has become clear that those things are true. 
2CO.7.15	And Titus loves you even more when he thinks about you. He remembers how ready all of you were to obey. You were happy that he had come to visit you. But you were also very afraid. 
2CO.7.16	I am happy because I am sure about you. I am completely sure that you will do only what is good and right.
2CO.8.1	Friends, we want you to know how very good God has been to the groups of 
2CO.8.2	They have had very bad troubles. But those troubles caused them to show how much they really believed God. They were so very, very happy, and so they gave a lot of money to help other people. They themselves were very poor, but still they gave so much money. 
2CO.8.3	I tell you this, which is certainly true. They gave as much money as they were able to give. They even gave more than they could. They themselves wanted to give that much money. 
2CO.8.4	They asked us very strongly to receive their gift of money. They wanted very much to do something that would help God's people. 
2CO.8.5	They did more than we had even hoped for! They gave themselves first to the 
2CO.8.6	So, because of this, we asked Titus if he would continue to help you. He is the person who started this good work. So, he will help you to finish it. He will help you to be kind in this way. 
2CO.8.7	You have so very much of everything. You believe God very much. You speak well and you understand a lot. You want very much to help, and you love us. So, be ready also to give plenty so that you can be good and kind in this way.
2CO.8.8	I am not telling you that you must do this. But I have told you how very much other groups of 
2CO.8.9	You know how very, very kind our 
2CO.8.10	Last year, you were the first people who wanted to give. And you were the first to begin that work. So, the best thing for you to do is to finish that work. That is what I think. 
2CO.8.11	Now finish the work. When you started, you wanted very much to do it. Now be as ready to finish it. Give what you can give. 
2CO.8.12	If you really want to give, then God will accept your gift. He will not want you to give more than you are able to give. But he will be happy because you have given. You have given as much as you can give.
2CO.8.13	You will make other people's lives easier because of your gift. But my purpose is not that your lives should become more difficult as a result. No, instead I want things to be equal. 
2CO.8.14	At this time now, you yourselves have plenty. So, you should give to those people who do not have enough. Then, at a future time when they have plenty, they will be able to give to you. They will be able to help you when you do not have enough. So then, they will help you in the same way as you helped them. 
2CO.8.15	As it says in the Bible:
2CO.8.15	‘The person who brought back a lot did not have too much.
2CO.8.15	And the person who brought back a small amount still had enough.’
2CO.8.16	God has caused Titus to love you so much that he really wants to help you. So, we thank God because of this. Titus wants to help you as much as we ourselves want to help you. 
2CO.8.17	He was so happy when we asked him to help you. He already wanted so much to help you that he himself had decided to visit you. 
2CO.8.18	We are sending another man, who is a 
2CO.8.19	And that is not everything. Also, the groups of 
2CO.8.20	We are being very careful about this large gift of money that we will take to people. We do not want anyone to say that we have done anything wrong. We want everyone to see that we are honest. 
2CO.8.21	We want to do only what is right. We want the 
2CO.8.22	We are sending another man also, with these men. Many times, in many ways, this man has shown certainly that he wants very much to help. And now that he is so very sure about you, he wants to help even more. 
2CO.8.23	If anyone asks about Titus, he works with me. He works together with me, to help you. If anyone asks about the other men, they are coming on behalf of the groups of 
2CO.8.24	So, show these men certainly that you love them. Then all the groups of 
2CO.9.1	I do not need to write to you about the money that we are sending to help God's people. 
2CO.9.2	I know how much you want to help. I say good things about you to the people in Macedonia. I tell them that you people in Achaia have been ready to help since last year. And because you are so ready to help, most of them now want very much to help also. 
2CO.9.3	But still, I am sending these men, who are 
2CO.9.4	Perhaps some people from Macedonia might come with me. And I would not want them to find that you are not ready to help. Then I would be ashamed that I had been sure about you. And I am saying nothing about how ashamed you yourselves would be! 
2CO.9.5	So, I thought that I must ask these men to visit you first. They will visit you before I myself come. They will help you to prepare the gift that you promised. Then it will be ready when I arrive. So, everyone will know that you really want to give this gift. You are not giving it because anyone is making you give it. Everyone will know that.
2CO.9.6	Remember this: A farmer who plants only a few seeds will not get much as a result. But a farmer who plants plenty of seeds will bring plenty from his field as a result. 
2CO.9.7	Each person should give as much as he himself has decided to give. He should not give because he has to give. He should not give if he does not really want to give. God loves someone who is really happy to give help to other people. 
2CO.9.8	God is able to give you more than you need of every good thing. You will always have everything that you need for yourselves. Also, you will be able to do many good things to help other people. 
2CO.9.9	The Bible says this about a person who helps other people:
2CO.9.9	‘He has given very much to the poor people.
2CO.9.9	God will always remember how good and kind that person has been.’
2CO.9.10	It is God who supplies seeds for the farmer to plant. It is God who supplies bread for food. And God will make you like a farmer who plants good seeds. He will supply your seeds, and he will give more and more seeds to you. Also, he will cause those seeds to grow, to give more and more good results. You will have good results from all the good seeds that you plant. 
2CO.9.11	God will make you rich always, so that you will always be able to give plenty to other people. Many people will thank God because of your gifts that they have received by us.
2CO.9.12	This good work that you are doing is helping God's people. It is helping to supply what God's people need. And it is not only doing that. It is also causing many people to thank God very, very much. 
2CO.9.13	Your gift will show people what you are really like. You say that you believe the good news about Christ. And your gift will show how much you really want to obey God. You are happy to give so much to these people, and to everyone else. So, as a result, many people will say how good and great God is. 
2CO.9.14	And they will pray on your behalf because they really love you very much. They will love you because God has caused you to be so very, very kind. 
2CO.9.15	We should thank God because of the very great gift that he has given to us. His gift is so great that no words could ever describe it!
2CO.10.1	I, Paul, myself am asking you something strongly. Some people say that, when I am present there with you, I am weak. They say that I am afraid to speak strong, angry words to you. But when I am away from you, I am brave enough to speak very strongly to you. That is what they say about me. But still, it is I who am asking you this. And I am asking it because Christ himself is so patient and so kind. 
2CO.10.2	This is what I am asking. When I come to visit you, do not make me have to say angry words to you. Do not make me angry, as some people make me angry. Some people think that we live by our own human 
2CO.10.3	It is true that we are human. We live in human bodies. But we do not fight by our own human 
2CO.10.4	We do not use human 
2CO.10.5	We pull down every high thing that tries to stop people from knowing God. With these 
2CO.10.6	You must obey completely everything that we have explained to you. And then we will be ready to 
2CO.10.7	You are looking at things only as they seem to be on the outside. Anyone who is sure that he is Christ's should think again about himself. In the same way that he is Christ's, so we are Christ's. He should remember that we are Christ's also. 
2CO.10.8	Maybe I say too many great things about the authority that the 
2CO.10.9	I do not want you to think that I am trying to frighten you by my letters. 
2CO.10.10	Some people say: ‘Paul's letters are very serious and strong, and his words are powerful. But when he is here with us, he is weak. And it is not worth listening to the words that he speaks.’ 
2CO.10.11	Anyone who says things like that should understand this. He should understand that there is no difference. We write certain things in our letters when we are away from you. And we will do certain things when we are present there with you. And those things are the same. There is no difference between them.
2CO.10.12	Some people say how very good and clever they themselves are. But we are not brave enough to include ourselves with them. We would not even want anyone to think that we were like those people. Those people are fools. They see what each other is like. Then, as a result, they decide how good they themselves are. They decide that only among themselves. So, they are fools. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not say any good things about ourselves that are not proper. We will say good things only about the work that God has chosen to give to us. And that includes our work among you. 
2CO.10.14	We are not trying to do anything more than what God has given to us to do. If we had not visited you, then we would be trying to do more. But we did come as far as where you are to tell the good news about Christ.
2CO.10.15	We do not say good things about ourselves as a result of other people's work. That would not be proper. Instead, we hope that you will continue to believe more and more strongly. Then, as a result, our proper work among you will become much greater. 
2CO.10.16	We hope to tell the good news to people in places beyond where you are. But we will not say good things about ourselves as a result of work that other people have done already. That is their proper work; it is not ours. 
2CO.10.17	But, as it says in the Bible:
2CO.10.17	‘If a person says good and great things about anyone,
2CO.10.17	they should speak only about the 
2CO.10.17	That person should say how good and great the 
2CO.10.18	If someone says good things about himself, that does not really matter. But if the 
2CO.11.1	Even if I seem to speak like a fool, please be patient with me. But you are being patient already! 
2CO.11.2	I want you very much to continue being Christ's, as God himself wants that, too. I have brought you to one husband, who is Christ. And I want you to belong only to Christ, like a good woman who has never had sex with any man. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that you might become like Eve. The snake told her things that were not true. And, because he was so clever, she believed him. 
2CO.11.4	You are happy to listen to any other teachers who come to you. They might tell you about a different Jesus from the Jesus that we told you about. And you are happy to listen to them. You are happy to receive a different 
2CO.11.5	But I think that I am quite as good as those special teachers. I am not less able than those teachers that you enjoy listening to so much. 
2CO.11.6	Perhaps I do not speak as well as they speak. But certainly, I do know what I am speaking about. We have made this very clear to you in every way and in all things.
2CO.11.7	When I told you the good news from God, I never asked you to pay me anything. I made myself less important so that you could be more important. I do not think that I was wrong to do that. 
2CO.11.8	Other groups of 
2CO.11.9	When I was present with you, I never asked anyone to give anything to me. Even when I needed something, I still did not ask you to give anything to me. Instead, the 
2CO.11.10	As certainly as Christ's true message is in me, nothing will stop me saying these true things about myself. Nothing anywhere, in all of Achaia, will stop me. 
2CO.11.11	I love you. That is the reason that nothing will stop me. And God knows that I love you.
2CO.11.12	I will continue to do the things that I am doing now. Then there will be no chance for those other teachers to say great things about themselves. They want a chance to say that they do the same work as us. They want everyone to think that they themselves are quite like us. 
2CO.11.13	But those people are false teachers. They say things about their work that are not true. They want people to believe that they are really Christ's special workers and teachers. 
2CO.11.14	And that should not surprise you! Even 
2CO.11.15	So, it should not surprise you if 
2CO.11.16	I say again: nobody should think that I am a fool. But even if you do think that, still listen to me. Listen to me as you would listen to a fool. So then I may say a few good things about myself. 
2CO.11.17	I am not saying what the 
2CO.11.18	There are so many people who say good things about themselves. They speak about the reasons why they themselves are so important as human people. So, I will say things like that about myself too.
2CO.11.19	You think that you yourselves are so very clever! You think that you understand so very much! So, you are happy to listen to fools. 
2CO.11.20	You listen to anyone who wants to make you like slaves. You listen to anyone who uses you for his own wrong purposes. You listen to anyone who makes you believe wrong things. You listen to anyone who makes himself seem much more important than you. You listen to anyone who hits you in your face. 
2CO.11.21	I am ashamed to say that I was too weak to do things like that to you.
2CO.11.21	But if anyone else is brave enough to say good things about himself, I will be brave enough also. But now I am talking like a fool! 
2CO.11.22	Those other teachers may say that they are 
2CO.11.23	They may say that they are Christ's servants. (Now I am speaking like a fool.) But I am a better servant than they are. I have worked much more than they have worked. I have been in prisons more often than they have been in prisons. I could not begin to count how many times people have hit me. I have nearly died many times.
2CO.11.24	At five different times, the 
2CO.11.25	Other people hit me with sticks three times. People threw stones at me to kill me once. Three times I have been on ships that broke in the sea. Once I was in the sea for a night and a day. 
2CO.11.26	I have travelled very much. I have been in danger from rivers and from people who rob. I have been in danger from my own people and from other people, who do not know God. I have been in danger in cities and in country places. I have been in danger on the sea. And I have been in danger from people who said that they were Christ's. But those people were not really Christ's.
2CO.11.27	I have worked very much, so that I have been very, very tired. Many times I have not slept. Many times I have been hungry and I have had nothing to drink. Many times I have had no food and I have been cold and without clothes. 
2CO.11.28	All these troubles have happened to me. But also, every day I think about all the groups of 
2CO.11.29	When one of these 
2CO.11.30	If I must say good things about myself, I will speak only about my own weakness. I will speak only about things that show my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	I am saying only true things. And the God and Father of the 
2CO.11.32	When I was in Damascus, the ruler of that city sent soldiers to look for me. The soldiers were round the city and they were trying to catch me. The ruler of the city was under the authority of Aretas, who was king. 
2CO.11.33	But my friends put me in a basket and they sent me out through a window in the city wall. They let the basket go slowly down to the ground outside the city. That is how I got away from the ruler of the city. 
2CO.12.1	I must say more things about myself, even if I am a fool to say them. But I will tell you about some of the special, secret things that the 
2CO.12.2	I know a man who is 
2CO.12.3+2CO.12.4	I know that God took this man up to 
2CO.12.5	I will say good things about a man like that. But I will not say good things about myself. I will speak only about the things that show my own weakness. 
2CO.12.6	If I did want to say good things about myself, I would not be a fool. No, because I would be saying true things. But I will not say good things about myself, because I want everyone to think properly about me. I do not want anyone to think better things about me than what they themselves see or hear.
2CO.12.7	God showed me so many things that were very great and special. But he did not want me to start thinking, as a result, that I myself was too great or special. So, he let me have something sharp and painful in my body, to stop me from thinking like that. This painful thing is an 
2CO.12.8	I asked the 
2CO.12.9	But he said to me: ‘I myself will help you and I will make you strong. I am everything that you need. When you are weak, then I will be powerful in you. Then I will show more completely how powerful I myself am.’
2CO.12.9	So, I am very happy to speak about how weak I am. When I am weak, then Christ's 
2CO.12.10	That is why I am very happy to be weak. I am happy when people say bad things about me. Sometimes I do not have things that I need. But I am happy then too. I am happy when people cause trouble and pain for me. I am happy when I am in difficulties. I am happy about these things because of Christ. Because when I am weak, then I am strong.
2CO.12.11	I am speaking like a fool but you have made me do it. You yourselves ought to be saying good things about me. You enjoy listening to those other special teachers. But even if I am nothing, I am quite as good as those teachers. 
2CO.12.12	When I was there with you, I was very patient. I did many things to show certainly that God had sent me to be a special worker and teacher. I did powerful things that surprised you. You knew that only God could make me do things like that. 
2CO.12.13	You were never less important to me than all the other groups of 
2CO.12.14	This is the third time now that I am ready to visit you. I will not ask you to give anything to me. I do not want the things that are yours. Instead, I want you yourselves. Children should not have to supply what their parents need. No, but instead, parents should supply what their children need. 
2CO.12.15	I will be very happy to give everything that I have to you. I will be happy to give myself also, because I want so very much to help you. Perhaps I love you much more than I should love you. But I hope that you will not love me less because of that.
2CO.12.16	You must agree that I did not ask you for anything. But some of you say that I was not honest with you. I was clever and, like fools, you believed me. That is what some of you say. 
2CO.12.17	I sent people to you. But I did not use any of them to get anything from you for myself. 
2CO.12.18	I asked Titus to visit you, because I wanted him very much to do that. And I sent another friend, who is also a 
2CO.12.19	Perhaps you think like this about us. All the time, we have been trying to show you how right we ourselves are. Perhaps this is what you think. But we are not doing that. We have been speaking as people who are 
2CO.12.20	I am hoping to see good things when I come there to visit you. I know what kind of people I want you to be. But I am afraid that you might be different from that. You might not be as I wanted you to be. Also, I might be different from what you wanted me to be.
2CO.12.20	I am afraid that you might be quarrelling. Some of you might not be happy about what other people have got. You might be angry with each other. Some of you might be enemies because you want to be better than each other. You might be saying bad things about each other. Some of you might be thinking that you are more important than other people. You might not be agreeing, nor doing things properly. I am afraid that I might discover all these things about you.
2CO.12.21	I am afraid about something else also. The next time that I come to visit you, perhaps my God will cause me to feel ashamed about you. And so I will be sad and I will weep. Many people among you did wrong things before. But still those people are not sorry about those wrong things. So, I will be sad because of those people. Many people among you have done bad, dirty things with their bodies. They have had sex with people who were not their own wife or husband. They have wanted very much to do wrong things like that. But they have not turned away from those things.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time that I will be coming to visit you. Remember this: ‘There must be two or three people to say certainly that another person has done something wrong. Two or three people must agree about the facts.’ 
2CO.13.2	I am speaking now to you people who did wrong things before. I am speaking also to all the other people. I said this before, when I visited you the second time. And I say it again now, while I am away from you. When I visit you again, I will make you feel sorry. I will make everyone who has done wrong things feel sorry. I will not try to be kind to anyone who has done wrong things.
2CO.13.3	You are demanding to know certainly that Christ speaks by me. So, I will cause you to know that certainly. When Christ works in you, he is not weak. No, but he does powerful things among you. 
2CO.13.4	Certainly, Christ was weak when people killed him on the 
2CO.13.5	Think carefully about how you yourselves are living. Ask yourselves whether you are really believing Christ. Decide certainly about yourselves. You ought to know that Jesus Christ is in you. You ought to know this, unless you do not really belong to him. 
2CO.13.6	I hope that you will be sure about us. We do really belong to Jesus Christ. I hope that you will know that.
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that you will do nothing wrong. We do not pray this to show good things about ourselves. We only want you to do what is right. We want that, even if we seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	We can only work on behalf of what is true. We cannot do anything against what is true. 
2CO.13.9	We are happy when we are weak. If our weakness helps you to be strong, then we are happy. We want you to become completely as God wants you to be. We pray for that also.
2CO.13.10	I am writing these things to you while I am away from you. So then, when I arrive, I will not need to be angry with you. I will not have to use my authority to 
2CO.13.11	And now I say ‘Goodbye’ to you, my friends. Try to do only good things. Listen to the things that I am asking you to do. Agree with each other. Do not quarrel, but instead try to be friends with everyone. Then the God who loves will be with you. The God who causes us to be without trouble inside ourselves will be with you. 
2CO.13.12	Say ‘hello’ to each other with a friendly kiss because you are God's people. 
2CO.13.13	All God's people here say ‘hello’ to you. 
2CO.13.14	I pray that the 
GAL.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. I am an 
GAL.1.2	All the 
GAL.1.2	I am writing to you, the people of the 
GAL.1.3	I pray that God, our Father, and the 
GAL.1.4	Jesus offered himself as a 
GAL.1.5	God is great and we should 
GAL.1.6	I am very surprised that you are turning away so soon from God. He is the one who chose you to come to him. He did that because Christ is very kind to you. But now you want to accept a different message which some people call good news. 
GAL.1.7	But really, there is no other message from God which is good news. Some people are confusing you. They are trying to change the good news about Christ and make it something different. 
GAL.1.8	Nobody should ever teach a message that is different from the good news that we taught you. Neither we ourselves, nor even an 
GAL.1.9	We have already said this, but now I will say it again. Do not accept any message that is different from the message that we taught you. If anyone teaches a different message, I pray that God will 
GAL.1.10	When I say these things, I am not trying to 
GAL.1.11	The good news that I tell people did not come from any human person. I want you to know that, my friends. 
GAL.1.12	No human person gave it to me or taught it to me. No, it was Jesus Christ himself who showed it to me clearly.
GAL.1.13	You know about the things that I did before, when I obeyed the 
GAL.1.14	I obeyed the 
GAL.1.15	But God had chosen me to 
GAL.1.16	He decided to show his Son clearly to me, so that I could tell the 
GAL.1.17	Nor did I go to Jerusalem to see Christ's 
GAL.1.18	Then, 3 years later, I did go to Jerusalem. I stayed there with Christ's 
GAL.1.19	I did not see any other 
GAL.1.20	God knows that what I am writing to you is completely true! 
GAL.1.21	Later, I went to different places in Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	The Christians in the 
GAL.1.23	They had only heard people say this about me: ‘This man caused bad trouble against us Christians before. He tried to destroy God's message about Jesus. But now he himself is telling people the good news about Jesus, so that they believe.’ 
GAL.1.24	When the 
GAL.2.1	Then, 14 years later, I went to Jerusalem again. This time I went with Barnabas, and I took Titus with me also. 
GAL.2.2	I went because God had shown me that I should go. I explained to the Christian leaders there the good news that I teach to the 
GAL.2.3	Titus was with me then, and he is from the country called Greece. But the leaders at Jerusalem did not tell me that anyone should 
GAL.2.4	But some men, who had come into our meeting secretly, did want to 
GAL.2.5	But we did not agree with what those men were saying, not even for a moment. We wanted you to continue believing the true good news.
GAL.2.6	Those people who seemed to be the leaders did not argue with me. It does not matter to me whether they were really important people or not. God does not look at what people seem to be on the outside. Those leaders did not say that I should teach anything more in my message. 
GAL.2.7	No, instead they saw that God had given a special job to me, as he had to Peter. God wanted me to tell the good news about Christ to the 
GAL.2.8	God worked in Peter to make him a special teacher to the 
GAL.2.9	James, Peter and John, the important leaders in Jerusalem, understood that God had given this special job to me. So, they were happy to be friends with Barnabas and me, because all of us were Christ's special workers. They agreed that we should go to the 
GAL.2.10	The only thing that they asked us to remember was this: They wanted us to remember to help the poor people. And that was the same thing that I myself wanted very much to do.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I was angry with him. I stood in front of him. ‘You are doing something that is wrong,’ I said to him. 
GAL.2.12	Before certain men had arrived at Antioch, Peter had been eating meals with the 
GAL.2.13	All the other 
GAL.2.14	But they were not doing what is really right. And I saw that it was not right. They were not obeying the true message that is the good news. Then I spoke to Peter in front of all of them. ‘You are a 
GAL.2.15	We were born 
GAL.2.16	But we know that those rules cannot make anyone right with God. A person only becomes right with God when that person really believes Jesus Christ. So we, too, have become 
GAL.2.17	So then, we 
GAL.2.18	But if I tried to obey all those rules again, then I would really be doing a wrong thing. I would be building again something that I had destroyed. It would show that I could not obey all those rules. 
GAL.2.19	But, as a result of those rules, I have died to those rules. I died to them, so that now I can live for God. 
GAL.2.20	Christ died on the 
GAL.2.21	God has done so very much on our behalf because he is so very, very kind. And I refuse to say that God has done less than he has really done. If the 
GAL.3.1	You Christians in Galatia are fools! Someone has taught you to believe crazy ideas! I showed to you so very clearly how and why Jesus Christ died on the 
GAL.3.2	I want you to think about the reason why you received God's Spirit. You did not receive him because you were trying to obey the 
GAL.3.3	You have begun by God's Spirit. So, you should not try to continue by your own human 
GAL.3.4	You have had so many difficulties and troubles that have taught you so very much. You should not throw away what you have learned as a result of all these troubles. 
GAL.3.5	God gives his Spirit to you. And he does special things among you that surprise people. But he does not do these things because you obey the 
GAL.3.6	Think about Abraham. ‘Abraham believed God. As a result, God accepted Abraham as right with him’. 
GAL.3.7	So, the people who believe God, they are Abraham's children. This is what you need to understand. 
GAL.3.8	In the Bible it says that, at a future time, God would make the 
GAL.3.9	So then, God will be good to all those people who, like Abraham, believe him.
GAL.3.10	But God will 
GAL.3.11	It is clear that nobody can become right with God by the 
GAL.3.12	But the 
GAL.3.13	As a result of the 
GAL.3.14	Christ did this so that the 
GAL.3.15	My friends, I will use an example from what people do. When two people make a proper 
GAL.3.16	In the same way, God promised things to Abraham and to Abraham's grandson. It does not say in the Bible ‘to your grandsons’. That is, it does not mean ‘to many people’. No, instead it says ‘to your grandson’. That is, it means ‘to one person only’. God promised those things to one person, and that person is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	What I mean is this. God had made an 
GAL.3.18	We can receive what God gives to his children. But it is not as a result of the 
GAL.3.19	So we could ask: Why did God give his rules to his people? He gave those rules to them to show them which things were wrong. God gave those rules until Abraham's one special grandson came. That was the grandson to whom God had given his promise. God used 
GAL.3.20	But God gave his promise to Abraham by himself alone. It was not necessary to have somebody in between like Moses.
GAL.3.21	So, perhaps someone could say that the 
GAL.3.22	But it says in the Bible that all the people in the world are like people in prison. 
GAL.3.23	But before we believed Christ, the 
GAL.3.24	So, the 
GAL.3.25	But now that we do believe Christ, the 
GAL.3.26	All of you are God's sons because you believe Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	All of you that God 
GAL.3.28	You are not different from each other any more, because you are all 
GAL.3.29	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's grandchildren. So, you will receive everything that God promised to Abraham. 
GAL.4.1	I will try to explain it like this. The oldest son in a family will receive what is his father's at the right age. But while he is a child, he is completely like a slave. One day he will be the master of all his father's things. But still he is completely like a slave now. 
GAL.4.2	He has to obey teachers, and other people who have authority over him, until the right time. He must wait for the time that his father has chosen. 
GAL.4.3	In the same way, we were like children also. We were slaves to the bad 
GAL.4.4	But when the time was completely right, God sent his own Son. He came as the son of a human mother. He was born a 
GAL.4.5	We were like slaves under the 
GAL.4.6	And because you are sons, God has sent his Son's Spirit to live deep inside us. His Spirit in us shouts to God: ‘Father, my Father’. 
GAL.4.7	So, you are not a slave any more, but you are a son. And because of that, you will receive everything that God gives to his sons.
GAL.4.8	Before, when you did not know God, you were slaves to other 
GAL.4.9	But now you know God. Or really, I should say that God knows you. So, you should not turn back to those weak and poor 
GAL.4.10	You say that certain days, or months, or times, or years are special. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid about you. I worked so very much among you to help you. And I am afraid that I may have wasted my time.
GAL.4.12	My friends, I ask you very strongly to become like me, because I became like you. You have not done anything wrong to me. 
GAL.4.13	I told the good news to you the first time because I was ill. You know that. 
GAL.4.14	I caused trouble for you because I was ill. But still you were kind to me, and you did not say bad things to me. Instead, you said ‘welcome!’ You were as happy as if I were an 
GAL.4.15	But now I do not understand why you are not happy like that any more. I can say certainly that you would have torn out your own eyes for me. If it had been possible, you would have given your own eyes to me. 
GAL.4.16	And now I seem to have become your enemy because of what I am telling you! But I am telling you only what is true.
GAL.4.17	Those false teachers want very much to make you believe them. But they do not really want what is good for you. What they do want is to make you separate from me. They want you to think that they themselves are very clever and important. 
GAL.4.18	It is good to want other people to believe certain things, if it is for a good purpose. It is always good to be like that, not only when I am there with you. 
GAL.4.19	My children, I feel really like a mother who is giving birth to you again. I feel pain on your behalf until you become more completely like Christ. 
GAL.4.20	I want very much to be present with you now. Then I could know better what I should say to you. Because I do not really know what to say.
GAL.4.21	So, you want the 
GAL.4.22	It says in the Bible that Abraham had two sons. He had one son by a woman, Hagar, who was a slave. And he had another son by Sarah, who was a free woman. 
GAL.4.23	One woman was a slave. And her son was born as a result of what Abraham himself decided. But his son by the free woman was born as a result of what God had promised. 
GAL.4.24	These two women are like pictures of the two 
GAL.4.25	Hagar is like a picture of Sinai mountain in Arabia. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free. And that Jerusalem is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	It says in the Bible:
GAL.4.27	‘Be happy, you woman who could not have any children!
GAL.4.27	You are the woman who has never known the pain from a child's birth.
GAL.4.27	Shout loudly because you are so happy!
GAL.4.27	Because the sad and lonely woman has many more children
GAL.4.27	than the woman who has a husband.’
GAL.4.28	You, my friends, are children like Isaac. Like him, you were born as a result of what God promised. 
GAL.4.29	At that time, the son who was born as a result of what Abraham decided was not kind to Isaac. That first son, Ishmael, caused trouble and pain for Isaac, the son who was born because of God's Spirit. And it is the same now. 
GAL.4.30	But it says in the Bible: ‘Send away the woman who is a slave and her son. Because that woman's son will never receive what God has promised to the free woman's son.’ 
GAL.4.31	So then, my friends, we are not children of the woman who is a slave. No, we are children of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	Christ has made us free because he wants us to be free! So, be strong and continue to be free. Do not let yourselves become slaves again.
GAL.5.2	Listen carefully! I, Paul, tell you this. If you let someone 
GAL.5.3	I say it again. Every man who lets someone 
GAL.5.4	You people who try to become right with God by the 
GAL.5.5	But God's Spirit causes us to hope certainly that we will become right with God. We will be right with him because we believe him. We are waiting for this and we want it to happen very much. 
GAL.5.6	We are 
GAL.5.7	Like good runners, you were doing so well! You should not have let anyone stop you. You should not have stopped obeying what is true. 
GAL.5.8	It is not God who has caused you to stop. No, because God asks you to come to him. 
GAL.5.9	‘Only a small amount of 
GAL.5.10	But I still feel sure about you, because we are 
GAL.5.11	My friends, I do not still tell people that someone should 
GAL.5.12	The people who are confusing you should cut their own bodies. That is what I want them to do!
GAL.5.13	My friends, God has chosen you to come to him so that you can be free. But you must be free in the right way. You are not free to do everything that, as a human person, you may sometimes want to do. Instead, you must be like servants to each other because you love each other. 
GAL.5.14	One rule brings together all the rules that God gave to the 
GAL.5.15	But do not be like wild animals. Wild animals fight and eat each other. If you are like that, be careful. Be careful that you do not destroy each other completely.
GAL.5.16	So, this is what I am saying to you. Live by the 
GAL.5.17	Your own human 
GAL.5.18	But if God's Spirit leads you, then the 
GAL.5.19	Everyone knows the kinds of bad things that people can do by their own human 
GAL.5.20	They 
GAL.5.21	They want things that are other people's. They are drunks. They have parties where they do all kinds of bad things. I have told you before how dangerous it is to do these things. And now I am telling you again. People who do things like this will not be God's people. They will not belong to God's people that he rules over. Nor will they receive the things that God has prepared for his people.
GAL.5.22	But God's Spirit in us causes us to love God and other people. He causes us to be happy and without trouble deep inside ourselves. He causes us to be patient, kind and good. He causes us to believe that God will continue to help us. 
GAL.5.23	He causes us not to think that we are better than other people. He causes us to rule ourselves properly. And there are no rules against these things that God's Spirit causes us to do. 
GAL.5.24	Those people who belong to Christ Jesus have killed their own human 
GAL.5.25	We live by God's Spirit. So, we must obey God's Spirit and we must let him lead us. 
GAL.5.26	We must not want people to think that we are better than anyone else. We must not make each other angry. We must not want each other's things so that, as a result, we 
GAL.6.1	My friends, if anyone among you cannot stop doing a certain wrong thing, you must tell him to stop. Those people in your group who understand things by God's Spirit should tell him to stop. You should tell him what is the right thing to do. But you must be careful to be kind when you tell him. Remember that you yourself might not always be able to stop yourself doing something wrong. 
GAL.6.2	Like people who help to carry heavy things, you should help each other to be strong during troubles and problems. This is how you will obey Christ's rules. 
GAL.6.3	None of you should think that you yourself are too important. If you are not that important really, then you would be believing something false. 
GAL.6.4	Each person should think about the things that he himself has done. And he himself must decide whether those things are good. If they are good, then he can be happy. He can be happy because of what he himself has done. He does not need to think about whether he is better or worse than anyone else. 
GAL.6.5	Each person must live his own life and do his own work.
GAL.6.6	Everyone who is learning God's message from a teacher should give good things to that teacher. Every learner should give some of all the good things that he has to his teacher.
GAL.6.7	Nobody can ever make God a fool. Do not let yourself think that anyone can ever do that! If someone puts a seed from a certain kind of plant into the ground, that seed will grow. And the result will be the same kind of plant. 
GAL.6.8	A person may do the things that, as a human person, he himself wants to do. And the result will be that he will die. Or instead, a person may do the things that God's Spirit wants. And the result will be that God's Spirit will cause him to live always. 
GAL.6.9	So, we should not stop doing what is good. We should not get tired of it. If we do not get tired, then we shall receive a good result at the proper time. 
GAL.6.10	So then, every time that we have the chance, we must do good things for everyone. Certainly, we must do good things for those people who, like us, believe Christ. Those people belong to the same family as us because all of us believe Christ.
GAL.6.11	You can see what big letters I am making now! It is because I am writing to you now with my own hand!
GAL.6.12	Those people who want to seem clever and important are trying to confuse you. They are telling you that you should let someone 
GAL.6.13	Even those men that someone has 
GAL.6.14	But I do not want to say any great things about myself. The only thing that makes me great is our 
GAL.6.15	It does not matter whether anyone has 
GAL.6.16	I pray that God will be kind to all those people who live by this rule. I pray that he will cause them to be without trouble deep inside themselves. I pray this for all those people who are really God's.
GAL.6.17	I want no more trouble from anyone after this. The marks on my body show that I am Jesus' servant.
GAL.6.18	My friends, I pray that our 
EPH.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an 
EPH.1.1	I am writing to you, God's own people who live in Ephesus. You continue to believe in Christ Jesus, and you obey him.
EPH.1.2	I pray that God, our Father, and the 
EPH.1.3	We should thank the God and Father of our 
EPH.1.4	This is true because he chose us to belong to Christ. God chose us in Christ before he made the world. He chose us in Christ to be completely good. So now, God thinks that there is nothing wrong with us. God loved us. 
EPH.1.5	So he had already decided to bring us to himself to be his sons by Jesus Christ. He decided to do this because it made him very happy. 
EPH.1.6	We should thank him so very much because he is so great and kind to us. God has been so kind to us by his son, whom he loves so much. 
EPH.1.7	Christ bought us, by his blood, to make us free. In Christ, God has 
EPH.1.8	He has done so very much on our behalf because he knew everything about us. He understood what we really needed. 
EPH.1.9	God has shown to us the secret things that he himself wanted to do. He has shown his own secret purpose that makes him very happy. 
EPH.1.10	God will finish what he wants to do when the time is completely right. At that time, he will bring everything together to be one thing. The things that are in 
EPH.1.11	In Christ also, God chose us to be his own people. God had already decided that this was his purpose. And he does all things as a result of what he himself has decided to do. 
EPH.1.12	God wanted us to show how very great and good he is. We show this after we have first hoped certainly because of Christ. 
EPH.1.13	And you also became 
EPH.1.14	God's Spirit is the first part of what God will give to us. God has bought us to be his own people. God gives his Spirit to us until he makes us completely free. And then we will thank God. We will show how very great and good he is.
EPH.1.15	People have told me about how you continue to believe the 
EPH.1.16	I never stop thanking God because of you. And when I pray, I remember to pray on your behalf. 
EPH.1.17	I pray to the very great and good Father, who is the God of our 
EPH.1.18	I pray that God will open your minds. So then you will understand what he has chosen to give to you. You will know the good things that he has caused you to hope for certainly. You will know what very rich and great things he has prepared for his people. 
EPH.1.19	And you will know how very, very powerful God is to us.
EPH.1.19	He is more powerful than anyone or anything else in us who believe him. God works in us by the same strong 
EPH.1.20	as he did in Christ. He worked powerfully to raise Christ, so that he became alive again after his death. God worked powerfully so that he caused Christ to sit at his right side in 
EPH.1.21	There, Christ rules over every other ruler and over everything else that has any authority. Christ is much, much greater than any other 
EPH.1.22	God has put all things under Christ's authority. He has made Christ the head over all things. He has done this to help his people, the 
EPH.1.23	The 
EPH.2.1	Before, your 
EPH.2.2	You were doing the same kinds of wrong things as other people in this world do. You were like all the other people in the world who do not obey God. You were obeying the 
EPH.2.3	In past times, all of us were like those other people. We did whatever things our own bodies and minds caused us to want. God was angry with us, as he was angry with everyone else. And, as a result, he would have had to 
EPH.2.4+EPH.2.5	But God is so very good and kind! Our 
EPH.2.6	Also, God raised us up with Christ and he caused us to sit with Christ in 
EPH.2.7	God did these things to show, for all future time, how very good he is to us. He wanted to show how very great and kind he is to us by Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	God has saved you only because he himself is so very kind. He has saved you because you believe him. You could not save yourselves, but it is God's gift to you. 
EPH.2.9	He has not saved you as a result of any good thing that you yourselves have done. So, nobody has any reason to say how good they themselves are! 
EPH.2.10	It is God who has worked in us. He himself has made us what we are. He had already prepared good things for us to do. And he has joined us with Christ Jesus so that we can do those good things.
EPH.2.11	So, remember what you were before. You were born 
EPH.2.12	Remember that, at that time, you were separate from Christ. You did not belong to Israel's people. You did not belong to the people that God had chosen. You were strangers. God had made no agreements with you, by which he promised certain things to you. You were living in this world with nothing good to hope for. You were living without God. 
EPH.2.13	You were far away from God. But now, because you are 
EPH.2.14	It is Christ himself who has stopped us from being enemies. He himself has brought the two separate groups of people, the 
EPH.2.15	He has brought to an end the 
EPH.2.16	By his death on the 
EPH.2.17	Christ came and he told people God's message. He told them about how they could be friends with God and with each other. He told it to you 
EPH.2.18	By Christ, all of us, both 
EPH.2.19	So now, you 
EPH.2.20	You belong to the building that is God's house. God's special workers, and the people who spoke his messages, are like strong stones under this building. They are like strong stones that hold the building up. And Jesus Christ himself is like the most important stone in the building. 
EPH.2.21	He holds the whole building together. And he makes it grow into a house that belongs only to the 
EPH.2.22	He himself is building you together also into a house where God lives by his Spirit.
EPH.3.1	I, Paul, am in prison because Christ Jesus has sent me to help you 
EPH.3.2	Certainly, you must have heard that God has chosen me to help you. He has chosen me to work on your behalf because he is so very kind. 
EPH.3.3	God has caused me to know his secret because he has shown it to me. I have written a few words about this already. 
EPH.3.4	When you read these words, you will be able to understand that I know the secret about Christ. 
EPH.3.5	God never showed this secret to the people who lived before this time. But now God's Spirit has shown it to the special workers and teachers that God has chosen. He has shown this secret also to the people who speak God's messages. 
EPH.3.6	This secret is that the 
EPH.3.7	I became a servant, to tell the good news, because God gave that special work to me. God himself worked powerfully in me because he is so kind. 
EPH.3.8	I am the least important of all God's people. But still, God has given this special work to me because he is so kind. He has sent me to tell the 
EPH.3.9	God sent me also to make clear to everyone how he would cause his secret thing to happen. God, who made all things, hid this secret during past times. 
EPH.3.10	His purpose was to show now, at this time, how completely he understands everything. He wanted the 
EPH.3.11	This had always been God's purpose. And he made it happen by Christ Jesus, our 
EPH.3.12	Because we are 
EPH.3.13	I have troubles and pain on your behalf. But I ask you not to let yourselves become afraid or weak because of that. No, but instead be happy, because my troubles and pain will help you.
EPH.3.14	For this reason, then, I go down on my knees to pray to the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family gets its name. Every family, in 
EPH.3.16	I pray that he will work powerfully by his Spirit to make you strong inside yourselves. I ask him to do this because he is so very great and rich. 
EPH.3.17	I pray that Christ will live inside you, because you believe in him. I pray that your 
EPH.3.18	You will be strong to understand, with all God's people, how very much God loves. You will be able to understand how wide and long and high and deep God's love is. 
EPH.3.19	You will know how very, very much Christ loves. He loves us more than anyone can ever really know. And then, because you know this, God will fill you completely with himself.
EPH.3.20	God is able to do much more than we could ever ask for. He is able to do so very much more than we could even think about. He does such great things because he works so powerfully in us. 
EPH.3.21	God is great! We are his 
EPH.4.1	So I, who am in prison for the 
EPH.4.2	Do not think that you are better or more important than other people. Always be kind and patient. Love each other, and do not become angry with each other quickly. 
EPH.4.3	Do your best to let God's Spirit keep you 
EPH.4.4	There is one body and there is one Spirit. God has chosen you to be his own people, and all of us wait certainly for the same good things. 
EPH.4.5	There is one 
EPH.4.6	There is one God, who is the Father of all of us. He is over all. He works by all, and he is in all.
EPH.4.7	Christ has given special gifts to each one of us, as he has chosen. He has made each one of us able to do certain things well. 
EPH.4.8	This is why it says in the Bible:
EPH.4.8	‘When he went up to the highest place,
EPH.4.8	he led many 
EPH.4.8	And he gave gifts to men.’
EPH.4.9	It says: ‘He went up.’ So, that must mean that first Christ came down, to the lower parts of the earth. 
EPH.4.10	So, the same man who came down also went up. He went up, high above all the 
EPH.4.11	It was Christ who gave some of his people the gift to be special workers and leaders on his behalf. He gave to some people the gift to speak messages from him. He gave to some people the gift to bring other people to himself. He gave to some people the gift to be 
EPH.4.12	He gave all these gifts to prepare God's people, so that they could work together as his servants. So then, as a result, Christ's body would grow and it would become stronger. 
EPH.4.13	In this way, all of us will become completely 
EPH.4.14	So then we will not be children any more. Clever people may try to make us believe things that are not true. They may teach different kinds of ideas, to confuse us. But we will not be like children, who are easy to confuse. We will not let those different ideas change what we believe. 
EPH.4.15	Instead, we must speak the true message because we love people. And, as a result, we will grow up in all things into Christ, who is the head. 
EPH.4.16	He holds the whole body together. He joins every part together to make the body strong. So then each separate part can work as it should work. And, as a result, the whole body grows and makes itself stronger by love.
EPH.4.17	So, I say this to you. I am sure that the 
EPH.4.18	They cannot understand because their minds are in the dark. They are strangers to the life that God gives. They do not know him because, deep inside themselves, they are hard. So, they refuse God. 
EPH.4.19	They have stopped knowing the difference between what is right or wrong. They have given themselves to do all kinds of bad and dirty things. And they want very much to do those things more and more.
EPH.4.20	But you have not learned anything like that from Christ! 
EPH.4.21	And I am sure that you have heard about him. I am sure that people taught you the true message. They taught you the true message that is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	So, you must put away the person that you were. That old person belongs to the way that you lived before. It wants to do things that are not really good. And those things are destroying it. 
EPH.4.23	Let God's Spirit make you think in a completely new way. 
EPH.4.24	You must put on the new person, that God has made to be like him. That person only does what is right. That person is really and completely good, like God.
EPH.4.25	So, you must stop saying things that are not true. Everyone must speak only true things to every other person. This is because all of us are parts of the same body. 
EPH.4.26	Even if you are angry, you must not let that cause you to do anything wrong. Do not let yourself continue to be angry after sunset. 
EPH.4.27	Do not give any room to the 
EPH.4.28	Any person who robbed people before must stop robbing. Instead, he should start to do honest work with his own hands. So then he will have something to give to anyone who needs anything.
EPH.4.29	Be careful not to say anything that is bad. Say only good things that will help people. Then you will help to make them strong. You will help to give them what they need. And so, your words will be good for those who hear them. 
EPH.4.30	Do not make God's own, completely good Spirit sad. He is like a mark to show certainly that you belong to God. He shows that God will make you completely free, one day. 
EPH.4.31	Do not become angry with people easily. Do not become so angry that you cannot be kind to them. Do not quarrel or fight. Do not shout at anyone or say bad things about them. Stop thinking bad things about anyone. 
EPH.4.32	Instead, be kind to each other and try to understand each other. 
EPH.5.1	You are God's children that he loves. So, you must try to be like him. 
EPH.5.2	Continue always to love other people, as Christ loved you. He loved us so much that he gave himself on our behalf. He offered himself as a 
EPH.5.3	So, you must never have sex with someone who is not your own wife or husband. You should not even want to do anything like that. Neither should you want too much of anything for yourselves. God's own people should never even want to think about anything that is bad or dirty. That is not how God's people should live. 
EPH.5.4	Nor should you talk about bad or dirty or silly things, as fools do. It is not right or proper for God's people to talk like that. Instead, you should be thanking God. 
EPH.5.5	Nobody who has sex with someone other than their own wife or husband can belong with God's people. Nobody who does bad, dirty things can belong with God's people. Nobody who wants too much of anything for themselves can belong with God's people. That person is really 
EPH.5.6	Do not let anyone make you believe wrong ideas as a result of the false words that they speak. God will certainly be angry with people who do these bad things. He will 
EPH.5.7	So, do not meet with those kinds of people. 
EPH.5.8	Once you were dark. But now that you are the 
EPH.5.9	The light causes people to be good. It causes people to do what is right. And it causes them to say what is true. 
EPH.5.10	Try to learn what the 
EPH.5.11	People who belong to the dark do wrong things. Never join in with wrong things like that. Those things have no good purpose. But instead, show how wrong those things really are. 
EPH.5.12	People should be ashamed even to speak about the bad things that those people do secretly. 
EPH.5.13	But when something comes out of the dark, God's light shines on it. 
EPH.5.14	Anything that God's light shines on becomes light. That is why it says:
EPH.5.14	‘Wake up, you who sleep.
EPH.5.14	Get up from among the dead people,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.’ 
EPH.5.15	So, you must be very careful how you live. Live like people who understand what is right and good. Do not live like people who do not understand anything. 
EPH.5.16	These are bad times, so use every moment well. 
EPH.5.17	Do not be fools. But instead, understand what the 
EPH.5.18	Do not drink too much 
EPH.5.19	Speak to each other with all kinds of 
EPH.5.20	Thank God, the Father, always for everything, by our 
EPH.5.21	Be servants to each other, because Christ is your master.
EPH.5.22	Wives, obey your own husbands as you obey the 
EPH.5.23	Because a husband is the head of his wife, quite as Christ is the head of the 
EPH.5.24	As the 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the 
EPH.5.26	so that he could make it completely good and clean. He washed it with water by his word. 
EPH.5.27	So then he could bring it to himself as a beautiful 
EPH.5.28	In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives quite as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	No man ever 
EPH.5.30	Christ takes 
EPH.5.31	As the Bible says: ‘This is the reason that a man leaves his father and his mother. Then God joins him and his wife together. The man and the woman become like one body.’ 
EPH.5.32	These words show us about important things that are difficult to understand. I am saying that they show us about Christ and the 
EPH.5.33	But they are also important for you. Each one of you husbands should love your own wife as you love yourself. And each wife must be ready to obey her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents. This is what the 
EPH.6.2	The first rule that God gave with a promise says: ‘Always love your father and your mother, and obey them. 
EPH.6.3	Then, as a result, you will be happy and you will live for a long time on the earth.’
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not make your children angry. But instead, teach them as they grow up. Teach them about the right way in which the 
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your human masters. Remember how important they are. And be afraid of them. Work well for them because you really want to make them happy. Work for them as if you were working for Christ. 
EPH.6.6	Do not work well only when they can see you. Do not work well only to make people happy. But instead, always work well, as Christ's slaves. Work because you really want to obey God. 
EPH.6.7	Be happy to work as well as you can for your human masters. Work as if you were working for the 
EPH.6.8	Remember this: anyone who does any good thing will also receive something good from the 
EPH.6.9	Masters, be good to your slaves in the same way. Do not say things that will frighten them. Do not say that you will 
EPH.6.10	The last thing that I want to say to you is this. Be strong by the 
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole 
EPH.6.12	You need to be strong because we are not fighting against human enemies. No, but instead we are fighting against the rulers and the powerful 
EPH.6.13	So, take the whole 
EPH.6.14	So stand. Always remember and obey God's true message. That will be like a belt round you. 
EPH.6.15	Remember God's good news that makes you friends with God and with each other. That will be like shoes on your feet, to make you ready to fight. 
EPH.6.16	Always continue to believe God. That will be like a 
EPH.6.17	Remember that God has saved you. That will be like a strong metal hat on your head, to keep you safe. Also, remember what God has said. That will be like a 
EPH.6.18	To do all of this, pray all the time as God's Spirit leads you to pray. Pray about everything. Ask God for what you need. For this purpose, be careful to continue praying always for all God's people. 
EPH.6.19	Pray for me, too. Pray that God will give me the right words to speak. Pray that I will not be afraid to tell people about the secret of the good news. 
EPH.6.20	God sent me to tell the good news to people. And that is why I am in prison. So, pray that I will not be afraid to speak. I want to speak the good news bravely, as I ought to speak it.
EPH.6.21	Tychicus, a Christian friend that I love, will tell you all the news about me. He is the 
EPH.6.22	This is the reason why I am sending him to you. I want him to tell you how we are. And I want him to help you so that you feel stronger and braver.
EPH.6.23	I pray that God, the Father, and our 
EPH.6.24	I pray that God will be very kind to everyone who continues to love our 
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy write this letter. We are servants of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.1	We are writing to you, God's own people who live in Philippi. You belong to God because you are 
PHP.1.2	We pray that God our Father and the 
PHP.1.3	Every time that I think about you, I thank my God because of you. 
PHP.1.4	I am always praying for you. Every time that I pray for you, I feel very happy. 
PHP.1.5	I am happy because you are helping people to know the good news about Christ. You have helped me with that work since the first day that someone told you about the good news. And you are still helping with that work. 
PHP.1.6	I know that God has begun to do good things in you. And he will continue to work in you until the day when Jesus Christ returns. Then God will finish this work in you. I am sure about that.
PHP.1.7	It is right for me to feel like this about you, because I love you so much. You are very special friends to me. And, like me, all of you continue to know how very kind God is to us. You know it now, while I am in this prison. And you knew it before I was in a prison. Then I was free and I could teach the good news. I explained to people why the good news is certainly true. And all of that is the reason that I love you. 
PHP.1.8	God himself knows that I very much want to be with all of you. I love you in the same way that Christ Jesus himself loves you.
PHP.1.9	This is what I pray for you. I pray that you will continue to love each other more and more. I pray that you will continue to know God more and more. If you do that, you will understand things more completely. You will understand why things are right or wrong. 
PHP.1.10	So then, you can choose to do what is best. So you can keep yourselves clean inside until the day when Christ returns. So, on that day, you will not have done anything wrong. 
PHP.1.11	Jesus Christ will make you completely good and right with God. Jesus will help you also to do many good things. Then you will show everyone the great things that God has done in you. So people will say that God is very great.
PHP.1.12	Friends, I want you to know this. The things that have happened to me have helped more people to know about God's good news. 
PHP.1.13	I am in a prison because I am Christ's servant. All the soldiers in the king's house know that. And everyone else knows that too. 
PHP.1.14	Also, because I am in a prison, almost all of the other Christians here are 
PHP.1.15	It is true that some of these Christians do not like me. So, they are telling people about Christ because they want to make me angry. These Christians want people to think great things about them. They want to be better than I am. But other Christians are friendly to me. They speak about Christ because they want to help me. 
PHP.1.16	They speak about him because they love me. They know that God has put me here in this prison. And he wants me to explain to people why the good news is true. 
PHP.1.17	Those other Christians, who do not like me, speak about Christ because of wrong reasons. They speak about him because they want to seem important. They do not really want people to know Christ. They want to cause trouble for me while I am here in this prison. 
PHP.1.18	But it does not matter! All of them are telling people about Christ. That is the most important thing. Whether they speak because of wrong reasons or because of right reasons, they are speaking about Christ! So, because of that, I am happy.
PHP.1.18	Yes, and I will continue to be happy. 
PHP.1.19	You are praying for me and Jesus Christ's Spirit is helping me. So, what has happened to me will have good results for me. God will save me. I know that, so I will continue to be happy. 
PHP.1.20	I never want to do anything that will cause me to be ashamed. I hope very much that I will never do that. I hope that now, as always, I will be brave. In my body, I want to show that Christ is very great. I want to do that if I live. And I want to do that if I die.
PHP.1.21	Christ is everything that I live for. And if I die, that will be even better for me. 
PHP.1.22	But if I continue to live in this body, I will be able to do more good work. That work will have good results. So perhaps I should continue to live. I do not know whether to live or to die. I do not know which to choose. 
PHP.1.23	I want to do both those things. I want to leave this world so that I can be with Christ. That is a much better thing. 
PHP.1.24	But you people need me to continue to live in my body. 
PHP.1.25	I am sure that you need me. So I know that I will continue to live. I will continue to help all of you. I will help you to believe Christ more and more. So, you will become happier and happier. 
PHP.1.26	And, when I am with you again, you will have an even better reason to thank Christ Jesus. You will say that he is very great. You will say that because of what he has done for me. 
PHP.1.27	You have believed the good news about Christ. So, whatever things may happen, you must continue to live for Christ. You must do everything that Christ's people should do. So, whether I come to visit you or not, people will tell me good things about you. I will know that you are continuing to believe Christ strongly. You will be like one person with one 
PHP.1.28	You will not be afraid of your 
PHP.1.29	God has given you special work to do as Christ's servants. He wants you to believe Christ. But also, he has chosen that you must have troubles and pain on behalf of Christ. 
PHP.1.30	You are fighting the same fight that I am fighting. When I was with you, I was fighting that fight. You saw that. And now people are telling you that I am still fighting that fight. 
PHP.2.1	You are 
PHP.2.2	So, make me completely happy because all of you agree. All of you should love each other in the same way. All of you should be like one person, because you have the same purpose. 
PHP.2.3	You must not do only the things that you want. You should not do anything only for the reason that it makes you seem more important than other people. Instead, always think about what other people need. Do not think that you are better than other people. But think about other people as better than you. 
PHP.2.4	Do not think only about the things that are important to you yourself. But each of you should think also about the things that are important to other people. 
PHP.2.5	You should think in the same way as Christ Jesus thought:
PHP.2.6	Christ had completely the same 
PHP.2.6	He was as important as God.
PHP.2.6	But Christ did not demand that he should continue to be important like that.
PHP.2.7	Instead, he made himself much, much less important.
PHP.2.7	He took for himself a servant's 
PHP.2.7	He became like men.
PHP.2.8	And when he was a man,
PHP.2.8	he made himself even less important.
PHP.2.8	He obeyed God so completely that he died.
PHP.2.8	He even died on a 
PHP.2.9	That is why God raised Jesus Christ to the most important place.
PHP.2.9	God gave him the name that is greater than every other name.
PHP.2.10	So that, when they hear Jesus' name, everyone must bend down.
PHP.2.10	Everything that is alive in 
PHP.2.10	Everything that is alive on earth, or under the earth, must bend down.
PHP.2.10	They must go down on their knees to 
PHP.2.11	Everyone must agree and say aloud,
PHP.2.11	‘Jesus Christ is 
PHP.2.11	That will show that God the Father is very great and very good. 
PHP.2.12	So, my friends that I love, you too must obey God. When I was with you, you always obeyed. Now that I am not with you, that is even more important. You are people that God has worked to save from the results of 
PHP.2.13	Obey God, because he is working in you. He is changing you so that you want to obey him. And he is making you able to do the things that make him happy.
PHP.2.14	When you do anything, do not become angry about it. And do not argue about it. 
PHP.2.15	Then you will be clean inside yourselves. You will be without anything wrong in you, as God's children should be. And nobody will be able to say that you have done anything wrong. In this world, you are living with bad people all round you. They have become very bad. And they want to do wrong things. But you must be like lights among them, like the bright stars that shine in the dark sky at night. 
PHP.2.16	You will be like lights to these people while you tell Christ's message to them. That message can cause them to become really alive. If you are like this, I can be happy because of you. I will be happy on the day when Christ will return. Then I will know that all my work among you had good results. I will know that I did not waste my time.
PHP.2.17	You believe Christ, so you are his servants. You offer yourselves to God, like a 
PHP.2.18	It is right that you should be happy too. You should be happy, as I will be happy.
PHP.2.19	But I hope that the 
PHP.2.20	Timothy really loves you, as I do. He really has an interest in you. I have nobody else like him. 
PHP.2.21	Everyone else thinks about the things that are important to themselves. They have no interest in the things that are important to Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But you know that Timothy is a good man. He has worked with me like a son works with his father. You know that. He has helped me to tell people the good news. 
PHP.2.23	That is why I hope to send him to you. I am waiting to discover what will happen to me. Then, when I know, I will send him. 
PHP.2.24	But I believe that the 
PHP.2.25	Epaphroditus is my Christian 
PHP.2.26	He wants very much to meet all of you again. You knew that he was ill. So he has not been happy that you knew. He does not want you to be sad about him. 
PHP.2.27	Certainly, he was very ill, and he almost died. But God was kind to him. God was also kind to me, so that I was not even more sad. 
PHP.2.28	So I want even more to send him to you. When you see him, you can be happy. And I will not feel so sad. 
PHP.2.29	Like you, he belongs to the 
PHP.2.30	Epaphroditus nearly died because he worked for Christ. He would have died so that he could help me. He helped me because you could not help me yourselves. 
PHP.3.1	Now, friends, I want to say this to you. Be happy because you are 
PHP.3.2	Some people are teaching wrong things. They say that you must cut your bodies. They are like dangerous dogs. Be very careful that you do not believe them. 
PHP.3.3	They are not really God's people. But we are God's people, because God himself has 
PHP.3.4	I could think that I was good. I could think that I could save myself from the results of 
PHP.3.5	I belong to 
PHP.3.6	I wanted very much to be a good 
PHP.3.7	But all the things that were very important to me before are worth nothing to me now, because of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	And it is not only those things that are worth nothing to me. Now I think that all things are worth nothing, because of Christ. The only thing that is really important to me is to know Christ Jesus, my 
PHP.3.9	I can be 
PHP.3.10	The only thing that I want is to know Christ. He rose, to become alive again, after he had died. And I want to know in myself how powerful his new life is. Also, I want to have troubles and pain, as he did. I want to become like him in his death. 
PHP.3.11	That is how I hope to rise from death myself. I hope to become alive again after death, so that I will live with God always.
PHP.3.12	I am not saying that I have already got all those things. I have not yet become completely as God wants me to be. I am not saying that I have become like that already. But Christ Jesus has made me his own. And it is my whole purpose to become completely what he wants me to be. I am like someone who is running strongly to reach a certain point. 
PHP.3.13	My friends, I do not think that I have reached that point yet. But this one thing is what I do. I forget past things, which are behind me. And I try very much to reach the things that are in front of me. 
PHP.3.14	I run straight towards that point, so that I can win God's gift. God has chosen that I should live in 
PHP.3.15	So all of us who have learned to live properly for Christ should think like this. And if you think differently about anything, God will make it clear to you. 
PHP.3.16	But we should continue to live as we have lived until now. I mean that we must continue to obey God. We must continue to do what God wants. As far as we understand it, we must do that.
PHP.3.17	My friends, all of you should try to do what I do. Also, watch everyone else who, like me, obeys God. And try to do what they do. Try to be like us. 
PHP.3.18	Many people live like 
PHP.3.19	God must destroy them. Their god is their stomach. They do bad things that should make them ashamed. But they are not ashamed. Instead, they are happy because they do those bad things. They do bad things like that. And they think that they are clever because of it. They think only about the things that belong to this world. 
PHP.3.20	But we belong to 
PHP.3.21	He will change these poor bodies that we have now on this earth. He will make our bodies like his own beautiful body in 
PHP.4.1	My friends, I love you very much. And I want very much to meet you again. You make me very happy. You show that my work among you had good results. So I am very happy because of you. My good friends, please remember what I have told you. If you do remember it, you will continue to believe Christ strongly. You will continue to live for the 
PHP.4.2	I say this to Euodia and I say it to Syntyche: ‘You are like sisters because you are 
PHP.4.3	I ask you too, my good friend, to help these women. You have worked with me to tell people the good news. And these women have worked with me too. They have worked very much so that people would believe the good news. They worked with Clement, and they worked with all my other workers. All those workers' names are in God's book. This book says who will live with him always. 
PHP.4.4	Always be happy because you are 
PHP.4.5	Always be kind and patient. So everyone will see that you are very kind and good. Remember that the 
PHP.4.6	Do not be afraid about anything. Do not let anything cause you trouble inside yourselves. Instead, tell everything to God. Pray to him. Ask him for everything that you need. And when you pray, always thank him. 
PHP.4.7	If you do that, God will rule you. He will rule your minds by Christ Jesus. He will rule what you feel like. He will cause you to be without trouble inside yourselves. God is so great that he can do that for us. But we cannot understand how he does it.
PHP.4.8	Now friends, I want to say this to you. Think about the things that are true and honest. Think about the things that are right and good and lovely. Everyone can see that some things are completely good. Think about these things. 
PHP.4.9	Do those things that you learned from me. Remember the things that I said. Remember the things that I did. You must do those things too. And so the God who causes us to be without trouble inside ourselves will be with you.
PHP.4.10	I am very happy that now you want to help me again. I thank the 
PHP.4.11	I am not saying this because I need anything. I have learned to be happy, whatever things may be happening to me. 
PHP.4.12	I know what it is like to need things. I know what it is like to have plenty. I have learned to be happy at any time and during all things. I have learned this secret. I can be happy whether I have enough food or not. I can be happy whether I have plenty of things or nothing. 
PHP.4.13	I can do everything because Christ makes me strong.
PHP.4.14	But certainly, you have been very kind to me. You have helped me at this time, when I am in trouble. 
PHP.4.15	You helped me also earlier, when I was starting to tell people the good news. When I left Macedonia, you helped me. You were the only group of Christians who helped me then. You people who live at Philippi know that yourselves. No other group of Christians gave gifts to me as you did. 
PHP.4.16	Even when I was at Thessalonica, you helped me. More than once, you sent gifts to me because I needed things. 
PHP.4.17	It is not your gifts themselves that I want. But instead, I want you to do good things so that God will be happy about you. So he will be good to you even more, because you have helped me. 
PHP.4.18	Epaphroditus has brought the gifts that you sent to me. I have received those gifts, and now I do not need anything. You have sent me plenty. It is more than enough. Your gifts are like a 
PHP.4.19	My God, who has plenty of very good things for us because of Christ Jesus, will supply everything for you. By Christ, God will give to you everything that you need.
PHP.4.20	Everyone should always say that our God, our Father, is very great! They should never stop saying that! This is true.
PHP.4.21	On behalf of me, say ‘hello’ to everyone who belongs to Christ Jesus' people. The Christians who are here with me say ‘hello’ to you. 
PHP.4.22	All God's people here say ‘hello’ to you. And those Christians who live in the king's house say a special ‘hello’ to you.
PHP.4.23	We pray that the 
COL.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an 
COL.1.2	We are writing to you, God's own people who live in Colossae. You are like brothers and sisters to us because you continue to believe in Christ.
COL.1.2	I pray that God, our Father, will continue to help you. I pray that he will give you 
COL.1.3	We always thank God, the Father of our 
COL.1.4	We thank God because people have told us good things about you. You are continuing to believe Christ Jesus and you are loving all God's people. 
COL.1.5	You are doing these things because you are hoping certainly for good things from God. God is keeping safe the things that you are hoping for. He is storing them in 
COL.1.6	This good news has caused good results among you since the time when you heard it first. At that time, you understood clearly how very kind and good God really is. Also, people all over the world are hearing this good news. And it is causing more and more good results among them too. 
COL.1.7	You heard about this good news from Epaphras. Like us, he is Christ's servant. And we love Epaphras very much. He continues to work well for Christ on our behalf. 
COL.1.8	Epaphras has told us how God's Spirit has caused you to love other people.
COL.1.9	It is because of these things that we have not stopped praying for you. We have prayed ever since the day that Epaphras told us news about you. We ask God that his Spirit will cause you to understand things properly. So you will know completely and clearly what God wants you to do. 
COL.1.10	So then you will be able to do those things that the 
COL.1.11	God will make you strong inside yourselves because he is so very great and powerful. So, whatever things may happen, you can be patient, brave and happy. 
COL.1.12	And you can thank the Father, who has made it possible for you to join his people. With them, you will receive what he has prepared for his people in the light. 
COL.1.13	God, our Father, has saved us from the dark power of 
COL.1.14	Because of what God's Son has done, we are now free. God will not 
COL.1.15	We cannot see God. But Jesus Christ is completely what God is. Even before God made anything, Jesus was already the Son of the Father. 
COL.1.16	God made everything that is on earth and in 
COL.1.17	Christ was there before anything else, and he holds all things together. 
COL.1.18	Think about Christ's people as his body. Christ is the head of that body. It is called the 
COL.1.19	It really gave God pleasure that all of himself is in Christ. His whole 
COL.1.20	Also, it really gave God pleasure to bring all things back to himself. He did that by the 
COL.1.21	At one time, you were far away from God. You were his enemies because you thought bad things. You were his enemies because you did bad things. 
COL.1.22	But now everything has changed. This happened because Christ died a human death. So God has decided to bring you back to himself. He has decided to make you completely good and clean inside. And nobody will ever be able to say that you have done anything wrong. 
COL.1.23	But you must continue to believe Christ strongly. You must not let anything cause you to stop. You must continue to hope strongly for everything that you have learned from the good news. People have told this good news to everyone in the world. And God has made me, Paul, a servant who tells people this good news.
COL.1.24	At this time, I am having trouble and pain on your behalf, but I am happy. Christ had pain on behalf of his own people. While I live in my body, I also have pain. In this way, Christ continues to have pain. This is necessary in order to help his people, the 
COL.1.25	God has made me a servant, who helps his people. He has chosen me to tell you his whole message. 
COL.1.26	This message is the secret that God hid from everyone before. He hid it from all the people who lived in past times. But now he is showing this secret to his people. 
COL.1.27	God wanted his people to know how very great this secret is. It is very, very good and it will help people from all countries very, very much. This secret is Christ in you. And because he is in you, you hope certainly for good things. You are sure that you will live with God always. You will be with him in the beautiful place where he lives.
COL.1.28	That is why we tell everyone about Christ. We teach them everything that we know. We tell them what God wants them to do. We tell them what he does not want. Our purpose, for every person who is 
COL.1.29	That is why I work so very much. Christ makes me very strong for this difficult work. He works powerfully in me to make me strong.
COL.2.1	I want you to know how very much I am working for you and for the people at Laodicea. I am also working for all those people who have never met me. 
COL.2.2	I am working like this because I want all of you to become strong inside yourselves for Christ. I want you to be 
COL.2.3	Christ knows and understands everything. Only Christ can cause us to understand things properly. He can cause us to understand the really valuable things that we need to know.
COL.2.4	I am telling you these things so that you will not listen to false teachers. Those teachers will try to teach you false things that may seem good. 
COL.2.5	My body is not there with you, but my 
COL.2.6	You have agreed that Christ Jesus should be your 
COL.2.7	You must be like trees that have their 
COL.2.8	Some people may try to teach you false ideas. Be careful that you do not believe them. Those ideas may seem clever, but they will take you away from God. Those ideas are the result of things that people have taught for many years. But those ideas belong to this world. They do not come from Christ. 
COL.2.9	The whole of God himself lives in Christ, in his human body. 
COL.2.10	And because you are 
COL.2.11	Also, because you are 
COL.2.12	By 
COL.2.13	At one time, you were like dead people because of all the wrong things that you did. Nobody had 
COL.2.14	He has chosen to forget that we have not obeyed all his rules. He has taken away the list of all the wrong things that we have done. He should have 
COL.2.15	On the 
COL.2.16	So do not let anybody else say what is right for you to eat or to drink. Do not let anybody make rules about special days, about new moons, or about the 
COL.2.17	Rules like that are only like shadows. In past times, they showed people about the good things that would happen. But those good things really have happened now because of Christ.
COL.2.18	Some people may say that God has shown them special things. They may tell you that you should do certain things to your bodies to become better people. They may tell you that you should 
COL.2.19	False teachers like that do not agree to be 
COL.2.20	You have died with Christ. So you do not have to obey the rules that belong to this world. You do not belong to this world now. So you should not still obey its rules! You do not need to obey rules like this: 
COL.2.21	‘Do not touch this thing! Do not taste that food! Keep away from that thing!’ 
COL.2.22	Rules like that are only about things that will finish. Those things are like things that people use. But they are destroying those things while they are using them. Rules like that are only rules that people teach. 
COL.2.23	Rules like that may seem to be clever people's rules. They try to cause people to 
COL.3.1	God has raised you from death, so that you are alive with Christ. So, you should continue to look up. You should want more and more the things that are in 
COL.3.2	Continue to think about things that are above. Do not think about things that are on the earth. 
COL.3.3	Think like that, because you have died. And now you are alive with Christ, who is 
COL.3.4	It is Christ who causes us to be alive. And when Christ shows himself clearly to everyone, then everyone will see you also with him. You will be like him and you will shine with him.
COL.3.5	So you must refuse to do bad things that belong to this earth. So then those things will stop being part of your life. You must not have sex with someone who is not your husband or your wife. You must not think bad, dirty thoughts. You must not want to have sex with other people. You must not want to do bad things. You must not want to have more and more things for yourselves. People who want things strongly like that are making those things more important than God. So they are really 
COL.3.6	God will be very angry with people who do those bad things. And he will 
COL.3.7	At one time, you were doing these kinds of bad things. These things were ruling your lives then. 
COL.3.8	But now you must refuse to do these kinds of things. You must not become angry easily. You must not continue to be angry with people. You must not want to do bad things to people. You must not say bad things that are not true about people. You must not speak bad and dirty words. 
COL.3.9	Stop saying things that are not true to each other. You should be like someone who has taken off old clothes. You have taken off the old 
COL.3.10	Instead, you have put on the new nature, which God has made. And God is continuing to make you more and more like him. So then you will know him more and more completely. 
COL.3.11	When people have this new nature, they are not different from each other. 
COL.3.12	God has chosen you to be his own special people. He loves you very much. So, you should choose to do good things, as God's people should do. You should be good and kind to other people. You should want to help them. You should not think that you are better or more important than other people. But you should be patient with them. 
COL.3.13	Do not get angry with each other, but be patient. You may not be happy about something that someone else has done. But you should 
COL.3.14	And you should love each other. That is the most important thing that you should do. Love is like clothes that go over all your other clothes. Love holds everything and everybody together. Love makes everything completely as it should be.
COL.3.15	Let Christ rule what you think. Let him rule what you feel. If you do that, you will have no trouble inside yourselves or with other Christians. God wants you to be 
COL.3.16	Let Christ's message live in you. Let it work in you. It will do many good things in you. It will help you to teach each other. It will help you to understand things correctly. God's Spirit will cause you to sing different kinds of songs to each other, while you 
COL.3.17	Everything that you do should make the 
COL.3.18	Wives, obey your husbands. That is the right thing to do, because you are the 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and be kind to them.
COL.3.20	Children, you must obey your parents about everything. That is how you can make the 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not make your children angry with you. They might think that they can never do anything to make you happy with them.
COL.3.22	Slaves, always obey your human masters in everything. Do not work well only when they can see you. So then they will be happy with you. Instead, always do your work well, because you really love the 
COL.3.23	Whatever things you do, do them for the 
COL.3.24	So then the 
COL.3.25	But the 
COL.4.1	Masters, give your servants what is right and fair. Remember that you have a Master also, in 
COL.4.2	Continue to pray. Do not let anything cause you to stop praying. Be like people who watch carefully. They watch carefully to see what is happening. And thank God when you pray. 
COL.4.3	Pray for us, too. Ask God to make it possible for us to tell people his message. We want to tell people the secret things about Christ that God has caused us to know. I am in a prison because I told people those things. 
COL.4.4	I want to tell people this message clearly, as I ought to do. Pray that I will be able to do that.
COL.4.5	Sometimes you are with people who do not believe Christ. Be careful when you are with those people. Be careful about what you say. Be careful about what you do. Use your time with them as well as you can. Do everything that you can to help them to believe Christ. 
COL.4.6	Always speak words that are kind and proper. Speak words that will be good for those who hear you. When someone asks you a question, you should know what to say. You should know how you ought to answer each person.
COL.4.7	Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a Christian 
COL.4.8	I am sending him to you for this purpose. He will tell you all the news about us. And he will help you to be braver and stronger for Christ. 
COL.4.9	Onesimus, who belongs to your group, is travelling with him. Onesimus is another Christian 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, who is with me in the prison, says ‘hello’ to you. Mark also says ‘hello’ to you. He is Barnabas's cousin. Mark may come to visit you. You should say ‘welcome’ to him if he comes. I have told you this already. I have told you that you should be kind to him. 
COL.4.11	Jesus, who is called Justus, also says ‘hello’ to you. These three men are the only 
COL.4.12	Epaphras says ‘hello’ to you. He also belongs to your group, and he is Christ Jesus' servant. He is always praying strongly for you. He prays like someone who fights on behalf of you. He prays that you will continue to obey God. So you will always do everything that God wants. He asks God to make you completely as God wants you to be. 
COL.4.13	I tell you this about Epaphras, which is true. He is working very much for you, and for the people at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.
COL.4.14	Our good friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas say ‘hello’ to you. 
COL.4.15	Say ‘hello’ for me to all the 
COL.4.16	After someone has read this letter to all of you, send it to the 
COL.4.17	Say to Archippus, ‘Remember the work that the 
COL.4.18	I, Paul, am writing these words here with my own hand. Remember that I am in a prison. I pray that God will continue to be very kind to you.
1TH.1.1	This letter is from Paul, Silas and Timothy.
1TH.1.1	We are writing to the people of the 
1TH.1.1	We pray that God will continue to help you. We pray that he will give you 
1TH.1.2	We thank God for all of you at all times. Every time that we pray, we always pray for you. 
1TH.1.3	We speak about you to God, who is our Father. We remember the good things that you do. You do those things because you believe Christ. You work very much because you love Christ and other people. We remember also how you continue to hope strongly because of our 
1TH.1.4	You are like brothers and sisters to us, and God loves you. We know that God has chosen you to be his own. 
1TH.1.5	We know that, because our good news came to you not only with words. When we told it to you, the power of God's Spirit was there too. Also, we felt completely brave and strong when we spoke. You know how we lived among you. You know what kind of people we were. We were like good guides for you. 
1TH.1.6	And you learned to live as we lived. So you learned also to live like the 
1TH.1.7	And so you became like a guide to all the 
1TH.1.8	Because of you, people in many places have listened to the message about the 
1TH.1.9	Those people themselves speak about how you believed our message. They tell how you turned to God. They tell us how you stopped 
1TH.1.10	Also, you are waiting for God's Son to come from 
1TH.2.1	Our friends, you yourselves know that our visit to you had good results. 
1TH.2.2	Before we came to you, the people at Philippi had done bad things to hurt us. And they had spoken very bad words to us. You know that. But our God caused us to be brave so that we could tell you his good news. Many people tried to stop us, but we did tell you God's message. 
1TH.2.3	We were telling you the good news so that you could believe God. We told you only true things. We had no wrong purpose. We did not want you to believe things that are not true. 
1TH.2.4	Instead, we say what God wants us to say. He has chosen us to tell his good news. We do not speak so that we can make people happy. But we do want to make God happy. And God discovers what our purposes really are, deep inside ourselves. 
1TH.2.5	We never tried to say nice things about you so that you would like us. You know that. We never demanded money or other things from you. We never had a secret purpose like that. God knows this. 
1TH.2.6	We did not want people to say great things about us. We did not want you to do that. And we did not want anyone else to do that. We are Christ's special workers and teachers. So, we could have used our authority over you. We could have caused you to do things for us. We could have caused you to supply things for us. 
1TH.2.7	But instead, we were kind when we were with you. We were kind like a mother who 
1TH.2.8	We were very fond of you. So, we wanted very much to tell you the good news from God. Also, we wanted to give ourselves completely to help you. We wanted to do these things because we loved you very much. 
1TH.2.9	Our friends, you should certainly remember how we worked so very much. We worked during the day and at night. We worked so that we did not need to ask any of you for anything. So then, we did not cost you anything while we taught you God's good news. 
1TH.2.10	When we were with you 
1TH.2.11+1TH.2.12	You know that we helped each of you. We were like a father who helps his own children. We taught you and we helped you to be brave and strong as 
1TH.2.13	There is also another reason why we continue to thank God always. When we told God's message to you, you believed it as words from God. You knew that it was not only a human message. You believed it as God's message, which it certainly is. And God's words do powerful things in you who believe him.
1TH.2.14	And now, my friends, you have become like the Christians who belong to God's people in Judea. People in your own country have caused trouble and pain for you. And that is what happened in Judea too to the 
1TH.2.15	The people who caused that trouble even killed the 
1TH.2.16	because they do not want us to speak to people from other 
1TH.2.17	But you are like brothers and sisters to us. We have had to go away from you for a short time. But it was only our bodies that left you. We did not stop thinking about you. We wanted very, very much to see your faces. And we tried very much to visit you again. 
1TH.2.18	We wanted to return to you. Certainly, I, Paul, tried again and again to return, but 
1TH.2.19	We wanted so much to visit you because you cause us to hope so strongly! You make us sure that God will continue to work in you. You cause us to be very happy! To us, you are like a 
1TH.2.20	Yes, it is because of you that we are so happy. We are happy about the results of our work.
1TH.3.1	When we could not wait any longer to know news about you, we decided to stay in Athens city alone. We thought that it was the best thing to do. 
1TH.3.2	And we sent Timothy to visit you. He is like our brother. He works with us for God, to tell people the good news about Christ. We sent Timothy so that he could help you to believe Christ strongly and to be brave. 
1TH.3.3	So then none of you will stop believing because of the troubles and pain that people cause you. You yourselves know that there must be troubles and pain for us. That is part of God's purpose for us.
1TH.3.4	Even when we were with you, we told you to be ready for future trouble. We told you that people would certainly cause you a lot of trouble and pain. And that did happen. You know that. 
1TH.3.5	That is why I had to send Timothy. I could not wait any longer, so I sent him to you. I wanted to know whether you were continuing to believe Christ. I was afraid that 
1TH.3.6	But now Timothy has come back to us from you. And he has told us good news about you. He has told us how you are continuing to believe Christ. You are continuing, also, to love God and each other. And you are always happy when you think about us. You want very much to meet us again, as we want to meet you. Timothy has told us these things. 
1TH.3.7	So, we have become stronger and braver because of you, who are like brothers and sisters to us. People have caused us very much trouble and pain. But we were very happy to know that you were continuing to believe Christ.
1TH.3.8	Now, because of you, we are like people who have become alive again. You are 
1TH.3.9	Now we can thank God very much for you! We are very, very happy when we talk to God about you. And so we thank him for that. 
1TH.3.10	We continue to ask God that we might visit you. We pray like that every day and every night. We want very, very much to visit you. We want to teach things to you that you still need to know. So then you can really believe Christ as you should believe him.
1TH.3.11	We pray this to God himself, who is our Father, and to our 
1TH.3.12	We pray also that the 
1TH.3.13	So, the 
1TH.4.1	Now, friends, we want to say this to you. We taught you how to live so that you make God happy. And certainly, you are living like that. Now we ask you very strongly to continue to live like that more and more. On behalf of the 
1TH.4.2	You know what we told you. We told you what you must do. The 
1TH.4.3	What God wants is this: He wants you to be completely good, and separate from everything that is bad. So you must not have wrong sex. You must not have sex with anyone who is not your own wife or husband. 
1TH.4.4	Each of you must learn how to rule his own body. So then you will always do what is right and proper. 
1TH.4.5	You should not be like the people who do not know God. They are always wanting very much to have sex. They cannot stop themselves, because they want it so much. But you should not be like those people. 
1TH.4.6	No man among you should ever have sex with a woman who is not his own wife. He would be taking something that is another man's. So, he would be doing a wrong thing to that man, who is like his brother. The 
1TH.4.7	God did not choose us to do bad and dirty things. He chose us to be completely separate from everything that is bad. 
1TH.4.8	So anyone who does not obey this rule is not refusing to obey a human person. Instead, he is refusing to do what God says. And God gives you his Spirit, who is completely good.
1TH.4.9	But I do not need to write to you about how you should love other 
1TH.4.10	Certainly, you do love all the 
1TH.4.11	Try very much not to cause trouble for anyone. Be busy only with your own things, not with other people's things. And work with your hands. We told you before that you must do these things. 
1TH.4.12	Then, if you do these things, other people will think good things about you. People who do not believe Christ will think good things about you. They will know that you are honest and good. Also, if you do these things, you will not need anyone else to supply anything for you.
1TH.4.13	Friends, we want you to understand properly about the people who have died. So you will not be sad about them, as other people are sad about their dead friends. Those other people are sad because they have nothing to hope for, after death. 
1TH.4.14	But we believe that Jesus died. We believe that he became alive again after death. So, we also believe this about the people who have died 
1TH.4.15	We are now telling you something that the 
1TH.4.16	On that day, God will shout with authority. Also, people will hear the voice of an important 
1TH.4.17	After that, those of us who are still alive at that time will go up. God will take us up to be together with them in the clouds. He will take us to meet the 
1TH.4.18	So tell these things to each other. So you will not need to continue being sad. 
1TH.5.1	Friends, we do not need to write to you about the dates and times when these things will happen. 
1TH.5.2	You know very well about how the day of the 
1TH.5.3	At that time, people will say, ‘We are safe and there is no trouble for us.’ But then, when they are not ready for it, a lot of trouble and pain will happen to them. That trouble will happen to them like the pains of a woman who is giving birth to a baby. And it will be impossible for anyone to get free from that trouble.
1TH.5.4	But you people, who are like brothers and sisters to us, you know about these things. So, you are not like people who live in the dark. And so the day when the 
1TH.5.5	All of you are people who are the 
1TH.5.6	So, we should not be like other people. We should not be like people who are sleeping. Instead, we should be like people who continue to be awake. We should think clearly about what is happening.
1TH.5.7	It is at night that people sleep. It is at night that people are drunks. 
1TH.5.8	But we belong to the day. So we should watch and we should think clearly. We must continue to believe God and to love him. So we will be like soldiers who put on 
1TH.5.9	God did not make us his people so that he could be angry with us. He has not chosen us so that he can 
1TH.5.10	Jesus died for us so that we can live together with him. When he comes, we will live with him. Whether we are alive or dead at that time, there will not be any difference. We will all live with him. 
1TH.5.11	So, tell these things to each other so that you do not feel sad or weak. Help each other to become stronger as 
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, our friends, to remember how valuable your leaders are. They work among you and they 
1TH.5.13	Show them how valuable they are to you. And love them very much because of the work that they do. Do not quarrel with each other.
1TH.5.14	Tell lazy people that they should work. Speak to those people who are afraid. Help them to be brave. Help those people who are weak. Be patient with everyone. Friends, we ask you strongly to do these things. 
1TH.5.15	If a person has done something wrong to you, do not do something wrong back to them. Be careful that none of you does things like that. But always try to do good things to each other and to everyone else.
1TH.5.16	Always be happy. 
1TH.5.17	Pray at all times. 
1TH.5.18	Whatever things may happen to you, continue to thank God. God wants you to do this, because you are 
1TH.5.19	Do not stop letting God's Spirit work in you as people might put out a fire. 
1TH.5.20	Listen carefully when people speak messages on God's behalf. Remember that those messages are important. 
1TH.5.21	But think carefully about everything, to see if it really is from God. Then be careful to remember and to obey everything that is good. 
1TH.5.22	Refuse to have anything to do with any kind of bad or wrong thing.
1TH.5.23	God causes us to be without trouble inside ourselves. And I pray that God himself will make you completely good and clean. I pray that God will 
1TH.5.24	God has chosen you to be his people. And he always does what he has promised to do. So, he will do this for you.
1TH.5.25	Our friends, please pray for us. 
1TH.5.26	Say ‘hello’ to all the 
1TH.5.27	I tell you very seriously, on behalf of the 
1TH.5.28	I pray that our 
2TH.1.1	This letter is from Paul, Silas and Timothy.
2TH.1.1	We are writing to the people of the 
2TH.1.2	We pray that God, the Father, and the 
2TH.1.3	You are like brothers and sisters to us, and we ought to thank God because of you always. We should thank him, because you are learning to believe Christ more and more. And each of you is loving each of the other Christians more and more. 
2TH.1.4	As a result, we speak about you to God's other groups of 
2TH.1.5	All this shows us something clearly, about how God decides about people. God decides about people who die. He decides what should happen to those people. And he will always decide what is right for them. People are causing great trouble for you now because God is your king. So it is right that, as a result, you should live always with God and his people. And God will cause this to happen to you.
2TH.1.6	God will do what is right. So he will 
2TH.1.7	God will also do what is right for you. You have troubles now. But God will cause you to rest and to be without trouble. You will rest, together with us, when the 
2TH.1.8	He will come with a very hot fire. And he will 
2TH.1.9	To 
2TH.1.10	All this will happen on that special day when Jesus will come. On that day, Jesus' own people will show what great things he has done for them. All those people who believe him will say great things about him. And you will be among them, because you believed our message. You believed what we told you.
2TH.1.11	So we always pray for you. Our God has chosen you to be his own people. And you must continue to be the kind of people that he wants. So, we pray that he will be happy about you. We pray also that God will work powerfully in you. So then he will make it possible for you to do every good thing that you want to do. You want to do those good things because you believe Christ. 
2TH.1.12	We pray this so that other people will say good things about our 
2TH.2.1	Our friends, we must explain something now about the time when our 
2TH.2.2	You must not let yourselves become confused or afraid easily because of false messages about the 
2TH.2.3	Do not let anyone cause you to believe something false in any way. That day will not happen until certain other things have happened first. Before that day, there will be a time when many people will turn against God completely. Also, before that day, people will see the man who completely refuses to obey God. He is the man that God will certainly kill. 
2TH.2.4	This man will be God's 
2TH.2.5	I told you these things when I was with you. I am sure that you remember that. 
2TH.2.6	This man will come at the time that God has chosen. But something makes it impossible for him to come yet. And you know what it is. 
2TH.2.7	Already 
2TH.2.8	Then people will see the man who completely refuses to obey God. But when the 
2TH.2.10	This very bad man will also do all kinds of bad things. He will cause bad people to believe what is not true. So, God will certainly kill those bad people. Those bad people will believe false things because they refused to love the true message. They refused to love the true message so that God could save them. 
2TH.2.11	For this reason, God causes them to believe wrong things very easily and very strongly. So then they will believe what is not true. 
2TH.2.12	The result is that God will decide to 
2TH.2.13	But you are like brothers and sisters to us, and the 
2TH.2.14	God asked you strongly to become his special people. You heard him when we told you the good news. He wanted you to become special people who would live always with our 
2TH.2.15	So, our friends, you must continue to believe Christ strongly. Continue to believe the true things that we taught you. God first taught those things to us. And we taught them to you when we spoke to you. We also taught them to you when we wrote our letter to you.
2TH.2.16	We pray about you to our 
2TH.2.17	We pray that our 
2TH.3.1	Now, friends, we ask you to pray for us. Pray that, because of us, more and more people will hear the 
2TH.3.2	Pray also that God will not let very bad people cause bad trouble for us. Pray like that, because not everyone believes the message about our 
2TH.3.3	But the 
2TH.3.4	Also the 
2TH.3.5	We pray that the 
2TH.3.6	Our friends, we tell you this with the authority that the 
2TH.3.7	You yourselves know that you ought to be like us. You ought to do the things that we did. We were not lazy when we were with you. 
2TH.3.8	We always paid for all the food that we received from anyone. We worked very much, during the day and at night. We worked so that we did not need to ask any of you for anything. So, you did not have to supply anything for us. 
2TH.3.9	We could have told you that you must supply things for us. We have authority to do that. But we wanted to show you ourselves what you should do. So then you could be like us. 
2TH.3.10	Even when we were with you, we told you this rule. ‘If anyone refuses to work, you should not let him eat,’ we said. 
2TH.3.11	We say this because someone has told us news about you. They have told us that some people among you are living in a lazy way. Those people do not work themselves. But they talk very much about other people. They are busy with things that should not matter to them. 
2TH.3.12	We speak strongly to those people who are lazy like that. We speak with the authority that the 
2TH.3.13	But you other 
2TH.3.14	We have written things in this letter to tell you what you should do. If anyone refuses to obey these things, tell everyone about him. And stay away from him, so that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	But do not think about him or speak to him as your 
2TH.3.16	The 
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, am writing these words myself to say ‘hello’ to you. I write my name like this at the end of all my letters. This is how I write. 
2TH.3.18	I pray that our 
1TI.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. I am an 
1TI.1.2	I am writing to you, Timothy. I told you the message about Jesus and you believed in him. So you are like my own child.
1TI.1.2	I pray that God the Father and Christ Jesus our 
1TI.1.3	When I was going to Macedonia, I asked you to stay in Ephesus. Please continue to stay there. Certain people in Ephesus are teaching wrong things about God. You must tell them to stop doing that. 
1TI.1.4	Tell people not to listen to false stories. They should not always be studying long lists of their families' names from years ago. Those things do not help people. They only cause them to argue. Instead, they need to understand God's purpose for us. To do that, people must 
1TI.1.5	We need to teach people really to love one another. To do that, people need to have good thoughts. They need to know that they live in a good way. And they need to 
1TI.1.6	But certain people have failed to live in that way. They would rather argue about things that do not help anybody. 
1TI.1.7	They want to be teachers of God's 
1TI.1.8	We know that God's 
1TI.1.9	We also know that God did not make those 
1TI.1.9	People who refuse to obey any 
1TI.1.9	People who do not want anyone to rule them.
1TI.1.9	People who refuse to obey God.
1TI.1.9	People who like to do bad things.
1TI.1.9	People who do not 
1TI.1.9	People who kill their father or their mother.
1TI.1.9	People who choose to kill other people.
1TI.1.10	People who have sex in a wrong way.
1TI.1.10	Men who have sex with other men.
1TI.1.10	People who catch other people and take them away to be slaves.
1TI.1.10	People who tell 
1TI.1.10	People who promise to say what is true, but then they speak 
1TI.1.10	People who do any other wrong things that are against God's true message.
1TI.1.11	That true message is the good news that comes from our great God. We 
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our 
1TI.1.13	Before he chose me, I spoke bad things about him. I caused great trouble for his people. I was a cruel man, but God was very kind to me. He 
1TI.1.14	Our 
1TI.1.15	Here is a true message that everyone should believe: ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save people who do wrong things.’ I am the worst of people like that! 
1TI.1.16	But, because I was so bad, God was kind to me. Then Christ Jesus could show how completely patient he was with such a bad person as me. That would be an example to those people who would later believe in him and receive life for ever with God.
1TI.1.18	Timothy, you are like my own child. So now I am telling you to 
1TI.1.19	You must continue to 
1TI.1.20	Hymenaeus and Alexander are people like that. I have given them to 
1TI.2.1	So then, this is what I want to ask you first. Please pray for all people. Ask God to supply what they need. Ask God to help them. Thank God for what he does for everyone. 
1TI.2.2	Pray in that way for kings and for all rulers and people who have authority. Pray for God to help them, so that we may live our lives without trouble or danger. Then we can live in a good way that 
1TI.2.3	It is good that we should pray like that. It makes God happy. He is the one who saves us. 
1TI.2.4	And he wants to save all people. He wants everyone to know his message and to accept it as true.
1TI.2.5	There is only one God. There is also only one person who brings God and people together. That person is Christ Jesus, who became a man himself. 
1TI.2.6	He died as a 
1TI.2.7	God chose me as his 
1TI.2.8	So then, in every place where you meet together, I want the men to pray. The men who lift up their hands and pray must be those who live good lives. They must not be people who are angry or who quarrel with others.
1TI.2.9	As for the women, I want them also to dress themselves properly. They should think carefully about the clothes which they wear. They should not bring 
1TI.2.10	Christian women should not dress themselves like that. Instead, their lives should show that they do good things. That is the proper way for them to live, because they say that they 
1TI.2.11	When you meet together, a woman should learn quietly. She must 
1TI.2.12	I do not let a woman teach men. I do not let a woman have authority over men. Instead, she should listen quietly. 
1TI.2.13	I say this because God made Adam first. Then he made Eve. 
1TI.2.14	It was Eve, not Adam, who believed the 
1TI.2.15	But even as women give birth to children, God will save them. They must continue to 
1TI.3.1	These words are true: ‘If you want to become a leader of God's people, it is an important work that you want to do.’ 
1TI.3.2	For that reason, a leader of the church must live a life that everyone knows is good. He must be the husband of one wife. He must think seriously about how he lives and he must rule himself well. He must be someone that people 
1TI.3.3	He should not like to drink too much 
1TI.3.4	He must take 
1TI.3.5	A man must know how to take 
1TI.3.6	A leader of the 
1TI.3.7	Also, people outside the 
1TI.3.8	In the same way, 
1TI.3.9	They must completely believe God's message that he has shown us about Christ. They must not be ashamed of that true message. 
1TI.3.10	Before anyone becomes a 
1TI.3.12	A 
1TI.3.13	If a 
1TI.3.14	I hope to come to visit you soon. But anyway, I want to write these things to you now. 
1TI.3.15	Then, even if I cannot come to you soon, you will know how people in God's family should live. That family is the 
1TI.3.16	Yes, the message that God has shown us about Jesus Christ is very great. Nobody can argue about that. We all agree to this:
1TI.3.16	God showed him to us as a human person.
1TI.3.16	God's Spirit showed that he always did what was right.
1TI.3.16	People taught his message in many countries of the world.
1TI.3.16	People in the world believed in him.
1TI.3.16	God took him up to be with himself in 
1TI.4.1	God's Spirit tells us clearly that, in later times, some people will stop believing the message about Jesus Christ. Instead, they will listen to bad 
1TI.4.2	The people who teach those false things are 
1TI.4.3	They say that it is wrong for anyone to marry. They tell people not to eat certain kinds of food. But God made those foods for people to eat! We should understand God's true message and 
1TI.4.4	Everything that God has made is good. So, we should not refuse anything that he has made. Instead, we should receive it and thank God for it. 
1TI.4.5	God has said that it is good. We should pray that he will 
1TI.4.6	You must explain these things to the 
1TI.4.7	But you must refuse to listen to false stories. Stories like that are not from God and only silly people believe them. Instead, learn to live well in a way that makes God happy. 
1TI.4.8	People say this: ‘If a person works to make his body strong and healthy, that will help him a little. But if a person works to live in a way that makes God happy, that will help him much more. It will help that person in his life now on earth, and it will also help him in his future life with God in 
1TI.4.9	We know that those words are true. Everyone should agree with them. 
1TI.4.10	So, that is why we work to 
1TI.4.11	Teach people to do these things. 
1TI.4.12	You are still a young man, but everyone should 
1TI.4.12	What you say;
1TI.4.12	What you do;
1TI.4.12	How you love people;
1TI.4.12	How you 
1TI.4.12	How you do only what is right.
1TI.4.13	Until I come, be careful to do this: Read the Bible aloud to people. Teach them to understand and to obey the message about Christ. 
1TI.4.14	Remember the gift that God's 
1TI.4.15	Be careful to do all these things well. Then everyone will see that you are 
1TI.4.16	Think carefully about how you live, and about the message that you teach. Continue to teach God's true message. Then God will save not only you, but also those people who listen to you.
1TI.5.1	Do not speak against an older man to tell him what he must do. Instead, ask him in a kind way, like you would speak to your father. Speak to younger men like they were your brothers. 
1TI.5.2	Speak to older women as you would speak to your mother. Speak to younger women like they were your sisters, and always 
1TI.5.4	If a 
1TI.5.5	Some 
1TI.5.6	But some 
1TI.5.7	Teach everyone clearly to do those things. Then nobody can say that the 
1TI.5.8	Every 
1TI.5.9	If you want to put a 
1TI.5.10	People should know that she has done good things. For example, she must have been a good mother to her children. She must have received visitors into her home. She must have helped God's people as their servant. She must have taken 
1TI.5.11	But refuse to put the names of younger 
1TI.5.12	As a result, they will stop doing what they had earlier promised to do for the 
1TI.5.13	Young 
1TI.5.14	So, I think that 
1TI.5.15	But some of the younger 
1TI.5.16	A woman who believes in Christ should take 
1TI.5.17	Everyone should 
1TI.5.18	The Bible says: ‘You must not cover a cow's mouth when it is walking on the 
1TI.5.19	Somebody may tell you that a leader of the 
1TI.5.20	If a leader is really 
1TI.5.21	I say this to you very strongly: Obey what I am telling you to do. Remember that God himself and Christ Jesus, together with their special 
1TI.5.22	Do not hurry to put your hands on anyone to choose him as a leader of the 
1TI.5.23	(I know that you often become ill. So do not drink only water, but drink a little 
1TI.5.24	Some people do wrong things that everyone can see clearly. When those people are 
1TI.5.25	It is the same with the good things that people do. Many good things are clear for everyone to see. And even the good things that people do secretly will not remain a secret for ever.
1TI.6.1	All slaves who are 
1TI.6.2	Slaves who have masters who are also 
1TI.6.2	Teach these things and tell people to obey them. 
1TI.6.3	Some people teach a false message that is different. Their message does not agree with the true message that our 
1TI.6.4	People like that think that they are very clever. But they do not really understand anything. They like to argue about things which are not important. They like to quarrel about words. As a result, people become 
1TI.6.5	Their minds have become confused and they argue all the time. They refuse to believe God's true message. They think that they will become rich if they say that they are 
1TI.6.6	If we 
1TI.6.7	When we were born, we brought nothing with us into this world. When we die, we cannot take anything with us out of the world. 
1TI.6.8	So, if we have enough food and clothes, we should be happy with that.
1TI.6.9	But some people want to have lots of money. This leads them to do wrong things. They are like fools when they want things for themselves. They cannot get free from their bad ways, which only hurt them. In the end, the bad thoughts of those people destroy their lives. 
1TI.6.10	When people like to have lots of money, that causes all kinds of bad things to happen. Some people have stopped believing the message about Christ because they just want to get more money. As a result, they have caused themselves to be very sad because they have many troubles.
1TI.6.11	But you, Timothy, are a servant of God. So, you must keep away from all bad things like that. Instead, always try to do what is right. 
1TI.6.12	Continue to believe God's true message. Be like someone who fights well to keep it safe. God has chosen you to live with him for ever. You stood in front of many people and said clearly that you believed in Jesus Christ. So, live in a way that shows that you belong to him.
1TI.6.13	Christ Jesus himself spoke clearly God's true message when he stood in front of Pontius Pilate. I now say this to you, in front of God who causes all things to be alive, and in front of Jesus. 
1TI.6.14	I tell you strongly to obey the true message. Obey it completely without any mistake until our 
1TI.6.15	God will cause Christ to appear clearly at the proper time. God is great, and he alone rules with all authority. He is the greatest King and the most powerful 
1TI.6.16	God alone can never die. He lives in very bright light that nobody can come near. No human person has ever seen God. Nobody is able to see him. So, we 
1TI.6.18	Tell those rich people to do many good things to help other people. That is the way in which they should be rich. They should be very kind to other people and 
1TI.6.19	In that way they will store valuable things for themselves in 
1TI.6.20	Timothy, God has given you his true message to tell people. You must keep that message safe. Do not listen to people who say a lot of silly things that are not important to God. Those people think that they know about special things. But their ideas are against God's true message. 
1TI.6.21	Some people have believed those wrong ideas and now they no longer 
1TI.6.21	I pray that God will continue to be very kind to all of you there.
2TI.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an 
2TI.1.2	I am writing to you, Timothy. You are like my own child, and I love you very much.
2TI.1.2	I pray that God the Father and Christ Jesus our 
2TI.1.3	I 
2TI.1.4	I remember how you wept when I said ‘Goodbye’ to you. I want to see you again very much, so that I may be completely happy. 
2TI.1.5	I remember how you really believe in Christ. Your grandmother, Lois, and your mother, Eunice, already believed in Christ before you did. Now I am sure that you yourself really 
2TI.1.6	For that reason, I want you to remember the gift that God gave you when I put my hands on you. Use that gift more and more to 
2TI.1.7	Be strong like that, because God has given us his 
2TI.1.8	So do not be ashamed of the message about our 
2TI.1.9	God is the one who has saved us. He has chosen us to 
2TI.1.10	Now Christ Jesus has come to save us, and we have seen how kind God is. Christ has destroyed death's power over us. We have heard the good news that he brought to us. So now we understand about life with God for ever.
2TI.1.11	That is the same good news that God has chosen me to tell to people. He has sent me as his 
2TI.1.12	That is why I have these troubles. But I am not ashamed to be in prison. I have believed in Christ and I know him well. I know that I can 
2TI.1.13	You have God's true message from me. Let those words be an example to you, so that you also teach what is true. Do this because you belong to Christ Jesus. Continue to 
2TI.1.14	God has given you his good message to keep safe. God's 
2TI.1.15	You know that almost all the 
2TI.1.16	But Onesiphorus has stayed to help me. I pray that the 
2TI.1.17	When he came here to Rome, he looked carefully for me until he found me. 
2TI.1.18	I pray that the 
2TI.2.1	Timothy, you are like my own child. Let God make you strong. 
2TI.2.2	You have heard the message that I have taught. Many other people also heard it and they agree that it is true. Now you must tell the same message to other people who will be able to teach it to even more people. Those should be people that you can trust as honest people and who can teach well.
2TI.2.3	Be patient through the troubles that we Christians have. Be brave and strong, like a good soldier for Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	Any soldier who fights in a war does not become busy with other things. He only wants to fight well to make his captain happy. 
2TI.2.5	It is the same with an 
2TI.2.6	A farmer works very much to grow plants for food. So, he should be the first person to receive some of that food. 
2TI.2.7	Think carefully about what I am saying to you. The 
2TI.2.8	Jesus Christ came from King David's family. 
2TI.2.9	And I receive many troubles because I tell that good news to people. They have even tied me up in a prison, like someone who has done something bad. But nobody can keep God's message in a prison!
2TI.2.10	So I continue to be patient and brave during all these troubles. I do that so that I can help the people that God has chosen to belong to him. I want God to save them also, because of what Christ Jesus has done for them. As a result, they will live with God for ever, in the beautiful place where he lives.
2TI.2.11	We all know that this is true:
2TI.2.11	‘If we have died with Christ in this world,
2TI.2.11	we will also live with him in the future world. 
2TI.2.12	If we continue to be strong during troubles here,
2TI.2.12	we will also rule with him there in 
2TI.2.12	But if we say that we do not know Christ,
2TI.2.12	he will also say that he does not know us.
2TI.2.13	Even if we no longer 
2TI.2.13	he will still be someone that we can 
2TI.2.13	He will always remain true to his 
2TI.2.14	Continue to tell these things to God's people there, so that they remember them. Use God's authority and 
2TI.2.15	Always try very much to 
2TI.2.16	But stay away from people who talk about silly things that are not important to God. A message like that causes people to live more and more in a way that does not make God happy. 
2TI.2.17	It causes people to become sick in their 
2TI.2.18	They no longer teach God's true message. They say that God will not raise dead people any more, because he has already given life to dead people. In this way they have confused the minds of some people, so that they no longer believe in Christ.
2TI.2.19	But the group of true 
2TI.2.20	In a big house, there are different kinds of dishes. There are some dishes that people have made from gold or from 
2TI.2.21	It is like that with people who serve God as their Master. People who keep themselves clean from those bad things will be like valuable dishes. Their master can use them for a special purpose. They will be ready for him to use them for every kind of good work.
2TI.2.22	Be careful not to do the kind of bad things that young people often want to do. Instead, always try to do what is right and fair. Continue to 
2TI.2.23	Do not join with people who want to argue about silly things that do not mean anything. You know that silly things like that only cause people to quarrel. 
2TI.2.24	As the 
2TI.2.25	When people speak against God's true message, teach them carefully. Help them to understand what is right. Maybe God will change how they think so that they believe the true message. 
2TI.2.26	Their minds will start to think clearly. It is the 
2TI.3.1	Let me tell you this. During the last days of this world, there will be times of great trouble. 
2TI.3.2	People will love only themselves, and they will want lots of money for themselves. They will be 
2TI.3.3	They will not be kind to other people, but they will like to quarrel. They will tell 
2TI.3.4	People will turn against their friends. They will do silly things and not think carefully about it. They will be sure that they are very important. They will not love God, but instead they will only want to enjoy themselves. 
2TI.3.5	Those people will seem to be 
2TI.3.6	Among those people, there are some men who get into people's homes. They get power over silly women who feel very 
2TI.3.7	These women are always trying to learn new things. But they can never really understand God's true message. 
2TI.3.8	These false teachers speak against God's true message, in the same way that Jannes and Jambres spoke against Moses. Their minds have become confused. The way that they 
2TI.3.9	But they will not continue to do many more bad things. Everyone will see clearly that they are fools. That is just what happened to Jannes and Jambres. 
2TI.3.10	But you, Timothy, have heard my message and you know it well. You also know the way in which I have lived. You know my purpose in life. You know how I 
2TI.3.11	You also know what happened to me in the cities called Antioch, Iconium and Lystra. People caused be to have a lot of trouble and pain in those places. But I was patient and brave in those bad troubles! And the 
2TI.3.12	It is not only me. Every Christian who wants to 
2TI.3.13	Bad people like that will become even worse. Some of them will teach a false message, and people will believe their 
2TI.3.14	But you must continue to believe the things that you have learned. You know that those things are true. You know the teachers who taught you those things. 
2TI.3.15	Even when you were a child, you already knew the message of the Bible. The Bible has taught you how you can be really wise. You understand that God saves you because you believe in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	Everything that is written in the Bible comes from God's Spirit. It helps us in many ways. The Bible teaches us what is true. It 
2TI.3.17	As a result, people who want to 
2TI.4.1	Timothy, I tell you this seriously, as God and Christ Jesus know everything that we do. When Christ Jesus comes to rule as king, he will 
2TI.4.2	Tell God's message to people. Always be ready to speak God's message clearly to people, whether they want to listen to you or not. 
2TI.4.3	Do this, because a time will come when people will not listen to God's true message. Instead, they will want to hear all kinds of new messages that will make them happy. So they will find many teachers for themselves who will tell them what they want to hear. 
2TI.4.4	People will refuse to listen to God's true message. Instead, they will want to listen to silly stories that are false. 
2TI.4.5	But you yourself must continue to think seriously and clearly. Be patient and brave when troubles come. Continue to tell the good news about Christ to people. Do all the work that God has given you to do as his servant.
2TI.4.6	As for me, it is nearly time for me to die. My death will be like a drink 
2TI.4.7	I have worked to 
2TI.4.8	So now a gift is waiting for me. The 
2TI.4.9	Timothy, please come to see me as soon as you can. 
2TI.4.10	Demas has left me and he has gone to Thessalonica city. He wanted to enjoy the things of this world too much. 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me now. 
2TI.4.12	I have now sent Tychicus to Ephesus city. 
2TI.4.13	I left a coat with Carpus at Troas city. Bring it when you come. Also bring the books for me. If you cannot bring all of them, then at least bring my special papers. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander, the man who makes things from metal, caused a lot of trouble for me. The 
2TI.4.15	You must also be careful that he does not cause trouble for you. He argued very strongly against our message.
2TI.4.16	I had to explain to a 
2TI.4.17	But the 
2TI.4.18	Yes, the 
2TI.4.19	Say ‘hello’ for me to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the family of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus remained at Corinth city. 
2TI.4.21	Please try to come before the winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia say ‘hello’ to you. All the other 
2TI.4.22	I pray that the 
TIT.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. I am God's servant and an 
TIT.1.2	They will also be sure that they will live with God for ever. Before the world began, God promised that his people will have life with him. And God never tells 
TIT.1.3	God is the one who saves us. Now, at the proper time, he has made his message clear. He has given his message to me so that I will tell it to people. That is what he has told me to do.
TIT.1.4	I am writing to you, Titus. I told you the message about Jesus and now we both believe in him. So you are like my own child.
TIT.1.4	I pray that God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, who saves us, will continue to help you. I pray that they will give you 
TIT.1.5	I left you there in Crete so that you could finish certain things. You should make right some things that were wrong. And you should choose leaders of the 
TIT.1.6	This is what a leader in the 
TIT.1.7	A leader in the 
TIT.1.8	Instead, he must be happy to have visitors in his home. He must want to do good things. He must be careful in how he lives. He must do what is right. He must want to 
TIT.1.9	A leader in the 
TIT.1.10	I say this because there are many people who teach false things that have no value. They do not obey anyone and they want people to believe their false message. The people who want the 
TIT.1.11	You must not let those people continue to teach false things like that. They are causing whole families to believe their 
TIT.1.12	Many years ago, there was a certain man who lived on Crete. The people there called him their 
TIT.1.13	What that man said is true. So, you must 
TIT.1.14	They must stop listening to those 
TIT.1.15	If someone is clean and good inside, then everything is clean and good for them to enjoy. But if someone is not a believer and has a dirty mind, then nothing is clean or good for that person. Their minds have become spoiled. They no longer feel 
TIT.1.16	People like that say that they know God. But the bad things that they do show that they do not know him. They are completely bad. They refuse to obey God and they are unable to do anything good.
TIT.2.1	But as for you, Titus, you must teach people to do what is right. Teach them only the things that belong to God's true message. 
TIT.2.2	Tell the older men to rule themselves well. They must think carefully about how they live, so that people 
TIT.2.3	Also, tell the older women to live in good way. Their lives must show that they 
TIT.2.4	In that way, they can teach the young women how they should live. As a result, the young women will love their husbands and their children. 
TIT.2.5	The young women must rule themselves well, so that they always do what is proper. They must be good housewives and they must be kind to other people. They must 
TIT.2.6	As for the young men, tell them also to think carefully about how they live. 
TIT.2.7	You yourself must always do good things too. In that way, you will show the young men how they shoud live. When you teach the 
TIT.2.8	Teach a message that is correct, so that nobody can say anything against it. Then our 
TIT.2.9	As for slaves, tell them to obey their masters always. They must not argue with their masters, but they should work well to make them happy. 
TIT.2.10	Slaves must not take things that belong to their masters. Instead, their masters must be able to 
TIT.2.11	God has shown us clearly how very kind he is. He has now come to save all people. 
TIT.2.12	Because God is kind, he teaches us to stop living in a bad way. We no longer do the bad things that do not make God happy. We turn away from the bad things that belong to this world. God teaches us to rule ourselves properly while we live in this world. He teaches us to do what is right. He teaches us to 
TIT.2.13	Remember this: We are waiting for Jesus Christ to return to this world. When he comes, that will make us very happy. Everyone will see how great Jesus Christ is. He is our great God. He is the one who saves us from our 
TIT.2.14	He gave himself as a 
TIT.2.15	You must teach these things to the 
TIT.3.1	Tell the 
TIT.3.2	They must not say bad things against anyone. They must not quarrel with people. Instead, they should be kind and polite to everyone.
TIT.3.3	Before we believed in Christ, we ourselves were fools too. We did not obey God. We believed a false message. We wanted to do many kinds of bad things, and we could not stop doing them. Every day we did bad things. We were jealous of other people. People 
TIT.3.4	But then God saved us from our 
TIT.3.5	God did not save us because of any good things that we ourselves had done. He saved us because he chose to 
TIT.3.6	Jesus Christ died as a 
TIT.3.7	Because God is very kind, he has accepted us as right with himself. As a result, we know that we will receive the good things that God has prepared for us. We know that we will live with God for ever.
TIT.3.8	That message is certainly true. I want you to teach clearly the things that I have said in this letter. Make sure that the people understand them well. Then the people who have believed in God will be careful to do good things. Good things like that will help everyone.
TIT.3.9	But stay away from people who argue about silly things. They study long lists of their families' names from years ago. Refuse to quarrel with people like that. Refuse to argue about the rules in God's 
TIT.3.10	If someone teaches a falsemessage that causes trouble, 
TIT.3.11	You know that a person like that has chosen not to believe the true message. He knows that he is doing a bad thing, but he continues to do it.
TIT.3.12	I will send either Artemas or Tychicus to you. After one of them has arrived, please come as soon as possible to meet me in Nicopolis city. I have decided that I will stay at Nicopolis during the winter. 
TIT.3.13	Please help Zenas (the 
TIT.3.14	Our Christian friends there must learn to do good things. They should supply things to people who need help. That will show that their lives really do help people.
TIT.3.15	Everyone who is here with me says ‘hello’ to you. Please say ‘hello’ on our behalf to the 
PHM.1.1	This letter is from me, Paul. I am in prison because I 
PHM.1.1	We are writing to you, Philemon. You are our friend, and we love you. You work on behalf of Christ, as we do. 
PHM.1.2	We say ‘hello’ also to Apphia, who is like a sister to us. And we say ‘hello’ to Archippus, who 
PHM.1.3	I pray that God, our Father, and the 
PHM.1.4	When I pray for you, I always thank my God when I think about you. 
PHM.1.5	I thank God because people tell me good things about you. You love all God's people and you trust in the 
PHM.1.6	We each have the same 
PHM.1.7	My friend, you have helped God's people to feel stronger. Your love for them has made me very happy. It makes me feel stronger too.
PHM.1.8	I want to ask you to do something. I am sure that Christ has given me authority. So I could tell you strongly what you should do. 
PHM.1.9	But instead, because of love, I will ask you, ‘Please do it.’ I, Paul, am an old man. Also, I am in prison now because I 
PHM.1.10	So I am asking you to help Onesimus, who is like my own child. I taught him about Jesus while I was in prison. Because of that, he now has life with God. I am like his father. 
PHM.1.11	Before he 
PHM.1.12	So I am now sending him back to you. Because I love him, it is like I am sending you my own 
PHM.1.13	I wanted to keep him here with me, to help me on your behalf. I am in prison here because I taught people the good news about Jesus. 
PHM.1.14	But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed. I wanted you to help me because you really want to help. I did not want to make you do it.
PHM.1.15	When Onesimus ran away from you, perhaps God let that happen. Onesimus left you for a short time so that you could now have him back for ever. 
PHM.1.16	You can have him back again not only as your slave. He will be something much better than a slave for you. He will be like a brother that you love. I love him very much. But now you will love him even more. He will 
PHM.1.17	I am your friend. Together we 
PHM.1.18	If Onesimus has done anything wrong to you, I will make it right again. If he took money from you, I will pay it back. Just tell me. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing this myself: ‘I will pay the money back to you.’ But you should remember what I have given you already. You have life with God because I told you the good news about Jesus. 
PHM.1.20	Yes, my friend, you should help me, because we both belong to the 
PHM.1.21	I am sure that you will do what I ask. That is why I have written this letter to you. I know that you will do even more than this to help me.
PHM.1.22	I want to ask you one more thing. Please prepare a room in your home where I can stay. I know that all of you are praying for God to let me go free. As a result, I hope that I will be able to visit you again.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras is also here in prison with me because he 
PHM.1.24	Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, who work with me here, say ‘hello’ to you also.
PHM.1.25	I pray that the 
HEB.1.1	Many years ago, God spoke to our 
HEB.1.2	But in these last days, he has spoken to us in his Son. In the beginning, God made the whole world and everything that there is. He decided that everything should belong to his Son. It was the Son himself who made all things, on God's behalf. 
HEB.1.3	The Son shows us completely what God is like. He shines with the great light of God himself. His 
HEB.1.4	That shows us that God's Son is much greater than the 
HEB.1.5	God never said this to any 
HEB.1.5	‘You are my Son.
HEB.1.5	Today I have become your Father.’
HEB.1.5	In another place in the Bible, God says,
HEB.1.5	‘I will be his Father,
HEB.1.5	and he will be my Son.’
HEB.1.6	Also, when God is going to bring his greatest Son into the world, he says:
HEB.1.6	‘All God's 
HEB.1.7	God speaks about the 
HEB.1.7	‘God makes his 
HEB.1.7	They 
HEB.1.8	But this is what God says to his Son:
HEB.1.8	‘You are God and you will rule as King for ever!
HEB.1.8	You will rule your 
HEB.1.9	You love everything that is right.
HEB.1.9	And you 
HEB.1.9	Because of that, you will be completely happy.
HEB.1.9	I am your God and I have 
HEB.1.9	I have chosen you to be greater than others who are with you.’
HEB.1.10	The Bible also says this:
HEB.1.10	‘
HEB.1.10	With your own power, you also made everything above the earth.
HEB.1.11	All these things will spoil and come to an end.
HEB.1.11	But as for you, you will continue for ever.
HEB.1.11	Like clothes, those things will all become old.
HEB.1.12	Then you will put them away like an old coat.
HEB.1.12	You will change them, like people change clothes.
HEB.1.12	But you will always continue to be the same.
HEB.1.12	Your life will never come to an end.’
HEB.1.13	Also, God has never said this to any of the 
HEB.1.13	‘Sit at my right side until I win against your enemies completely.
HEB.1.13	Then you will be able to put your feet on them.’
HEB.1.14	So, we see that all the 
HEB.2.1	So we must be very careful. We must continue to remember the message that we have heard about God's Son. Then we will not go in the wrong direction, and turn away from God. 
HEB.2.2	The message that God spoke by 
HEB.2.3	As for us, God has shown us the way in which he will save us from our 
HEB.2.4	God himself also showed clearly that what these people said is true. He did many 
HEB.2.5	We are speaking about the new world that will come. God did not choose 
HEB.2.6	No. Instead, someone wrote this somewhere in the Bible:
HEB.2.6	‘
HEB.2.6	You take care of men and women,
HEB.2.6	even though they do not seem to be important.
HEB.2.7	For a short time you made them less important than the 
HEB.2.7	But then you made them great and powerful, like kings.
HEB.2.8	You caused them to rule over everything.’ 
HEB.2.8	It says that God has caused people to rule over everything. That means that there is nothing that people do not have authority over. But at this time, we do not yet see that people rule over everything. 
HEB.2.9	But we do see Jesus! God made him less important than the 
HEB.2.10	It was right that God should bring Jesus back to 
HEB.2.11	Jesus is the one who makes people 
HEB.2.12	He says this to God about it:
HEB.2.12	‘I will tell my brothers and sisters that you are great.
HEB.2.12	When your people meet together,
HEB.2.12	I will stand with them,
HEB.2.12	and I will 
HEB.2.13	He also says this:
HEB.2.13	‘I will 
HEB.2.13	He says this too:
HEB.2.13	‘I stand here with the children that God has given me.’ 
HEB.2.14	So, those people who become God's children are human people. They have human bodies. Because of that, Jesus himself became a human person like us. In that way, when he died he was able to destroy the 
HEB.2.15	Before, we were like slaves all our lives because we were afraid of death. But now, Jesus' death makes us free. 
HEB.2.16	It is clear that Jesus did not come to help the 
HEB.2.17	Because of that, it was necessary for Jesus to become completely like us, his brothers and sisters. He had to become God's servant on our behalf, like God's most important 
HEB.2.18	While Jesus lived on earth, the 
HEB.3.1	So, Christian friends, think carefully about who Jesus is. Like us, God has chosen you to belong to him. We tell people that we believe in Jesus as the 
HEB.3.2	That is what God sent Jesus to do. Jesus did everything that God wanted, just like Moses. Moses also 
HEB.3.3	We know that someone who builds a house is more important than the house itself. In the same way, we should 
HEB.3.4	Every house has someone who built it. But God is the one who has built all things. 
HEB.3.5	We say that Moses 
HEB.3.6	But Christ 
HEB.3.7	God's 
HEB.3.7	‘You must listen when you hear God speak today.
HEB.3.8	Do not refuse to obey him.
HEB.3.8	Do not be like God's people many years ago.
HEB.3.8	When they travelled in the 
HEB.3.8	They wanted to see if I would 
HEB.3.9	For 40 years your 
HEB.3.9	But they still did not obey me.
HEB.3.10	That is why I became angry with those people.
HEB.3.10	I said, “They always want to do what is wrong.
HEB.3.10	They refuse to understand my message.”
HEB.3.11	Because of that, I promised to 
HEB.3.11	Because I was angry with them, I said,
HEB.3.11	“They will never arrive in my special place of rest.” ’ 
HEB.3.12	So be careful, my Christian friends. Do not refuse to 
HEB.3.13	Instead, help each other to be strong every day. Today, you can still hear God's message. While that is still true, do not refuse to obey God. Do not think that 
HEB.3.14	We must continue to 
HEB.3.15	We have seen what the Bible says:
HEB.3.15	‘You must listen when you hear God speak today.
HEB.3.15	Do not refuse to obey him.
HEB.3.15	Do not be like God's people many years ago,
HEB.3.15	when they turned against God.’
HEB.3.16	That is speaking about all the people that Moses led away from Egypt. They heard God's message, but they refused to obey him. 
HEB.3.17	God was angry with those same people for 40 years. They did what was wrong. So they died and their bodies remained in the 
HEB.3.18	God promised to 
HEB.3.19	So we must be careful ourselves! Those people did not 
HEB.4.1	God promised his people that they could go to his special place of rest. That promise is still true for us today. So we must be very careful. Do not fail to arrive in that place. We certainly do not want that to happen. 
HEB.4.2	We have heard God's good news, just like God's people in the 
HEB.4.3	But those of us who do 
HEB.4.3	‘Because I was very angry with them, I promised this:
HEB.4.3	“They will never arrive in my special place of rest.” ’
HEB.4.3	God said that, even though he had finished his work when he made the world. 
HEB.4.4	In the Bible God has spoken about the seventh day like this:
HEB.4.4	‘God rested from all his work on the seventh day.’
HEB.4.5	As we have already seen, God said something later about his rest:
HEB.4.5	‘They will never arrive in my special place of rest.’
HEB.4.6	So we see that there is still a chance for people to go to God's place of rest. But those people who first heard God's message in the 
HEB.4.7	So God chose another time for people to go to his place of rest. He called it ‘Today’. A long time after Moses, David spoke God's message. As we have already seen, he said:
HEB.4.7	‘You must listen when you hear God speak today.
HEB.4.7	Do not refuse to obey him.’
HEB.4.8	This shows that Joshua did not bring God's people to the place where they could rest. Because later, God had to speak again about another day of rest. 
HEB.4.9	So, we see this: God still has a place ready for his people, where they can rest. They will rest like God rested on the seventh day. 
HEB.4.10	When God made the world and everything, he rested after he had finished his work. It is the same for everyone who goes to God's place of rest. They too will rest. They will no longer need to work. 
HEB.4.11	So we must do everything possible to arrive in God's special place of rest. God's people in the 
HEB.4.12	So, be careful! God's message to us is alive and powerful. It is like a 
HEB.4.13	There is nothing in the whole world that can hide from God. He sees everything clearly and he knows everything. And we will have to explain to him everything that we have done during our lives.
HEB.4.14	Jesus, the 
HEB.4.15	Jesus, our great 
HEB.4.16	So, we should come near to God and we should not be afraid. God is our King. We can ask him to help us when we need help. We know that he will 
HEB.5.1	Every leader of God's 
HEB.5.2	That 
HEB.5.3	But, because he himself does wrong things, he must offer sacrifices to God on behalf of himself, as well as on behalf of the people.
HEB.5.4	Nobody decides for himself to become a leader of the 
HEB.5.5	It is the same with Christ. He did not choose himself to be God's special 
HEB.5.5	‘You are my Son.
HEB.5.5	Today I have become your Father.’
HEB.5.6	And in another place in the Bible God says this:
HEB.5.6	‘You will be a 
HEB.5.6	in the same way that Melchizedek was a 
HEB.5.7	When Jesus Christ lived on earth as a man, he often prayed to God. He asked God to help him. He prayed strongly and he cried with tears. He knew that God could save him from death. And God listened to Jesus when he prayed, because Jesus 
HEB.5.8	Jesus is God's Son. But he still had trouble and pain. In that way he learned to obey God completely. 
HEB.5.9	As a result, Jesus became the person who can save everyone who obeys him. Because of Jesus, God 
HEB.5.10	God has chosen Jesus to be his special 
HEB.5.11	We have a lot more to say to you about these things. But you understand things very slowly. As a result, it is difficult to explain any more to you now. 
HEB.5.12	After all this time as 
HEB.5.13	Anyone who still thinks like a baby does not yet understand God's message about what is right. It is like they are still drinking only milk. 
HEB.5.14	People who have grown up eat proper food. In the same way, people who have been 
HEB.6.1	So we must go on from the first lessons that we learned about Christ. We must grow as 
HEB.6.2	We have already learned about how to become clean. 
HEB.6.3	Yes, we must choose to go on from those early lessons! God is ready to help us to do that.
HEB.6.4	That is important, because we must not turn away from Christ, after we have first believed in him. Some people have come into God's light. They have understood God's message. They have started to enjoy the true life that God has given them. They have received the 
HEB.6.5	They have understood that God's message is good for them. They have seen powerful things that belong to the future time. 
HEB.6.6	But after all that, they have turned against God. Then it is impossible for anyone to help them to turn away from their 
HEB.6.7	Think about a field where rain has fallen many times. That ground helps the plants in it to grow well. As a result, the farmer receives good things. It shows that God has 
HEB.6.8	But a field where only weeds and 
HEB.6.9	We are telling you this, our good friends, because we want you to continue well. We are sure that God has saved you and that he will continue to 
HEB.6.10	God is always right and fair. He will not forget all the good things that you have done. You have shown that you love him very much, because you have helped the other 
HEB.6.11	But we very much want each of you to continue to 
HEB.6.12	Then you will not become slow to learn. Instead, you will copy the example of those people who continue to 
HEB.6.13	God made a promise to Abraham many years ago. God used the authority of his own name to show that his promise was true. He did that because there was nobody greater than God himself. His name showed that the promise was very serious. 
HEB.6.14	God said to Abraham, ‘I will certainly 
HEB.6.15	Abraham waited patiently for a long time. In the end, he received what God had promised to give him. 
HEB.6.16	When someone make a strong promise, he uses the authority of a person who is greater than himself. This shows that he will certainly obey his promise. Then nobody can argue about it. 
HEB.6.17	God wanted to show very clearly that he would never change his purpose. He wanted his people to know that he would certainly 
HEB.6.18	Those two things can never change. God cannot tell a lie. As a result, we can be brave and strong. We have 
HEB.6.19	We can be completely sure about those good things that we hope for. That keeps our thoughts strong, because we know that our life is safe with God. It is like an 
HEB.6.20	Jesus has already gone in there. He has gone there before us, on our behalf. He has become our special 
HEB.7.1	Melchizedek was the King of a city called Salem. He was also a 
HEB.7.2	Also, Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth part of everything that he had won in the fight. 
HEB.7.3	Nobody wrote down that Melchizedek had a father or a mother. Nobody wrote down that he had any 
HEB.7.4	So, think about how great this man, Melchizedek, was! Even Abraham, the 
HEB.7.5	Men from Levi's family group who become 
HEB.7.6	As for Melchizedek, he did not come from Levi's family. But he still received a tenth part of what Abraham had. He also asked God to 
HEB.7.7	It is always the more important person who asks God to 
HEB.7.8	The 
HEB.7.9+HEB.7.10	The 
HEB.7.11	The 
HEB.7.12	When there is a change in the kind of 
HEB.7.13	It is the 
HEB.7.14	We know that our 
HEB.7.15	What we have said becomes even clearer now. Another kind of 
HEB.7.16	Jesus did not become a 
HEB.7.17	The Bible speaks about him as a 
HEB.7.17	‘You will be a 
HEB.7.17	in the same way that Melchizedek was God's 
HEB.7.18	So the old 
HEB.7.19	God's 
HEB.7.20	Also, when God said that Jesus would be his special 
HEB.7.21	But when Jesus became God's 
HEB.7.21	‘The 
HEB.7.21	He will not change his mind.
HEB.7.21	You will be a 
HEB.7.22	Because God promised that to Jesus, we know that his new 
HEB.7.23	In the old way, there were many 
HEB.7.24	But Jesus lives for ever, so he will never stop being a 
HEB.7.25	Jesus is always alive and he asks God to help his people. So, he can completely save everyone who believes in him. He will lead them to God.
HEB.7.26	Jesus is the kind of special 
HEB.7.27	Jesus is not like the 
HEB.7.28	In the old 
HEB.8.1	The most important thing that we are saying is this: In Jesus, we do have this kind of special 
HEB.8.2	He 
HEB.8.3	It is the duty of every special 
HEB.8.4	If he was living on earth, then he would not be a 
HEB.8.5	But the way that those 
HEB.8.6	But now God has given Jesus much better way to 
HEB.8.7	If there had been nothing wrong with that first 
HEB.8.8	But God did find something wrong with it. As a result, he said this to his people:
HEB.8.8	‘Listen to this! The Lord says:
HEB.8.8	A time will come when I will make a new 
HEB.8.8	That is, with 
HEB.8.9	It will not be like the 
HEB.8.9	At that time I led my people out of the country called Egypt.
HEB.8.9	I led them like a father who takes his child's hand.
HEB.8.9	But they did not continue to obey my 
HEB.8.9	So I turned away from them.
HEB.8.9	That is what the 
HEB.8.10	But now the Lord says this:
HEB.8.10	After the time of that old 
HEB.8.10	I will make a new 
HEB.8.10	It will be like this:
HEB.8.10	I will put my 
HEB.8.10	I will write my 
HEB.8.10	I will be their God and they will be my people.
HEB.8.11	As a result, nobody will have to teach their friends about me.
HEB.8.11	They will never need to say to their family, “You should know the 
HEB.8.11	This is because everyone will know me.
HEB.8.11	The least important people will know me,
HEB.8.11	and the greatest people will know me too.
HEB.8.12	I will be kind to them.
HEB.8.12	I will 
HEB.8.12	I will not continue to remember their 
HEB.8.12	That is what the 
HEB.8.13	We see that God was speaking about a new 
HEB.9.1	The first 
HEB.9.2	's people made a special 
HEB.9.3	Behind a second curtain, there was a very special room. It was called the Most 
HEB.9.4	The gold 
HEB.9.5	The shapes of two special 
HEB.9.6	So, that was how they prepared the special 
HEB.9.7	But only the special leader of the 
HEB.9.8	In this way, God's 
HEB.9.9	This is like a picture that means something for us today. It teaches us about the gifts and 
HEB.9.10	The old rules taught people about different kinds of food and drink. They taught about how people should wash in special ways. Those rules were about people's bodies. They had authority only until the time when God would make things new and better.
HEB.9.11	But now Christ has come as our special 
HEB.9.12	Christ went into the Most 
HEB.9.13	The old rules said that the 
HEB.9.14	But the blood of Christ's 
HEB.9.15	So, by Christ's death, God brings a new 
HEB.9.16	Think about this. A person may make an 
HEB.9.17	The 
HEB.9.18	So, even God's first 
HEB.9.19	It was like this. Moses read God's 
HEB.9.20	When Moses did this, he said to the people, ‘This blood shows that God's 
HEB.9.21	In the same way, Moses threw some of the blood on to the 
HEB.9.22	God's 
HEB.9.23	The 
HEB.9.24	Christ did not go into a 
HEB.9.25	The leader of the 
HEB.9.26	To do that, he would need to die again and again, many times since the world began. No! Christ has appeared just once. He has appeared now, when time is near its end. He came and he died as a 
HEB.9.27	Every person must die only once. After death, God will 
HEB.9.28	Christ also died only once as a 
HEB.10.1	God's 
HEB.10.2	If the old rules could do that, the 
HEB.10.3	But as it is, those 
HEB.10.4	We know that the blood of cows and of goats cannot remove the 
HEB.10.5	So, when Christ came into the world, he said to his Father,
HEB.10.5	‘You have not wanted people to offer 
HEB.10.5	Instead, you have prepared a body for me to offer to you.
HEB.10.6	If people burn whole animals as a 
HEB.10.6	or if they offer a 
HEB.10.6	that does not make you happy.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, “Here I am, my God.
HEB.10.7	I have come to do what you want.
HEB.10.7	That is what it says about me in the Bible.” ’
HEB.10.8	So think about what Christ said there. First he said to God, ‘You have not wanted gifts and 
HEB.10.9	Then Christ said, ‘Here I am. I have come to do what you want.’ In that way, Christ took away the first agreement and its rules about 
HEB.10.10	Jesus Christ was ready to do what God wanted. He offered his own body to God once, for all time. Because of Christ's 
HEB.10.11	Every day, the 
HEB.10.12	But Christ, our special 
HEB.10.13	Since then, he waits for God to win against his enemies completely. They will become like a place for him to put his feet. 
HEB.10.14	So, as a result of his one 
HEB.10.15	God's 
HEB.10.16	‘The 
HEB.10.16	After the time of the old 
HEB.10.16	I will make a new 
HEB.10.16	It will be like this:
HEB.10.16	I will put my 
HEB.10.16	I will write them into their thoughts.’
HEB.10.17	Then he says this:
HEB.10.17	‘I will not continue to remember their 
HEB.10.17	when they do not obey my 
HEB.10.18	So, that is the way that God 
HEB.10.19	So then, Christian friends, we see that Jesus died as a 
HEB.10.20	Jesus has opened a new way for us to come near to God. That way gives us life with God. It leads us through the curtain into God's Most 
HEB.10.21	We have a great 
HEB.10.22	So we should come near to God and we should not be afraid. But we must be honest and we must continue to 
HEB.10.23	We know that we can 
HEB.10.24	We should think about how we can help one another. We want everyone to show love to each other. We want everyone to do good thigs to help one another. 
HEB.10.25	Some people have stopped meeting with the group of Christians. But that is not good. We should all continue to meet together. We need to help one another to be strong and brave. That is now even more important, because the 
HEB.10.26	Now that we have learned what is really true, we must continue to believe in Jesus. If we know God's true message, but we continue to do wrong things anyway, God will not 
HEB.10.27	We know that God will 
HEB.10.28	In the old 
HEB.10.29	So think about a person who has turned against the 
HEB.10.30	We know God and his message. And God said this: ‘I am the one who will 
HEB.10.31	Yes, if God takes hold of you to 
HEB.10.32	Remember what happened to you in those early days. When you first understood the message about Christ, you had many troubles. But you continued to be strong. 
HEB.10.33	Sometimes people 
HEB.10.34	You were kind to Christians who were in prison. When people took away your own things, you still chose to be happy. You knew that you certainly had something better that would belong to you for ever. 
HEB.10.35	So continue to be strong in your thoughts. If you continue to 
HEB.10.36	You need to be patient and strong. Then you will continue to do what God wants. As a result, you will receive what God has promised. 
HEB.10.37	This is what the Bible says:
HEB.10.37	‘In a very short time,
HEB.10.37	my special servant will come.
HEB.10.37	He is the one that I promised to send to you.
HEB.10.37	He will not be late. 
HEB.10.38	The person that I have accepted as right will live.
HEB.10.38	That person will live because he 
HEB.10.38	But if any one of them is afraid and he turns back,
HEB.10.38	I will not be happy with that person.’ 
HEB.10.39	But we are not like those people who are afraid and who turn back. If we were, God would destroy us. But we are people who continue to 
HEB.11.1	This is what it means to 
HEB.11.2	It was because of their 
HEB.11.3	Because of 
HEB.11.4	Abel believed God. So he offered a better 
HEB.11.5	Enoch also believed God. Because of Enoch's 
HEB.11.6	Unless we 
HEB.11.7	Noah believed God too. God told Noah about bad things that would happen. Nobody could see what was going to happen, but Noah believed God's message. He was careful to do exactly what God told him. He built a large boat to save his family. As a result of his 
HEB.11.8	Abraham also believed God. When God told him to leave his home, he obeyed God. He left his home to go to another country, but he did not know where he was going. It was the place that God had promised to give to Abraham. 
HEB.11.9	Because of his 
HEB.11.10	We see that Abraham was waiting to live in God's special place. That is the city that God himself has built. God has made it very strong so that it will be there for ever. 
HEB.11.11	Abraham and his wife, Sarah, were too old to have children. But Abraham believed God's promise that they would have children. He trusted God to do what he had promised. As a result of his 
HEB.11.12	Abraham was so old that he was almost like a dead man. But from this one man there came very many grandchildren. His family became so large that nobody could count them. They were like the number of stars in the sky. They were as many as the bits of sand on the shore of the sea. 
HEB.11.13	All these people continued to believe God until they died. But they did not receive all the things that God had promised to give them. They were like people who saw those things far away. That made them happy. These people understood that they lived as strangers and travellers on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	People who live in that way show clearly that they expect to live somewhere else one day. That is a place where they will really be at home. 
HEB.11.15	They were not thinking about the country that they had left. They could have gone back there if they really wanted to. 
HEB.11.16	No, they wanted very much to go to a better place, in 
HEB.11.17	Here is another example of Abraham's 
HEB.11.18	God had said to Abraham, ‘It is through Isaac that your family will continue.’ 
HEB.11.19	But Abraham was sure that, if Isaac died, God could raise Isaac to life again. We could even say that is a picture of what really happened. It was like Abraham did receive Isaac back from death. 
HEB.11.20	Isaac himself also believed God. As a result of his 
HEB.11.21	Jacob believed God. As a result of his 
HEB.11.22	Joseph also believed God. At the end of his life, he spoke about what would happen to the family of 
HEB.11.23	Moses' parents believed God. When Moses was born, they hid him for three months. They saw that he was a very special child. As a result of their 
HEB.11.24	Moses himself also believed God. When he became a man, he refused to be called the son of the king's daughter. 
HEB.11.25	Instead, Moses chose to join with God's people. He chose to receive trouble and pain together with them. He did not want to live in the king's house and do wrong things. He would only be happy for a short time there. 
HEB.11.26	Moses could have been very rich in Egypt. But instead, he let people 
HEB.11.27	As a result of his 
HEB.11.28	As a result of his 
HEB.11.29	Because of their 
HEB.11.30	Because of their 
HEB.11.31	Rahab, who had been a 
HEB.11.32	I could say even more about other people who 
HEB.11.33	As a result of their 
HEB.11.34	Some of them put out fires that were burning very strongly. Some of them got away from people who wanted to kill them with a 
HEB.11.35	Some women who 
HEB.11.36	Other people who 
HEB.11.37	Some of them died when people killed them with stones. Some of them died when people cut them into two pieces. Some of them died when people killed them with 
HEB.11.38	These people who 
HEB.11.39	God said good things about all these people because they 
HEB.11.40	God had already decided to prepare something better for all of us. As a result, those people did not receive everything until we could join with them. 
HEB.12.1	So, we have learned about many people who 
HEB.12.2	As we run, we must always look towards Jesus. He is the one who 
HEB.12.3	So, think carefully about how Jesus lived on earth. Bad people did very bad things against him, but he continued to be strong. Think about him, and then you will not become weak as Christians. You will not stop 
HEB.12.4	You have been fighting against 
HEB.12.5	God speaks to you as his children. Do not ever forget these words in the Bible that will make you strong:
HEB.12.5	‘My son, when the 
HEB.12.5	do not easily forget it.
HEB.12.5	Do not be 
HEB.12.6	Because the 
HEB.12.6	He 
HEB.12.7	When you have troubles in your life, you must be patient and strong. Remember that God is teaching you what is right because you are his children. There has never been any son whose father did not 
HEB.12.8	God teaches all his children not to do wrong things. So if he does not 
HEB.12.9	Also, we have all had human fathers who 
HEB.12.10	Our human fathers 
HEB.12.11	 never makes us happy at the time when we receive it. No, the pain makes us sad. But later we know that the 
HEB.12.12	So, be strong as servants of God! If your hands feel weak, lift them up! If your knees are not strong, stand up straight! 
HEB.12.13	Walk straight in front of you, step by step! Your example will help other Christians to 
HEB.12.14	Do everything that you can to live in 
HEB.12.15	Remember that God is very kind. Nobody should refuse to let God help them. Make sure that nobody among you causes trouble so that people turn against God. A person who is angry against God is like poison. He spoils many other people's lives so that God does not accept them.
HEB.12.16	Make sure that nobody among you has sex in a wrong way. Be careful that nobody is careless about God's rules, like Esau was long ago. He gave away everything that he would have received as his father's first son. He gave it all away so that he could get only one meal. 
HEB.12.17	As you know, after that, he still wanted to receive those good things from his father. He wanted his father to ask God to 
HEB.12.18	You have come close to God. But you have not come to a place that you can touch, like the mountain called Sinai. That mountain burned with fire. But where the people stood, it was completely dark. They could not see at all. There was also a very strong wind and a storm. 
HEB.12.19	There was the loud sound of a 
HEB.12.20	They were very afraid of what God had told them. God had said, ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, you must kill it with stones.’ 
HEB.12.21	Even Moses was very afraid when he saw God's great power. He said, ‘I am full of 
HEB.12.22	But as 
HEB.12.23	All God's people meet together there. They are like his most important sons. They belong in 
HEB.12.24	You have come to Jesus, who brought the new 
HEB.12.25	So be careful! Always be ready to listen when God speaks. God used Moses as his servant on the earth to speak to 
HEB.12.26	At Sinai mountain many years ago, God's voice caused the earth to move strongly. But now God has promised this: ‘Once again I will cause the earth to move. But this time I will cause 
HEB.12.27	These words, ‘once again,’ show us that God will take away the things that he has made. All things on the earth that he causes to move will finish. After that, everything that he does not cause to move will continue to be there. 
HEB.12.28	But we receive a place where we will rule with God. We belong to God's kingdom, and nobody can ever move that! So, we should thank God. We should 
HEB.12.29	Remember that our God is like a fire. He destroys everything that is not good.
HEB.13.1	Continue to love each other like brothers and sisters. 
HEB.13.2	Always remember to be kind to strangers. Let them stay in your homes. In this way, some people have received 
HEB.13.3	Remember to help those 
HEB.13.4	When a man and a woman have married each other, they must each 
HEB.13.5	In the way that you live, do not want lots of money. Be happy with the things that you have. Be happy, because God has said this:
HEB.13.5	‘I will never leave you;
HEB.13.5	I will always be there with you.’
HEB.13.6	Because of that, we can bravely say this:
HEB.13.6	‘The 
HEB.13.6	so I will not be afraid.
HEB.13.6	I will not be afraid of anything that people can do to me.’
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders, who taught God's message to you. Think about the way in which they have lived and the good things that they have done. They have 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is always the same, yesterday and today and for ever. 
HEB.13.9	Some people teach all kinds of strange new things. Do not let them lead you away from God's true message. It is good that God is very kind to us. That is what makes us strong inside ourselves. Rules about what foods we should eat do not make us strong like that. Those rules have never helped the people who tried to obey them. 
HEB.13.10	Jesus is the 
HEB.13.11	In the old agreement, the leader of the 
HEB.13.12	In the same way, Jesus also died outside the city. He did that as a 
HEB.13.13	Jesus died like that in a place where people 
HEB.13.14	Here on earth, we who are 
HEB.13.15	So we should always 
HEB.13.16	Remember to be kind to other people. 
HEB.13.18	Pray to God for us. We are sure in our minds that we have done nothing wrong. We always want to do only what is right. 
HEB.13.19	The most important thing is this: Pray that I may come back to you soon.
HEB.13.20	I pray that God will help you. He is the one who gives us 
HEB.13.21	I pray that God will give you every good thing that you need to 
HEB.13.22	My Christian friends, please listen patiently to my message. This is only a short letter and I want to help you to be strong. 
HEB.13.23	I want to tell you about Timothy, who is like a brother to us. They have let him go out of prison, so that he is free now. If he arrives here soon, he will come with me when I travel to see you.
HEB.13.24	Say ‘hello’ on my behalf to your leaders and to all God's people. The Christians who have come here from Italy say ‘hello’ to you too. 
HEB.13.25	I pray that God will be very kind to all of you.
JAS.1.1	This letter is from me, James. I am a servant of God and the 
JAS.1.1	I am writing to the 12 
JAS.1.2	My Christian friends, continue to be happy, even when many kinds of trouble happen to you. 
JAS.1.3	God wants to see if you really 
JAS.1.4	So you should continue to 
JAS.1.5	But maybe you need to know how to be 
JAS.1.6	But when you ask God for something, you must 
JAS.1.7+JAS.1.8	A person who is like that never knows what to do. He has many ideas in his mind. He should not think that he will receive anything from the 
JAS.1.9	The 
JAS.1.10	And the 
JAS.1.11	The sun rises and it becomes very hot. Then the plants quickly become dry. Their flowers fall to the ground. They are no longer beautiful. In the same way, rich people will die when they are busy in their work. Then they will have nothing.
JAS.1.12	Some people continue to 
JAS.1.13	When troubles happen to you, you may want to do something bad. But do not say, ‘God is causing me to do wrong things.’ Nothing can make God do anything bad. And God does not try to make anyone do a wrong thing. 
JAS.1.14	It is our own thoughts that sometimes make us want to do a bad thing. When our thoughts are bad, they lead us in a bad way. 
JAS.1.15	We may agree to do what our bad thoughts tell us to do. When we do that, it becomes a 
JAS.1.16	My Christian friends, do not make a mistake. 
JAS.1.17	Remember that every good gift comes to us from God. He only does what will help us. He is our Father in 
JAS.1.18	He chose to make us his children. He used his true message to do that. Because of that, we are like the first gift that belongs to him from the 
JAS.1.19	Understand this, my Christian friends: We must all be careful to listen. We should not be too quick to speak. We should not get angry quickly. 
JAS.1.20	God wants you to do what is right. But when someone is angry, he does not do those right things. 
JAS.1.21	So, stop doing anything dirty. Stay away from the bad things that are all round you. God has put his message deep inside you, and it can save you. So, be careful to accept that message.
JAS.1.22	But be careful to do what God says in his message. Do not only listen to it. Do not make that mistake! 
JAS.1.23	Obey God's message. Don't be like a man who just looks at his face in a mirror. 
JAS.1.24	That man looks at himself, but then he goes away. He immediately forgets what he is really like. 
JAS.1.25	So, do not just listen to God's message and then forget it. It is a completely good message that makes people free. Look at it carefully and keep it in your mind. Do what it tells you to do. God will 
JAS.1.26	Maybe some of you think that you are 
JAS.1.27	If you want to 
JAS.2.1	My Christian friends, you 
JAS.2.2	When you are meeting together as 
JAS.2.3	You are kind to the man who is wearing beautiful clothes. You say to him, ‘Please sit here in this good place.’ But you say to the poor man, ‘Go and stand over there.’ Or you may say to him, ‘Sit on the floor near my feet.’ 
JAS.2.4	If you do that, you think that one of them is more valuable than the other one. You are thinking bad thoughts. You have decided that one person among you is better than another person. You must not do that.
JAS.2.5	My Christian friends, listen to me. God has chosen people who are poor in this world. He has helped them to 
JAS.2.6	But you have not been kind to the poor people. You have caused them to feel ashamed. Who causes you to have troubles? It is the rich people! They are the people who want the 
JAS.2.7	It is the rich people who speak bad things against the good name of Jesus Christ. And you are called Christians because you belong to him. 
JAS.2.8	But the message of God's 
JAS.2.9	But if you are kind to some people and you are not kind to others, then you are doing a bad thing. God's 
JAS.2.10	Even if you fail to obey only one rule in God's 
JAS.2.11	For example, God has said in his 
JAS.2.12	Remember that God will 
JAS.2.13	God will not 
JAS.2.14	My Christian brothers, you say that you believe in God. Then you must show this in the things that you do. If not, your 
JAS.2.15	For example, maybe a 
JAS.2.16	Then one of you may say to them, ‘Go with God's 
JAS.2.17	How we believe in God is also like that. If our 
JAS.2.18	Someone may say, ‘You believe in God, but I do good things to help people.’ If you say that, show me that you really believe in God. If you do not do good things, you cannot show me that you really believe in God. But I do good things. In that way I will show you that I believe in God. 
JAS.2.19	You believe that there is only one God. That is good! But even the 
JAS.2.20	You fool! If someone's faith does not lead him to do good things, it is not worth anything. Do I have to show you that this is true? 
JAS.2.21	Think about our 
JAS.2.22	Abraham believed in God, and he did what God asked him to do. So, you can see that both of these were necessary. When he did this good thing, he showed that he believed in God completely. 
JAS.2.23	This happened in the way that the Bible tells us. It says, ‘Abraham believed God. As a result, God accepted Abraham as right with him.’ God also called Abraham his friend.
JAS.2.24	So, you see how God accepts someone as right with himself. That person must not only believe in God. He must also do good things to show that he has 
JAS.2.25	It was the same with Rahab, long ago. She was a 
JAS.2.26	If our bodies have no 
JAS.3.1	My Christian friends, not many of you should become teachers. We people who teach God's message must be very careful. When God 
JAS.3.2	We all make many mistakes. So, if someone never says anything that is bad, that person is completely good. It shows that he has authority over his whole body. 
JAS.3.3	For example, think about how we make a horse go the right way. We put a small bit of metal in its mouth so that we can turn it. Then we can cause the horse's whole body to go where we want it to go. 
JAS.3.4	Also, think about ships that sail on the sea. They are very large. Strong winds push them with great power. But we fix a piece of wood at the back of the ship. With this small piece of wood, the master can cause the ship to go anywhere that he wants it to go. 
JAS.3.5	In the same way, our 
JAS.3.5	Think about this. A very small fire can cause even a big forest to burn completely. 
JAS.3.6	And our 
JAS.3.7	Remember this: People can cause all kinds of things to do what they want them to do. They have done this with animals, birds, snakes and fishes. 
JAS.3.8	But no person can rule his 
JAS.3.9	We use our 
JAS.3.10	This shows that we use the same mouth to 
JAS.3.11	Salty water and sweet water never come from the same well. 
JAS.3.12	A 
JAS.3.13	Do some of you think that you are 
JAS.3.14	But if you live in a bad way, do not think that you are wise. Are you 
JAS.3.15	You are not being 
JAS.3.16	If you are 
JAS.3.17	But if God makes you really 
JAS.3.18	Those who bring 
JAS.4.1	You very often fight and quarrel among yourselves. Do you know why that happens? It is because of the troubles in your thoughts. You want to do bad things that you think will make you happy. 
JAS.4.2	You want to have something for yourself, but you do not get what you want. You even kill other people. You try to take things that are not yours. But you cannot get them. So, you fight and you quarrel with each other. But you do not have these things because you do not ask God for them. 
JAS.4.3	Even when you do ask God, you do not receive anything. That is because you ask for the wrong reason. You just want to use these things to make yourselves happy.
JAS.4.4	You are turning away from God, like a wife who has sex with other men. You choose to be friends with people who are against God. So, you yourselves become enemies of God. You should know that! 
JAS.4.5	With good reason, the Bible says to us: ‘God has caused his 
JAS.4.6	But God will be very kind to us and he will help us. That is why the Bible says, ‘God is against those people who think that they are important. But he is kind to people who do not feel important.’ 
JAS.4.7	So, obey God's authority. Be strong against the 
JAS.4.8	Come near to God and he will come near to you. Be clean in the way that you live. Stop doing wrong things. Make your minds clean. You cannot love 
JAS.4.9	Be sorry about your 
JAS.4.10	Think about yourselves as small in front of the 
JAS.4.11	My Christian friends, do not say bad things against each other. If you speak against another 
JAS.4.12	God is the one who gave his 
JAS.4.13	Some of you say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to a certain city. We will stay there for a year. We will buy and sell things, and we will become rich.’ If you say things like that, listen to me. 
JAS.4.14	You do not really know what will happen tomorrow. Your life is like a cloud which appears for a short time and then it quickly goes away. 
JAS.4.15	So, what you ought to say is, ‘If the 
JAS.4.16	But instead, you talk about what you have decided to do. You speak as if you have the power to make it happen. It is wrong to speak like that.
JAS.4.17	So, you know what is the right thing that you ought to do. But if you know that and you do not do the right thing, then you have done a wrong thing. 
JAS.5.1	Now, listen to me, you rich people. Weep and cry aloud, because many troubles will soon happen to you. 
JAS.5.2	Your money no longer has any value. Insects have eaten your beautiful clothes and spoiled them. 
JAS.5.3	You have stored silver and gold coins to spend for yourselves. But dirt has spoiled those coins. That dirt will show that you are 
JAS.5.4	But you have not paid anything to the people who worked in your fields. Listen! You have cheated them and now they are speaking against you. The 
JAS.5.5	As you live here on this earth, you have had all that you wanted. You have lived like kings. You have eaten as much food as you want. So now you are like fat animals that are ready for men to kill. 
JAS.5.6	As for the person who has not done anything wrong, you say that he is 
JAS.5.7	So, my Christian friends, be patient until the 
JAS.5.8	You also must be patient, because the 
JAS.5.9	My Christian friends, do not say bad things against each other. If you do, God will 
JAS.5.10	Think about how God's 
JAS.5.11	We know that God 
JAS.5.12	Here is another important thing to remember, my Christian friends. When you want to make a strong promise, never use extra words. Do not say, ‘I promise by 
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you in trouble? Then they should pray to God about it. Or, is anyone feeling happy? They should sing and 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone ill? They should ask the leaders of the 
JAS.5.15	If they pray in that way and they trust that God will answer them, the sick person will become well again. The 
JAS.5.16	So, you should tell each other about any wrong things that you have done. Then you will be able to pray for each other, so that God makes you well again. When a good person prays to God, God does powerful things. 
JAS.5.17	For example, God's 
JAS.5.18	After that time, he prayed to God to send rain again. As a result, rain came down from the sky. The seeds that were in the ground began to grow and give food.
JAS.5.19	My Christian friends, if anyone among you turns away from God's true mesage, you should help him. Try to bring him back to God. 
JAS.5.20	Understand this: If you turn a person back from his bad ways, you will save that person's 
1PE.1.1	This letter is from me, Peter. I am an 
1PE.1.1	I am writing to you, God's own people that he has chosen. You are now living in many different places, in the 
1PE.1.2	God, the Father, had already decided that you should be his people. God's 
1PE.1.2	I pray that God will help you and give you 
1PE.1.3	We 
1PE.1.4	We wait to receive all the good things that God has prepared for us. Nobody can ever destroy those things. Nothing can spoil them. They will never become old or less beautiful. God is keeping those things in 
1PE.1.5	God is using his great power to keep you safe, because you 
1PE.1.6	Because of all this, you are very happy, even when you have troubles. For a short time now, different kinds of troubles may make you sad. 
1PE.1.7	The purpose of these troubles is to show whether you really 
1PE.1.8	You have never seen Jesus, but still you love him. You do not see him now, but you believe in him. As a result, you are very happy. There are no words to describe how happy you are. 
1PE.1.9	You are happy now because God is saving you from 
1PE.1.10	A long time ago, God's 
1PE.1.11	Christ's 
1PE.1.12	God showed his 
1PE.1.13	So now, prepare your minds, so that you are ready to live in a good way. Think clearly about how God helps you. Always remember that God will be very kind to you when Jesus Christ comes again. 
1PE.1.14	Obey God, like good children who obey their father. Before you knew the true message about Christ, you very much wanted to do bad things. But now you should not agree to live in that bad way. 
1PE.1.15	God has chosen you to be his own people. He is completely good. So, you must be completely good also, in all the way that you live. 
1PE.1.16	In the Bible God says this: ‘You must be completely good, because I am completely good.’ 
1PE.1.17	God knows what each person has done, and he 
1PE.1.18	Your 
1PE.1.19	Instead, he bought you with the very valuable blood of Christ, who died as a 
1PE.1.20	Before the world began, God had already chosen Christ. But now, during these last days of the world, God has shown Christ to people. God did that so that he could help you. 
1PE.1.21	Yes, it is because of Christ that you now believe in God. God raised Christ, so that he became alive again after his death. He did that to show everyone that Christ is great. That is why you believe in God. You 
1PE.1.22	You have obeyed God's true message. As a result, you have become clean in your 
1PE.1.23	You have received a new life. It is not human people that gave you this new life. The human kind of life does not continue for ever. But God's new life does not come to an end. You have been born again into a new life, because you believed God's message. That message continues to be true and it does not change. 
1PE.1.24	The Bible says:
1PE.1.24	‘All human people are like grass.
1PE.1.24	They may seem beautiful for a short time,
1PE.1.24	like flowers that grow in the fields.
1PE.1.24	But grass soon becomes dry and it dies.
1PE.1.24	Flowers soon fall to the ground.
1PE.1.25	But the 
1PE.1.25	That message is the good news about Jesus Christ, which people have taught you.
1PE.2.1	So, you must refuse to do any kind of bad things. Do not tell any 
1PE.2.2	Instead, you should want to learn about God more and more. New babies always want their mothers' milk, which makes them grow strong. God's true message is like good food that will make you strong in your 
1PE.2.3	Already, you have begun to know how good the 
1PE.2.4	So come to the 
1PE.2.5	You yourselves are also like stones that are alive. God is using you, like stones, to build a house where his 
1PE.2.6	In the Bible, God says this:
1PE.2.6	‘Look, I have chosen a stone that is very valuable.
1PE.2.6	I have chosen this stone as the most important stone,
1PE.2.6	for the corner of my house in 
1PE.2.6	Anyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.’
1PE.2.7	This stone is very valuable to you who believe in Jesus. But the Bible says this about people who do not believe in him:
1PE.2.7	‘The builders refused to use a certain stone.
1PE.2.7	They thought that it had no value.
1PE.2.7	But now that stone has become the most important stone at the corner of the building.’ 
1PE.2.8	The Bible says this also:
1PE.2.8	‘This stone will cause people to fall to the ground.
1PE.2.8	It is a rock that will make them fall down.’
1PE.2.8	They fall like that because they refuse to obey God's message. God already decided that this would happen to them. 
1PE.2.9	But you are not like that. You are a special group of people that God has chosen. You 
1PE.2.10	In past times, you were not people who knew God. But now you are God's people. In past times, God had not 
1PE.2.11	My friends, remember that you are really strangers in this world. You do not belong here. So I am telling you not to do the bad things that your bodies may want to do. Those bad things fight against what is good for your 
1PE.2.12	You are living among people who do not know God. So be very careful that you always live in a good way. Sometimes these people may wrongly say that you do bad things. But if you continue to live in a good way, they will see that you really do good things. As a result, on the day when God comes and shows himself to people, they will know that he is good.
1PE.2.13	Obey all people who have authority in this world. Obey them, because you are servants of the 
1PE.2.14	Also obey the officers that 
1PE.2.15	God wants you to do only what is good. Then silly people will not be able to say bad things against you. Those people do not really know what is true.
1PE.2.16	You are free people. But you are servants of God. So live in a way that will make God happy. Do not think, ‘Because I am free, I can do any bad thing that I want.’ 
1PE.2.17	You must 
1PE.2.18	You who are slaves must obey your masters. Always respect them. Do that to every kind of master. Obey those who are good and kind. But also obey masters who are not fair to you. 
1PE.2.19	This makes God happy. Maybe your master will 
1PE.2.20	But if you do something wrong, then your master ought to 
1PE.2.21	When God chose you to be his servants, he wanted you to be brave like that. Christ had trouble and pain on your behalf. He has shown you how you should live. You must be patient and brave like him. 
1PE.2.22	The Bible says this:
1PE.2.22	‘He never did anything that was wrong.
1PE.2.22	He never said anything that was not true.’
1PE.2.23	People said bad things against Christ, but he did not say any bad thing back to them. People caused him to have trouble, but he never tried to hurt them in return. Instead, Christ 
1PE.2.24	When Christ died on the 
1PE.2.25	Before, you were like sheep that were going the wrong way. But now you have turned round and come to Christ. He is your 
1PE.3.1+1PE.3.2	I need to say the same thing to you wives. You should each obey your own husband. Even if your husband does not believe God's message about Jesus Christ, you should still 
1PE.3.3	Do not always try to make your bodies beautiful. The way that you prepare your hair does not really make you beautiful. You do not need to wear gold things or beautiful clothes. 
1PE.3.4	Instead, think about what you are really like inside yourself. Be patient and do not become angry easily. Then you will never stop being beautiful. If you are beautiful in your 
1PE.3.5	That was how good women made themselves beautiful many years ago. They 
1PE.3.6	Sarah was a woman like that. She obeyed her husband, Abraham. She called him, ‘My master’. So, you wives also should do what is right. Do not let anything make you afraid. Then you will be like true daughters of Sarah. 
1PE.3.7	You husbands must also live in a good way with your wives. Each of you should be kind to his wife and help her. Remember that she is not as strong as you are. Remember that both of you have received true life from God, because he is kind. So, 
1PE.3.8	Now I want to say this to you before I finish my letter. All of you should agree with each other in what you think. You should try to understand how other people are feeling. Love each other as brothers and sisters. Be kind to each other. Do not think that you are more important than other people. 
1PE.3.9	If people do bad things to you, do not do anything bad to them in return. If people say bad things against you, do not say bad things back to them. Instead, pray that God will be good to those people. That is what God wants you to do. Then you also will receive good things from God. 
1PE.3.10	The Bible says this:
1PE.3.10	‘Do you want to enjoy your life?
1PE.3.10	Do you want to be happy?
1PE.3.10	Then you must be careful not to say bad things.
1PE.3.10	Do not tell any 
1PE.3.11	Stop doing anything that is bad.
1PE.3.11	Instead, do what is good.
1PE.3.11	Try very much to be friendly with people.
1PE.3.11	Help people to live in 
1PE.3.12	Live in that way, because the 
1PE.3.12	He takes care of people who live in a good way.
1PE.3.12	When they pray, he listens to them.
1PE.3.12	But the 
1PE.3.13	If you always try to do good things, then nobody should hurt you. 
1PE.3.14	But somebody might give you trouble, even when you do what is right. If that happens, God will 
1PE.3.15	Instead, always remember that Christ is your 
1PE.3.16	But when you tell them, be kind and polite. Do only what you know is right. Then those people will see that you live in a good way because you believe in Christ. When they say bad things against you they will become ashamed. 
1PE.3.17	Sometimes God may let you have trouble and pain even when you have done good things. But that is better than if you have trouble and pain because you have done bad things.
1PE.3.18	Christ himself always did what was right. But he received pain on behalf of people who do what is wrong. He died once to take away all those wrong things. He did that to bring you near to God. People killed Christ's body, but God's 
1PE.3.19	In this way, he went to the 
1PE.3.20	Those were the 
1PE.3.21	That shows how God now saves you. It is like a picture of 
1PE.3.22	After that, Jesus went into 
1PE.4.1	Christ had trouble and pain while he lived in his body. So, you should prepare yourselves to have trouble and pain too. Think about it in the same way that Christ did. Then you will be strong. If someone has trouble and pain in his body, he no longer wants to do wrong things. 
1PE.4.2	As a result, that person will want to do what God wants him to do. While he continues to live in his body, he will not want to do the bad things that people often want to do.
1PE.4.3	You have already done those kinds of bad things for long enough. The people who do not know God like to live in that way. In past times, you also did those bad things. You did many wrong things that your bodies wanted to do. You had sex in a wrong way. You were drunks. You went to many wild parties where you drank too much alcohol. You 
1PE.4.4	The people who do not know God are surprised that you no longer live in that bad way. They continue to enjoy those bad things all the time. But you do not join with them. So they say bad things against you. 
1PE.4.5	But those people will have to explain to God what they have done. He is ready to 
1PE.4.6	This is why even dead people needed to hear the good news about Christ. Their bodies had to die, as all people must die. But they heard the good news so that their 
1PE.4.7	All things in this world will soon come to an end. So, you must think clearly. Then you will be able to pray in a serious way. 
1PE.4.8	Continue to love each other very much. That is more important than anything else. If you love people, you will 
1PE.4.9	Always be happy to have other 
1PE.4.10	God has helped each of you in a certain way. You should use that gift from God well, so that you can help other people. Think carefully about how you do that. Remember that God has given many different gifts to his people so that they can 
1PE.4.11	Has God has helped you to speak well? Then speak God's messages to people. Or has God helped you to 
1PE.4.12	My friends, I know that people are causing you to have bad trouble. It is like a fire that is burning you. Do not be surprised about that. These things are happening to you, to show whether you really 
1PE.4.13	Instead, thank God when you have trouble. Remember that Christ also received much pain. If you have trouble like he did, then you will be happy when he returns. When everyone sees how great Christ really is, then you will thank God, and you will be very happy. 
1PE.4.14	People may say bad things against you because you belong to Christ. But God will 
1PE.4.15	But if you receive pain because you do wrong things, that is only right. You must not kill anyone. You must not rob anyone. You must not do bad things to other people. You must not cause other people to have trouble. If you do bad things like that, then they are right to 
1PE.4.16	But if you receive trouble because you are a Christian, do not be ashamed about that. Instead, you should thank God that you belong to Christ.
1PE.4.17	The time has come when God will start to 
1PE.4.18	The Bible says:
1PE.4.18	‘When God saves people who are good,
1PE.4.18	it is difficult for that to happen.
1PE.4.18	So, think about the people who refuse to obey God.
1PE.4.18	It will surely be much worse for those bad people.’ 
1PE.4.19	So remember this. If you receive trouble because that is what God wants, you should 
1PE.5.1	Now I want to say something to you who are leaders of the groups of 
1PE.5.2	Watch over the group of 
1PE.5.3	God has given you a group of 
1PE.5.4	Then our master, Christ, will give you a great gift. He is the most important 
1PE.5.5	I want to say the same thing to you who are young men. You must obey the older 
1PE.5.5	‘God is against those people who think that they are important.
1PE.5.5	But he is kind to people who do not feel important.’
1PE.5.6	Remember that God is strong and powerful. So, think about yourselves as small in front of him. Then he will lift you up to a good place at the right time. 
1PE.5.7	If you have any kind of trouble in your mind, give it to God. God has promised to take 
1PE.5.8	Think seriously about how you live. Watch carefully for danger. Remember that the 
1PE.5.9	But you must be strong to fight against him. 
1PE.5.10	Yes, you will have trouble like this for a short time. But after that, God will make everything right. He is completely kind and he will always help you. Because you belong to Christ, God has chosen you to live with him in 
1PE.5.11	Yes, God rules with power for ever! 
1PE.5.12	Silas has helped me to write this short letter to you. I know that he continues to 
1PE.5.13	The 
1PE.5.14	When you meet, kiss each other as Christian friends.
1PE.5.14	I pray for all of you who belong to Christ. I pray that God will give you 
2PE.1.1	This letter is from me, Simon Peter. I am Jesus Christ's servant and his 
2PE.1.1	I am writing to you people who believe in Jesus Christ, as we do. That is a valuable gift that God has given to us all. He has done this because Jesus is completely good and right. Jesus is the one who saves us. He is the God that we 
2PE.1.2	I pray that God will help you and give you 
2PE.1.3	God is very powerful because he is God. He has used that power to help us. He has given us everything that we need to live in a good way. We can do things that make God happy. This is possible because now we know him. God has chosen us to be his people because he is very great and very good. 
2PE.1.4	Because of this, God has promised that he will do very great and valuable things for us. As a result, you can do what is right, like God does. The people who belong to this world want to do bad things. Those bad things make them become worse and worse. But God gives you the power to be free from all that.
2PE.1.5	God has done all this to help you. So, now that you believe in Christ, you must grow as 
2PE.1.6	Then you should learn to rule yourselves properly. That is not all. You should learn to be patient and brave also. And you should 
2PE.1.7	You should not only 
2PE.1.8	You should grow as 
2PE.1.9	But some people do not live in these good ways. They do not think that these things are important. They are like people who cannot see clearly. They cannot really see anything. They have forgotten that God has made them clean. He has 
2PE.1.10	So, my friends, try very much to do these good things. Live in a good way, because God has chosen you to be his own people. Show that you really do belong to God! If you do these things, you will never turn away from God. 
2PE.1.11	Also, God will be very happy. He will bring you into that place where Jesus Christ will rule his people for ever. Jesus Christ has saved us, and you will live with him for ever.
2PE.1.12	You already know these things. You know that they are completely true. But because they are important, I will continue to tell you about them again and again. 
2PE.1.13	I want you to remember them. So, I will continue to tell you about them. I think that it is right to do that. So I will do it while I am still living here on earth. 
2PE.1.14	I know that I will die soon. Our 
2PE.1.15	I want you always to remember these things after I have died. So I will try very hard to tell you about them now.
2PE.1.16	We told you that our 
2PE.1.17+2PE.1.18	We were with him on the mountain when his Father God spoke to him. God 
2PE.1.19	As well as that, we have the 
2PE.1.20	It is very important that you should understand this: The 
2PE.1.21	None of the 
2PE.2.1	Many years ago, there were false 
2PE.2.2	Many people will believe these false teachers. They will live in a bad way, like the false teachers. As a result, many people will say bad things against God's true way to live.
2PE.2.3	The false teachers want you to give them money. So, they will teach things that are not true. A long time ago, God already decided that he must 
2PE.2.4	God even 
2PE.2.5	Also, a long time ago, God 
2PE.2.6	God also 
2PE.2.7	Also, God saved Lot from danger. Lot was a good man. He was very sad because the people in Sodom did not obey God's 
2PE.2.8	Lot lived among those bad people. Every day, he saw the bad things that they did. Every day, he heard the bad things that they said. As a result, Lot had much trouble in his mind, because he was a good man. 
2PE.2.9	We know that the 
2PE.2.10	God will certainly 
2PE.2.10	These false teachers are not afraid of what other people think about them. They think that they themselves are very important. They are not afraid to say many bad things against the great 
2PE.2.11	The 
2PE.2.12	But these false teachers speak against things that they do not understand. They are like wild animals. Their minds cannot think properly. They only do what their 
2PE.2.13	They have caused other people to have much trouble. In return, God will cause them to have trouble. They just do things which will make their bodies happy. They have wild parties, even during the day. They eat and drink too much when they eat meals with you. They enjoy all these bad ways to be happy. As a result, people think bad things about you as well. They cause people to be ashamed about you. So, they are like dirty marks that spoil something which is clean, 
2PE.2.14	All the time, they are looking for women who will have sex with them. They always want to do bad things. They teach people who have weak minds to believe wrong things. They just want more and more things to make themselves happy. God will certainly 
2PE.2.15	These false teachers have left the way which is good and right. Like Balaam, Beor's son, they have gone the wrong way. Balaam wanted money so much that he did wrong things to get it. 
2PE.2.16	But a 
2PE.2.17	These false teachers promise good things that will never happen. They are like a dry well that has no water. They are like clouds in a storm which the wind blows away so that no rain comes. God will certainly send them to the darkest place in 
2PE.2.18	The messages that these teachers speak seem very important. But their words really mean nothing. In that way, they lead people away from God. Some people have not been 
2PE.2.19	The false teachers tell them to do whatever they want to do. They promise that this will make these people really free. But the false teachers themselves are not free. Instead, they are like slaves. They cannot stop doing the bad things that will destroy them. We know that if something has power over a person, then that person is its slave.
2PE.2.20	These false teachers learned about our 
2PE.2.21	It would have been better for them if they had never known God's good way. But they did understand about the right things that God wants us to do. And then they turned away from that way of life. They stopped obeying God's good rules, that people had taught them. 
2PE.2.22	You know these true 
2PE.3.1	My friends, this is the second letter that I have written to you. I have written both these letters to help you to understand some things. You already know these things. I want you to think about them in a good way. 
2PE.3.2	I want you to remember the messages from God's that his own 
2PE.3.3	The first thing that you should understand is this. In the last days of this world, some people will 
2PE.3.4	They will say: ‘Christ promised that he would return to this world. But he has not returned! Our 
2PE.3.5	But these people choose to forget things that they really know. God spoke his word and he made the sky and the earth, a long time ago. He caused land to come up through water. He made the land to be separate from the water. 
2PE.3.6	Also, it was water that God used to destroy that same world long ago. He spoke his word and he covered the land with water. 
2PE.3.7	But God has also spoken his word to say what will happen to the world in a future time. The sky and the earth that we see now will continue for a time. But God is keeping them until the day when he will destroy them with fire. On that day he will 
2PE.3.8	My friends, here is one thing that you must remember. In the 
2PE.3.9	The 
2PE.3.10	One day the 
2PE.3.11	Certainly, God will destroy everything in this way one day. So think about how you should live now. You should be the kind of people that God is happy about. You should show that you belong to God. 
2PE.3.12	Yes, you should continue to obey God while you are waiting for Christ to return. God has chosen that day. Try to make it come soon in the way that you live. On that day, fire will burn the whole sky. The sky will no longer be there. Heat will destroy the 
2PE.3.13	But God has promised to make a new sky and a new earth. That is what we are waiting for. That will be a home for everything that is good and right. 
2PE.3.14	So, my friends, live in a good way, because you are waiting for these things to happen. Try very much to do what makes God happy. Then, when you meet God, he will see that you are clean. He will see that there is no trouble in your minds. 
2PE.3.15	Remember that our 
2PE.3.16	He wrote about them in all his letters. Some things that he has written are difficult for people to understand. Some people who have weak minds explain these things wrongly. Those people are not sure about what they believe. They explain other things in the Bible wrongly also. As a result, those people will destroy themselves and God will 
2PE.3.17	My friends, you already know about these false teachers. So, be very careful that you do not believe those bad people. Do not let them lead you away from God. You know what is true, so do not leave that safe place. 
2PE.3.18	Instead, you must grow as 
1JN.1.1	We have an important message to tell you. We want to tell you about the person who was already there before the beginning of the world. We heard him speak. We saw him with our own eyes. We watched him and we touched him. He is the Word that gives us life with God. 
1JN.1.2	He showed himself clearly when he lived on this earth. From long ago he was together with God the Father, and he lives for ever. We saw him and we are telling you what is true. He is the one that has shown himself to us. 
1JN.1.3	We want you also to 
1JN.1.4	We are writing to you so that together we all may be completely happy.
1JN.1.5	We are telling you the good news that Jesus Christ told to us. This is the message: God is completely good and 
1JN.1.6	Do you say that you 
1JN.1.7	But when we live in a right way, it is like living in the light. God is always in the light. So, if we live in the light, we 
1JN.1.8	If we say that we never do any wrong thing, that can not be true. Even though we may think it is true, it is a 
1JN.1.9	Instead, we should agree that we have done wrong things and tell that to God. Then God will 
1JN.1.10	God says that all people have done wrong things. So, if we say that we have not done any wrong thing, we are saying that God tells 
1JN.2.1	I am writing this letter to you, my friends who are like my little children. I am writing to you because I do not want you to do wrong things. But if anyone among you does something wrong, there is someone who will speak to God on our behalf. That person is Jesus Christ, who always does only what is right. He will ask our Father God to 
1JN.2.2	Jesus died as a 
1JN.2.3	How can we be sure that we really know God and we belong to him? We can be sure of that if we obey God's rules. 
1JN.2.4	Someone may say, ‘I belong to God.’ But if he does not obey God's rules, that person is telling a 
1JN.2.5	But anyone who obeys God's message shows that he really loves God completely. So, this is how we know that we belong to God. 
1JN.2.6	If we say that we are living in God's true way, then we must live in the way that Jesus lived. 
1JN.2.7	My friends, I am telling you to love one another. When I write this to you, I am not giving you a new rule. It is an old rule that you have had for a long time. We gave it to you when you began to obey Christ. It is the same message that you have already heard. 
1JN.2.8	But there is something new about it. This rule has become true in the way that Christ lived. Now it has also become true in your lives. God's true message has brought light to shine in your lives. You no longer live in the dark where you do bad things. 
1JN.2.9	A person may say that he is living in the light. But, if that person 
1JN.2.10	Anyone who loves other 
1JN.2.11	But if someone 
1JN.2.12	My little children, I am writing to you because God has 
1JN.2.13	You who are older, like fathers, I am writing to you because you know Christ. He was already there before the world began.
1JN.2.13	You who are young men, I am writing to you because you have won against 
1JN.2.14	Yes, my children, I have written to you because you know God, our Father.
1JN.2.14	Fathers, I have written to you because you know Christ. He was already there before the world began.
1JN.2.14	Young men, I have written to you because you are strong. You continue to obey God's message, and you have won against 
1JN.2.15	Do not want to live like people who do not know God. Do not love the wrong things that belong to this world. If anyone loves those things, it shows that they do not love God, their Father. 
1JN.2.16	What are the wrong things that belong to this world? People want to do bad things to make themselves happy. People want to have things that they see, even bad things. People want to show other people how rich they are. These ideas do not come from God, our Father. They are the thoughts of people who belong to the world. 
1JN.2.17	One day, those people and the things that they want will not be there any longer. But those who continue to do what God wants will live for ever.
1JN.2.18	My children, the world will soon end. 
1JN.2.19	These people used to be in our group of 
1JN.2.20	But Christ, the 
1JN.2.21	That is why I am writing to you. It is not because you do not yet know God's true message. I am writing to you because you do know that true message. And you can be sure that there are no 
1JN.2.22	Who are the people who tell the worst 
1JN.2.23	Anyone who says that Jesus is not God's Son does not belong to the Father. But anyone who accepts Jesus as the 
1JN.2.24	As for you, always remember the true message that you heard at the beginning. If you continue to believe that message, you will remain 
1JN.2.25	That is the real life that continues for ever. And that is what God has promised to give to us.
1JN.2.26	Some people are trying to lead you away from God's true message. I am writing these things to you so that you know about those people. 
1JN.2.27	But Christ has given the 
1JN.2.28	Yes, my children, continue to be 
1JN.2.29	You know that Christ only does what is right. So you should know this: Everyone who continues to do what is right has become a child of God.
1JN.3.1	Think about how much God the Father loves us. He calls us his children. He loves us that much! And we really have become children of God. The people who belong to this world do not understand who God is. Because of that, they do not understand who we are. 
1JN.3.2	My friends, we are already children of God. We do not yet know clearly what we will become. But we do know this: when Christ returns to this world, we will become like him. We will be like him because we will see him as he really is. 
1JN.3.3	Christ is completely good. So all of us who hope to see him then must keep ourselves clean from 
1JN.3.4	If a person continues to do wrong things, he is choosing not to obey God's rules. 
1JN.3.5	You know that Jesus came into the world so that he might take away our 
1JN.3.6	A person who is 
1JN.3.7	My little children, do not let anyone tell you 
1JN.3.8	But people who continue to do wrong things show that they belong to the 
1JN.3.9	Everybody who is a child of God does not continue to do wrong things. This is because God has given them a new life. He has caused them to become his children. So, they cannot continue to do wrong things. 
1JN.3.10	So we can see clearly who are God's children and who are the 
1JN.3.11	Yes, we must love one another. That is the message which you have heard from the beginning. 
1JN.3.12	We should not be like Cain. He belonged to 
1JN.3.13	So, my Christian friends, do not be surprised when people who belong to this world 
1JN.3.14	We know that we now have new life with God. We have left the way of death. We know that because we love our Christian friends. But anyone who does not love other 
1JN.3.15	Anyone who 
1JN.3.16	This is how we know what true love is: Jesus Christ gave his own life on the 
1JN.3.17	When another 
1JN.3.18	My little children, we should not show love for each other only by what we say. We should also show true love by what we do to help each other. 
1JN.3.19	Then we will know that we really belong to God. We will be obeying God's true message. As a result, our thoughts will not make us ashamed to come to God. 
1JN.3.20	Even if our thoughts tell us that we have done something wrong, we still will not be afraid of God. God is greater than our thoughts. He already knows everything about us.
1JN.3.21	My friends, if our thoughts do not tell us that we are 
1JN.3.22	We can pray to God and we can ask him to help us. He will give us what we ask him for. That is because we do what he tells us to do, and we do the things that 
1JN.3.23	This is what God tells us to do: We must believe that Jesus Christ is his Son. And we must love each other, as Jesus told us that we should do. 
1JN.3.24	Anyone who obeys God's rules is 
1JN.4.1	My friends, do not believe everyone who says that they speak God's message. There are many false 
1JN.4.2	How do you know whether a person has God's 
1JN.4.3	But if someone does not agree to say that about Jesus, he does not have God's 
1JN.4.4	My little children, you belong to God. You have won against those people with a false message. You have been able to do that because God's 
1JN.4.5	Those false 
1JN.4.6	But as for us, we belong to God. Everyone who knows God believes our message. But anyone who does not belong to God does not believe it.
1JN.4.6	So, that is how we know if someone's message comes from God's 
1JN.4.7	My friends, we should all love one another. It is God who makes us able to love other people. Everyone who loves other people has become a child of God. That person knows God. 
1JN.4.8	Anyone who does not love other people does not know God. We know this because God's own 
1JN.4.9	This is how God showed that he loves us: He sent his only Son to come and live in the world. He did that so that we could have true life with God because we believe in Jesus. 
1JN.4.10	This shows what real love really is. It is not that we have loved God. Rather, God loved us so much that he sent his Son to save us from 
1JN.4.11	My friends, this shows how much God has loved us. So then, we should all love one another.
1JN.4.12	Nobody has ever seen God. But, if we love each other, it shows that God really lives in us. Then we can love people completely, in the same way that God loves us. 
1JN.4.13	God has given us his 
1JN.4.14	God the Father sent his Son to come into the world. God sent him to save the people of the world from their 
1JN.4.15	If anyone says clearly that Jesus is the 
1JN.4.16	We really know the kind of love that God has for us. We believe that God has put that love in us. God's 
1JN.4.17	That is how we are able to love other people completely. Then, we will not be afraid on the day when God will 
1JN.4.18	If we really love God, we will not be afraid of him. We cannot love him completely and also be afraid. We would only be afraid of God if we thought that he would 
1JN.4.19	We are able to love God and other people because God loved us first. 
1JN.4.20	Someone may say, ‘I love God.’ But if he says that and he 
1JN.4.21	This is the rule that God has given us. He has told us that anyone who loves him should also love other Christians. 
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is God's 
1JN.5.2	How do we know that we really love God's children? We know it when we love God and we do what he tells us to do. 
1JN.5.3	Because, if we really love God, we will obey his words. And what he tells us to do is not difficult for us to obey. 
1JN.5.4	Because we have become God's children, we can live in a good way. We can refuse to live like people who belong to this world. We are able to win against the world because we 
1JN.5.5	It is only people who believe that Jesus is the 
1JN.5.6	Jesus Christ is the man that God sent into the world. John 
1JN.5.7	So there are three things that show us clearly that Jesus came from God: 
1JN.5.8	Those are the 
1JN.5.9	We believe people who tell us about things that they know. So even more, we can believe what God says. He has told us what is true about his Son. So we should believe his message.
1JN.5.10	Anyone who believes in Jesus, the 
1JN.5.11	This is what God has told us: God has given us life with him that never ends. We receive this life when we believe in his Son, Jesus. 
1JN.5.12	So whoever belongs to the Son has this true life. But anyone who does not belong to the 
1JN.5.13	I have written these things to you who believe that Jesus is the 
1JN.5.14	Also, we can really 
1JN.5.15	Since we know that, we also know that God will give to us the things that we ask for. It is like we have already received those things from him.
1JN.5.16	If you see that another Christian is doing something bad, this is what you should do. If it is a 
1JN.5.17	Any wrong thing that a person does is 
1JN.5.18	Nobody who has become a child of God continues to do wrong things. Instead, the 
1JN.5.19	We know that we belong to God. We know that 
1JN.5.20	We also know that the 
1JN.5.21	My little children, be careful to keep away from 
2JN.1.1	This letter comes from me, the leader of the 
2JN.1.2	I love you because we have all come to understand what is true. It will remain with us for ever. 
2JN.1.3	I pray that God our Father, and his Son Jesus Christ will help us and be kind to us all. I pray that he will give us 
2JN.1.4	I was very happy to hear about some of your children. I am happy because they are living in a good way. They are obeying the true message about God. They are doing what God our Father has told us to do.
2JN.1.5	So now, lady, I want you to do something. I want all of us to love one another. I am not telling you a new rule that you must obey. This is a rule that we had from the beginning. 
2JN.1.6	How do we show real love? We show it when we live in a way that makes God happy. We obey his rules. He tells us to love one another, and that is how you should live. You have heard that rule from the beginning.
2JN.1.7	I say this because many false teachers are travelling round everywhere. They do not agree that Jesus Christ was born as a human baby. Anyone like that is telling 
2JN.1.8	So, be careful! Do not believe their 
2JN.1.9	Remember the message which Christ taught. Anyone who teaches his own ideas instead of Christ's true message does not belong to God. Continue to believe what Christ taught. Anyone who does that belongs to God the Father and to his Son, Jesus. 
2JN.1.10	Someone may come to you and teach you something that is different. Do not receive that person into your house. Do not receive him as a Christian. 
2JN.1.11	If you receive people like that as Christian people, you are making yourself the same as them. You also are doing the same kind of bad work.
2JN.1.12	I want to tell you many more things, but I do not want to write about them in a letter. Instead, I hope to come and visit you. Then I can see you and we can talk together. Then we will be completely happy.
2JN.1.13	The 
3JN.1.1	This letter comes from me, the leader of the 
3JN.1.2	My friend, I pray that God will help you to live well. I know that you are well in your 
3JN.1.3	I was very happy when I heard news about you. Some Christian friends came here to tell me about you. They said that you are living in a good way. That is the way that God's true message tells us to live. 
3JN.1.4	I am happy when I hear that my children are living like that. When they obey God's true message, it makes me very happy. 
3JN.1.5	My friend, you do many things to help other 
3JN.1.6	These men have spoken to the group of 
3JN.1.7	They are travelling to different places to tell people about Jesus Christ. They do not accept any gifts from those people who are not Christians. 
3JN.1.8	Because of that, we Christians must help them with the things that they need. In that way we will be working together with them as they tell people the true message about Christ.
3JN.1.9	I have already written something to the group of 
3JN.1.10	So, when I arrive there myself, I will speak to the 
3JN.1.11	My friend, do not copy what bad people do. Instead, you should copy the good things that people do. The person who does good things shows that he belongs to God. But anyone who does bad things does not know God.
3JN.1.12	All the 
3JN.1.13	I would like to tell you many more things. But I do not want to write them in a letter. 
3JN.1.14	Instead, I hope to come and visit you soon. Then I can see you and we can talk together.
3JN.1.15	I pray that God will give you 
JUD.1.1	This letter is from me, Jude. I am Jesus Christ's servant and I am James's brother. I am writing to you people that God, the Father, loves. God has chosen you to be his own people. He is keeping you safe until the time when Jesus Christ returns. 
JUD.1.2	I pray that God will be kind to you and that he will give you 
JUD.1.3	My friends, I wanted very much to write to you about how God has saved us from 
JUD.1.4	I say this because certain bad people have secretly come among you. They are not servants of God. They are trying to change God's true message. They teach that we can do any bad things that we want to do. They say that God will be kind and he will 
JUD.1.5	I want you to remember these important things. You really already know all about them, but you must never forget them. Remember that the 
JUD.1.6	Also, remember that some 
JUD.1.7	Also, remember what happened to the cities called Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other cities that were near them. Like those bad 
JUD.1.8	These false teachers who have come among you do the same kind of bad things. Their dreams 
JUD.1.9	Even the leader of God's 
JUD.1.10	But these false teachers speak bad things against anything that they do not understand. They are like animals that cannot think properly. They just do the things that their 
JUD.1.11	It will be very bad for them! They have lived in the way that Cain lived. 
JUD.1.12	When you meet as 
JUD.1.13	Those false teachers are like water in the sea that the wind blows during a storm. The dirt that comes to the top of the water is like the dirty things that those people do. They are like stars that have moved away from their proper places in the sky. God has prepared a completely black, dark place for them. God will keep them there for ever.
JUD.1.14	Long ago, Enoch also spoke about those false teachers. Enoch belonged to the seventh family that was born, starting with Adam. He said, ‘Look, the 
JUD.1.15	He will 
JUD.1.16	Those people are always complaining. They are never happy about other people. They just do bad things that will make themselves happy. They speak great things about themselves, to show how important they are. They 
JUD.1.17	But as for you, my friends, remember the message that the 
JUD.1.18	They said to you, ‘In the last days of this world, some people will

REV.1.1	This book describes the things that God showed to Jesus Christ. He wanted Jesus to show these things to his own servants. They are events that must happen soon. Jesus sent his 
REV.1.2	I, John, have written about everything that God showed me. These things are a true message from God. They are the things that Jesus Christ says are really true. 
REV.1.3	If anyone reads aloud the words of this 
REV.1.4	I am John. I am writing to the 7 
REV.1.4	God will help you, and the 7 
REV.1.5	Jesus Christ will also help you. He always speaks a true message. He is the first person who became alive again after death. 
REV.1.5	Jesus loves us and he died for us. That is how he made us free. Because of Jesus, God will not 
REV.1.6	Jesus has brought us into his family, so that we belong to God's 
REV.1.7	Look, he will come on the clouds!
REV.1.7	At that time, everyone will see him!
REV.1.7	Even the people who pushed a 
REV.1.7	People from all the countries on earth will be sad when they see him.
REV.1.7	Yes, this will really happen. It is true. 
REV.1.8	The 
REV.1.9	I am John. I am a 
REV.1.10	On the 
REV.1.11	The voice said: ‘When you see these things, write them in a book. Then you must send the book to the 7 
REV.1.11	Ephesus,
REV.1.11	Smyrna,
REV.1.11	Pergamum,
REV.1.11	Thyatira,
REV.1.11	Sardis,
REV.1.11	Philadelphia and
REV.1.11	Laodicea.’
REV.1.12	I turned round to see who was speaking to me. When I turned, I saw 7 gold 
REV.1.13	In the middle of the lights, I saw someone like a human person.
REV.1.14	His head and his hair were white like sheep's hair. They were very white, like snow. His eyes were like fires that were burning brightly. 
REV.1.15	His feet shone like a yellow metal that shines brightly in a very hot fire. When he spoke, his voice was very loud. It was like the sound of many rivers that are moving very fast. 
REV.1.16	He held 7 stars in his right hand. A sharp 
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead person. Then he put his right hand on me, and he said to me, ‘Do not be afraid! I am the one who is the first and also the last. 
REV.1.18	I am the one who always lives. I died once. But look! Now I am alive and I will be alive for ever. I have authority over death and over Hades, the place of dead people. 
REV.1.19	So write down the things that you have seen. Write about what you see that is happening now. Also write about the things that will happen later.
REV.1.20	You saw 7 stars that I held in my right hand. You saw 7 lights in their gold 
REV.2.1	‘Now write this to the 
REV.2.1	“This is the important message to you from the one who holds the 7 stars. He holds them carefully in his right hand. He walks among the 7 gold 
REV.2.2	I know everything that you do. You have worked much for me. You have continued to work patiently. I know that you do not accept bad people as your friends. Some of these bad people say that they are 
REV.2.3	You have been patient and strong in times of trouble. You have continued to 
REV.2.4	But I have something to say against you. You loved me very much when you first believed in me. You do not love me as much now. 
REV.2.5	Think carefully about this! You do not now live in the way you did at the beginning. So you must change the way you live. Do again the good things that you did at the beginning. If you do not change the way you live, I will come to 
REV.2.6	But this is something that you do well: You 
REV.2.7	God's Spirit is now speaking to people in the 
REV.2.8	‘Write this to the 
REV.2.8	“This is the important message to you from the one who is the first and the last. He was dead, and he became alive again.
REV.2.9	I know that bad people are hurting you very much. I know that you are poor. But really, you are rich. Some people there say that they are 
REV.2.10	I know that trouble will soon come to you. But do not be afraid. Listen! The

REV.2.15	Also, some people among you do the bad things that the Nicolaitans teach. 
REV.2.16	So you must stop doing these bad things. If you do not change how you live, I will quickly come to

REV.2.18	‘Write this to the

REV.2.20	But I have something to say against you. You let that woman Jezebel teach you. She says that she is a 
REV.2.21	I have given her time to stop doing these bad things. But she refuses to change how she lives. She does not stop having sex with other men. 
REV.2.22	Listen to this! She has done bad things like that on a bed. So I will cause her to have pain on a bed. I will also cause great pain for those who do the same bad things. They must stop doing the bad things that she teaches. 
REV.2.23	I will hurt those who obey her so that they die. Then all the people in the 
REV.2.24	But I say this to you other people in Thyatira. You have not agreed with what Jezebel taught. You have not learned what they call ‘
REV.2.25	But continue to obey my message that you already have. Believe in me until I come.
REV.2.26	You must continue to obey me until the end. You must win against 
REV.2.27	He will rule them with an iron stick and with great power. He will be like someone who breaks 
REV.2.28	He will have the same authority that I received from my Father. I will also give the morning star to those people who win against 
REV.2.29	God's

REV.3.3	So remember God's message that you have heard. Obey what God has said. Turn away from the wrong things that you do. Change the way you live. If you do not wake up, I will come to 
REV.3.4	But you have a few people among you in Sardis who have not done these bad things. They are like people who have kept their clothes clean. They will walk with me and they will wear white clothes. They are good people and it is right for them to wear these white clothes. 
REV.3.5	Everyone who wins against

REV.3.9	Some people there say that they are 
REV.3.10	I have told you to be patient in this difficult time. You have obeyed what I told you. Because of that, I will keep you safe from the time of great trouble that will come. This trouble will come to everyone who lives in the world. It will show me what each person is really like.
REV.3.11	I will come quickly.

REV.3.16	But you are only warm. Because you are neither cold nor hot, I am ready to throw you away completely. 
REV.3.17	You say, ‘I am rich. God has helped me to have many things. I do not need anything more.’ But you do not know how very poor you are really! You are like people who cannot see. You are like people who are without clothes. Really, other people should feel very sorry for you. 
REV.3.18	So, I tell you that you should buy gold from me. With my gold, you would be really rich. My gold is the best, because it has been through fire. You should also buy white clothes from me to dress yourselves. Then you will not be ashamed because you have no clothes. You should also buy medicine from me to put on your eyes. Then you will be able to see well. 
REV.3.19	I help everyone that I love. When they have done wrong things, I tell them, ‘You have done a wrong thing.’ I show them the right thing that they should do. So be serious about how you live. Stop doing wrong things and turn to me. 
REV.3.20	Look! I am standing at the door of your house. I am knocking on your door. When you hear my voice, you should open the door. Then I will come in. We will eat a meal together as friends.
REV.3.21	Everyone who wins against

REV.4.1	After this I looked. There in front of me was an open door in 
REV.4.2	Immediately God's 
REV.4.3	The person who sat there shone with bright red and white light, like beautiful stones called jasper and ruby. Round the 
REV.4.4	All round the 
REV.4.5	It was like a storm with bright 
REV.4.6	Also in front of the 
REV.4.6	In the middle, round the 
REV.4.7	The first of these 
REV.4.8	Each of these 4 
REV.4.8	‘The 
REV.4.8	He is has no bad thing in him. He is completely good.
REV.4.8	He has always been alive. He is alive now.
REV.4.8	He will continue to be alive for ever.’
REV.4.9	God sits on the 
REV.4.10	When they do this, the 24 leaders bend down to the ground. They also 
REV.4.11	‘Our 
REV.4.11	Everyone should say how great and powerful you are!
REV.4.11	Everyone should 
REV.4.11	You decided to make them and so you made them!
REV.4.11	That is why everything in the world is here.’
REV.5.1	Then I looked at the one who was sitting on the 
REV.5.2	Then I saw a strong 
REV.5.3	But nobody in 
REV.5.4	I wept much because there was nobody who was good enough. Nobody was so good that they could open the book. Nobody could look inside it. 
REV.5.5	Then one of the leaders said to me, ‘Do not weep! Look! There is someone who can break the 7 
REV.5.6	Then I saw a 
REV.5.7	The 
REV.5.8	When he had taken the book, the 4

REV.5.9	You are good enough to take the book.
REV.5.9	You can break its

REV.5.9	When you died, you bought people for God with your blood.
REV.5.9	You bought them from every family group,
REV.5.9	from every language and every country.
REV.5.10	You have caused them to belong to the 
REV.5.10	You have made them 
REV.5.10	so that they 
REV.5.10	And they will rule on the earth.’
REV.5.11	Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of many 
REV.5.12	They all sang with loud voices:
REV.5.12	‘The 
REV.5.12	He has all authority, and all things belong to him.
REV.5.12	He is 
REV.5.12	Everyone must agree that he is great!
REV.5.12	Everyone must 
REV.5.13	Then I heard everything that is alive singing. That was everything in 
REV.5.13	‘We 
REV.5.13	We 
REV.5.13	We say that they are great! We 
REV.5.13	They have power to rule for ever!’
REV.5.14	The 4 
REV.6.1	Then I watched while the 
REV.6.2	I looked, and I saw a white horse. The person who was riding the horse held a bow. Someone gave him a 
REV.6.3	Then the 
REV.6.4	Then another horse came out. This horse was bright red, like fire. The person who was riding the horse had authority. He could take 
REV.6.5	Then the 
REV.6.6	Then I heard a sound like somebody speaking among the 4 
REV.6.7	Then the 
REV.6.8	I looked, and I saw a grey horse. The name of the person who was riding the horse was Death. The place for dead people, called Hades, was following near to him. They had authority to kill people in a quarter of the earth. They could kill people in different ways. They could kill them in wars. They could cause people die because there was no food. They could cause people to become very ill so that they died. They could also cause wild animals to kill people. 
REV.6.9	Then the 
REV.6.10	These 
REV.6.11	Then each 
REV.6.12	I watched again. I saw the 
REV.6.13	The stars in the sky fell to the earth. They fell like fruits fall from a tree when a strong wind blows. 
REV.6.14	The sky 
REV.6.15	Then everyone on the earth hid themselves. They went to the mountains and they hid among the rocks and in holes in the rocks. Everyone tried to hide, even the kings and the rulers. The soldiers' leaders, the rich people and other powerful people all went to hide. Everyone hid, whether they were slaves or free people. 
REV.6.16	They shouted to the mountains and to the rocks, ‘Fall on us and cover us. Hide us, so that the one who sits on the 
REV.6.17	Their great day has come. They will

REV.7.2	Then I saw another 
REV.7.3	But he shouted to them, ‘Do not destroy the land or the sea or the trees yet. Wait until we put a 
REV.7.4	Then I heard how many people received God's 
REV.7.5	There were 12000 from each family group:
REV.7.5	12000 from Judah's family group,
REV.7.5	12000 from Reuben's family group,
REV.7.5	12000 from Gad's family group,
REV.7.6	12000 from Asher's family group,
REV.7.6	12000 from Naphtali's family group,
REV.7.6	12000 from Manasseh's family group,
REV.7.7	12000 from Simeon's family group,
REV.7.7	12000 from Levi's family group,
REV.7.7	12000 from Issachar's family group,
REV.7.8	12000 from Zebulun's family group,
REV.7.8	12000 from Joseph's family group,
REV.7.8	12000 from Benjamin's family group. 
REV.7.9	After this, I looked again. I saw a very big crowd of people. There were so many people that nobody could count them. They came from every country, from every family group and from every language. They were standing in front of the 
REV.7.10	They shouted loudly:
REV.7.10	‘We 
REV.7.10	And we 
REV.7.10	They have saved us from 
REV.7.11	All the

REV.7.12	‘This is true!

REV.7.12	We thank him and we 
REV.7.12	He has all power and authority.
REV.7.13	Then one of the leaders asked me, ‘Who are these people in white clothes? Where did they come from?’
REV.7.14	‘Only you know who they are, sir,’ I replied.
REV.7.14	He said to me, ‘They are the people who have had a time of very bad trouble. Now they have come out of that. They have washed their clothes in the blood of the 
REV.7.15	Because of that, they are now standing in front of God's 
REV.7.16	They will never again be hungry. They will never be 
REV.7.17	The 
REV.8.1	The 
REV.8.2	Then I saw the 7 
REV.8.3	Then another 
REV.8.4	When he did that, the smoke from the 
REV.8.5	Then the 
REV.8.6	Then the 7 
REV.8.7	The first 
REV.8.8	Then the second 
REV.8.9	A third of the animals that lived in the sea died. It also destroyed a third of the ships on the sea.
REV.8.10	Then the third 
REV.8.11	The name of the star means ‘It tastes bad’. So a third of the water on the earth became bad. Many people died because they drank that bad water.
REV.8.12	Then the fourth 
REV.8.13	Then I looked up, and I saw an 
REV.9.1	The fifth 
REV.9.2	The star opened the way into the deep hole. Smoke came up out of the hole. It was like the smoke from a very big hot fire. The smoke caused the sun and the sky to become dark. 
REV.9.3	Then 
REV.9.4	They knew that they must not do anything bad to the grass on the earth. They must not attack any plant or any tree. They could only attack people who did not have God's 
REV.9.5	The 
REV.9.6	During that time of great pain, people will want to kill themselves. They will want to die, but they will not find any way to die.
REV.9.7	The 
REV.9.8	Their hair was like women's hair. Their teeth were like 
REV.9.9	They had 
REV.9.10	They had poison in their tails, like 
REV.9.11	The king that ruled them was the 
REV.9.12	The first great trouble has now finished. But after all these things, there are two more great troubles still to come.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth 
REV.9.14	The voice said to the sixth 
REV.9.15	So he went and he made those 4 
REV.9.16	I heard how many soldiers there were in their great army. There were 200 million soldiers who rode on horses.
REV.9.17	It was like a dream when I saw the soldiers and their horses. The soldiers had 
REV.9.18	The fire, the smoke and the 
REV.9.19	The horses had great power in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails were like snakes, with heads that could hurt people very much.
REV.9.20	But all the people that the fire, the smoke and the 
REV.9.21	They were not sorry that they murdered other people. They were not sorry that they used 
REV.10.1	Then I saw another strong 
REV.10.2	He had a little book in his hand and it was open. He put his right foot on the sea and he put his left foot on the land. 
REV.10.3	Then he shouted with a loud voice like the sound that a 
REV.10.4	When the 7 voices of 
REV.10.5	Then I looked again at the 
REV.10.6	He made a strong promise by the name of God. He is the one who lives for ever. He made 
REV.10.7	He said, ‘The time will soon come when the seventh 
REV.10.8	Then I heard again the voice that spoke to me from 
REV.10.9	So I went to the 
REV.10.10	So I took the little book from the 
REV.10.11	Then they said to me, ‘You must continue to tell God's message to people. You must say what will happen to people from everywhere in the world. Those are the people of many countries, and people who speak many languages, and also their kings.’ 
REV.11.1	Someone gave me a stick, like the sticks that people use to measure things. He told me, ‘Go and measure the size of 
REV.11.2	But do not measure the yard that is outside God's house. Do not measure it, because God has given that yard to 
REV.11.3	I will give authority to my two servants who speak my message clearly. Like 
REV.11.4	These servants are the two 
REV.11.5	If anyone tries to hurt them, fire comes out of the servants' mouths. This fire destroys their enemies. Anyone who wants to hurt the two servants must die in this way. 
REV.11.6	These servants of God have authority to shut up the sky. Then there will be no rain during the time that they tell their messages from God. They also have authority to cause the water on earth to become blood. They can also cause people to have many kinds of illness. They will do this as often as they want.
REV.11.7	When these two servants of God finish speaking God's messages, a wild animal will attack them. This is the animal that lives in the deep hole. It will come up out of the hole. 
REV.11.8	Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city where people killed their 
REV.11.9	People from everywhere in the world will look at the servants' dead bodies for 3.5 days. Those are people from every country, from every family group and from every language. They will refuse to let anyone bury the bodies. 
REV.11.10	The people who live on the earth will be very happy because the two servants of God are now dead. They will send gifts to each other because they are so happy. These two 
REV.11.11	But after 3.5 days, God put his 
REV.11.12	Then God's two servants heard a loud voice that came from 
REV.11.13	At the same time the ground moved strongly. It moved so much that one in every ten buildings in the city fell down. And 7000 people died there because the ground moved. The other people who were still alive became very afraid. They 
REV.11.14	That is the second great trouble and it has now finished. But the third great trouble will come soon.
REV.11.15	The seventh 
REV.11.15	‘Our 
REV.11.15	The whole world has become their 
REV.11.15	God will rule them for ever!’
REV.11.16	The 24 leaders were sitting on their 
REV.11.17	They said:
REV.11.17	‘We thank you, 
REV.11.17	You are alive now and you have always been alive.
REV.11.17	You have great power and now you have begun to rule the whole world!
REV.11.18	The countries of the world were very angry.
REV.11.18	But now you have become very angry with them,
REV.11.18	becuse they do not believe in you.
REV.11.18	Now you will 
REV.11.18	You will give good things to your servants.
REV.11.18	Those are your 
REV.11.18	Some of them are important people, and some are not important.
REV.11.18	You will give good things to all of them.
REV.11.18	But you will destroy all those people who destroy the earth.
REV.11.18	The time has now come for all this to happen.’
REV.11.19	Then I could see 
REV.12.1	A very surprising thing appeared in the sky. I saw a woman who was wearing the sun like clothes. The moon was under her feet. A 
REV.12.2	She was soon going to have a baby. She screamed because the pain hurt her very much.
REV.12.3	Then another surprising thing appeared in the sky. It was a very big red 
REV.12.4	Its tail hit a third of the stars in the sky and it threw them down on the earth. Then the 
REV.12.5	The woman gave birth to a son. He was a man who would rule all the countries of the world with an iron stick and with great power. Then someone quickly took her child away. He went up to God and to his 
REV.12.6	The woman ran away into the 
REV.12.7	Then a war started in 
REV.12.8	But the 
REV.12.9	Michael and his 
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in 
REV.12.10	‘Now God has saved his people from 
REV.12.10	God has shown his great power as King.
REV.12.10	His special 
REV.12.10	All day and all night he has continued to say bad things against 
REV.12.10	But now they have thrown him out of 
REV.12.11	But our brothers and sisters fought against him and they won.
REV.12.11	They 
REV.12.11	They continued to say that God's message is really true.
REV.12.11	They were ready to die as God's servants.
REV.12.12	So be happy, everyone who lives in 
REV.12.12	But the earth and the sea will have bad trouble.
REV.12.12	The 
REV.12.12	He is very angry.
REV.12.12	He knows that he has only a short time to hurt people.’
REV.12.13	The 
REV.12.14	But the woman received two 
REV.12.15	Then the 
REV.12.16	But a big hole opened in the ground. Then the river that poured from the 
REV.12.17	As a result, the 
REV.12.18	After that, the 
REV.13.1	Then I saw a wild animal that was coming up out of the sea. It had 10 
REV.13.2	The wild animal that I saw was like a 
REV.13.3	Someone had cut one of the wild animal's heads badly. It seemed that it would die. But the animal's head had become well again. This surprised all the people who were living on the earth. As a result, they were ready to obey what the wild animal said. 
REV.13.4	People 
REV.13.5	The wild animal received authority to hurt people for 42 months. It could say it had great power. It could also speak bad things against God. 
REV.13.6	So the wild animal began to 
REV.13.7	It received authority to fight a war against God's own people. It received power to win against them. It received power over people from every family group, people from every country and people from every language. 
REV.13.8	Nearly all the people who live on the earth will 
REV.13.9	Everyone who can understand should listen carefully to these words:
REV.13.10	‘If it is right for someone's enemy to catch him, that is what will happen.
REV.13.10	If it is right for someone's enemy to kill him with a 
REV.13.10	This means that God's people must be patient and strong. They must continue to 
REV.13.11	Then I saw a second wild animal. This one was coming up out of the ground. It had two 
REV.13.12	It worked for the first wild animal and it used the authority the first wild animal. It made all the people on earth 
REV.13.13	The second wild animal did great 
REV.13.14	This second animal received power to work for the first animal and to do great things. As a result, the people who lived on the earth believed its 
REV.13.15	The second wild animal received power to give life to the 
REV.13.16	The second wild animal also caused everyone to receive a mark. They put the mark on each person's right hand or on the front of their head. They did this to everyone, great people and 
REV.13.17	Nobody could buy anything unless they had this mark on them. Nor could they sell anything. This mark shows the wild animal's name or the number of its name.
REV.13.18	You must think carefully so that you can understand this number. Anyone who is 
REV.14.1	Then I looked again and I saw the 
REV.14.2	Then I heard a loud sound which came from 
REV.14.3	The 144000 people were singing a new song that they had learned. They sang it in front of the 
REV.14.4	These 144000 people have kept themselves clean in their 
REV.14.5	They have never spoken any 
REV.14.6	Then I saw another 
REV.14.7	He said in a loud voice, ‘
REV.14.8	A second 
REV.14.9	A third 
REV.14.10	God will be very angry with all those people. They will be like people who must drink God's strong 
REV.14.11	The smoke will rise for ever while they burn. They will have no rest during the day or during the night. This will happen to everyone who 
REV.14.12	This means that God's people must go on being patient and strong. They must continue to obey God's rules. They must continue to 
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice that spoke from 
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and I saw a white cloud in front of me. I saw someone who was like a human person. 
REV.14.15	Then another 
REV.14.16	Then the person who sat on the cloud moved his sharp knife over the earth. He cut down the earth's plants and he brought in the 
REV.14.17	Then another 
REV.14.18	Again, another 
REV.14.19	So the 
REV.14.20	The 
REV.15.1	Then I saw another very surprising thing in 
REV.15.2	Then I saw what seemed to be a glass sea. Fire was mixed in it. I also saw people who were standing at the edge of the glass sea. Those people had fought against the wild animal and its idol, and the number that means its name. They had fought and they had won. God had given them 
REV.15.3	Now they sang the song of God's servant, Moses, and the 
REV.15.3	‘
REV.15.3	what you do is great and surprising!
REV.15.3	Everything that you do is completely fair and honest.
REV.15.3	You are King of all countries of the world.
REV.15.4	Everyone will 
REV.15.4	They will say how great your name is,
REV.15.4	because only you are completely good.
REV.15.4	People from every country have seen what you do.
REV.15.4	You always do what is right.
REV.15.4	So all people will come and stand in front of you,
REV.15.4	and they will 
REV.15.5	After this I looked again. I saw that God's house in 
REV.15.6	The 7 
REV.15.7	Then one of the 4 
REV.15.8	Then God's house in 
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice speak from God's house in 
REV.16.2	The first 
REV.16.3	Then the second 
REV.16.4	Then the third 
REV.16.5	Then I heard the 
REV.16.5	‘
REV.16.5	You are right in everything that you decide.
REV.16.5	Now you have 
REV.16.6	They have killed your people and your 
REV.16.6	They have caused your servants to bleed and to die.
REV.16.6	So now you have given these bad people blood to drink.
REV.16.6	That is what ought to happen to them. It is right.’
REV.16.7	Then I heard a voice from the 
REV.16.7	‘Yes, 
REV.16.7	When you 
REV.16.8	Then the fourth 
REV.16.9	The strong heat burned people and it hurt them very much. As a result, they said bad things against God's name, because he had the power to cause these troubles. But they refused to change how they lived. They refused to agree that God is great.
REV.16.10	Then the fifth 
REV.16.11	They 
REV.16.12	Then the sixth 
REV.16.13	Then I saw 3 bad 
REV.16.14	Those bad 
REV.16.15	The 
REV.16.16	Then the bad 
REV.16.17	Then the seventh 
REV.16.18	There was a great storm, with bright 
REV.16.19	As a result, the great city called Babylon broke into three parts. When the ground moved, it also destroyed the big cities of other countries in the world. God did not forget the bad things that the people of the great city Babylon had done. He was very angry with them and he 
REV.16.20	When the ground moved, every island in the sea went away. There were no more mountains anywhere. 
REV.16.21	Strong rain with big stones of ice fell from the sky. The stones hit people and hurt them. The weight of each stone was about 50 kilos. The people 
REV.17.1	One of the 7 
REV.17.2	It is like the kings who rule on the earth have had sex with that bad woman. She has led the people who live on the earth to do bad things. They have become like drunks from the strong 
REV.17.3	Again, God's 
REV.17.4	The woman was wearing clothes that were made from expensive cloth. She also wore bright things that made her look beautiful. She shone with gold, valuable stones and 
REV.17.5	A name was written on the front of her head. Only God knows what it means. It was:
REV.17.5	Powerful Babylon.
REV.17.5	Mother of all 
REV.17.5	Mother of everything that God 
REV.17.6	I saw that the woman was like a drunk. She was like someone who had drunk the blood of God's people. She had killed them because they had told other people about Jesus. When I saw her, I was very surprised. 
REV.17.7	Then the 
REV.17.8	This animal was once alive, but it is not alive now. Soon it will come up out of the deep hole again but then God will destroy it completely. 
REV.17.9	If you are 
REV.17.10	They are also a picture of 7 kings. 5 of these kings have already stopped ruling. Another king is ruling now. The last king has not yet come. When he does come, he must rule only for a short time. 
REV.17.11	The wild animal is a picture of an eighth king. He was alive once, but he is not alive now. He belongs to the group of 7 kings, but God will destroy him completely.
REV.17.12	The 10 
REV.17.13	They all have the same purpose. They will give their power to the wild animal. They will give him authority to rule people. 
REV.17.14	Together they will fight a war against the 
REV.17.15	Then the 
REV.17.16	The wild animal and the 10 
REV.17.17	They will decide to do that because God has given them those thoughts. So, they will do what he wants. They will give to the wild animal their authority to rule as king. The animal will continue to rule until everything that God has said really happens. 
REV.17.18	The bad woman that you saw is a picture of the great city. That city has power over all the kings who rule on the earth.’
REV.18.1	After these things happened, I saw another 
REV.18.2	He shouted with a very loud voice:
REV.18.2	‘God has destroyed Babylon!
REV.18.2	It is no longer a great city!
REV.18.2	She has become a place where 
REV.18.2	She is a home for every dirty 
REV.18.2	She is a home for every dirty bird.
REV.18.2	She is a home for every dirty animal which people 
REV.18.3	She has been like a 
REV.18.3	Then she leads them to have sex in a wrong way.
REV.18.3	Like this, she has caused people from every country to turn away from God.
REV.18.3	It is like the kings who rule on the earth have had sex with that bad woman.
REV.18.3	She has bought many expensive things from the people on earth who buy and sell things.
REV.18.3	As a result, she has caused them to become rich.’
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice which spoke from 
REV.18.4	‘My people, leave the city! Come out!
REV.18.4	Do not do the bad things that the people of that city have done.
REV.18.4	Then you will not receive any of the troubles that God sends to them.
REV.18.5	They have done very many bad things.
REV.18.5	Their 
REV.18.5	God knows about all the wrong things that they have done.’
REV.18.6	‘Yes, 
REV.18.6	Do to them the same things that they have done to others.
REV.18.6	She caused people to drink many troubles from her cup.
REV.18.6	Now make her drink twice as many troubles for herself!
REV.18.7	She made herself to be great.
REV.18.7	She made herself to be happy with many expensive things.
REV.18.7	So now give her trouble and pain instead of her happiness.
REV.18.7	She said to herself, “I rule people like a queen.
REV.18.7	I do not live like a 
REV.18.7	I will never have trouble. I will never be sad.”
REV.18.8	Because she spoke like that, she will receive many troubles in one single day.
REV.18.8	Her people will become ill.
REV.18.8	They will be sad.
REV.18.8	They will have no food.
REV.18.8	Fire will destroy the city,
REV.18.8	The 
REV.18.8	So he will 
REV.18.9	When all that happens, the kings on the earth will be very sad. They enjoyed the bad things that people did in that city. They had many expensive things so that they were happy. Now they will see the smoke from the fire that burns the city. As a result, they will cry and they will weep. 
REV.18.10	They will stand a long way from the city because they are afraid. They do not want to receive the same troubles themselves. They will say,
REV.18.10	‘Bad trouble has come to you, Babylon!
REV.18.10	Great city! Powerful city! It is very bad for you!
REV.18.10	In one single hour God has destroyed you!’
REV.18.11	The people on the earth who sell things will also be very sad. They will weep because nobody will buy their things any more. 
REV.18.12	They sold many expensive things like these:
REV.18.12	Things made from gold and 
REV.18.12	Valuable stones and 
REV.18.12	Special kinds of cloth which included expensive red cloth and 
REV.18.12	Things made from wood that has a nice smell;
REV.18.12	Many different things that are made from 
REV.18.12	Many kinds of things that people had made from expensive wood, and from different metals and from stone;
REV.18.13	Different kinds of 
REV.18.13	Cows and sheep;
REV.18.13	Horses and their 
REV.18.13	Human slaves.
REV.18.14	The people who sold these things will say to the city, ‘You have now lost all the good things that you wanted so much. You have lost all those expensive things that made you beautiful. You will never have them again.’
REV.18.15	Those people had become rich because of the city. But now they will stand a long way from the city because they are afraid. They do not want to receive the same troubles themselves. They will weep and they will be very sad. 
REV.18.16	They will say,
REV.18.16	‘Bad trouble has come to you, Babylon!
REV.18.16	Great city! It is very bad for you!
REV.18.16	You wore beautiful clothes that were made from expensive cloth.
REV.18.16	You also wore bright things that made you look beautiful.
REV.18.16	You shone with gold, valuable stones and 
REV.18.17	But in one single hour God has destroyed all those valuable things.’
REV.18.17	All the sailors and the people who travel on ships will also be sad. They include every ship's captain, and everyone who works on ships on the sea. They will stand a long way from the city. 
REV.18.18	They will see the smoke from the fire that burns the city. Then they will shout, ‘There is no other city like this great city!’ 
REV.18.19	They will throw dirt from the ground on their heads because they are so sad. They will weep and they will shout,
REV.18.19	‘Bad trouble has come to you, Babylon!
REV.18.19	Great city! It is very bad for you!
REV.18.19	Everyone who had ships on the sea became rich because of you.
REV.18.19	You used your money to buy their expensive things.
REV.18.19	But in one single hour God has destroyed that city.’
REV.18.20	Yes, you who live in 
REV.18.20	Be happy because God has 
REV.18.20	God's people and his 
REV.18.20	God has 
REV.18.21	Then a powerful 
REV.18.21	‘God will throw you down, Babylon!
REV.18.21	You are a great city, but God will throw you down like this stone.
REV.18.21	Nobody will ever see you again!
REV.18.22	Nobody will ever hear music in the city again.
REV.18.22	Nobody will sing there.
REV.18.22	Nobody will make music with 
REV.18.22	There will never be workers who make things in the city.
REV.18.22	Nobody will ever hear the sound of people who make flour again.
REV.18.23	No light from people's 
REV.18.23	Nobody will ever hear the happy voices of a man and a woman when they marry.
REV.18.23	Your people who sold things were the most powerful people on the earth.
REV.18.23	You used your 
REV.18.23	You caused people from all countries to believe wrong things.
REV.18.24	Your people killed God's people and his 
REV.18.24	Their blood is in your streets.
REV.18.24	The blood of everyone on earth that people have killed is also there.
REV.18.24	This shows that you are 
REV.19.1	After these things, I heard a sound like the voices of very many people in 
REV.19.1	‘We 
REV.19.1	He has saved us!
REV.19.1	He is really powerful!
REV.19.1	We say that he is great!
REV.19.2	Everything that he decides is right and fair.
REV.19.2	He has decided to 
REV.19.2	She led people on the earth to do bad things.
REV.19.2	She has led them to 
REV.19.2	It is like she led people to have sex in a wrong way.
REV.19.2	She killed God's servants with her own hands.
REV.19.2	Because of all that, God has now 
REV.19.2	So, we 
REV.19.3	Then the crowd of people in 
REV.19.3	‘We 
REV.19.3	The smoke from the fire that burns that city will go up for ever.’
REV.19.4	The 24 leaders and the 4 
REV.19.5	Then a voice spoke from the 
REV.19.5	‘All of you who are God's servants,
REV.19.5	All of you who 
REV.19.5	You who are important people, and you who are not important, 
REV.19.6	Again I heard a sound like a very big crowd, and they were shouting. The sound was like the noise of many rivers that were moving very fast. It was like the noise of loud 
REV.19.6	‘We 
REV.19.6	He rules with all power and authority!
REV.19.7	Now we are very happy!
REV.19.7	We will say how great God is!
REV.19.7	The time for the 
REV.19.7	His wife that he will marry has prepared herself.
REV.19.8	God has given her bright, clean clothes to wear.’
REV.19.8	These special clothes are a picture of the good things that God's people have done.
REV.19.9	Then the 
REV.19.10	Then I bent down at the 
REV.19.11	I saw that 
REV.19.12	His eyes burned like bright fires. Many 
REV.19.13	He was wearing a long shirt that had much blood on it. His name is: ‘The Word of God’.
REV.19.14	The armies in 
REV.19.15	A sharp 
REV.19.16	The man who rode the white horse had a name that was written on his shirt. It was also written high on his leg. That name is: ‘The King who rules over all other kings. The 
REV.19.17	Then I saw an 
REV.19.18	Eat the meat from dead bodies until you are full! Come and eat the meat of kings, the meat of captains of armies and the meat of powerful men. Eat the meat of dead horses and the meat of those who ride them. You can eat the meat of all kinds of dead people. They may be slaves or free people. They may be great people or people who are not important.’
REV.19.19	Then I saw the wild animal together with the kings of the earth and their armies. They had come together to fight a war. They were going to fight against the man who rode the white horse and his army. 
REV.19.20	But the man and his army caught the wild animal and the false 
REV.19.21	The man who rode the white horse then killed all his other enemies. He killed them with the

REV.20.5	(But all the other dead people did not become alive again until the 1000 years had finished.) This is the first time that God would raise up dead people to become alive again. 
REV.20.6	The people that God raises up to become alive again that first time are very happy people! They are God's own people. The second death has no power over them. Instead, they will be 
REV.20.7	When the 1000 years have passed, God will let 
REV.20.8	 will then go and tell 
REV.20.9	They will go across the whole earth. They will arrive at the place where God's people are living. They will stand all round that place. It is the city that God loves. But fire will come down from 
REV.20.10	The 
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white 
REV.20.12	Then I saw the people who had died. They were standing in front of the great 
REV.20.13	The sea brought up all the dead people who were in it. Death and the dead people's place called Hades brought up all the dead people who were there too. Then God 
REV.20.14	Then God threw Death and Hades into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death for people. 
REV.20.15	God threw into the lake of fire anyone whose name was not written in his book of life.
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new 
REV.21.2	I saw God's own special city. It was coming down out of 
REV.21.3	Then I heard a voice that spoke loudly from the 
REV.21.4	God will take away all the tears from their eyes. Nobody will ever die again. Nobody will be sad again. Nobody will ever cry. Nobody will have pain again. Everything that made people sad has now gone. That old world has completely gone away.’
REV.21.5	God, who was sitting on the 
REV.21.6	He also said to me, ‘Everything is now done! I caused all things to begin and I will cause all things to end. I am the first at the beginning and I am the last at the end. If anyone is 
REV.21.7	Everyone who wins against 
REV.21.8	But I will 
REV.21.8	People who are afraid of trouble;
REV.21.8	People who do not believe in Jesus;
REV.21.8	People who do dirty things;
REV.21.8	People who murder other people;
REV.21.8	People who have sex in a wrong way;
REV.21.8	People who do 
REV.21.8	People who 
REV.21.8	People who tell 
REV.21.8	All these people will go into the lake of fire that burns with 
REV.21.9	Then one of the 7 
REV.21.10	Then God's 
REV.21.11	It was shining with the very bright light that comes from God. The city shone like a very valuable stone that is called jasper. It shone like clean glass. 
REV.21.12	It had a very big, high wall round it. The wall had 12 gates in it. 12 
REV.21.13	There were three gates on each side of the city:
REV.21.13	3 gates were on the east side;
REV.21.13	3 gates were on the north side;
REV.21.13	3 gates were on the south side;
REV.21.13	3 gates were on the west side.
REV.21.14	They had built the city's wall on top of 12 strong stones. They had written the name the 
REV.21.15	The 
REV.21.16	The shape of the city was a square. It was as long as it was wide. The 
REV.21.17	He also measured its wall. The size of the wall was 144 cubits (65 metres). That is the way that human people measure things. The 
REV.21.18	The wall was made from stone that is called jasper. The city was made from the best kind of gold. The light shone through it, as light shines through clean glass. 
REV.21.19	The strong stones that were holding up the city's wall were very beautiful. They had valuable stones in them that were different colours. Each great stone had its own special valuable stone. They were called:
REV.21.19	1. Jasper;
REV.21.19	2. Sapphire;
REV.21.19	3. Agate;
REV.21.19	4. Emerald;
REV.21.20	5. Onyx;
REV.21.20	6. Carnelian;
REV.21.20	7. Quartz;
REV.21.20	8. Beryl;
REV.21.20	9. Topaz;
REV.21.20	10. Chrysoprase;
REV.21.20	11. Jacinth;
REV.21.20	12. Amethyst.
REV.21.21	The 12 gates were 12 
REV.21.22	When I looked, I saw that there was no 
REV.21.23	Also, the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it. The very bright light that comes from God gives light to the city. The 
REV.21.24	People from all the world's countries will live in the city's light. The earth's rulers will bring all their valuable things into the city. 
REV.21.25	Nobody will ever shut the city's gates at the end of the day. It will always be day and there will be no night there. 
REV.21.26	People from all the world's countries will bring their beautiful and valuable things into the city. 
REV.21.27	But nothing that is bad or dirty can ever go in there. Nobody who does anything that God 
REV.22.1	Then the 
REV.22.2	It ran along the middle of the city's biggest street. I saw a tree that was growing on each side of the river. It is the tree that causes people to have true life. It has 12 different kinds of fruit. It has new fruit every month. The tree's leaves are like medicine. They make people of every country well again.
REV.22.3	There will be nothing there that God will speak against. God's 
REV.22.4	They will see his face. His name will be on the front of their heads. 
REV.22.5	There will be no more night, so nobody will need a 
REV.22.6	Then the 
REV.22.7	Jesus says, ‘Listen! I will come quickly. Every person who obeys my message will be happy! That message from God is what this book describes.’
REV.22.8	I am John. I myself heard these things and I saw them. When I had heard them and I had seen them, I fell down at the 
REV.22.9	But he said to me, ‘You must not do that! I am only a servant of God, the same as you are. I am a servant, like all God's 
REV.22.10	Then he told me, ‘Do not hide the words of God's message that are in this book. The time is near when these things will happen. 
REV.22.11	Let everybody continue to live as they choose. Everyone who does wrong things will continue to do wrong things. Everyone who is bad and dirty will continue to be bad and dirty. Everyone who does right things will continue to do right things. Everyone who belongs to God's will continue to do what God wants.’ 
REV.22.12	Jesus says, ‘Listen! I will come quickly! I know what each person has done. I will give each one what they ought to have. I am ready to do that. 
REV.22.13	I am first and I am last. I cause all things to begin and I cause the end of all things. I am the first at the beginning and I am the last at the end.
REV.22.15	But other people must stay outside the city:
REV.22.15	People who like to do what is bad;
REV.22.15	People who do 
REV.22.15	People who have sex in a wrong way;
REV.22.15	People who murder other people;
REV.22.15	People who 
REV.22.15	Everyone who tells 
REV.22.16	I am Jesus. I have sent my

REV.22.18	Now John says this. I say clearly to everyone who hears God's message that is written in this book: If anyone puts more words than are already in this book, God will 
REV.22.19	And if anyone takes away from the words that are in this book, God will 
REV.22.20	It is Jesus who tells us that all these messages are true. He says, ‘Yes, I will come quickly!’
REV.22.21	I pray that the
